Environmental friendly EME (semiconductor encapsulation materials)
12.4 Reduce the release of chemicals
SUMIKON EME*1 is a material that encapsulates semiconductors and electrical components for the purposes of providing protection, moisture resistance and insulation for them. Encapsulation materials must offer excellent flame retardance, and conventionally chemical substances that are harmful to the environment and health have been used for this, such as bromine and antimony. Therefore, our Company brought our own compounding techniques to bear to develop an environmental friendly EME that achieves equivalent or greater flame retardant properties without the use of any bromine or antimony flame retardants. We will continue to contribute to reducing the release of harmful chemical substances by expanding and deploying environmentally-friendly EME in the future as well.

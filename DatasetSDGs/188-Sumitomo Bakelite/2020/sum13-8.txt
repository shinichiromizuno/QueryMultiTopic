  Our Group has established a Responsible Care Committee
chaired by the director overseeing company-wide safety.
This committee determines health and safety activity policies
■ 2015 ■ 2016 ■ 2017 ■ 2018 ■ 2019
along with important measures for preventing disasters
and accidents, and based on these, rolls out health and
safety activities across the entire company. What is more, in

three1Safe1ty Ac2tion Guidelines. These have been translated
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
into eight languages and deployed throughout the entire
company to promote the complete elimination of serious disasters and major accidents.
Each of our business sites makes efforts closely in tune with the needs of individual workplaces within a company-wide framework and under an accountability structure involving the managers of business sites. At its monthly meetings, the Health and Safety Committee inspects health and safety management activities, ensures thorough compliance with relevant laws and ordinances, and considers capital investments to realize risk reduction, among other actions.
In 2009, our Group’s plants and main subsidiaries in Japan began pursuing OHSAS18001 accreditation, followed by our Group’s overseas subsidiaries from 2010. Today, a total of 23 business sites have received accreditation, including five business sites and three subsidiaries in Japan and 15 subsidiaries overseas. In addition, we are making steady progress on transitioning over to ISO 45001 as a result of the repeal of OHSAS 18001 scheduled for 2021.
Machinery and Equipment Risk Reduction Activities
All new machinery and equipment installed at domestic production plants and subsidiaries from 2008 and at overseas subsidiaries from 2009, have been designed in compliance with ISO12100. We carry out risk assessments of existing facilities when changes occur, such as when the facilities are restructured or work procedures change, in an effort to make machinery and equipment fundamentally safer.

In 2012, we introduced chemical substance risk assessments at plants in Japan and subsidiaries worldwide. We verify our evaluation results when changes occur, such as information on the risks and hazards posed by chemical substances and changes to work procedures. This is done in aiming to prevent adverse health effects to employees through exposure to chemical substances, and to prevent explosion or fire incidents caused by chemical substances.

  Our business sites in Japan along with subsidiaries worldwide comply with laws and ordinances and address prevention needs in order to preserve the environment. In fiscal 2019, we received five complaints concerning the environment (two
from Japan and three from overseas). Three of these involved instructions to improve our environmental impact, one was a noise complaint, and one was a complaint concerning odors. Each of these were addressed in the appropriate manner.

Health and Safety Education
We carry out measures to reduce the risks posed by machinery and chemical substances in order to ensure safety on sites where these are used. At the same time, we conduct hazard prediction training as well as initiatives, such as “pointing and calling” and making proposals for reducing near-miss accidents. We have introduced “Safety Gyms” at each production plant to allow employees to learn about the fundamentals of safety. They are able to improve their safety consciousness and learn hazard prediction skills and risk identification skills.
Furthermore, we also conduct safety education at every level. This includes holding safety meetings in which all plant managers participate to share initiatives involving safety activities in which they take a lead and act as role models, specialized safety education for managers, basic correspondence education on safety for mid-level employees, and hands-on safety education for new employees. In addition,

we make efforts to disclose disaster and accident information, and to share information in a timely manner through the use of our Safety Portal Site, which was set up online so that it was accessible by every employee. The Safety Philosophy and Safety Action Guidelines that were enacted in October 2019 have also been translated into eight languages, and education is being carried out at every business site.

Trends in Occupational Accidents at Sumitomo Bakelite and Subsidiaries
Number of Employees Injured as a Result of Occupational Accidents
The graph on right shows the number of employees injured as a result of occupational accidents at our company as well as subsidiaries in Japan. In 2019 there was a slight increase in both occupational accidents resulting in lost workdays and occupational accidents not resulting in lost workdays, and the total number of employees injured rose for the second straight year.
Occupational Accidents by Type
Occupational accidents in Japan categorized by type are shown in the graph on the right.
In 2019 pinching and entanglement accidents increased. Other than this, no prominent trends were observed with regard to the type of accidents, but the majority was made up of accidents caused by unsafe actions taken by workers. By notifying all employees of our Safety Action Guidelines and utilizing our Safety Portal Site, we will continue with initiatives to enhance the safety awareness of workers.

 We have inherited Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy, passed down by the Sumitomo family, which has supported the Sumitomo Group for four centuries. The origins of this philosophy are found in the Monjuin Shiigaki (the Founder’s Precepts), a document written by Sumitomo family founder Masatomo Sumitomo. Approximately 400 years ago, Sumitomo (Monjuin) wrote to his family about business wisdom, urging at the beginning, “Strive with all your heart, not only in business, but in all situations.”
The rigorous efforts and honesty demanded by the Monjuin Shiigaki as well as other personal characterbuilding precepts continue to form the foundation of the Sumitomo Group’s Business Philosophy and make up the basis of our fundamental policy.

  Message from the President
Expanding the Potential of Plastics to Become
“A Company That Makes Your Dreams for
the Future a Reality” Introduction
I would like to express my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by COVID-19, and to everyone impacted by the pandemic this year.
It has been more than 100 years since the beginning of plastics production in Japan. In that time, many different types of plastic products have been invented or developed, and they continue to develop and advance as an essential material across a wide variety of uses, including everyday items, transport equipment, medical equipment, semiconductors and the aerospace industry.
As a pioneer in plastics, we have pursued the potential of plastics amid rapid social changes, expanding our business on a global scale. We consider it our mission to create plastics with more advanced functionality, and focus on the concept of “Customer Satisfaction (CS) First” to contribute to social development and the standard of living through building customer value.

 President and Representative Director
 Results for fiscal 2019
As for the business environment surrounding our Company, in the field of semiconductors, 2019 saw the most deeply negative rate of market growth since the collapse of the dotcom bubble. However, the second half saw rising demand from the development of 5G, with a substantial recovery led by the Chinese market. In the automobile field, new car sales underperformed the previous fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the United States, Europe and Japan, among other factors.
Revenue in fiscal 2019 dropped 6,332 million yen, or 3.0%, year on year to 206,620 million yen due to the combined impact of recessionary conditions in the manufacturing industry overall from the start of the year, the strong yen and weak dollar and weak euro, and the COVID-19 pandemic which began to affect the market in February 2020. With regard to profit or loss, due to struggling in sales of high-performance
plastic products, primarily those for automobiles, rising raw material prices for semiconductor materials and increasing restructuring costs related to a deteriorating sales environment for aircraft parts led to a 17.0% year-on-year decline in business profit to 14,346 million yen. Operating profit dropped 24.3% year on year to 10,285 million yen. Profit attributable to owners of parent fell 40.4% year on year to 8,986 million yen.
Mid-term Business Targets
The Mid-term Business Targets set last year have become very difficult to achieve due to the changes in the business environment wrought by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are currently reviewing them, but we continue to use revenue, busines profit and return on equity (ROE) as indicators for our performance goals. We have retained the vision set out in 2018 of “a company that makes your dreams for the future a reality” as we strive to achieve future expansion and sustainable

 Message from the President
growth of the business.
We are continuing with our basic policy of “Aiming to achieve the ‘top shares in niche markets’ in the functional chemical sector as well as expanding our business by implementing ‘One Sumibe’ (the Japanese abbreviation of ‘One Sumitomo Bakelite’) activities in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” We are a company engaged in the business of functional chemical products. We are not a manufacturer that supplies plastics for mass consumption, such as polyethylene or polypropylene; rather, it is our job to provide optimal functions through new technologies for each and every plastic application. That is why large markets may not necessarily be the place that we should compete in. Instead, we believe it is ideal for us to securely capture the top share worldwide in niche markets with growth potential. That is the “top share in niche markets” vision that we aim to achieve, and we have incorporated the SDGs into our new Mid-term Business Targets as our approach for realizing this vision. The SDGs, which aim for sustainable growth on a global scale, are the ultimate potential needs required by society, and align with our Business Philosophy (Company Policy)—“Our company places prime importance on trust and sureness, and shall commit itself to contributing to the progress of society and enhancement of people's welfare and livelihood through its business activities.” Of the 17 goals of SDGs, we have identified the goals on which we should focus our efforts.*1 We will put companywide effort into promoting activities, including the development of new products while keeping these goals of SDGs in mind. As a quantitative target, we are aiming for revenue ratio of 30% for our SDG-contributing products in fiscal 2021. Another key aspect is our “CS first” philosophy. We are engaged in companywide “One Sumibe” activities globally, without being constrained by organizational boundaries. “One Sumibe” are activities that provide customers with values that cut across the entire company, with all our business divisions. This makes it possible for us and customers to develop new materials and roll out technological innovation at pace, as one-stop solutions. We are continuing to advance initiatives in the following basic strategies finalized last year: (1) develop new products with competitive advantage, aiming at their prompt contribution; (2) increase profitability of existing products, expanding their field
(applications and geographical areas); (3) proactive strategic investment in growth areas (M&A, etc.).

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business and response
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we unfortunately had to suspend production in some plants overseas. Some staff have fallen ill. Risks remain around the impact on supply chains due to suppliers or distribution failing and border closures. In order to minimize disruption to business activity, in February 2020 we established an internal COVID-19 Emergency Taskforce and we are steadily implementing a possible Business Continuity Plan (BCP).
To stop the virus infecting employees, we have preventative measures in place across all workplaces and are proactively applying work-from-home and staggered working hours. Regarding supply chains, we secured multiple sources for raw materials procurement, duplicated our production in plants worldwide, and ensured that we had the appropriate stocks of raw materials and products in our inventories. These longstanding measures worked and there was no major negative impact on supply chains. We also gathered information as quickly as possible on supply chains and the situation and shared it instantly with customers. At the same time, we kept updated with the operational status of our customers, reacting to ensure that the supply chains did not break down.
At the same time, we are progressing initiatives to respond to needs brought about by the market changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Quality of Life Products segment, harnessing the plastics processing technologies we have developed to date, we launched production of anti- droplet face shields and protective panels to respond to the spike in infection prevention awareness. We also expect demand to rise for bio-related products for supporting drug discovery and drug packaging materials as hopes rise for new drug development. There is also expected to be increased

demand for long-life food products as a result of stay-at-home advisories. In semiconductor materials, the rise in working from home should accelerate demand for advanced materials for IT services such as 5G. Going forward, the way people live and work—and every area of economic activity—is expected to change too. We will harness the technologies and strengths we have fostered so far to meet market needs.
ESG initiatives
The Sustainability Promotion Committee established in 2019 is the focus of the activities involving all departments and employees on the three axes of environment (E), social (S) and governance (G).
As a manufacturer of functional chemical products, we do not believe the environment can be separated from any aspect of our business activities. We have longstanding initiatives to reduce our CO2 emissions and material loss in our production and sales activities, but we are developing new technologies to ensure that we can supply finished products to customers that are even more environmentally-friendly. The best examples of this would be our support to the automotive industry in swapping metal parts for lightweight plastic to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles, and our efforts to help reduce the volume of waste by developing environmentally- friendly packaging. Elsewhere, our “Freshness-preserving film (MAP)”*2 for fruit and vegetables is proving tremendously helpful in reducing food loss. We intend to vigorously pursue development of products to help the environment, driven by “Responsible Consumption and Production” as one of our Priority SDGs.
On social aspects, our independently developed SBPS (Sumitomo Bakelite Production System) is in place to achieve better manufacturing. As we undertake reforms to improve quality, innovate production and shorten lead times, it has also led to the elimination of quality complaints, reduced energy and resource consumption. More recently, we have applied AI and the IoT to our promotion of production technology digitalization, including advance detection of irregularities and automated controls of facilities.
Meanwhile, occupational health and safety is certainly core to our business activities and we have a cross-cutting initiative to ensure that our workplaces are safe and healthy for all employees. Undoubtedly, the smooth transition to working from home to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among employees was made possible by the success of the work style reform carried out earlier. For all employees around the world, we will continue to pursue better working conditions adapted to social and economic change, as well as training to boost our “human ability.”
From the perspective of governance, our Business Philosophy (Company Policy), a legacy of Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy that has over 400 years of history, is: “Our company places prime importance on trust and sureness, and shall commit itself to contributing to the progress of society and enhancement of people's welfare and livelihood through its business activities.” This is the basis of our
Group Standards of Conduct and Code of Conduct, and we are strengthening compliance in our operations. We must never lose the trust and confidence of our customers and the market because quality and compliance were neglected in favor of short-term profits and focus. Through e-learning, SB School and the in-house newsletter, we will strive to ensure that all employees are more aware than ever of the need for compliance. Furthermore, of the 14 directors and auditors on our Board of Directors, four are independent outside officers. We are working towards increased board effectiveness by ensuring more robust discussion and greater transparency.

To stakeholders
When I assumed office as the President in 2018, I declared that our vision is to expand the potential of plastics and create value for customers (stakeholders) to become “a company that makes your dreams for the future a reality.” This vision is born out in the innovation created by our competitive advantage, the fundamental technologies that we have built up over many years—in other words, the material technologies for resin formulation and design as well as monomer/polymer synthesis, process design technologies, and evaluation technologies. Further, as part of the chemical industry, it is vital that we fulfill our social responsibility and we will continue to support and implement our Responsible Care Global Charter. It is through these initiatives, striking the balance between creating business opportunities and resolving social issues, that we will make a contribution to our stakeholders. Thank you for your continued support.

Interview with the President
Addressing the SDGs and
Creating Value as a “Pioneer in Plastics”
Through its businesses that are expanding globally, the Company works to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by working together with a variety of stakeholders.
We invited Misako Konno, who serves as the Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and has been active in environmental protection and reducing poverty around the world, for a discussion on the theme of the Company's efforts for the SDGs and its creation of value.

Misako Konno
Developing a variety of products as a “Pioneer in Plastics”
Konno: As a “pioneer in plastics,” your Company conducts business in a variety of different areas. I know of your Company from “freshness-preserving film (MAP),” which is used to preserve vegetables, but what other sorts of businesses are you engaged in?
Fujiwara: Phenolic resin is the oldest plastic, which was developed in 1907. We took on the mantle of being a “pioneer in plastics” because we originated from the first company to industrialize this phenolic resin in Japan. We currently promote our businesses in three segments: Semiconductor materials, high- performance plastics, and quality of life products. “Freshness- preserving film (MAP)” is one of our quality of life products. We are a so-called materials manufacturer, and so most of our products are delivered in the form of materials to clients who then make the end products or the parts for these. As such, our
products are almost entirely invisible to ordinary consumers. Konno: I see. So for example, in what sorts of places are your Company’s materials used?
Fujiwara: Semiconductors are used in computers and smartphones, and we also make the encapsulation materials used to cover and protect semiconductor chips. With cars, our high-performance plastic products are found everywhere from the tires to the brakes, and they have come to be used in important components within the motors of the electric vehicles that have recently begun to be produced in greater quantities. In addition, they are used across a broad spectrum such as in airplanes, shale gas extraction equipment, medical devices, packaging materials for pharmaceuticals or food, construction-related uses, and more.
Konno: That truly is a wide range, with a surprising amount of diversity. What are some of the features and characteristics unique to your Company’s when it comes to these products? Fujiwara: The trend with semiconductor materials and high- performance plastics is weight saving. This also leads to making them more environmentally friendly. Of course, this also cuts down on waste. For example, if you think about this in terms of automobile parts, this makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions because the lighter the weight, the better the fuel efficiency. As such, one of the Mid-term Business Targets we have been working towards since FY2019 is: “Aiming to achieve the ‘top share in niche markets’ in the functional chemical sector as well as expanding our business by implementing ‘One Sumibe’ activities in line with the SDGs.” It would be safe to say that one of our characteristics is that we have numerous products that contribute to the SDGs. We are currently putting our efforts into research and development, and are aiming to launch new products that incorporate the SDG-perspective as soon as possible.
Konno: Adopting a strong awareness when it comes to contributing to the SDGs in the products near and dear to us in our everyday lives would be a welcome development. But at the same time I feel that we as consumers need to be aware of the SDGs and environmental issues when making purchases. As consumers we tend to focus on price over all else. Instead of this, we need to make purchases by considering what sorts of environmental considerations are being shown by the companies making the products. We need to be smart consumers in this regard.
Fujiwara: Making products that meet the demands of customers is the top priority, and so I am strongly encouraged by such comments. In addition, the greatest risk we face in 2020 comes from the coronavirus pandemic. We considered whether there was anything we could do to be helpful to society here at our Company, and as a result we decided to manufacture the medical face shields for which there had been severe shortages. We have been manufacturing helmets and polycarbonate sheets from the outset, so by combining these together we were able to get to the point of achieving a mass- production system for these in about one month from the start of development.
Konno: I've seen the actual goods, and they seem to be light, highly transparent, and very easy to use. Have you been

delivering these directly to medical settings?
Fujiwara: Recently, we wanted to find a way to quickly deliver them to those places that were hard-hit, so we donated them to the administrative agencies of local municipalities where our plants are located and so forth. Since we were able to bring our technology and knowledge in manufacturing medical devices to bear here, we are confident in their quality.
Structure for promoting initiatives for the SDGs globally
Konno: There has recently been an increase in the number of companies that are enthusiastically promoting the SDGs. But chief among these is your Company, as you have already incorporated this into your business targets, which I feel puts you far ahead of the curve in this respect.
Fujiwara: The SDGs are not a new concept, and we consider them to be consonant with our Business Philosophy (Company Policy) that we had previously set forth. Within this Business Philosophy we declare that: “Our company places prime importance on trust and sureness, and shall commit itself to contributing to the progress of society and enhancement of people's welfare and livelihood through its business activities.” The roots of this ideology have been passed down from the “Sumitomo Business Philosophy” from 400 years ago. We have consistently held to our corporate mission to contribute to society through our business activities since way back. Konno: If you regard the SDGs as being consonant with your Business Philosophy, then they would surely be readily
accepted by all of your employees. Incidentally, for the SDGs, 17 goals and 169 targets have been established, with specific matters having been incorporated into them. This would surely give rise to some difficult areas if you were to go about promoting this in a concerted manner across the company as a whole, would it not?
Fujiwara: First of all, I think it is important to have the top managers act by leading the way. To have the entire company come together to promote the SDGs, we launched the SDG Promotion and Preparation Project Team in 2018. Furthermore, in 2019 we established the Sustainability Promotion Committee to serve as a parent body for carrying out our sustainability activities in an ongoing, company-wide manner, with this including the SDGs. As the president, I serve as the leader for this committee. The fact that everyone from top management down to the worksites must join forces and work together is something that should be clearly indicated in an organizational sense as well. Under this Sustainability Promotion Committee, we are undertaking initiatives such as promoting the SDGs, taking measures to combat climate change, and reducing waste. What is more, of the 17 goals in the SDGs, we have selected five that are deeply connected to our businesses, as well as one that we ought to emphasize as a company dealing in plastics, and have been working to address these by setting them as priority targets.
Konno: Do these initiatives cover your business sites and plants around the world?
Fujiwara: Yes, these are being deployed globally. This is because the SDGs are similar to climate change and other
environmental problems in that all of these are challenges at the global-level. We will also continue to promote the globalization of our businesses in the future. Initially, we had expanded out into overseas markets in a manner consistent with the deployment of businesses by our customers, but having this global manufacturing structure has served as one of our strengths now more than ever before. When we shut down some of our plants due to the coronavirus pandemic, we were able to get by without stopping the supply of products by manufacturing these

at plants located in other regions instead. The same holds true when it comes to the procurement of raw materials. The fact that we set in place structures from a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) perspective to ensure that we could procure raw materials from different regions is bearing fruit in the present.
Improving “human ability” and working to create additional value
Konno: We've talked about products and structures, but I feel that in conjunction with these, it is also extremely important to educate the people who use the products as well as the people who make them. The UNDP, where I have been serving as Goodwill Ambassador, has been focusing its efforts on human development.
Fujiwara: You're exactly right. In the message I delivered to our employees at the start of the year I designated “human ability“ as the keyword for 2020. “Human ability“ is the cumulative effect obtained from multiplying motivation, capability, personality, and character together. I want to raise the “human ability“ of every one of our employees, and make them feel glad to work at Sumitomo Bakelite. Therefore, we are promoting human resource development with our SB School and Sumitomo Bakelite Production System (SBPS) serving as central pillars for this.
Konno: What can you tell us about your employees’ work styles? In the SDGs, “No. 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth“ and “No. 5. Gender Equality“ relate to this. Fujiwara: Working from home became widespread all at once in order to prevent the spread of infections from the coronavirus. This was an abrupt change the likes of which had never been seen before. Even from before that we declared a state of emergency at our Company, we had set up an emergency response headquarters and took a number of different measures, in addition to which many of our employees started working from home or working staggered work hours. At first we were anxious that we would fall behind in terms of work, but that never came to pass. Of course, some people are better suited to it than others based on their individual characters, capabilities, and the work they oversee, but I suppose that’s about all you can say given the circumstances. Our employees lent us their cooperation

in order to keep them safe. While this was an emergency situation, I'm sure that working from home will persist as one style of work even after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Konno: This will certainly spur significant changes to work styles. Seeing as how each employee is sure to have their own respective circumstances, it would be great to create a structure whereby they can choose from among various different work styles.
My take-away from this conversation is that there is still a great deal of potential in plastics. Since you're putting your efforts into research and development, I'm sure you'll create products that lead to resolving a great many problems, which I look forward to seeing. Conversely, due to problems such as those of ocean plastics, plastics have been gaining attention in various different senses. While ocean plastics is a problem that you probably have little in the way of a direct connection with as a materials manufacturer, my hope is that your Company can come up with some sort of groundbreaking solution that only you can provide as a company that is unlocking the potential of plastics. So I would urge you to actively give thought going forward to the question of how you can bring your wealth of knowledge and your track record to bear on solving the challenges facing society. Fujiwara: As a company whose businesses have a global reach, we must not only create economic value in terms of sales and profits and the like, but we must also contribute to achieving a sustainable society through our business activities. We will continue working to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, create still-greater value, and contribute to a sustainable society.

Sumitomo Bakelite is promoting the SDGs to create a future in harmony with plastics
Our Company launched the SDG Promotion and Preparation Project Team in 2018 and the Sustainability Promotion Committee in 2019, thus setting in place a structure for addressing the SDGs in a full-fledged manner.
Director and Senior Managing Executive Officer Inagaki, who leads our SDG promotion efforts to ensure to promote even more effective initiatives in the future, as well as other members of our SDG Promotion Committee, sat down for a discussion with Professor Norichika Kanie of Keio University, one of the foremost figures in research on the SDGs.
  Achieving harmony with plastics to create a sustainable future
Inagaki: At our Company, we have incorporated the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our mid-term business targets that started in fiscal 2019. The targets set forth by the SDGs represent the ideal vision for the world we must strive for, and serve as guideposts for where people all around the world will end up, so to speak. In contemporary societies undergoing intense changes that feature a great many elements of uncertainty, it is extremely difficult to predict what sorts of products will be well-received by society at large. So I
consider the SDGs as one authority we can rely on for this. Kanie: I feel that this is a particularly effective way of thinking for companies that conduct business globally. Actually, movements are arising in which developing countries are re-calibrating their development plans for the nation as a whole so as to be consistent with the SDGs. So dealing in products that are consistent with the SDGs will surely make it easier to enter these sorts of markets. In addition, the material of plastic is an extremely important one from the perspective of the SDGs. Plastics is an issue that inevitably comes up with regard to Goals 13 and 14 of the SDGs, and in terms of its impact on climate change. So I

 am heavily focusing on the initiatives taken for the SDGs by companies that deal in plastics.
Inagaki: In the recent trend towards eliminating plastics, we have seen some views to the effect that plastic is bad, but this is just not the case. As you can see by looking at the measures taken to prevent infections by the coronavirus, which has come to be the greatest hardship faced worldwide in 2020, plastics play an essential role in contemporary society. Therefore, as a manufacturer of plastics we must give thought to modalities for how plastics can achieve harmony with the global environment. For example, plastic films that can offer the same functionality as conventional plastics at half their thickness. These will make it possible to reduce the amount of waste generated by half. Or plastics that do not place a burden on the environment when they are disposed of, such as plastics derived from inedible biomass and biodegradable plastics. We are already considering a number of techniques and directions to head in, such as increasing plastics with a structure that makes them easy to recycle.
Kanie: We will continue to perceive the challenges head- on and discover solutions in order to make greater use of the positive aspects of plastics. This in itself is the very philosophy of the SDGs. The SDGs consist of 17 goals, and if you were to try to achieve all of these at the same time it wouldn't go well at all due to conflicts that would arise between them. But then if you give some thought to why this didn't go well, it would serve to clarify what barriers are hindering you. By removing these barriers, we will continue to get closer to a more sustainable society. The expectation is that this process will contain signs for major innovations.
The world has begun to change as we aim to achieve the SDGs
Inagaki: Roughly five years have passed since the SDGs were adopted at a UN summit in September 2015. I look at this
five-year period as basically having been a preparatory phase, so to speak. The next five years starting from 2020 will be the phase in which to assess the actual activities. Then the last stretch from 2025 to 2030 will be the phase for finally arriving at the goals. Our Company has launched a Sustainability Promotion Committee and set in place a structure for continuing to promote concrete activities. But I wonder what the situation is like at other companies all over the world. Kanie: When you look at this by region, you see that Europe is quite far ahead of the curve. The United States and developing countries both have some individual companies that have made significant progress with this, but I feel that they are lagging behind on the whole. In Japan's case, there is an incredibly high level of recognition when it comes to the SDGs. This is particularly high among listed companies, and recently they have become well-known among general consumers and students as well. However, on the question of what sorts of concrete actions are actually being taken in order to achieve the SDGs, Europe is still a step ahead of Japan in this regard.
Oki: Every day we wrack our brains trying to think of what we should actually do in order to achieve this. While goals have been set for the SDGs, nothing has been decided in terms of how we should proceed in order to achieve them. There are some items that are clearly aimed at national and regional governments, which we feel would be difficult to work into our corporate activities. Particularly since we are a material manufacturer, when we consider the connection between our products and society we must look at the whole picture by linking together our customer companies and supply chains. These present difficulties that we cannot successfully complete just on our own, but which we are slowly but surely making progress on.
Aiba: I feel that awareness and judgment criteria have been changing among the automotive and food companies and so forth that are our customers. At times like when we introduce our newly developed product to them, it's

becoming increasingly commonplace for them to confirm matters like whether we are able to reduce its CO2 emissions versus past products when it is produced, or whether it does not contain any chemical substances that would place a heavy burden on the environment.
Kanie: How did you go about producing this single product? How should one go about disposing of it? Or how should it be returned back to the global environment? It’s like you’re presenting products to consumers by including its story right on through to the very end. The perspective through which products are viewed has been changing from how it was before. I feel that this perspective is the one thing that is most worthy of being changed as we go about addressing the SDGs.
Addressing the 5+1 priority areas as we set our sights on the 17 goals
Inagaki: The SDGs contain 17 goals. At our Company, we
analyzed our strengths, position, and market demands based on our business areas and decided that the areas we were going to address in a prioritized manner were Goals 3, 7, 8, 9, and 12. Things like products for the medical field and food packaging are related to Goals 3 and 9, while products related to issues like environmental friendliness with automobiles contribute to Goal 7. Goals 8 and 12 are important for us as a manufacturing company, and also as a company where a great many employees work. As for Goal 14, we defined this as a priority area since it includes the problems of marine plastics and microplastics.
Kanie: When your priorities are clear, it makes it easier to address them. Most people would probably get confused if they were suddenly told to address 17 goals at once. I believe that as you actually go about addressing these you will come to find that other areas besides the 5+1 priority areas are also in fact closely interconnected with these. But I feel that it's better to start from those ones that are easy for you to comprehend and easy to act on. While you are addressing energy this will lead you to get involved in water issues, and improving approaches to work will bring you into contact with gender issues, which ultimately should lead to you contributing to all 17 of the goals. Inagaki: Our Priority SDGs "5 + 1 goals" are the message from management. At our Company, we have established highly integrated devices, automobiles and aircraft, and healthcare as our three creation areas. We have declared our intention both internally and externally as being to carry on devoting managerial resources to the areas where our three creation areas overlap with our Priority SDGs "5 + 1 goals". Oki: When it comes to research and development in line with our creation areas and SDG priority areas, since 2018 we have been addressing this by soliciting ideas from our

  employees. Employees can offer suggestions regardless of their affiliation, and if the substance of their proposal is good we will either turn them into projects, or expand them out to joint research with outside research institutions and the like. To begin with, we selected 25 projects and moved forward with examining them over the past year. Now, we have narrowed these down to eight projects for which research and development have actually gotten underway. In addition, we are carrying out a system in which we certify products that contribute to the SDGs as "SDG-contributing products."*1 Kanie: This is excellent. It seems like it would certainly boost the motivation of your employees. Creating and utilizing structures for promoting activities is something that must be done if you are going to tackle the SDGs in a serious manner.
Aiba: Boosting employee motivation is of course important, but even before that I feel like working to improve understanding of the SDGs and thoroughly informing our employees of them are important challenges for us. As you stated before, Professor Kanie, you mentioned that recognition of the SDGs is high in Japan. But through my activities on the SDG Promotion Committee I came away with the feeling that there is a significant age-gap here, and that it differs between individuals. In order to engage in one's daily work duties in line with the SDGs, it is crucial that each and every employee have an accurate understanding of them, regardless of their specific section or position. Thus far we have entrenched the SDGs internally by using our internal newsletter and e-learning, and we intend to continue to institute a variety of measures and soundly align the vectors of all of our employees.
Kanie: I would like to see everyone not just entrench the SDGs internally within their companies, but also take on the challenge of raising the bar across their supply chains as a whole. I feel that your Company is a company that has the power to do so.
*1 See P.18 for details on the process for certifying SDG-contributing products.
The sense that global challenges are near at hand, and the rising importance of promoting the SDGs
Inagaki: What sort of impact will the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic have on promoting the SDGs? As the situation has not yet been resolved at this point in time, the answer to this question is not yet apparent. But my fear is that this could potentially change the order of priority of the challenges we ought to be resolving.
Aiba: I feel like right now we are seeing one of those changes that can fundamentally alter people's sense of values. I think that perhaps the importance of the SDGs will conversely rise amidst such changes, but what are your thoughts on this?
Kanie: The coronavirus pandemic clearly threw into relief just how unsustainable our world up until now had been. Yet at the same time, I think that it has been an opportunity

to get a visceral sense of the fact that global challenges can occur close to home for us. If each and every one of us acts with great care, it can lead to preventing pandemics. The same holds true for climate change and issues of human rights. I feel that what we have learned through this experience will have a significant impact on promoting the SDGs in the future.
Oki: The SDGs are targets for people all around the world, and also represent targets for our Company at the same time. This has reaffirmed for me that these are individual targets for us as well. Turning our attention to the individual level while keeping our sights set on the global level, and soundly grasping and expanding upon the opinions and ideas of our employees, will lead to growth for our Company. We intend to continue to promote research and development from this perspective moving forward.
Kanie: It is certainly my hope that everyone will take a positive approach, and that we will be able to give rise to innovations that pave the way to the future by making use of the flexible way of thinking young people have.
Inagaki: It's a question of what we do to create a future even further beyond 2030, which is the target year for the SDGs. The theme of sustainable development must transform into something that can continue indefinitely. I feel that what we ought to be doing right now is developing targets for the future. Society is undergoing intense changes, and we have no idea if the conceptual blueprint for the future which we envision will be accurate or not. But I believe that creating ideals and passing these down to the next generation will lead to sustainable development. Thank you very much for the opportunity to have this valuable discussion today.

  Environmental friendly EME (semiconductor encapsulation materials)
12.4 Reduce the release of chemicals
SUMIKON EME*1 is a material that encapsulates semiconductors and electrical components for the purposes of providing protection, moisture resistance and insulation for them. Encapsulation materials must offer excellent flame retardance, and conventionally chemical substances that are harmful to the environment and health have been used for this, such as bromine and antimony. Therefore, our Company brought our own compounding techniques to bear to develop an environmental friendly EME that achieves equivalent or greater flame retardant properties without the use of any bromine or antimony flame retardants. We will continue to contribute to reducing the release of harmful chemical substances by expanding and deploying environmentally-friendly EME in the future as well.

9.4 Environmentally sound technologies
Bromine/antimony content: 0%
           Improving battery performance and achieving lighter-weight vehicle bodies are essential when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles. Switching the metal parts used in the brakes and engines of automobiles to phenolic molding compounds and molded parts makes it possible to reduce the weight of the vehicle bodies. Our Company's phenolic molding compounds and molded parts are made using our proprietary technologies for developing and processing materials that capitalize on the unique qualities of phenolic resin, which is a thermoset resin. With these, we have been able to boost the performance of parts, particularly those placed under thermal load and those for which dimensional accuracy is required.
Cover tape for electrical components
12.5 Substantially reduce waste
This is a tape used to carry semiconductor packages and electrical components to the surface mount process. Through innovations in the tape's design and production processes, we were able to substantially reduce the electricity and solvents used during its production. In addition, making the tape itself as thin as possible contributes to cutting down on waste.

Polycarbonate polarizing plate for eyewear
11.2 Safe transport systems
This is a material that is primarily used in sunglasses. Cutting down on the brightness and glare in one’s field of vision reduces eye and nerve fatigue and stress. When they are used by drivers during long distance transportation runs, they contribute to improving transportation safety by reducing the physical burden and also making it easier for them to notice signs and other such objects.
Steering microcatheter
8.1 Sustain per capita economic growth
This is used in catheterization (a minimally invasive treatment) to treat hepatocyte cancer. Since the tip moves freely without any guide wires, it can quickly and reliably arrive at the affected blood vessel. As a result, this enables more precise surgeries to be conducted in a shorter time span compared with cases where traditional catheters are used.
There is little in the way of physical burden on the patient, and since patients can be rehabilitated and rejoin society quicker than they could if they had undergone surgical procedures involving an incision to the abdomen, this contributes to the economic underpinnings that serve as a basis for economic growth.

9.4 Achieve increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean

12.3 Halve per capita food waste and reduce food losses along supply chains
    Our freshness-preserving film (MAP) helps to improve distribution and product appeal by retaining the freshness of fruits and vegetables for an extended period of time, and delaying degradation. This is achieved by keeping the product in a state of “hibernation” (a state of equilibrium with reduced breathing).
This means that the distribution of products can be switched from styrene foam containers to cardboard boxes, contributing to the resolution of problems with waste due to lighter and more compact packaging. This can also reduce food loss with the extended period of quality maintenance thanks to functional improvements in packaging with freshness preserving film, contributing to the reduction of environmental burdens in terms of the lifecycle of fruits and vegetables. Freshness-preserving film (MAP) is not only used in areas across Japan to transport their distinctive fruits and vegetables, in recent years it has been adopted for overseas exports and distribution between foreign countries. It is also used for packaging cut vegetables, and you can buy zipper bags for use at home.

 Message from the Director Overseeing Finance and Accounting
We are instituting
"investments aimed at growth and expansion" and "regular and stable shareholder returns" predicated
on maintaining a sound financial foundation.
 A look back at business performance in fiscal 2019
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the automotive and semiconductor sectors that constitute major markets for our Company had been in a slump since the start of the fiscal year. Then upon entering the fourth quarter the global coronavirus pandemic occurred, which had a significant impact on our business performance. On the other hand, throughout the fiscal year we had been thoroughly undertaking efforts to "lean management" such as by cutting fixed costs. So while both sales and profits fell below our initial expectations with respect to our business performance for fiscal 2019, my take is that through these sorts of initiatives we were able to keep the extent of the decline down to a minimum. However, the fact of the matter is that our sales and profits declined compared to those of the previous fiscal year. Therefore, we should accept this in good faith, and promptly take measures to counteract it without failing to reflect on this and select challenges for the coming fiscal year.
My view is that it will take time for demand to recover in the new fiscal year. Therefore, in order to ensure business performance capable of meeting the expectations of our stakeholders given the environment we find ourselves in, we will continue to regard consolidating a foundation for earning profits as our highest priority. We will continue to work towards reassessing and cutting costs as a whole, primarily fixed costs, across each department. We will also provide a sound underpinning for our business performance, and establish a
constitution capable of earning profits despite the challenging circumstances.
Initiatives for Mid-term Business Targets
One of the basic strategies for our Mid-term Business Targets we set forth is: "Developing new products with competitive advantage, aiming at their prompt contribution." With this strategy, since demand for end products has not recovered, we have been unable to achieve adequate results from the perspective of readily developing the potential for such products. But when it comes to development, we are soundly moving ahead with spreading and nurturing the seeds necessary for this. Another strategy is: "Increasing profitability of existing products, expanding their field (applications and geographical areas)." With this, for our semiconductor materials business we are making advances in developing new purposes of use and functionality for not only telecommunications equipment, but also for in-vehicle products, while for our high-performance plastics business the same is being done for thermal management and replacing metals. As for our quality of life products business, we are proceeding ahead with developing new application and functionality in areas such as health care and films and sheets, including through outside partnerships, and these are being a potential force. When it comes to these two strategies, we ought to promote them in tandem with measures to enhance revenue for when they are practically implemented, wait until demand for end products recovers, and then tie this in with results all at once.

With the third strategy of "Proactive strategic investment in growth areas (M&A, etc.)," we will allot research and development costs on a basis of 5% of sales and capital investments of around 10 billion yen per year to expand sales in the future. We will also allocate about 50 billion yen as part of a strategic investment framework for the prompt commercialization of priority areas as businesses. Yet under the current harsh conditions, as we take measures to underpin our business performance we will be rendering judgment on these, which will surely lead to making new large-scale investments based on careful selection, although we will continue to proactively seek out investment opportunities. At this point in time, the coronavirus pandemic has not affected our cash flow, and we will continue to ascertain investment opportunities by keeping an eye on the situation.
Basic policies for financial strategy
The composition of our finances has been maintained at a stable and sound level for a long time. In many cases the materials we provide are the main components in our customers' products, and they all have lengthy development timeframes. As such, even after they are made into products we must supply materials in a stable manner over the long- term. In other words, we must be worthy of forming long- term, stable partnerships with, as seen from the perspective of our customers. In addition, it is also crucial that we form sound relationships of trust with upstream manufacturers of raw materials in order to be able to continue to provide high quality that can meet the expectations of our customers in a stable manner.
As a company that has been chosen by our stakeholders, we strive to improve our corporate value from three primary perspectives. The first is profitability. First off, while business profits are at an exceedingly dire level due to the current circumstances, our aim is to build a foundation for earnings in which our business profit to revenue ratio from our three business segments can be kept at or above 10% in a stable manner. The second is ROE, which is an indicator of how effectively we are utilizing capital to generate profits. In fiscal 2019, this fell 3.7% compared to the previous fiscal year to 5.0%, but our goal is to raise this figure up to 10%. Another important perspective is financial stability. As I mentioned above, I feel that we need to allocate cash to investments in new business areas, M&A, and so forth, with a view towards long-term growth. However, while we are in the process of making investments in an increasingly proactive manner, we have set the criterion of not exceeding ratio of interest-bearing debt and debt- equity ratio from when we acquired the US company Vaupell Holdings, Inc. back in 2014. For fiscal 2020, we will continue working to make efforts to reform our businesses structures, make improvements, and boost our corporate value with this in the front of our minds as we focus on restoring our business performance in the here and now.
Shareholder return policy and message to shareholders and investors
Even though our business performance in fiscal 2019 fell below that of the previous fiscal year's, we kept annual dividends at the same level as the previous fiscal year at 75 yen. In addition, the standard we use for our dividend payout ratio is 30%. On account of our business performance, this came in at the high figure of 39% for fiscal 2019, but over the medium-term we will continue to aim for our standard of 30%.
When it comes to cash, I would like for us to maintain a certain amount of this as capital for strategic investments geared towards future growth and expansion. When this is viewed over the medium-to long-term, this will bring about improvements in our corporate value and allow us to return profits to our shareholders. We will focus on restoring and improving our business performance in the future based upon our policy of continuing to return profits to our shareholders in a stable and ongoing manner.
In light of the current state of affairs with the world economy, we must soundly do what we must in this moment and seek to expand and grow our businesses over the medium to long- term while sustaining our business performance in the here and now. The embodiment of the SDGs that is consonant with our Business Philosophy (Company Policy) serves as an articulation of this growth orientation. We will engage in development that places importance on social needs based on the SDGs and continue to provide valuable materials. Through this, we will aspire to be a company that can both create business opportunities and contribute to resolving social issues, as well as exert a strong presence in various different sectors.
In addition, my view is that times of social change present opportunities. For example, metallic materials have until now been widely used in automobiles, but the emergence of the problem of climate change has accelerated moves to switch to hybrid vehicles and EVs in order to reduce emissions of CO2, and encouraged the replacement of metals with resin materials in the aim of reducing weight. Nowadays, the focus is on new breakthroughs such as self-driving and connected vehicles. As this demonstrates, the concept of what a vehicle is, is changing. Our greatest strength is our ability to provide plastics with new functionality right when technical innovations demand such functionality and materials. Our greatest mission lies in providing materials offering high-performance, high added-value, and sound reliability, as well as those materials that no one else but we can produce.
Society is undergoing significant changes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In all likelihood, only those companies that can acutely grasp these changes and continue providing sought-after value will be able to achieve growth. I am confident that we can be one such company. I would like to ask all of our shareholders for your understanding regarding our approach to business, and to lend us their support as viewed from a long-term perspective on into the future.

Risks on Business
The items below constitute the major risks facing our Company Group's businesses. However, these do not cover all of the risks related to our Group, as risks other than those listed here that are difficult to foresee also exist.
Our Group has set in place a corporate control structure and has established and operates an internal control system in an effort to reduce both the frequency with which these risks occur and the extent of their impact.
What is more, each Group company and each department gets a handle on and assesses the business risks facing their own sections, based on which our Group formulates its basic policy for risk management. This states that we must undertake appropriate controls and best practices in response to the various risks surrounding our businesses.
Matters related to future events found within this document are based
1 Product Quality
Our Group has adopted a consistent quality control structure covering everything from the design management through to the manufacture and sales of our various products that is based on quality manuals that conform to international quality control standards (ISO-9001, IATF-16949, AS9100, etc.). Yet we cannot guarantee that all of our products will be completely free of defects and deficiencies, or that absolutely no quality complaints or recalls will occur in the future.
Our products are used for purposes that are both directly and indirectly related to people's lives, such as in automobiles, aircraft, medical devices, electronic materials, and more. Therefore, if a large-scale incident involving these products were to occur, it would generate an enormous cost burden as a result of paying compensation for damages, recalls, and so forth. Not only that, but it could also potentially lead to negative repercussions for our management performance due to a loss of confidence in our Group.
There are also cases where advances in science and technology and changes in customers markets, and the way our products are used result in raising the level of quality control demanded by customers after our products have been placed on the market, or which give rise to unexpected quality issues.
Our Group regularly verifies our quality control status via internal audits performed by licensed personnel and external onsite quality audits. In addition, we undertake improvement activities that include detecting latent quality risks through the use of FMEA and FTA techniques, as well as taking measures to reduce these.
In addition, our Group has established a system for immediately sharing and undertaking centralized management for any quality issues that arise at any of our business sites in Japan or overseas. This is done in an effort to mount initial responses to said quality issues and to prevent the damage from them from spreading.
2 Disasters and Accidents
Of the foreseeable disasters and accidents that could occur, our Group regards earthquakes; explosions, fires, and
on judgments made by our Group as of the end of fiscal 2019.
leaks; storm and flood damage, and pandemics as major emergencies. Should any of these emergencies occur, our concern is that this would produce conditions under which we would be unable to continue to supply products as a result of casualties arising among neighboring residents and employees, damage to facilities and equipment, or the interruption of electricity, gas, water supply, or communication functions. Furthermore, interruptions to supply chains resulting from our partners or suppliers suspending functions, or functional interruptions to distribution, could potentially render us unable to ensure continuity in our economic activities. As a result, this could potentially have negative repercussions for our business performance, such as if we were to receive claims to pay vast sums of money as compensation for damages.
Our Group has usually prepared Business Continuity Plans (BCP) designed to ensure the continuity of business when such emergencies occur, and shares these with the relevant parties as needed. When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck, the structures and equipment at our Utsunomiya base were partially damaged, but by acting in accordance with this BCP we were able to minimize the damage done to our Group. Our Group recognizes that the frequency with which disasters and incidents that we regard as major emergencies occur, as well as the magnitude and extent of their impacts, is changing every year as a result of advances in science and technology and the effects of climate change. To date, we have taken measures such as ensuring adequate inventories, ensuring redundancy with our production systems at business sites in Japan and overseas, augmenting our supplies of spare parts, and systematizing our restoration structures. Every year we verify the adequacy of these measures based on the latest information. Moving forward, we will continue to reassess our BCP and offer training.
Of the disasters mentioned above, with regard to "explosions, fires, and leaks" that could potentially occur due to causes attributable to our Group, we collect data on near misses that occurred at our business sites in Japan and overseas. We then have our Corporate Safety Center, which was established in 2018, draft scientific explanations and countermeasures, which are then deployed throughout the entire Group.

3 Information Security Incidents
In recent years, cyber attacks have been growing increasingly clever and sophisticated, and there have been numerous cases in which the information retained by companies has been exfiltrated as a result of unauthorized access and cyber attacks. If our Group were to suffer a cyber attack that resulted in the failure or interruption of important systems, or the exfiltration of sensitive data in our possession, it could potentially impact our Group's business performance via a loss of trust in us by society, causing confusion or delays in our business activities, or generating costs such as compensation paid to our business partners.
To prevent information security incidents, our Group adopts information security measures and monitors for cyber attacks. We also provide information security education for our executive officers and employees and perform cyber attack drills in working to improve awareness of information security.
In addition, we make efforts to take part in and actively obtain information from organizations that share information on and enhance countermeasures to cyber attacks, such as the Nippon CSIRT Association and the Initiative for Cyber Security Information sharing Partnership of Japan (J-CSIP). We also established SUMIBE-CSIRT, which is a cross-cutting body to prepare against the occurrence of information security incidents. Through this, we have set in place a structure for mounting responses when emergencies occur that includes our management-level employees, and coordinating with outside agencies related to security.
4 Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Our Group engages in business activities globally, and complies with a broad range of laws and regulations covering a number of different areas both in Japan and various other countries. Of these, regulations that are closely related to the contents of our businesses as a manufacturer of functional chemical products include regulations on the management of chemical substances, as well as regulations pertaining to waste, carbon dioxide, sewage, and emissions of soot and dust.
In the event that we should fail to abide by any current or future laws or regulations, this could result in negative repercussions for our business performance on account of the generation of vast sums in losses due to criminal penalties, fines, or civil suits, as well as a loss in confidence in our Group.
In order to prevent legal and regulatory violations from occurring and minimize any negative repercussions from these on our financial condition and business performance, through operating and enhancing our chemical substance management system, arranging and improving various internal regulations and procedures, providing different types of compliance education, and performing internal audits, we work to properly comply with laws and regulations.
5 Country-specific Risks
Revenue from our overseas subsidiary companies accounts for an approximately 50% share of our consolidated revenue, and the regions we are active in span a wide range that covers Europe and the United States, East Asia (including China), and Southeast Asia. In cases where there are abrupt changes in the practical application or interpretation of laws by the laws, regulations, policies, or authorities of the countries in which we carry out business activities, or when political instability arises or uprisings occur, this could potentially have negative repercussions for our Group in carrying out our business and on our business performance. The same holds true in cases where such changes occur in regions in which our suppliers and customers operate.
In addition, in the future chemical substance management and initiatives to curb and reduce our emissions of CO2 could be strengthened, which could potentially give rise to new costs for countermeasures to these.
Our Group focuses on getting a grasp of the most recent circumstances in each country. In addition, for products that we provide globally, we focus our efforts on establishing structures that allow us to supply said products from multiple production bases in order to disperse risk and continue supplying these to our customers.
6 Procurement of Raw Materials and Price Fluctuations
As a manufacturer of functional chemical products, many of the main raw materials used by our Group are derived from petroleum. Therefore, if the price of petroleum or naphtha were to suddenly rise as a result of instability in the Middle East or the global economic climate, this could potentially lead to negative repercussions for our business performance as a result of delays in reflecting this in the price of our products, for example. We also use metal materials like silver and copper as raw materials. If the prices of these materials were to skyrocket due to the economic climate or for other reasons, then this could also potentially have negative repercussions on our business performance in a similar manner.
Furthermore, with regards to the raw materials that are supplied to us from foreign companies, there is the possibility of supply
 Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2020
28

interruptions, temporary restrictions, sudden price increases, and raw material manufacturers suddenly withdrawing from business on account of causes such as the conditions or climate, revisions to laws, and problems in securing a labor force in the country of origin. Such cases could potentially give rise to sales decreases, worsening profitability, or impediments to business continuity.
With continuity of supplies as our foremost consideration, our Group works to reduce such risks by sourcing from multiple suppliers, by way of example. As for raw materials derived from natural products such as plants and minerals, we will continue working to develop technologies to control differences in their composition and ingredients that occur as a result of regional variations. In addition, when we adopt new raw materials, one of our criteria for their adoption is that they must not contain substances that will be subject to restrictions in the future, which is done in an effort to reduce risk. As for price fluctuations for our main raw materials, we are proceeding with the adoption of a formula system (where changes in raw materials are automatically reflected in prices) based on consultations with our customers.
7 Securing and Developing Human Resources
People form the foundation of our business activities. Should we be unable to secure and train human resources who can be expected to serve as valuable assets, or if our existing valuable human assets were to leave our Group, it could potentially have negative repercussions on our business continuity and business performance. Members of our organizations for each business, both in Japan and overseas, are aging, and our Group will be faced with risks in terms of our operational safety should we be slow to properly respond to this. What is more, the chemical industry to which our Group belongs is similar to other industrial sectors in that the human resources they require have been changing as a result of changes to the products, manufacturing techniques, and so forth, with engineers in particular in short supply. The employment of the digital engineers that can oversee the AI/MI/IoT that will be key to the chemical industry
and our Group in the future is becoming increasingly fluid. Should we be slow in responding to this appropriately, it could have negative repercussions on our business continuity and business performance.
To respond to social changes such as flows of human resources becoming commonplace and increasingly diverse career paths, since 2007 our Group has been offering our own unique education and training program in the form of SB School by revising the course every year. For the future, we feel that it will be necessary to promote efforts like overhauling our various personnel systems to be even more appealing, career recruitment, and so forth.
8 Coronavirus
Our Group regards the "pandemics" mentioned in section "2 Disasters and Accidents" above as major emergencies. The COVID-19 pandemic that has spread all over the world starting in early 2020 has truly become manifest in a manner close to the absolute worst-case scenarios envisioned. Our Group now finds itself in a position where it cannot guarantee the continuity of economic activities that involve all of the relevant parties. This naturally includes health issues faced by employees, as well as protracted stoppages in production and shipping activities at our plants in different locations, primarily those located overseas, disruptions of supply chains due to business partners and suppliers suspending their functions, and logistical disruptions. We now find that we must promptly respond.
As for our initiatives for this, we are currently soundly moving forward with all conceivable BCP measures. These include continuing to procure raw materials from multiple sources, ensuring redundancy with our production systems at our business sites in Japan and overseas, ensuring adequate inventories, and taking prompt and flexible measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees. Furthermore, we recognize the need to continue performing verification and reappraisals of the adequacy of our measures while keeping an eye on changes to the current conditions.

A look back at fiscal 2019
A worldwide slump in the semiconductor market has persisted since the latter half of 2018, and just when demand was showing signs of recovering at the end of 2019 the coronavirus pandemic struck. However, we were ultimately able to increase revenue, partially as a result of the initiatives we had previously been addressing, including expanding our market share and developing new use cases. Conversely, with respect to business profits our profit margins deteriorated and profits fell as a result of the steep rise in procurement costs for certain raw materials.
By building globally same quality assurance structure maintaining top share in global markets for more than 30 years
Since the 1980s, we have captured the top share in global markets with our semiconductor encapsulation materials that insulate and protect semiconductor devices, and we have maintained this position for more than 30 years since then. At present, in addition to encapsulation materials we also supply a number of products that are crucial for semiconductor manufacturing processes, including photosensitive coating resins for semiconductor wafers, substrate materials for semiconductor packages, and die bonding paste. These are used in a variety of different sectors, such as in telecommunications equipment like PCs and smartphones, as well as in automobiles, consumer electronics, industrial machinery, and more. To meet the needs of our customers all around the world, we have established structures that integrate manufacturing, sales, and R&D in different regions spanning from Japan (Fukuoka) to China (Suzhou), Singapore, and Taiwan (Kaohsiung). Through this, we have established a quality assurance structure offering a uniform level of quality between our bases. In addition, with "Customer Satisfaction (CS) is the foundation for everything" as our business policy, we emphasize activities whereby we offer proposals from the customer's viewpoint. We have also established open laboratories that allow us to undertake development in an integrated manner together with customers in our various locations in Asia, as well as Europe and the United States, and work to faithfully and rapidly reflect the needs of our customers in products.

material technologies we have cultivated to date and our strong relationships of trust with our customers. As for our Mid-term Business Targets, we are working to boost the competitive advantage of our encapsulation materials and expand production in growth areas by means of expanding our business with highly integrated devices and in the mobility sector.
For example, in the in-vehicle encapsulation material sector, in addition to conventional semiconductor devices, we have also positioned materials for fixing motor magnets for hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs), direct molding materials for electric control units (ECUs), and materials for power module as strategic products, and will continue to actively deploy these. In April 2020, we launched the Mobility Materials Sales Department within our Sales Division, thereby setting in place a sales promotion structure. For the future, our aim is to situate in-vehicle encapsulation materials as a second pillar of our business after our semiconductor encapsulation materials. We have set forth a target for sales in the in-vehicle encapsulation materials market of 12 billion yen by fiscal 2025.
In addition, in January 2020 we established the Next e-Axle Market Promotion Project Team to set our sights even farther ahead in the future of mobility. Electric axles are pivotal devices providing the driving force for
industry, government, and academia. It also aspires to promptly achieve electric axles that are small, light-weight, low-vibration and low-noise, and highly efficient by making them out of resin. In the field of highly integrated devices, we are working to enhance our lineup in response to the advent of IoT and 5G (fifth generation mobile communications systems). We are making advances in developing forward-looking products that include cutting-edge packaging materials (mold underfill materials*1 and granule type encapsulation materials for compression molding), low dielectric constant materials for 5G, and materials that can directly act as antennas on the surface of encapsulation materials. To supply goods to the Chinese market, where 5G-related demand is growing, we plan to increase production capacity at our subsidiary company in Suzhou, China. For the future, our aim is to expand our market share worldwide by further promoting initiatives that place CS first and ensuring our competitive
advantage.

Goichiro Kuwaki
 A look back at fiscal 2019
Revenue declined due to the sluggishness in the global automotive market seen since the start of the fiscal year, the decline in exports of electrical machinery and products from China to the United States due to the trade friction between the two countries, as well as the partial suspension of production at U.S. aircraft manufacturers that serve as our major customers. Other reasons for this decline include the slump in sales to the shale gas oil industry by our U.S. subsidiaries due to cheap crude oil costs, as well as the impact from the coronavirus pandemic. Business profits also decreased as a reflection of the rising cost of structural reforms due to the slump in sales to the automotive industry and the worsening sales environment when it comes to the aircraft industry.
Deploying our own proprietary value chains worldwide as a pioneer in plastics
High-performance plastics are the business that formed the core of our Company starting from back when we were founded. Phenolic resin is characterized by its excellent heat- resisting properties. By adding new functionality to it in the form of strength, heat dissipation, and abrasion resistance qualities we have expanded its use cases, thus ensuring its continued existence for more than 100 years. Chief among these, the greatest expansion in this regard has been in terms of its usage as a replacement for metal. Switching from metal to resin offers numerous advantages in terms of reducing the cost of raw materials, cutting manufacturing costs due to the ease with which it can be processed, and its ability to achieve weight reductions. As such, its use has rapidly expanded, primarily in the area of small components on vehicles.
In addition, one of our major strengths lies in our complete value chain. By developing and synthesizing phenolic resins in-house, creating molding compounds and molded parts suited to each purpose, and providing exceptional functionality and value at each stage, we are able to offer proposals that meet our customers' requirements. There are few resin manufacturers that possess such a value chain. Through these activities, we have built strong relationships of trust with customers in a variety of industries such as the automotive industries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Japan.
Returning to a growth path by implementing measures to restore business performance and accelerating new expansion in growth areas
Our high-performance plastic business has suffered a sizable slump in business performance. This came about as a result of the worldwide slump in the automotive market and the partial suspension of production at aircraft manufacturers, which are major customers of ours, as well as the impact from the

coronavirus pandemic. While we expect that these uncertain conditions will continue on into the future, we consider restoring our business performance and securing earnings to be pressing needs. We are currently promoting the concept that we must “lean management” measures in response to the market environment (optimizing our organizations, personnel, and equipment), such as by cutting fixed costs mainly in Europe and the United States, rebuilding our business models by expanding our customer base for the aircraft business, and so forth.
Yet even amidst such business conditions, we intend to capture demand by bringing to bear our complete value chain and global production and supply structures, which are our strengths. We have set molding compounds for brake pistons, resins for tires, and resins for friction materials as global strategic products, and position products in which we have an advantage in each region as regional competitive-advantage products. Examples of this would include materials for excavating shale gas and oil in the United States, resins for heat insulating foam in Europe, and materials for electric parts in Asia. We believe that there is not only demand for these in their respective regions, but that there
Brake pistons molded from Phenolic resins are used to phenolic molding compounds improve tire durability
could also potentially be latent demand for them in other regions as well. As such, we are proactively working to deploy these laterally in aiming to expand our market share and business globally.
What is more, we work to create new business opportunities through joint development rooted in the relationships of trust with our customers that we have built up over a long time, as well as our "One Sumibe" activities. In fiscal 2019, we developed a module for detecting fuel leaks that is compliant with China's environmental regulations for vehicles, and succeeded in acquiring major customers for it. In addition, we are strengthening our sales of materials for thermal management, as there is a growing need for this in a broad range of areas that include high-speed telecommunications and the fitting of electronics on vehicles. We offer a lineup of materials in a variety of different form factors suited to their purpose of use, such as substrates and sheets. Moving forward, we will aim for still-greater growth by proposing materials that contribute to solving social issues based on the three keywords of new markets, new customers and new functions.

     Development of “SiONTM,” a phenolic molding compound offering high dimensional accuracy
 We have developed our SUMIKON®PM "SiONTM" series of phenolic molding compounds, which achieve dimensional accuracy comparable to that of machined metal components via general injection molding, which we began selling in 2020. "SiONTM" is a new molding compound that overcomes the challenges of dimensional accuracy and strength that had plagued phenolic molding compounds, and is capable of meeting numerous high-level requirements such as creep resistance and strength at high temperatures. This is allowing us to accelerate the replacement of medium and large- sized molded metallic components with resin components on vehicles, for which such applications had previously been difficult, such as the gear pulley for electric power steering. In addition, replacing metal components, by cutting back on die-cast aluminum and bonded metal, with resin components which exhibit dimensional accuracy makes it possible to reduce weight by 20–60% and improve energy efficiency, which in turn contribute to achieving No. 7.3 of the SDGs.

 A look back at fiscal 2019
While the domestic market for medical devices has been weak, sales in the U.S. market have increased favorably, thus leading to growth on the whole. Moreover, with bio-related products we saw favorable sales of glycan kits and diagnostic microfluidics. In addition, this business also saw increased revenue and profits due to the contributions by SB Bioscience Co., Ltd., with its in- vitro diagnostics (IVD) business that newly began operating from this fiscal year, as well as the substantial growth we saw in sales of films and sheets to manufacturers of generic drugs.
Eliciting new functionality from plastics and paving the way to a future of human health and wealth
Our quality of life (QOL) products business is divided up into the four areas of healthcare, films and sheets, industrial functional materials, and waterproofing, with the healthcare area including medical devices and bio-related products.
Our QOL product business features numerous products closely connected to people's everyday lives, including medical care, food, and housing, and provides both sophisticated functionality and value throughout daily life. For example, our films and sheets for pharmaceutical packaging have been imbued with various different functionality, such as being moisture-proof and blocking light and ultraviolet rays, by means of overlapping multiple sheets with varying formulations. In addition, we undertake design and offer proposals that incorporate innovations to make the packages easy to press, safe, and that discourage accidental ingestion, while also reflecting the unique characteristics of the drug in question. For this reason, our customers entrust our Company to handle the majority of their packaging design, leaving them free to focus on the development of the drugs themselves. We have received high praise regarding our excellent product functionality and our business model of placing CS first, which has allowed us to acquire a roughly 70% domestic market share when it comes to our films and sheets for pharmaceutical packaging.
Moving forward, we will continue to pursue development and manufacturing that contribute still further to society and the richness of people’s lives to continue achieving growth with an accurate understanding of social problems like the aging of society, as well as the challenges for the SDGs.

to see growth in the future, such as endovascular treatments and gastrointestinal endoscopic treatments. We are moving forward with expanding our lineup of Class III and IV (in-vivo products) in particular, which involve a high degree of difficulty. While we are already selling our "Steering Microcatheter" endovascular treatment devices and biliary stents, in FY2019 we newly launched the world's thinnest microcatheters for the brain and endoscopic clips on the market. In addition, we are moving ahead with obtaining approval for pharmaceuticals at our subsidiary in Dongguan, China, and will continue working to expand into the Chinese market, which will only grow larger in the future. At the same time, when it comes to bio-related products, since April 2019 we have been expanding into the in- vitro diagnostic pharmaceutical business through SB Bioscience Co., Ltd., which is a joint venture together with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. Diagnostic drugs are useful when it comes to the early diagnosis of illnesses. By bringing the bio- related technologies for things such as cell culture incubators and glycan analysis reagents/kits that we have cultivated thus far to bear on diagnostic drugs, we are expediting research and development of these drugs.
For films and sheets, we have been able to supply most of the packaging for new generic drugs. We believe this is due to the fact that our initiatives that place CS first have
garnered recognition. As for their use for food

As for their industrial uses, our subsidiary in Nantong, China is off to a good start in this regard, and is setting in place a structure capable of accommodating this via local production for local consumption in China, through which we are making progress with capturing demand.
As for industrial functional materials, we are making progress with differentiating ourselves by using the optical control technology we have cultivated with our polarizing sheets as an asset in this. We are promoting the development and sale of in- vehicle optical products, such as heads-up displays and sensing cameras for self-driving, and are working to shift to highly profitable products.
It is essential that we continue to meet the new needs arising as people's lives change due to the coronavirus pandemic. For example, in the healthcare sector we have begun supplying face shields to protect against infection via droplets. Moreover, our films and sheets are perfectly suited for the long-term storage of foods in response to people's rising tendency to stay at home more. Through our business model of placing CS first, we intend to continue to go about accurately determining market needs and creating products that can contribute to society and the richness of people's lives.

 Initiatives to provide total solutions for the glycan sector
Glycan is one of the biomolecules that make up our bodies. It plays an important role when it comes to diagnosing cancer and other diseases, drug discovery, and research on iPS cells. We are not only advancing sales of glycan analysis kits and fully-automated equipment for this, but we also offer analysis services on a consignment basis in which we undertake glycan analysis. What is more, in May 2019 we began selling our O-glycan analysis kits, which made it possible to easily, quickly, and accurately analyze O-glycan, which had previously been difficult to analyze. Use of these products and services has spread among pharmaceutical companies, universities, and others both in Japan and overseas. By providing "one-stop solutions for glycan research and analysis," we are supporting the healthcare industry and contributing to improving the richness of people's lives.

Our Company Group's Environmental Vision for 2050 (CO2 reduction)
 Our Group relies upon the earth’s natural resources and energy in order to do business. However, doing business will generate garbage and air and water emissions. For this reason, we believe it is important for our Group to adhere to environmental laws and regulations, conduct business in an environmentally friendly manner, and engage in initiatives that reduce the environmental impact on the entire society through our products and services.
In fiscal 2018 our Group established a plan with medium- to long-term targets ending in fiscal 2030, and has been promoting activities based on this. However, in light of the environmental challenges that will only grow more severe from this year on, we felt it was necessary to promote activities from an even longer-term perspective. Therefore, we formulated our Environmental Vision for 2050 (CO2 reduction) ending in 2050.
For the future, we will continue to promote activities aimed at our challenges for the year 2050 by using SBT*1 as one of the indicators for this.

Initiatives for the Climate Change Program
CDP (headquartered in London)*2 is an international NGO established in 2000 in partnership with institutional investors from around the world. It carries out projects in which it sends out questionnaires to major companies and municipal governments around the world on issues such as climate change, water security, and forests, and that seek climate change strategies and specific declarations related to emissions of greenhouse gases.
With the CDP's 2019 survey, survey activities were conducted on behalf of 525 institutional investors with net invested assets totaling 96 trillion U.S. dollars. More than 8,400 companies, accounting for over 50% of global market capitalization,
disclose environmental data on their initiatives for climate change programs via the CDP.
We complied with the CDP's request to respond to its 2019 climate change survey, and we were awarded a "B" rating on January 20, 2020. For fiscal 2020, we have been requested to reply to the survey on water security in addition to the one on climate change, and we intend to respond.
We will continue to reduce our environmental impact, conserve resources and energy, control chemical substances, develop products that contribute to the environment, and contribute to countering climate change, while also promoting the disclosure
of environmental information in the future.

Environmental Management System
Under our newly established Environmental Vision for 2050, our Group will work to address environmental conservation across the entire Group based on our Policy on Responsible Care Activities in aiming to contribute to the sustainable development of society.
To actively reduce environmental impacts, conserve biodiversity, and prevent soil and groundwater pollution, our Responsible Care Committee and Environmental Impact Reduction Committee take the lead in checking compliance with environmental laws and regulations as well as conducting environmental assessments throughout the entire life cycle, from R&D to raw materials procurement, production, sales and final disposal. Based on the results, each workplace and work site take appropriate actions.
From January 2020, our Responsible Care Committee and Environmental Impact Reduction Committee began carrying out activities as subordinate committees under the
Sustainability Promotion Committee. We will continue to promote environmental management under this sustainability promotion structure.
▶ Environmental Management Structure
*1 The Sustainability Promotion Committee is a committee that is chaired by the president, and was launched in April 2019. See pages 39 and 40 for details.
*2 The above system diagram is just an excerpt of our committees related to environmental management. See page 39 regarding our Responsible Care Committee and Environmental Impact Reduction Committee.
  Responsible Care Committee*2
  Activities of the Environmental Impact Reduction Committee
The Environmental Impact Reduction Committee recaps each year’s progress toward medium- to long-term environmental targets at the end of the fiscal year and determines the targets for the following fiscal year. It carries out its activities with the approval of the Sustainability Promotion Committee, which serves as its parent body. Two subcommittees were established within the committee in order to achieve its objectives, and these subcommittees work to reduce our environmental impact.
The Life Cycle Subcommittee aims to establish production systems with minimal environmental impacts through scientific, quantitative, and objective assessments of environmental impacts, from the R&D phase onward, under the Policy on Responsible Care Activities. The subcommittee is moving forward with its activities under its set target of ensuring that 25% of its researchers are capable of performing life cycle assessments (LCA) at all research and development departments and instituting energy conservation on their own by fiscal 2022 by continuing to foster said researchers and developers. In fiscal 2019 the number of certified personnel was hovering above the target line. In addition, as part of its efforts to expand the aggregation of environmentally friendly products company-wide, it has revised the phrasing from "environmentally friendly products (non-consolidated)" to "SDG- contributing products and technologies (consolidated)."
In fiscal 2020, the Life Cycle Subcommittee will work to enhance educational opportunities, horizontally deploy LCA evaluations on baseline products, and expand items on which LCA evaluations have been carried out for SDG-contributing products.
The Energy Conservation Subcommittee worked to establish, across all business sites in Japan, a mechanism for continuously soliciting and trying out ideas for saving energy through such means as voluntary implementation initiatives in business sites. In fiscal 2019, the subcommittee successfully reduced
energy consumption by as much as 1,424 kL (55,181 GJ) in crude oil equivalent, or 2,748t-CO2, compared with fiscal 2018, primarily by reducing city gas and electricity consumption. Furthermore, the subcommittee established and successfully achieved targets by carrying out unique activities to conserve electricity in the summer and winter months. Outside of Japan, the subcommittee worked to ensure a similar level of activities as in Japan and continued to promote the roll out of activity methods and best practices.
The subcommittee has established an energy conservation target for fiscal 2020 too, and will continue efforts aimed at achieving energy consumption reduction plans at the workplace level. In particular, the subcommittee will focus on creating a system across business sites in Japan for sharing practices for reducing energy consumption and technical information related to energy conservation in order to improve the level of energy-saving technology throughout our Company; and having the mother plants in Japan provide technical support to their affiliated sites through a tie-up with the Company-wide Energy Conservation Secretariat.

Material Flows and Investments in Environmental Protection
The figure below shows inputs, including raw materials and energy, and outputs that are products and emissions released into the environment.
The Group is working to minimize its impact on the environment by means of waste reduction and resource savings through promoting more efficient use of raw materials, energy, and water. For fiscal 2019, we reduced both our emissions of CO2 and the amount of water used compared with the previous year through reduction efforts at our business sites. In addition, in light of the impact that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had in terms of bringing economic activity to a standstill in the latter part of the fiscal year as a separate causal factor, we saw reductions across numerous items such as the volumes of inputs of raw materials and sales of products. Conversely, our amount of recycled waste has increased. This can be attributed to import restrictions on waste plastics in the China / Southeast Asian region, which in turn has led to an increase in waste plastics being disposed of as waste, whereas before these had been traded as a valuable good.

Medium- to Long-term Environmental Targets and Performance
 Medium- to Long-term Environmental Targets
We have established a medium- to long-term environmental plan starting from fiscal 2018 and ending in fiscal 2030, and are promoting activities based on this.
In particular, we have formulated targets for reducing greenhouse gases that are based on the following.
·Response to sustainable development needs shared by the international community with 2030 as the target year established in the SDGs approved at the UN Summit in September 2015.
·Response to the greenhouse gas reduction target for fiscal 2030 indicated in the Japanese government’s INDC in COP21.
·Response to the Act on the Rational Use of Energy and the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures.
In addition, we are focusing our efforts on the reduction of greenhouse gas (CO2 emissions) linked with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren)’s Commitment to a Low Carbon Society, which we have participated in through the Japan Chemical Industry Association. Furthermore, as we have done in the past, the amount of material loss (waste and valuable materials) generated is suppressed. By controlling it, we will improve the resource utilization rate and promote the effective use of raw materials. We will also set targets for reducing chemical substance emissions and systematically promote efforts to reduce environmental impact.
Initiatives at Business Sites in Japan
We saw reductions that were over and above our expectations in light of the impact that the coronavirus pandemic had in terms of bringing economic activity to a standstill at the end of fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020, we expect to see increases over fiscal 2019 based on the expected recovery in production activities and the emission factors of our power suppliers.
Regarding material loss, we are promoting measures to detect and cut down on waste at our plants through MFCA*1 activities at each
of our business sites. We saw a slight increase in material loss due to the effects of the import restrictions on waste plastics in China and Southeast Asia in fiscal 2019. However, we will institute further measures to reduce the amount of losses that arise, and we expect this to once again begin declining starting from fiscal 2020.
As for emissions of chemical substances, we had business sites that saw temporary increases in their atmospheric emissions for reasons such as the start of new businesses. These sites achieved substantial reductions by introducing exhaust combustion equipment. We are also making progress on treating the substances subject to the PRTR Act found within said emissions of these same business sites, achieving substantial reductions of 5.5 tons versus the previous year. For fiscal 2020, we will proceed with increasing our efficiency in treating this, and expect to be able to reduce this still further.
*1 See the glossary on page 108.
Initiatives at Overseas Business Sites
CO2 emissions at overseas business sites fell significantly compared to the previous fiscal year due partially to the results of Energy conservation activities at each business site, but also as a result of the coronavirus. For fiscal 2020 our aim is to recover our production activities while at the same time promoting further reductions.
As for the occurrence of material loss, this was similarly impacted, and thus fell. Moving forward, we will perform monitoring to ensure that no waste arises when our production activities recover via MFCA activities in aiming to reduce this further.
We reduced emissions of chemical substances compared with last year by operating the exhaust combustion equipment introduced the previous year in a more efficient manner. For the future, we will move forward in reducing our consumption to an even greater extent at each of our business sites.

Reducing Energy Use and CO2 Emissions
Regarding energy usage at our business sites in Japan, our per production amount value rose slightly due to the decrease in production. As for CO2 emissions, both emissions and per production amount value are on a downward trajectory, but we expect that our emissions will increase slightly in 2020 due to the recovery of production and the emissions coefficient of our energy suppliers.
At our overseas business sites, both our energy consumption and CO2 emissions declined from the previous year, but our per production amount value increased due to the decrease in production. As we expect production to recover in 2020 we anticipate that our energy consumption will increase, but we anticipate reductions in CO2 based on our efforts to achieve this.
▶ Energy usage per production amount value*1
Disclosure of Scope 3*3 Data
In 2015, our Group began calculating and disclosing Scope 3 emissions in the supply chain of business sites belonging to Group companies in Japan because of the growing importance of understanding CO2 emissions covering the entire supply chain. In fiscal 2018, we enlarged the scope to cover overseas business sites. The scope of said disclosures cover a total of eight categories including Category 1 “Purchased goods and services.” In addition, we confirmed that three categories including Category 8 “Upstream leased assets” are not applicable.
Similar to past years, Category 1 “Purchased goods and services” accounted for a large portion of CO2 emissions, and this includes the portion from overseas. However, emissions have been declining since fiscal 2018 due to the drop in purchase volumes, primarily at overseas business sites. Moving forward, we will continue to calculate and disclose data on other categories and work to increase the accuracy of the data for each category, while also promoting ongoing efforts to reduce CO2 emissions across the entire supply chain. *3 See the glossary on page 108.

* Data covers all the business sites in Japan and Oversea listed on page 3.
Calculation method:
We calculated the amount of emissions in accordance with the Basic Guidelines on Accounting for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Throughout the Supply Chain Ver. 3 issued by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, using the emission coefficient stated in the basic database IDEA Ver. 2.3 Carbon Footprint Communication Program developed jointly by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and the Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry as well as the Emissions Intensity Database for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Organizations through the Supply Chain
*1 Energy usage per production amount value is determined using the following equation:
Energy usage per production amount value = energy usage/(production amount x unit price) Energy consumption is calculated as a crude oil equivalent.
*2 CO emissions per production amount value are determined using the following equation: 2
CO2 emissions per production amount value = CO2 emissions/(production amount x unit price) Also, CO2 emissions are the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

  Assessment of Water-Related Risk in Fiscal 2019
Since fiscal 2015, we have been continuously surveying the regional watershed risk of all major plants in the Group (11 sites in Japan and 24 sites overseas). Continuing on from fiscal 2018, in fiscal 2019 there were significant changes to the WRI Aqueduct*1 tool. While the risk level for our business sites in Japan fell, conversely the risk level for districts in China worsened.

Our Group revised risk levels based on the results of WRI studies and independent studies performed on each business site. We compiled the results into a table that contains the risks facing each of the regions in which the Group operates. Using these results, going forward, we will continue working to preserve water resources more effectively.

Soil/Underground Water Pollution Countermeasures
Response to Soil/Underground Water Pollution
Our Group carries out risk assessments relating to leakage of chemical substances at all of our business sites, and we promote both the development and implementation of preventive frameworks. At the same time, when contamination caused by past leakage accidents is confirmed, we actively undertake voluntary surveys and institute countermeasures in order to prevent the environmental impact and health damage from spreading.
We did not suffer any severe leakage accidents in fiscal 2019.
▶ Results of Soil and Groundwater Studies, Related Actions, and Monitoring Results

  Results of Investigation
  Countermeasures and monitoring results
   Amagasaki Plant
 Lead was detected by soil content sampling in 2009 and 2010 (max. 500 mg/kg whereas the standard is 150 mg/kg). No groundwater contamination was detected.
 Heavy metals exceeding the standard values of the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act were detected at the business sites on the left. Monitoring of the groundwater is conducted at these sites every year and their contamination levels have been confirmed to be below standard values.
   Akita Sumitomo Bakelite
   Lead was detected by soil elution sampling in 2005 (max. 0.032 mg/L whereas the standard is 0.01 mg/L). No groundwater contamination was detected.
   Yamaroku Kasei Industry
 In January 2016, 1,4-Dioxane in excess of the standard concentrations was detected in the company's cooling water effluent, with concentrations of a similar amount confirmed in well water drawn from on the premises that had been used. In consultation with the government, the plant stopped drawing water and switched to a closed water cooling system. The company has no history of using the substance in question.
   The company cooperates with an ongoing monitoring survey of the groundwater quality that is regularly conducted by Osaka Prefecture, and also continues to perform independent examinations as well. The latest measurement results were 1.48mg/L (standard value of 0.05mg/L).
   Initiatives for resource recycling
Marine plastics
When it comes to the problem of marine plastics, we are moving ahead with activities to contribute to reducing plastic marine waste via a number of initiatives based on the Japanese government’s Plastic Resource Recycling Strategy. These initiatives include managing the raw materials used and the plastic products we manufacture, promoting the recycling of said products, and developing new products.
We are currently taking part in the Japan Initiative for Marine Environment (JaIME), which was established by major companies and industry organizations in the chemical industry, as well as the Clean Ocean Material Alliance (CLOMA), which was established by a broad range of business operators related to supply chains for plastic products, including those in the chemical industry and distribution/retail industries, with the goal of forming cross-industry partnerships. Through this, we are working to address a variety of challenges by aiming to curb plastic waste across our supply chain as a whole and promoting recycling via 3R activities for plastic products.
Recycling
Our Group promotes recycling as a means to make effective use of resources. This recycling includes the recovery and recycling of phenol from waste liquid produced by phenolic resin reactions during the product production process, fine grinding of offcuts from phenolic laminated sheets and decorative melamine resin laminate for use as a filler in phenolic resin molding compounds reuse of molded article by-products (sprues and runners) as raw material for molding materials, as well as reuse of excess sludge from activated sludge effluent treatment equipment as compost (organic fertilizer).

company to promote the complete elimination of serious disasters and major accidents.
Each of our business sites makes efforts closely in tune with the needs of individual workplaces within a company-wide framework and under an accountability structure involving the managers of business sites. At its monthly meetings, the Health and Safety Committee inspects health and safety management activities, ensures thorough compliance with relevant laws and ordinances, and considers capital investments to realize risk reduction, among other actions.
In 2009, our Group’s plants and main subsidiaries in Japan began pursuing OHSAS18001 accreditation, followed by our Group’s overseas subsidiaries from 2010. Today, a total of 23 business sites have received accreditation, including five business sites and three subsidiaries in Japan and 15 subsidiaries overseas. In addition, we are making steady progress on transitioning over to ISO 45001 as a result of the repeal of OHSAS 18001 scheduled for 2021.
Machinery and Equipment Risk Reduction Activities
All new machinery and equipment installed at domestic production plants and subsidiaries from 2008 and at overseas subsidiaries from 2009, have been designed in compliance with ISO12100. We carry out risk assessments of existing facilities when changes occur, such as when the facilities are restructured or work procedures change, in an effort to make machinery and equipment fundamentally safer.

In 2012, we introduced chemical substance risk assessments at plants in Japan and subsidiaries worldwide. We verify our evaluation results when changes occur, such as information on the risks and hazards posed by chemical substances and changes to work procedures. This is done in aiming to prevent adverse health effects to employees through exposure to chemical substances, and to prevent explosion or fire incidents caused by chemical substances.

Health and Safety Education
We carry out measures to reduce the risks posed by machinery and chemical substances in order to ensure safety on sites where these are used. At the same time, we conduct hazard prediction training as well as initiatives, such as “pointing and calling” and making proposals for reducing near-miss accidents. We have introduced “Safety Gyms” at each production plant to allow employees to learn about the fundamentals of safety. They are able to improve their safety consciousness and learn hazard prediction skills and risk identification skills.
Furthermore, we also conduct safety education at every level. This includes holding safety meetings in which all plant managers participate to share initiatives involving safety activities in which they take a lead and act as role models, specialized safety education for managers, basic correspondence education on safety for mid-level employees, and hands-on safety education for new employees. In addition,

Trends in Occupational Accidents at Sumitomo Bakelite and Subsidiaries
Number of Employees Injured as a Result of Occupational Accidents
The graph on right shows the number of employees injured as a result of occupational accidents at our company as well as subsidiaries in Japan. In 2019 there was a slight increase in both occupational accidents resulting in lost workdays and occupational accidents not resulting in lost workdays, and the total number of employees injured rose for the second straight year.
Occupational Accidents by Type
Occupational accidents in Japan categorized by type are shown in the graph on the right.
In 2019 pinching and entanglement accidents increased. Other than this, no prominent trends were observed with regard to the type of accidents, but the majority was made up of accidents caused by unsafe actions taken by workers. By notifying all employees of our Safety Action Guidelines and utilizing our Safety Portal Site, we will continue with initiatives to enhance the safety awareness of workers.

Chemical Substance Management
 Chemical Substance Management throughout Product Life Cycles
 The targets for 2020 agreed upon at the WSSD*1 call for the worldwide and comprehensive management of chemical substances throughout the product life cycle, from development to manufacturing, use and disposal, by 2020 in order to minimize the significant adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by the manufacture and use of chemical substances. Following this trend, the regulatory environment is changing, as new regulations on the management of chemical substances have been established not only in Europe and the United States, but also in Asian countries since 2015.
In September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted at the U.N. Summit. They comprise 17 goals and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030 to create a sustainable
Chemical Substance Management System
We are focussing on promoting the use of SDSs*2 across the Group not only for disclosing information related to chemical substances under regulatory control in Japan and overseas, but also for disclosing relevant information voluntarily so as to improve the quality of the Group’s information disclosure practices. Particularly for the GHS*3 system, we have introduced MSDgen.*4 and offer SDS and labels that are compliant with the laws and regulations of 40 countries, including Japan, in the official languages of each country. In 2019, we revised our SDS to accommodate the new additions to Taiwan's Priority Management Chemicals and the U.S.’ TSCA Active Inventory.
*2,3,4 See the glossary on page 108.
Chemical Substance Management System
In the interest of ensuring safety, we confirm that all of the chemical substances constituting the raw materials and products handled by the Group conform with the laws and regulations of each country. We are also making progress with the creation of a Chemical Substance Management System to centrally manage these chemical substances. Introducing this system allows us to speed up chemical substance- related investigations (inventory in each country, the safety of products and raw materials, regulatory information, etc.) and to provide accurate information. We are now rolling out the system to plants that manufacture molded articles*17 and expanding application of volume tracking management to products for Taiwan and South Korea, in addition to Japan’s Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture and Industrial Safety and Health Act as well as Europe’s REACH.*18 We will continue to enhance our
world. Aimed at achieving the SDGs in 2030, the governments of each country have begun taking proactive actions. The Group (each of our plants and research institutes worldwide) is working on the SDGs through the management of chemicals carried out as part of our Responsible Care activities.
In terms of its management of chemical substances, the Group has a system in place for studying and reviewing chemical substance-related laws and regulations in Japan and throughout the world from the product development phase onward. We manage the chemical substances contained in products in order to comply with the laws of the countries where we operate and to minimize environmental impacts throughout product life cycles.

Reducing Risk Relating to New Business
There is a need to improve (optimize) the output quality (degree of perfection) of product designs and process designs when developing new products and to shorten (minimize) the time required for the development process by minimizing rework.
❶ Shortening New-Product Development Periods and Improving Work Quality
In new product development, initial plans are often delayed
because of the tendency for a variety of problems requiring
reworking to arise. To prevent this, we implement the Plan-Do-
Check-Action (PDCA) cycle to increase the degree of perfection
of design quality and shorten the development period through
and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to predict potential failures or abnormalities by analyzing health and safety risks on people including customers related to our products, along with Design Review Based on Failure Mode (DRBFM) that focuses on changes to the design and changes to conditions and the environment. In turn, we implement risk reduction measures
in all processes of DR, FMEA and DRBFM as well as during technical verification at the time of using new raw materials.
In addition, we use Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) that rationally analyzes accidents and defects in a hierarchical manner to discover root causesSaumnitdomofuBankdeliatemCoe., Lntdt. a(inlclsudoinlguGtrioupncsomfpoanriespirneJavpeannantdinovgerseas) recurrence.

on the audits, inadequate skills of the auditors, and a lack of information provided beforehand.
Furthermore, the internal audits conducted by each business site focused on the management system, and It was not possible to successfully link the activities from the extraction of essential issues to the prevention of recurrence and prevention. Therefore, in order to resolve these problems, we built an audit system (combining ‘Monozukuri’ Audits and internal audits)
that is able to identify the root issues in each business site,
education and instruction (including accompanying auditors onsite where necessary) were provided as a way to foster internal auditor leaders at business sites within Japan in order to strengthen our internal audits.
The findings from internal audits and ‘Monozukuri’ Audits consist of essential issues and items that could lead to essential issues. We have largely succeeded in achieving the functionality to deduce these essential issues. What is more, we have disclosed the findings from other business sites to ten of the audited business sites, had each of them perform self-inspections on their own sites, and make corrections and improvements where needed in order to roll out risk reductions laterally.
For fiscal 2020, we will continue working to improve the skills of auditors by training them as a way to enhance “combining 'Monozukuri' Audits and internal audits,” thereby aiming to further improve the effectiveness of our audits.

Enhancing Customer Satisfaction (CS) CS Promotion System
 Our Company has established a basic policy on the promotion of CS though the CS*1 Promotion Committee. In accordance with this basic policy, divisions and Group companies work together to share the voice (needs) of the customers and improve business processes based on this.
We invite customers in an annual conference to listen to their voices, deepen mutual understanding and build trust through questionnaires and other means. Internally, we hold CS discussion meeting annually to share CS activities and enhance awareness of CS. Each business site and business division creates their own CS Declaration comprised of five principles to suit the nature of its business and environment, all employees continue to evolve. Also, we utilize the company newsletter to convey our philosophy toward CS activities to employees.
*1 See the glossary on page 108.
Promoting One Sumibe Activities
With customer satisfaction (CS) a top priority, we promote “One Sumibe” by conducting company-wide product marketing activities, deepening relationships with customers, and actively promoting collaboration and cooperation within and outside the company. In the past, information, technology, and ideas that could not be shared because each business was divided vertically were gathered, and with the aim of making product proposals and sales that transcend the boundaries of business divisions, a team is formed to make proposals to customers.
For fiscal 2019 we increased the involvement of the General Manager of the Business Marketing Division and deepened examinations of areas that ought to be focused on in working to evolve these to activities that are adapted to the actual business conditions. We also instituted education via e-learning in order to further instill the “One Sumibe” mentality in employees. We are also considering using the company's newsletter for this. We will continue to share and discuss information among the teams that were started in fiscal 2018 and hold sessions to present the outcomes from this, while also providing information to our overseas locations. In fiscal 2020 we arranged our customers from each segment and will continue to widen the scope of customers we target with our activities.

  We are carrying out initiatives following the action plan for the promotion of women’s advancement that was decided in FY2015. In the four years from April 2016, we are aiming to solve the issues of there being few female management staff and the short length of service of women employed in career track positions. We have set the target of doubling the number of female management staff compared to the end of March 2014. At the end of March 2020, there was a 0.58-point increase in the number of female management staff compared to the

Work-Life Balance Our Position on Work-Life Balance
We promote the creation of workplaces conducive to successful work-life balance of employees.
In 2008, we formed its Work-Life Balance Labor Study Group to consider the options, formulate policies and commence their implementation. The objectives are:
❶ To promote flexible approaches to work, while also reducing overtime hours and promoting the full use of annual leave entitlements, and encourage employees to devote the additional time available to worthwhile non-work activities, such as educational pursuits and activities related to family and communities.
❷ To offer a greater diversity of working styles that benefit employees who must deal with major life events, such as marriage, childbirth, and child rearing, and thus contribute to nurturing the next generation.
In 2013, we expanded the application requirements to allow use for participation in volunteer activities and use in half-day increments to make it easier to use accumulated annual paid vacation. In 2014, we increased the number of days of leave for those attending the birth of their child from three days to five days. In 2016, we eliminated the number of days of accumulated annual paid vacation attached to family care leave and in 2017 we introduced a half-day leave system for days off in lieu.
In 2018, we began to allow employees to apply accumulated annual paid vacation in one-day increments for infertility treatment and cancer treatment. As for annual paid vacation, in 2011 we expanded the number of days of accumulated annual paid vacation (annual unused paid vacation days accrued) that may be carried over from 30 to 40 days, before further expanding this to 60 days in January 2020. We also adopted a system for annual time off based on hourly increments in January 2020.
We will continue to implement such initiatives as part of efforts to further promote better work-life balance.
▶ Number of Overtime Hours Worked and Days of Paid Leave Taken by Regular Employees
* “Regular employees” means our company (non-consolidated basis) personnel working during daytime hours, excluding managerial personnel.
Employee Support for Various Life Events
We are focusing on creating an environment in which our employees can achieve their goals for both work and life events (such as childbirth and childcare). We are also encouraging employees to proactively utilize various programs provided by our Group to help them deal with important life events, and since the implementation of childcare leave and nursing care leave programs, the proportion of employees returning to work after taking childcare or nursing leave has
been almost 100%. The number of people who took childcare leave in fiscal 2019 came to five women and two men, while nobody took nursing care leave.

  Feedback from a user of our system
I took childcare leave after the birth of our third child to support my wife
After the birth of our first son (our third child), I was able to take approximately one month of childcare leave starting from January 2020. When our first and second daughters were born it was still uncommon for men to take childcare leave, and the thought that I could even do so never occurred to me. Yet now the fact that even men can take childcare leave at Sumitomo Bakelite is no longer a rarity. This time around, my wife had been worried about caring for our three children right after giving birth even from when she was pregnant with our third child, so I decided to take time off, even if it was just for a month. Fortunately, my boss and coworkers understood, and while I was away on childcare leave I

During this period of childcare leave I realized that up until now I had only been able to help with childcare in a superficial sense, so this has been an excellent opportunity to think about my work-life balance moving forward.

The Group’s in-house training institute, “SB School”
In September 2007, we opened the Sumitomo Bakelite School (SB School) as an in-house training institute.
The aim of SB School is to provide lifelong education and training courses that help our Group achieve sustainable growth of business operations while maximizing corporate value. The school offers courses for all grades of employees from all departments. These include “all-employee education” courses that confirm and reinforce employees’ awareness of the Company’s Business Philosophy as well as fundamental knowledge about such issues as enhancement of CS, compliance, human rights, occupational safety, quality, and environmental protection. The school also systematically plans and implements various other kinds of educational and training courses needed by employees. From April 2019 through March 2020, the cumulative participation in SB School courses was about 27,000 employees, and the number of hours of education provided was approximately 16,000. We will plan and implement an increasingly wide range of programs
▶ Education and Training Structure of SB School
to develop the capabilities of all employees—the Company’s most precious management resource. In addition, we implement life planning education as a program for providing necessary information for life planning after retirement and rethinking one’s career direction. This program was revamped in fiscal 2017 to provide not only information about social insurance systems, but also opportunities to learn about second careers and health. In fiscal 2019, 70 employees took part.

Manufacturing-oriented SBPS Education
  SBPS activities originally began as an offshoot of on-site kaizen (improvement) activities but are now implemented throughout the Company in order to generate the values demanded by customers and society.
The activities are aimed at securing the revenue and safety (personnel, facilities, environmental, and quality) that our company requires to achieve sustainable development. The activities involve setting specific targets (financial, quantitative, and delivery), planning who needs to achieve each of these targets by when, and implementing these plans without delay, meaning the activities are just the same as the daily work tasks carried out by employees.
We believe that, through the ages, technical capabilities, knowledge, experience, and tireless will that each individual has who promotes these activities will always bring about our required results.
Based on this idea, we have organized education programs targeting each employee grade and level as part of the SB School system. The planning and operation of the education is in principle carried out by employees themselves.
Attendees are required to submit reports, and the emphasis is placed on putting what they have learnt into practice in their own departments. Regular followups are carried out to track their progress.
Our training course for foremen is one example of our employee grade-based education. We began offering courses designed to foster future workplace leaders back in 2017. More than 70 people have attended these as of March 2020, and are now working to boost the safety and profitability of their respective workplaces.
Quality Control Skill Enhancement
We offer 30 quality-training programs at our SB School to increase our employees’ awareness of quality, to prevent quality problems, and to improve quality techniques. November every year is designated as “quality month,” and quality education via e-learning is provided for all employees.
We provide education for second-year employees in the engineering track through the Sumitomo Bakelite educational system by offering easy-to-understand lectures and practical training in areas such as the company’s quality policy and approach to quality, regulations, quality management systems, problem-solving methods (FTA, FMEA, Why-Why Analysis, and Further Investigation), and statistical methods from the early
Environmental Education
Our laboratories and plants handle a wide range of chemical substances. We conduct periodic group education programs for employees, including new employees, with the objective of protecting the environment in the vicinity of our business sites and ensuring that employees work in safety. These programs are designed to enhance employees’ understanding of the properties of chemical substances and the content of relevant laws and regulations, thus enabling them to handle chemical substances appropriately.
In addition to group education programs, environmental education by e-learning is conducted every year for all employees in June, a month dedicated to enhancement of environmental protection. This helps our employees learn and gain an in-depth understanding about the various activities that the company is undertaking, including Responsible Care.

stages of the career of employees assigned to the research and production engineering departments. Administrative employees were also included in the eligible group for receiving education in areas such as quality in general, regulations, and management systems.
In fiscal 2019, we gave everyone throughout the company a test of their quality control knowledge to enhance the level of our future quality control managers, and selected those who ranked highly on the test as member candidates to lead the next generation at each business site. In fiscal 2020 we will offer our training course for quality management representative as a form of leader education in aiming to raise the bar.

R&D and Tech Day Held
On November 7, 2019 we held the “R&D and Tech day 2019” to share information about technology across the boundaries of the various departments and businesses that we operate with the aim of enhancing our overall Group-wide technological capabilities. More than 260 staff members from Japan and overseas, primarily from research departments, manufacturing-related departments, marketing, and sales participated in the meeting. The presentation was live streamed to eight business sites in Japan via the Internet, and viewed by more than 130 people.
 'Gemba Kaizen' Activity Presentation Meeting Held
On May 16, 2019, we held 'Gemba Kaizen' Activity Presentation Meeting 2019 as a venue for presenting successful outcomes of daily improvements at each business location. More than 110 employees, mainly those in production-related departments, attended. Just like with Tech Day, this was live-streamed to eight of our business sites in Japan via the internet, where it was viewed by 210 employees. Video of and materials from the presentation session were released over the intranet in the aim of laterally deploying examples of improvements.
Human Rights Education
Our company prohibits discrimination and harassment within Our Code of Conduct and other regulations, with this including at our group companies as well. We offer education related to our Code of Conduct when employees join the company, and promote awareness of human rights. We give consideration to and practically implement education to raise awareness of human rights that we as a company ought to address, and encourage each and every one of our employees to adopt a proper understanding when it comes to discrimination and various types of harassment out in society at large.
Every year, we provide education to all of our employees via e-learning to coincide with Human Rights Week in December. This deepens employees' understanding of typical types of harassment, including power harassment, sexual harassment, and maternity harassment, which are social problems, and teaches them points to be aware of to ensure that they do not perpetrate harassment. It has been designed to be a specific, easy-to- understand educational program that introduces employees to case studies and contact points to consult with in the event that they are harassed.
We recognize that the problem of harassment is a risk that is always liable to occur, regardless of the size of the workplace. But we will move ahead in creating spirited workplaces where it is easy to work and in which employees respect one another's individual character and human rights.

Health Management
Our company strives to create workplaces conducive to the maintenance of employees’ good health, both physical and mental. Our employee health management activities are primarily based on the results of regularly scheduled health checks. In particular, employees over 30 years old are entitled to receive cancer screening (stomach and colon) and those over 40 years old can receive abdominal ultrasonography as well. We offered health guidance to employees to help prevent lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. By ensuring that employees properly understand the results of health checks and receive timely diagnoses and guidance from in-house and external industrial physicians and other medical staff, the Company is contributing to the prevention or amelioration of lifestyle diseases. In addition, employees engaged in work that involves use of organic solvents and specified chemical substances receive special health checkups twice a year for early detection and prevention of health problems attributable to occupational diseases. We also provide opportunities for employees to receive health consultations at their own discretion with industrial medical staff who offer advice on physical and mental health issues. In order to promote health, we are strengthening employee education based on the
understanding that it is important for individual employees to be aware of prevention. With regard to mental health, for which detection at an early stage is deemed as important, education is provided to all employees and proves useful in the acquisition and enhancement of their knowledge. Furthermore, consultations with physicians are arranged once a year for employees who wish to undergo a stress check. The necessary measures are implemented based on the results of the examination, and efforts are made to improve the workplace environment based on the results of a group analysis. For employees suffering from mental health issues, measures are put in place in line with a support program designed to help them return to work and to prevent relapses through the concerted effort of their superiors, people in charge of labor affairs, industrial physicians, and healthcare staff.
We set up a special feature page in our company newsletter authored by our head industrial physician that provides seasonal and event-based health information useful for employees and their families to maintain and improve their health. The special feature on infectious diseases (influenza and norovirus) covered how to prevent them and what to do if an employee actually caught one to make this important information known to all employees.

Health Instruction with the Head Industrial Physician
As a part of the Data Health Plan, health classes are conducted with the aim of preventing serious illnesses, and to raise awareness among employees about health and improving their lifestyle habits. Employees performed exercises to release the physical stiffness in their bodies that occurs while working, such as aerobics and myofascial release through the use of stretch balls, at each business site. In addition, the employees were able to check on their own current physical condition through the introduction of sphygmomanometers and measurements of advanced glycation end products (AGES) in their bodies. A total of 285 employees across the entire company attended these classes, and many opinions were received from the participants to the effect that they would like to continue working on this.
Labor-Management Relations
Health Class
    We recognize that pleasant and satisfying working environments contribute to the development of the company, and therefore, good labor-management relations and the collaboration they engender are essential ingredients of such working environments. Currently, 100% of general employees from Sumitomo Bakelite and its domestic group companies are members of the Sumitomo Bakelite Union (hereafter, “the Union”). 54.1% of all employees are covered by the company’s collective bargaining agreement. Corporate-level meetings of the company’s senior executives and representatives of the Union are held twice a year at the head office. These meetings are valuable opportunities to cultivate favorable labor-management relationships by sharing frank views on the business environment and the Company’s operations. Major business sites also hold monthly labor-management meetings at which information about conditions in each department is shared. As for health and safety, we aim for creating safe and comfortable
workplaces through labor-management collaboration based on the provisions of the labor agreement. As part of this effort, we hold annual labor-management meetings on occupational health and safety by bringing the persons in charge of safety from the Union across Japan, to deepen mutual understanding through a frank exchange of opinions. We also recognize that occupational health and safety is an important theme to monitor between labor and management. At Sumitomo Bakelite along with its subsidiaries and affiliates with a labor union, provisions on health and safety are included in the labor agreements that establishes a formal agreement between the company and its labor union.
We are also putting effort into developing good labor-management relations at our overseas business sites. Currently, 15 out of 25 overseas business sites have labor unions; of these, 17 have concluded labor agreements, while 14 have established arrangements on safety and health.

    Relations with Local Communities Biodiversity Conservation Initiatives
 Our company’s business activities rely on nature’s bounty. Following the philosophy of our Responsible Care Activity Guideline, we recognize the importance of conserving biodiversity. As such, we are a promotion partner of “The Declaration of Biodiversity by Nippon Keidanren.” Understanding the importance of biodiversity outlined in the guidelines and reflecting it in the basic management stance, and following these declarations, we are promoting environmental impact
reductions, compliance with our procurement policy, and dialogue with communities through preservation activities at biotopes set up at some of our business locations. In terms of our initiatives during the product life cycle, we develop eco- friendly products, while outside of Japan we take part in local initiatives, including those that protect rare tree species.
These initiatives are approved, monitored, reviewed and modified by our Responsible Care Committee.
TOPIC
Biotope Initiatives
  The results of an investigation into the relationship between the business sites of our group worldwide and protected areas where biodiversity is considered important indicated that none of our business sites were located in these areas. Although not a protected area, the results of an ecosystem survey conducted in fiscal 2011 at the site of our Shizuoka Plant located in Fujieda City, Shizuoka Prefecture, confirmed the presence of Japanese killifish, an IA-rated endangered species. After determining the strong need for preserving the biodiversity of this site, we decided to create a company biotope. The creation and maintenance of the biotope were completed in March 2017. The biotope, which occupies about 5% of the Shizuoka Plant’s 287,000m2 site, is habitat for a wide variety of fauna and flora, including ancient Oga lotus and jewel beetles, among others, in addition to Japanese killifish.
We continue to engage in communication with local communities, such as by spreading the word on the significance of our biotope for biodiversity to the community and supplying some of the Japanese killifish that have taken root and multiplied within our biotope to neighboring locations.
Irodori no Oka (hill) Japanese killifish (Oryzias latipes)
The biotope received a total of 520 visitors in 2019. As a result of actively holding dialogues with neighboring elementary schools, particularly since 2018, we have expanded their understanding of our biotope. People visiting for school events and the like accounted for half of the visitors in 2019. Information about these internal and external initiatives is shared and managed at regular meetings of the Biotope Committee, comprising members from departments at the production plants and head office. In addition, our CSR activities centered on “Ikoi no Mori” (Comfort Forest) won the Chairperson’s Encouragement Award of the Japan Greenery Research and Development Center at the National Award for Factory Greening, which is sponsored by the Japan Greenery Research and Development Center (with the backing of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and other ministries and agencies).
Our goal for the future is to use this to contribute to the community, such as by making this a place for raising environmental awareness by having people who visit it get a firsthand feel for the importance of biodiversity, as well as a place for environmental education.

Initiative to Protect Forest Ecosystems
Our company contributes to conservation of biodiversity by protecting forest environments through supporting forest thinning projects and afforestation activities. Our company has supported forest thinning mainly in Iwate Prefecture since fiscal 2008 by expanding the use of Paper Products that Contribute to Forest Thinning Efforts promoted by the Morino Chonai-Kai (Forest Neighborhood Association). The cumulative amount of this paper used is approximately 70.3 tons, which corresponds to the thinning of 4.55 hectares.
Our business site in Indonesia engages in afforestation activities for growing mangrove forests that protect various species of marine organisms, and is also carrying out a biopori hole campaign to mitigate climate change. Going forward, we will continue to conserve
biodiversity tailored to the environment surrounding each of our business sites.

Support for Japan Inclusive Football Federation
We concluded a partnership agreement with the Japan Inclusive Football Federation (JIFF),*1 as an initiative from the standpoint of respect for diversity and contributing to the realization of a society where everyone can live in harmony. Based on this agreement, we provide support for the development of inclusive soccer sports.
We continued on with our partnership agreements in fiscal 2019, and provided support for the Japan Powerchair Football Championship 2019 that was held in November. Going forward,
we will continue to support this activity that broadly seeks to build a society in which people can intermingle and coexist through soccer regardless of their disabilities as an official partner.
*1 The Japan Inclusive Football Federation is an organization that brings together seven inclusive soccer sports associations. JIFF carries out activities under its commitment to create a vibrant society that respect’s each person’s uniqueness through the benefits of sports and soccer regardless of disability.

Environmental and Social Contribution Activities
We participate in an environmental survey program run by NPO Earthwatch Japan as a corporate partner, as part of its educational and social contribution activities as well as to expand the scope of these educational and social contribution activities. In fiscal 2019, we deployed employees out on research investigations to the East Japan Green Restoration Monitoring Project (which monitors and surveys the ecosystems of the regions affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake), a survey on tidal flats carried out in the tidal flats of Idoura in Sendai City and Hiroura in Natori City, Miyagi Prefecture in June.

     Comment from an Employee who Participated
Through this survey, I was able to actually come into contact with living creatures that I have little contact with in my ordinary, everyday life, such as endangered species of shellfish, and was thus able to learn about the diversity of the living creatures that inhabit tidal flats and other ecosystems, as well as the significance of their presence. What is more, I also had exchanges with the participants over the course of the two-day program, and was able to talk to people who had witnessed the earthquake and how the reconstruction has been going. I feel that it was an experience unlike any I'd had before.
The results of this survey showed that the tidal flats had been restored to a condition that compares favorably with how things were before the earthquake occurred. But for me, this reaffirmed the need for Sumitomo Bakelite to keep working on activities that are conducive to achieving the goals of the SDGs in order to ensure this sort of biodiversity.

 Message from Earthwatch Japan
Recently, large-scale disasters have been occurring as a result of abnormal weather phenomena even in places that are near at hand. There are a wide range of challenges we must deal with, such as climate change and the increasing fragility of our social infrastructure. Companies are being called upon more so than ever before to take part in activities that are conducive to solving these challenges.
Sumitomo Bakelite has been taking part in these survey activities in an ongoing manner for five years. We feel that these foster awareness grounded in science research and study, as well as understanding and interest in environmental conservation by harnessing this. Our hope is that this will give rise to a structure whereby employees who have taken part convey everything from their experiences to their feelings to others around them, thereby conveying this more broadly out to society.

 Donations
Under the Sumitomo Bakelite Group’s business philosophy (Company Policy), we cooperate on cultural and academic activities such as symphony orchestras, environmental conservation activities such as the Keidanren Committee on Nature Conservation that works to actively protect nature and conserve biodiversity, and international events such as the International Chemistry Olympiads (Details: URL on the right) in which senior high school students compete against one another to demonstrate their chemistry capabilities. We also donate directly to specific groups across a wide range of fields including schools and education, social welfare, academic
promotion, R&D, regional development, international exchange, and sports for people with disabilities. Through these donations, we are helping to create a better environment and support the development of the next generation.
Looking ahead, we will continue this support to create a brighter future for all people.

Official Partnership Agreement with Fujieda MYFC
Since fiscal 2018, we have been in an official partnership agreement with Fujieda MYFC, a professional soccer club in a J League J3. The team’s home town is the Haibara District of Fujieda City, Shizuoka Prefecture, where our Shizuoka Plant is located. Therefore, we provide our support to the team as a partner with the goal of lending our cooperation to Fujieda City, which promotes revitalization of the town through soccer, and also to contribute to the community and boost the motivation of our employees.
Relations with Local Residents and Participation in Local Events

Donating face shields
The Sumitomo Bakelite Group has begun manufacturing face shields in order to curb the spread of infections from the coronavirus. The first round of face shields we manufactured were donated to medical institutions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Region and Kanagawa Prefecture at the request of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in order to support facilities engaged in medical care that lacked devices to guard against infection. Following this, we began donating these to the governmental agencies in different regions in order for them to be put to use as safety measures for local communities by local municipalities where we have locations from the middle of May 2020.
These were donated to the cities of Fujieda, Amagasaki, and Nogata in May 2020, then to the cities of Akita, Utsunomiya, and Kanuma in June, where they were put to use in medical settings and health care centers in each of these regions.

Volunteer Activities by Promerus LLC
As part of its volunteer activities, Promerus lent its support to activities to provide food, sanitary supplies, cleaning supplies, and more to people living in poverty in northeastern Ohio, through which it collected 9,563 meals worth of food and provided them to a foodbank together with cleaning supplies. The foodbank then distributed this food, which would ordinarily have gone to waste, to where it was needed. This is consistent with "reducing food loss," which is called for as part of Goal 12 of the SDGs.

 Initiatives Relating to Fostering the Next Generation
   Support for Education of the Next Generation (Fujieda City Science Education Support Project)
We are taking the lead in providing support for the education of the next generation as part of an industry-government- academia partnership in cooperation with other companies with production plants located in and around Fujieda City, an initiative that has been ongoing since 2009.
In January 2020, the 11th Fujieda City Science Education Support Project was held at Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.’s Shizuoka Plant. A lively exchange was held among a large number of participants that included not only science teachers from public junior high schools in Fujieda City, but
also staff from the Education Department and Industrial Promotion Department of Fujieda City as well as employees from companies located in Fujieda City. Kaken Pharmaceutical introduced participants to the agrochemicals that are one major pillar of its business by combining together accurate information and practical demonstrations concerning their roles, effects, risks, and safety.
The principal in charge offered the comment, "Coming into contact with cutting-edge subject matter has a major impact on the subjects we highlight in class."

Executive Remuneration
The remuneration of Directors consists of monthly base pay and a bonus. The monthly base pay is fixed based on one’s job title, while the amount of the bonus is determined according to the Company’s consolidated business performance during the fiscal year, in order to raise Directors’ motivation to achieve the fiscal year business plan. The annual amount of the monthly base pay and bonus is determined within the total amount of remuneration approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting. The individual amounts of monthly remuneration paid to each position of Representative Director / Chairperson, as well as President, Senior Managing Executive Officer, Managing Executive Officer, and Executive Officer serving concurrently as Directors are set. Decisions on the amount of monthly remuneration paid to each individual Director are entrusted to the Representative Directors at the Board of Directors, with said decisions being based on the aforementioned payment criteria. The net amount to be paid for bonuses is calculated by multiplying a fixed multiplier against business profits, and the amount paid to each individual is
calculated by multiplying a fixed multiplier determined according to the person’s title. The net amount to be paid for bonuses is determined by the Board of Directors, allocations are entrusted to the Representative Directors, and decisions on these are made in accordance with the aforementioned payment criteria. Non-executive Outside Directors are only paid monthly base pay. The remuneration of Corporate Auditors consists of base pay (monthly pay). The net amount and the amounts paid to each individual are determined by consultations with the Corporate Auditors within the total amount of remuneration approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting.
Remuneration for executive officers in fiscal 2019 comprised a total of ¥370 million (base pay of ¥300 million and bonus of ¥70 million) for seven Directors (excluding Outside Directors), a total of ¥54 million (base pay of ¥54 million) for three Corporate Auditors (excluding Outside Corporate Auditors), and a total of ¥58 million (base pay of ¥58 million) for six Outside Officers.
Analyzing and Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
We conduct questionnaires regarding matters like the management of the Board of Directors on each Director and Corporate Auditor, then analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors based on the results of these questionnaires.
The results of the questionnaires are discussed by the Management Committee comprised of standing Directors, as well as the Board of Outside Executive Officers, with summaries provided to the Board of Directors.
Internal Control
We have systems in place for ensuring appropriate operations in accordance with our Business Philosophy. In accordance with our Basic Policy on Internal Control Systems drawn up by the Board of Directors in May 2006, we periodically review the systems and promote various activities to enhance internal control.
With respect to internal control over financial reporting, based on our Basic Rules and Regulations for Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we endeavor to enhance systems for ensuring the reliability of our financial reporting, appropriately operate internal control systems in terms of implementation, assessment, reporting, and correction, and ensure appropriate and timely disclosure of corporate information.

 Interview with Independent Outside Directors
Evolving Governance
to Become a Company that Can Succeed Globally
Role of outside directors and evolution of corporate governance
Abe: Each of our Outside Directors have different career trajectories. I was involved in science and technology-related fields for many years at a university and in government. Whereas conversely Director Matsuda came here after being involved in managing financial institutions and the manufacturing industry over many years. My view is that being able to advise the Company from our respective perspectives based on our entirely different careers is one of our essential roles.
Matsuda: That's exactly right. I believe that one important point when it comes to governance is making it possible for the company's management team, or its executive team, to hold open discussions on various challenges and targets from top to bottom. The member's opinions from their different perspectives provides the backdrop to such discussions. The same holds true at the Board of Directors, which constitutes the top of the company's management. It is here that I want to use my career to be of service.
Abe: Prior to holding meetings of its Board of Directors, the Company holds meetings of its Outside Officer’s Meeting. At these, we receive explanations regarding the pressing challenges faced by the Company and themes that ought to be addressed, which last a considerably long time. Only after satisfactory understanding has been reached by those of us who are outside executives is the matter taken up by the Board of Directors, and so I feel that the Company has set in place a structure that allows for meaningful discussions. Yet in reality there is still little in the way of discussions by the Board of Directors. My hope is that the Directors within the Company will proactively offer their remarks.
Matsuda: The Company could currently be said to be at the stage where it is exploring how it ought to handle corporate governance. Some time has passed since Japanese companies began grappling with corporate governance. In this period the Company has differed from the Western model in that it has built up its own infrastructure for corporate governance suited to itself. The Outside Officer’s Meeting is one example of this. Moving forward, I feel that we should continue to evolve this infrastructure while keeping an eye on developments in the wider world. The next step in this evolution would be invigorating our discussions.
Abe: The Company has inherited the Business Philosophy of the Sumitomo Group, and has set forth its Company Policy as being to live up to the enormous trust placed in it by society and engage in sound management without getting overly caught up in short-term profits. This approach of inheriting outstanding elements created by our predecessors and paving the way to the future by improving upon them step by step is truly amazing.

Matsuda: In order to further boost the transparency and effectiveness of the Board of Directors, I would like to see the executives more clearly convey their decision-making process. I would even be happy if they just did this for their process for important matters. I have already consulted with the Chairman and the President over this quite a bit, which has led to steady improvements over a number of years. Abe: This is extremely important. In particular, this point becomes problematic when significant changes are encountered. Since taking up my position as an Outside Director, as a result of all of our daily efforts, there have not been any scandals or similar incidents that rattled management. If such a situation were to arise, the Outside Directors would be held responsible. We simply cannot plead ignorance of such matters.
Matsuda: To be sure, information sharing is something I would like for us to promote more as a means of risk management for governance. Doing so would allow us to more forcefully play the role required of us as Outside Directors in terms of acting as a check on management.
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Company
Matsuda: As Director Abe just mentioned, I also feel that the fact that we have inherited the heritage of the Sumitomo Group is one of the Company's major strengths. The mentality that "Our company places prime importance on trust and sureness" is widespread among the employees, every one of whom are outstanding people. Yet while this is a strength, at the same time it can also pose a weakness.
Abe: Exactly. The fact that steady management has been carried out thus far in partnership with the employees is an extremely significant positive factor. I feel that the management team absolutely cherishes the employees. At the same time, nobody knows just what might occur amidst such turbulent globalism. Groups with the advantage of being well organized tend to not stick out. So for this reason, while both Director Matsuda, who is cut from a different cloth, and myself both bear heavy responsibility, my (Abe's) competence would be called into question.
Matsuda: We must respond to globalism from a governance dimension as well. The scope of the Company’s overseas businesses is enormous, and we engage in M&A as well. It is relatively easy to build a consensus within Japan due to the lack of language and cultural barriers, but this is not the case overseas. Yet at the same time, our partnerships with overseas employees and business partners present us the opportunity to incorporate a diverse array of values. I feel that setting in place a global governance structure is the next challenge that the Company should tackle. At any rate, Japanese companies have a tendency to dedicate both time and resources to setting targets. "Setting targets" could result
in "achieving targets", and then the plan-do-check-action (PDCA) cycle does not work well. Therefore, recently the plan at the Company has been to try to navigate this via OODA.*1 I feel that performing monitoring to ensure that we can take the helm of a flexible style of management suited to these challenging times and environmental changes in response to changes and discontinuities is an important role of us Outside Directors.
Abe: In our capacity as Outside Directors, both of us will continue working to resolve such challenges.
*1 A theory for engaging in decision-making via a loop of: observe, orient, decide, and act. The theory was originally proposed for military movements. It was theorized based on decision-making processes for responding in an ad-hoc manner, quickly and appropriately under uncertain and unpredictable conditions.

Risk Management Risk Management Structure
Our risk management structure is described below.
● Risk Management Committee
The Committee identifies major risks that could have a serious impact on our business performance, confirms the validity of response measures to major risks, and gives instructions on what additional measure should be considered to our departments that oversee risk and each department. In fiscal 2019, the Risk Management Committee convened on five occasions to take up matters such as identifying major risks, measures against quality complaints, and measures to enhance our culture of safety.
● Departments that oversee risk
When it comes to risk oversight, the departments that oversee risk draft and promote response measures for our Group
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)
Of the foreseeable disasters and accidents that could occur, we regard earthquakes; explosions, fires, and leaks; storm and flood damage, and pandemics as major emergencies. We prepare BCPs designed to ensure the continuity of business when such emergencies occur, and shares these with our clients as needed. What is more, we have also taken measures such as ensuring adequate inventories of products and raw materials, ensuring redundancy with our production systems, augmenting our supplies of spare parts, and
Information Security
We retain an extensive array of personal information on customers, shareholders, employees, and others. In addition to personal information, we also retain trade secrets and other confidential information relating to our business partners. All of this information in our possession is important and must be protected. Therefore, we are committed to ensuring that this information is never leaked.
We also have measures in place to address computer security incidents (cyber attacks, phishing sites, illegal access, malware infections, and others) in order to prevent information leakages and improve the security of the information systems we operate. In order to strengthen our countermeasures against cyber attacks, in fiscal 2019 we upgraded the OS software on our in-house computers from an older version to the newest version. We also enhanced checks on unauthorized sites when browsing outside websites and strengthened measures against irregularities when work is performed by outsourcing contractors. In addition, to improve employee awareness of information security, we sent out information security trends and alerts, handed out additional information security handbooks, and offered security education, among other efforts.
as a whole by coordinating with our various departments. These departments that oversee risk include the Corporate General Affairs Division, Personnel Division, Corporate Finance & Planning Division, Corporate Production Management & Engineering Division, Corporate Research & Development Division, Information Systems & Data Processing Department, Global Procurement Division, and more.
● Each operating department
Each operating department, which includes the sales departments, plants, research and development departments, and more at our Company and our group companies, take various different measures to properly manage risks that arise in the course of performing the duties of their sections and their company as part of their essential duties.
systematizing our restoration structures.
We recognize that the frequency with which disasters and incidents that we regard as major emergencies occur, as well as the magnitude and extent of their impacts, is changing every year as a result of advances in science and technology and the effects of climate change. As such, every year we verify the adequacy of our BCPs based on the latest information. Moving forward, we will continue to reassess our BCPs and provide training.
We have established the Computer Security Incident Response Team of Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. (SUMIBE-CSIRT). Under both normal circumstances and when incidents arise, SUMIBE- CSIRT works together with the Corporate General Affairs Division, Information Systems & Data Processing Department, Personnel Division, Intellectual Property Department, and other relevant departments to respond to information security incidents.

Compliance Compliance System
We emphasize compliance because we recognize that adherence to laws and corporate ethics is integral to the conduct of business.
We established the Compliance Committee to minimize the risks of compliance violations at our Group, promote the creation of structures for compliance, and to promote activities to raise awareness of compliance.
In fiscal 2019 the Compliance Committee was convened three times, where it took up matters such as security trade controls and our internal whistleblower system.
Code of Conduct for Employees
We make efforts to inform our employees of our Business Philosophy in which our business principal is shown, and Our Group's Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, such as by offering e-learning on a regular basis or having employees read this aloud from pamphlets in their workplace. Our Group's Code of Business Ethics and Conduct is consist of specific standards of conduct and explanations for Our Code of Conduct, which was enacted to serve as standards of conduct that our officers and employees must adhere to when carrying out their duties.
The current version of Our Group's Code of Business Ethics and
Articles for Emphasis in Compliance
Workplaces in each department apply compliance to daily operations, decide on the key items for compliance and each prepare Articles for Emphasis in Compliance. Although the Articles differ among workplaces, they are displayed
Compliance Education Using Cartoons
Every month, our internal publication contains a fourframe cartoon about compliance under the title “The Way to Become a Compliance Master.” This cartoon explains compliance in an easy-to-follow style. Past cartoons have been compiled into two booklets, which were distributed to employees to raise awareness of compliance.

Conduct was revamped in October 2017, taking into account our measures for CS promotion, SBPS, quality control, health and safety, as well as the latest worldwide trends in legal compliance. It has also been translated into seven languages.
The booklet on Our Group's Code of Business Ethics and Conduct
 prominently and confirmed with all employees periodically by having them read aloud in unison. Our group companies, in Japan and overseas, also undertake similar activities.
Mamoru-kun joined the company 18 years ago. He’s a very active mid-level employee, and everyone relies on him. Mamoru-kun is able to offer appropriate advice throughout the company as a compliance master, which is especially appreciated given the spate of corporate scandals hitting Japan recently.

▶ Flow of the Whistleblower System Internal Contact Point
External Contact Point
assessments are conducted from the standpoint of whether the operations of departments are in compliance with relevant laws and conform to various standards. Departments where issues are identified are required to submit written reports detailing actions taken to resolve the issues.
In fiscal 2019, compliance auditing and assessment was conducted from the standpoints of environment, human rights, occupational health and safety, provision and use of products and services, management of customer information and data, proper accounting, and fair trade, with no significant violations of laws or regulations.
Internal Whistleblower System
We have established an internal whistleblower system (which コンプhラasイbアeeンnスd委es員ign会ated the “Compliance Whistleblower Sy執st行em役"員
at our Group). Under this system, employees can report to an internal contact point (GM of the Internal Audit Department) or an external contact point (Legal Counsel) when they have discovered a compliance violation or suspect there may have been such a violation, in an effort to promptly detect and preemptively prevent compliance violations. The privacy of whistleblowers is rigorously protected to ensure that they are not placed at a disadvantage as a consequence of reporting violations.
In fiscal 2019 there were two cases reported to the Compliance
Whistleblower System. The results of our investigations revealed
that there were no major violations to laws and ordinances, such
fraud, bribery or corruption, or the Antitrust Act, nor were there any cases that could have a significant negative impact on society. Both cases were dealt with appropriately.
Moreover, some of our group companies have established their own unique internal whistleblower systems, which are

In fiscal 2019 there were 120 cases reported to these unique internal whistleblower systems at these group companies. The results of investigations revealed that there were no major violations to laws and ordinances, such as violations to laws against child labor, forced labor, accounting fraud, bribery or corruption, or antitrust laws, nor were there any cases that could have a significant negative impact on society. All of these cases were dealt with appropriately.

Procurement Initiatives Basic Approach
We strive to ensure compliance with the laws, regulations, and social norms of Japan and the other countries and regions in which it operates. We also require our business partners to observe these standards of fulfilling their social responsibilities given the changing social expectations placed in companies. In principle, we conclude a basic contract with each business partner we purchase from, which requires the contracting parties to fulfill their corporate social responsibilities (CSR). Our criteria for selecting business partners include their CSR and environmental impact reduction initiatives.
The Global Procurement Division is in overall charge of the purchasing of raw materials, fuel, and equipment for use at our Company’s plants and our Group companies worldwide. Our procurement policy and Green Procurement Guidelines are posted on the Company’s website. The procurement policy is now published in Japanese, English, and Chinese. Given the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)*1 Code of Conduct (formerly the EICC Code of Conduct) and changing frameworks for general business dealings, we are working
CSR Survey of Suppliers
We conduct CSR surveys on our suppliers. In fiscal 2019, we conducted a BCP survey related to the risks of disasters to major raw materials on 96 of our domestic suppliers. The results of the survey indicated that we have 22 suppliers operating in high-risk regions based on hazard maps that have not formulated BCPs. In fiscal 2020, for these 22 suppliers we plan to confirm their BCP measures, including their responses to the social impact that could potentially arise during typhoons and flooding, and will consult with them over their response measures if these are found to be inadequate. In addition, we
Selection of Business Partners
When selecting new business partners, the decision to commence transactions is made based on fair and impartial judgment after applying the criteria established by the Global Procurement Division. When commencing transactions, we check whether the Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors applies and if it does, we commence the transaction in accordance with this law and the relevant company rules. If we find that this law applies to existing transactions, we immediately take measures to ensure the legality of these transactions under this law.
to observe this policy in our procurement activities, and we require our business partners to do the same, too.

● Action for Stable Procurement
The Global Procurement Division takes a variety of measures, including auditing materials manufactures to ensure stable supply.
● Procurement Crisis Management
The Global Procurement Division prepares a list of locations of materials manufacturers and keeps it up to date. In the event of a disaster, the division checks the statuses of manufacturers’ factories in the affected areas and formulates countermeasures.
conducted surveys on the status of initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions of 36 of our main domestic suppliers. Based on the results of these surveys, we had seven companies that did not calculate their CO2 emissions and eight companies that did not set reduction targets for said emissions. To promote reductions of CO2 emissions in partnership with our suppliers, for fiscal 2020 we will continue to strengthen said partnerships, particularly with these suppliers, based on the results of this survey. We will also continue to expand similar initiatives out to our overseas business sites and suppliers.
We have established company rules requiring that we check whether new raw materials comply with chemical substance controls both domestically and internationally, and new raw materials are not adopted unless they conform to these controls. Relevant departments internally work closely together to investigate and make sure that the Company does not violate chemical substance controls.
We are convinced that it is important to establish a relationship of equals based on trust with every business partner and that the transactions should be beneficial to both parties.

 *1 “Business profit” is calculated by deducting “cost of sales” and “selling, general and administrative expenses” from “revenue”.
*2 As the share consolidation of each 5 shares of common shares into 1 share was exercised effective on October 1, 2018, “equity attributable to owners of parent per share” and “basic earnings per share” is calculated with the assumption that the share consolidation had exercised at the
beginning of fiscal 2017. “Cash dividends per share” for fiscal 2018 is calculated with taking such share consolidation into consideration.

We are working hard to reduce our environmental impact, such as through our activities to conserve energy through solar power, in order to contribute to achieving the society aimed for by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a research laboratory, we work to develop products that are both environmentally-friendly and people-friendly from the design stage onward.
We are committed to giving back to the community, while promoting engagement and disclosure of information needed for the community to develop a correct understanding of our operations.
We are pursuing initiatives to reduce the environmental burden of all our processes (including conserving energy and reducing MFCA, etc.). The biotope opened to the general public for the three year and welcomed 520 visitors, an increase over the number of visitors from the previous year, thereby contributing to both biodiversity preservation and environmental education. In fiscal 2020, we will continue to promote SDG-contributing products and LCA for standard products, and to advance our efforts to be an environmentally-friendly plant.
We aim to be a plant that is trusted by customers and the local community through our products featuring a variety of functions and designs that cater to everyday living and industrial use. Our activities this fiscal year featured a particular focus on energy conservation in reducing environmental impacts and reducing MFC by half. Our entire staff is committed to occupational health and safety with the cooperation of those both inside and outside the plant. We will continue to focus on product development and manufacturing with an emphasis on the SDGs (Sumitomo Spirit).
We are pursuing initiatives whereby all of our employees work on occupational health and safety activities and environmental impact reduction activities in the hopes of contributing to realizing the society that the SDGs aim to achieve. When it comes to occupational health and safety, through our activities based on our Safety Principles: Prioritizing Safety in Everything We Do and our three principles for safe conduct, we will continue to ensure zero accidents and injuries, conserve energy as a means of promoting a reduction of our environmental impact, and institute systematic mitigations through MFCA. By doing these activities, we aspire to be a plant that is trusted by both customers and the local community.
Everyone at this plant takes part in addressing activities to lessen our environmental impact across our various processes, spanning from the development of products through to their disposal, in order to contribute to achieving the society aimed for by the SDGs. Continuing on, our aim is to ensure transparency in our activities and to be a business site that is trusted by our customers and the local community.

We work to address a number of activities to lessen our environmental impact in order to contribute to achieving the society aimed for by the SDGs.

In 2019, we were able to obtain a Class II grade from a review of our safety standardization by Jiangsu Province. While we had been working towards acquiring this certification and reaching the record of one million hours without an accident, unfortunately in March 2020 we suffered an occupational accident resulting in lost workdays at our manufacturing site. Each workplace, together with our departmental general managers and other managers, will work to establish safe workplaces in order to preemptively prevent accidents from occurring in the future by clarifying the nature of this accident.

Safety remains a top priority for the Niagara Falls site at 2020, with a continued emphasis on job observations and ergonomic improvements. We continue to look for ways to minimize waste generation for the site and reduce the environmental impact on our community. Our focus on quality will continue with emphais on procedure updates and employee training.
Safety continues to be a main focus for the plant. We had three recordable injuries in FY2019 which is unacceptable. North America corporate-wide we are looking to establish a "Safety First" cultural shift. Safety is top priority.Waste generation remains a challenge. We did however do some work and our air emissions are now within government regulations.
2019 has been a year of transition for Promerus. We have been preparing for our exit from our current facility in Brecksville and for a move to our new facility in Akron. The exit from Brecksville has required us to undertake many non-routine activities including the demolition of our pilot plant. This has required a sharper focus on reviews for non-routine work. We are also reviewing and revising safety policies that will be used in Akron. In 2019, there were no safety incidents or environmental releases.
Vaupell Northwest continues to refine standards and practices to ensure that we act in a socially responsible fashion. With renewed emphasis on the safety and wellbeing of our employees and our neighbors we are committed to the highest standards of performance. Further, we are committed to ensuring that these standards perpetually remain fundamental to our business.

In 2019, a very important target has been the new ERP implementation (SAP), which has started to get the desired fruits. To remark also the implementation of ISO 45001 (replacement OHSAS 18001). Along 2019 the automotive crisis has touched all the levels of the supply chain, but the most critical crisis started ending FY 2019, COVID-19, which is going to change the live style worldwide and is re-affirming that Safety is absolutely First.
In FY2020 safety and housekeeping remains our top priorities. The LMRA is embedded now in the organisation, but unfortunately we had 3 LTA's that despite the injuries were not critical. The cokes line was upgraded which gave a positive boost in the uptime. VNV put also a lot of energy into management of direct operator cost, which ended up almost in target.

Definitions/Calculation Method
  CO2 emissions and energy consumption (crude oil equivalent)
(4) External recycling (expenses paid): waste recycled with payment made to cover processing costs (including energy recovery)
Valuable materials
The volume of valuable materials that are generated at business sites and sold and that are neither products nor raw materials.
Material loss
Total of the volume of waste generated and the volume of valuable materials. Waste generated owing to the retirement of facilities, repairs, building demolition (in-house demolition work), etc., is not included in the scope of waste, nor is dismantling scrap material of value sold, facilities resold, or construction material waste (for which a manifest is issued by the Company).
Chemical substance emissions
Total emissions into the air, bodies of water, and the ground (aggregate volume) of chemical substances targeted by the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA)’s Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) assessments (including substances subject to the reporting requirements of “The Act on Confirmation, etc. of Release Amounts of Specific Chemical Substances in the Environment and Promotion of Improvements to the Management Thereof” of Japan [PRTR system]). The emissions calculation method used is based on the latest Manual for Calculating PRTR Emissions (Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry). JCIA changed the chemical substances subject to survey in fiscal 2013 and the Group reflected the change in the overall results from fiscal 2014 onward. Major substances that were excluded from the scope of calculation include ammonia and sulfuric acid.
The calculation of CO2 emissions and energy consumption covers energy (fuel, heat, electricity, etc.) associated with all business activities. CO2 emissions are calculated based on the Manual for Calculating and Reporting Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; April 2019). For city gas and electricity, the coefficient for each business released by each company is used. Energy consumption is calculated as a crude oil equivalent based on the Act on the Rational Use of Energy. Overseas business locations use the applicable domestic laws of each country. In the calculation of CO2 emissions, the latest conversion coefficient at the start of the fiscal year of each Natural gas and electricity provider supplying each business site is used for city gas and electricity. In case the emissions coefficient of the electricity provider is unknown, the coefficient as of the start of each fiscal year for which data is released by the International Energy Agency is used.
In addition, Our company does not emit any greenhouse gases (CH4, H2O, HFC, SF6, NF3) other than CO2 that meet the reporting requirements of Act on Promotion of Global Warning Countermeasures.
Waste generated
Total of aggregate volume of industrial and general waste from business sites. Definitions of each type of waste are as follows.
(1) Landfill: waste disposed of in landfills by the Company or outsourced
contractors
(2) External intermediate processing: waste incinerated or treated by other
means by outsourced contractors (without energy recovery)
(3) Internal intermediate processing: waste incinerated or treated by other
means in-house (without energy recovery)

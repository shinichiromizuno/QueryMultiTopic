Cover tape for electrical components
12.5 Substantially reduce waste
This is a tape used to carry semiconductor packages and electrical components to the surface mount process. Through innovations in the tape's design and production processes, we were able to substantially reduce the electricity and solvents used during its production. In addition, making the tape itself as thin as possible contributes to cutting down on waste.

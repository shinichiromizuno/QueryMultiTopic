Chemical Substance Management
 Chemical Substance Management throughout Product Life Cycles
 The targets for 2020 agreed upon at the WSSD*1 call for the worldwide and comprehensive management of chemical substances throughout the product life cycle, from development to manufacturing, use and disposal, by 2020 in order to minimize the significant adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by the manufacture and use of chemical substances. Following this trend, the regulatory environment is changing, as new regulations on the management of chemical substances have been established not only in Europe and the United States, but also in Asian countries since 2015.
In September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted at the U.N. Summit. They comprise 17 goals and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030 to create a sustainable
Chemical Substance Management System
We are focussing on promoting the use of SDSs*2 across the Group not only for disclosing information related to chemical substances under regulatory control in Japan and overseas, but also for disclosing relevant information voluntarily so as to improve the quality of the Group’s information disclosure practices. Particularly for the GHS*3 system, we have introduced MSDgen.*4 and offer SDS and labels that are compliant with the laws and regulations of 40 countries, including Japan, in the official languages of each country. In 2019, we revised our SDS to accommodate the new additions to Taiwan's Priority Management Chemicals and the U.S.’ TSCA Active Inventory.
*2,3,4 See the glossary on page 108.
Chemical Substance Management System
In the interest of ensuring safety, we confirm that all of the chemical substances constituting the raw materials and products handled by the Group conform with the laws and regulations of each country. We are also making progress with the creation of a Chemical Substance Management System to centrally manage these chemical substances. Introducing this system allows us to speed up chemical substance- related investigations (inventory in each country, the safety of products and raw materials, regulatory information, etc.) and to provide accurate information. We are now rolling out the system to plants that manufacture molded articles*17 and expanding application of volume tracking management to products for Taiwan and South Korea, in addition to Japan’s Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture and Industrial Safety and Health Act as well as Europe’s REACH.*18 We will continue to enhance our
world. Aimed at achieving the SDGs in 2030, the governments of each country have begun taking proactive actions. The Group (each of our plants and research institutes worldwide) is working on the SDGs through the management of chemicals carried out as part of our Responsible Care activities.
In terms of its management of chemical substances, the Group has a system in place for studying and reviewing chemical substance-related laws and regulations in Japan and throughout the world from the product development phase onward. We manage the chemical substances contained in products in order to comply with the laws of the countries where we operate and to minimize environmental impacts throughout product life cycles.

Reducing Risk Relating to New Business
There is a need to improve (optimize) the output quality (degree of perfection) of product designs and process designs when developing new products and to shorten (minimize) the time required for the development process by minimizing rework.
❶ Shortening New-Product Development Periods and Improving Work Quality
In new product development, initial plans are often delayed
because of the tendency for a variety of problems requiring
reworking to arise. To prevent this, we implement the Plan-Do-
Check-Action (PDCA) cycle to increase the degree of perfection
of design quality and shorten the development period through
and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to predict potential failures or abnormalities by analyzing health and safety risks on people including customers related to our products, along with Design Review Based on Failure Mode (DRBFM) that focuses on changes to the design and changes to conditions and the environment. In turn, we implement risk reduction measures
in all processes of DR, FMEA and DRBFM as well as during technical verification at the time of using new raw materials.
In addition, we use Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) that rationally analyzes accidents and defects in a hierarchical manner to discover root causesSaumnitdomofuBankdeliatemCoe., Lntdt. a(inlclsudoinlguGtrioupncsomfpoanriespirneJavpeannantdinovgerseas) recurrence.

on the audits, inadequate skills of the auditors, and a lack of information provided beforehand.
Furthermore, the internal audits conducted by each business site focused on the management system, and It was not possible to successfully link the activities from the extraction of essential issues to the prevention of recurrence and prevention. Therefore, in order to resolve these problems, we built an audit system (combining ‘Monozukuri’ Audits and internal audits)
that is able to identify the root issues in each business site,
education and instruction (including accompanying auditors onsite where necessary) were provided as a way to foster internal auditor leaders at business sites within Japan in order to strengthen our internal audits.
The findings from internal audits and ‘Monozukuri’ Audits consist of essential issues and items that could lead to essential issues. We have largely succeeded in achieving the functionality to deduce these essential issues. What is more, we have disclosed the findings from other business sites to ten of the audited business sites, had each of them perform self-inspections on their own sites, and make corrections and improvements where needed in order to roll out risk reductions laterally.
For fiscal 2020, we will continue working to improve the skills of auditors by training them as a way to enhance “combining 'Monozukuri' Audits and internal audits,” thereby aiming to further improve the effectiveness of our audits.

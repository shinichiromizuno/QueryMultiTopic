This is used in catheterization (a minimally invasive treatment) to treat hepatocyte cancer. Since the tip moves freely without any guide wires, it can quickly and reliably arrive at the affected blood vessel. As a result, this enables more precise surgeries to be conducted in a shorter time span compared with cases where traditional catheters are used.
There is little in the way of physical burden on the patient, and since patients can be rehabilitated and rejoin society quicker than they could if they had undergone surgical procedures involving an incision to the abdomen, this contributes to the economic underpinnings that serve as a basis for economic growth.

Environmental Performance
Reducing Energy Use and CO2 Emissions
Regarding energy usage at our business sites in Japan, our per production amount value rose slightly due to the decrease in production. As for CO2 emissions, both emissions and per production amount value are on a downward trajectory, but we expect that our emissions will increase slightly in 2020 due to the recovery of production and the emissions coefficient of our energy suppliers.
At our overseas business sites, both our energy consumption and CO2 emissions declined from the previous year, but our per production amount value increased due to the decrease in production. As we expect production to recover in 2020 we anticipate that our energy consumption will increase, but we anticipate reductions in CO2 based on our efforts to achieve this.

Disclosure of Scope 3*3 Data
In 2015, our Group began calculating and disclosing Scope 3 emissions in the supply chain of business sites belonging to Group companies in Japan because of the growing importance of understanding CO2 emissions covering the entire supply chain. In fiscal 2018, we enlarged the scope to cover overseas business sites. The scope of said disclosures cover a total of eight categories including Category 1 “Purchased goods and services.” In addition, we confirmed that three categories including Category 8 “Upstream leased assets” are not applicable.
Similar to past years, Category 1 “Purchased goods and services” accounted for a large portion of CO2 emissions, and this includes the portion from overseas. However, emissions have been declining since fiscal 2018 due to the drop in purchase volumes, primarily at overseas business sites. Moving forward, we will continue to calculate and disclose data on other categories and work to increase the accuracy of the data for each category, while also promoting ongoing efforts to reduce CO2 emissions across the entire supply chain. *3 See the glossary on page 108.

* Data covers all the business sites in Japan and Oversea listed on page 3.
Calculation method:
We calculated the amount of emissions in accordance with the Basic Guidelines on Accounting for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Throughout the Supply Chain Ver. 3 issued by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan, using the emission coefficient stated in the basic database IDEA Ver. 2.3 Carbon Footprint Communication Program developed jointly by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and the Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry as well as the Emissions Intensity Database for Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Organizations through the Supply Chain
*1 Energy usage per production amount value is determined using the following equation:
Energy usage per production amount value = energy usage/(production amount x unit price) Energy consumption is calculated as a crude oil equivalent.
*2 CO emissions per production amount value are determined using the following equation: 2
CO2 emissions per production amount value = CO2 emissions/(production amount x unit price) Also, CO2 emissions are the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
See the business sites listed on page 3 about the boundary.

Conservation of Water Resources
When it comes to the water used at our Group's locations,
in Japan a large share of the water used comes from
groundwater, while overseas a large share of this comes from
waterworks. The water used in our plants in Japan accounts
for 84% of the water used by the entire Group.
retroactively back to 2005. There were no changes to the overall trends from this. Furthermore, it also came to light that there were errors in the method by which water was being aggregated at Vaupell's Ballard & Everett Plant, and so this was corrected starting from the aggregation of fiscal 2019 figures.

  Assessment of Water-Related Risk in Fiscal 2019
Since fiscal 2015, we have been continuously surveying the regional watershed risk of all major plants in the Group (11 sites in Japan and 24 sites overseas). Continuing on from fiscal 2018, in fiscal 2019 there were significant changes to the WRI Aqueduct*1 tool. While the risk level for our business sites in Japan fell, conversely the risk level for districts in China worsened.

Our Group revised risk levels based on the results of WRI studies and independent studies performed on each business site. We compiled the results into a table that contains the risks facing each of the regions in which the Group operates. Using these results, going forward, we will continue working to preserve water resources more effectively.

Soil/Underground Water Pollution Countermeasures
Response to Soil/Underground Water Pollution
Our Group carries out risk assessments relating to leakage of chemical substances at all of our business sites, and we promote both the development and implementation of preventive frameworks. At the same time, when contamination caused by past leakage accidents is confirmed, we actively undertake voluntary surveys and institute countermeasures in order to prevent the environmental impact and health damage from spreading.
We did not suffer any severe leakage accidents in fiscal 2019.
▶ Results of Soil and Groundwater Studies, Related Actions, and Monitoring ResultsSiteResults of InvestigationCountermeasures and monitoring resultsAmagasaki PlantLead was detected by soil content sampling in 2009 and 2010 (max. 500 mg/kg whereas the standard is 150 mg/kg). No groundwater contamination was detected.Heavy metals exceeding the standard values of the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act were detected at the business sites on the left. Monitoring of the groundwater is conducted at these sites every year and their contamination levels have been confirmed to be below standard values.Akita Sumitomo BakeliteLead was detected by soil elution sampling in 2005 (max. 0.032 mg/L whereas the standard is 0.01 mg/L). No groundwater contamination was detected.Yamaroku Kasei IndustryIn January 2016, 1,4-Dioxane in excess of the standard concentrations was detected in the company's cooling water effluent, with concentrations of a similar amount confirmed in well water drawn from on the premises that had been used. In consultation with the government, the plant stopped drawing water and switched to a closed water cooling system. The company has no history of using the substance in question.The company cooperates with an ongoing monitoring survey of the groundwater quality that is regularly conducted by Osaka Prefecture, and also continues to perform independent examinations as well. The latest measurement results were 1.48mg/L (standard value of 0.05mg/L).Initiatives for resource recycling
Marine plastics
When it comes to the problem of marine plastics, we are moving ahead with activities to contribute to reducing plastic marine waste via a number of initiatives based on the Japanese government’s Plastic Resource Recycling Strategy. These initiatives include managing the raw materials used and the plastic products we manufacture, promoting the recycling of said products, and developing new products.
We are currently taking part in the Japan Initiative for Marine Environment (JaIME), which was established by major companies and industry organizations in the chemical industry, as well as the Clean Ocean Material Alliance (CLOMA), which was established by a broad range of business operators related to supply chains for plastic products, including those in the chemical industry and distribution/retail industries, with the goal of forming cross-industry partnerships. Through this, we are working to address a variety of challenges by aiming to curb plastic waste across our supply chain as a whole and promoting recycling via 3R activities for plastic products.
Recycling
Our Group promotes recycling as a means to make effective use of resources. This recycling includes the recovery and recycling of phenol from waste liquid produced by phenolic resin reactions during the product production process, fine grinding of offcuts from phenolic laminated sheets and decorative melamine resin laminate for use as a filler in phenolic resin molding compounds reuse of molded article by-products (sprues and runners) as raw material for molding materials, as well as reuse of excess sludge from activated sludge effluent treatment equipment as compost (organic fertilizer).

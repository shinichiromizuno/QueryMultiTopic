  Improving battery performance and achieving lighter-weight vehicle bodies are essential when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles. Switching the metal parts used in the brakes and engines of automobiles to phenolic molding compounds and molded parts makes it possible to reduce the weight of the vehicle bodies. Our Company's phenolic molding compounds and molded parts are made using our proprietary technologies for developing and processing materials that capitalize on the unique qualities of phenolic resin, which is a thermoset resin. With these, we have been able to boost the performance of parts, particularly those placed under thermal load and those for which dimensional accuracy is required.

We are also making continuous efforts to employ new graduates with disabilities by, for example, accepting students with disabilities for internships so as to provide them with opportunities that suit their conditions and workstyle needs. These initiatives are approved, monitored, reviewed and modified by our Responsible Care Committee.

Work-Life Balance Our Position on Work-Life Balance
We promote the creation of workplaces conducive to successful work-life balance of employees.
In 2008, we formed its Work-Life Balance Labor Study Group to consider the options, formulate policies and commence their implementation. The objectives are:
❶ To promote flexible approaches to work, while also reducing overtime hours and promoting the full use of annual leave entitlements, and encourage employees to devote the additional time available to worthwhile non-work activities, such as educational pursuits and activities related to family and communities.
❷ To offer a greater diversity of working styles that benefit employees who must deal with major life events, such as marriage, childbirth, and child rearing, and thus contribute to nurturing the next generation.
In 2013, we expanded the application requirements to allow use for participation in volunteer activities and use in half-day increments to make it easier to use accumulated annual paid vacation. In 2014, we increased the number of days of leave for those attending the birth of their child from three days to five days. In 2016, we eliminated the number of days of accumulated annual paid vacation attached to family care leave and in 2017 we introduced a half-day leave system for days off in lieu.
In 2018, we began to allow employees to apply accumulated annual paid vacation in one-day increments for infertility treatment and cancer treatment. As for annual paid vacation, in 2011 we expanded the number of days of accumulated annual paid vacation (annual unused paid vacation days accrued) that may be carried over from 30 to 40 days, before further expanding this to 60 days in January 2020. We also adopted a system for annual time off based on hourly increments in January 2020.
We will continue to implement such initiatives as part of efforts to further promote better work-life balance.
▶ Number of Overtime Hours Worked and Days of Paid Leave Taken by Regular Employees
* “Regular employees” means our company (non-consolidated basis) personnel working during daytime hours, excluding managerial personnel.
Employee Support for Various Life Events
We are focusing on creating an environment in which our employees can achieve their goals for both work and life events (such as childbirth and childcare). We are also encouraging employees to proactively utilize various programs provided by our Group to help them deal with important life events, and since the implementation of childcare leave and nursing care leave programs, the proportion of employees returning to work after taking childcare or nursing leave has
been almost 100%. The number of people who took childcare leave in fiscal 2019 came to five women and two men, while nobody took nursing care leave.

  Feedback from a user of our system
I took childcare leave after the birth of our third child to support my wife
After the birth of our first son (our third child), I was able to take approximately one month of childcare leave starting from January 2020. When our first and second daughters were born it was still uncommon for men to take childcare leave, and the thought that I could even do so never occurred to me. Yet now the fact that even men can take childcare leave at Sumitomo Bakelite is no longer a rarity. This time around, my wife had been worried about caring for our three children right after giving birth even from when she was pregnant with our third child, so I decided to take time off, even if it was just for a month. Fortunately, my boss and coworkers understood, and while I was away on childcare leave I

The Group’s in-house training institute, “SB School”
In September 2007, we opened the Sumitomo Bakelite School (SB School) as an in-house training institute.
The aim of SB School is to provide lifelong education and training courses that help our Group achieve sustainable growth of business operations while maximizing corporate value. The school offers courses for all grades of employees from all departments. These include “all-employee education” courses that confirm and reinforce employees’ awareness of the Company’s Business Philosophy as well as fundamental knowledge about such issues as enhancement of CS, compliance, human rights, occupational safety, quality, and environmental protection. The school also systematically plans and implements various other kinds of educational and training courses needed by employees. From April 2019 through March 2020, the cumulative participation in SB School courses was about 27,000 employees, and the number of hours of education provided was approximately 16,000. We will plan and implement an increasingly wide range of programs

TOPIC
Manufacturing-oriented SBPS Education
  SBPS activities originally began as an offshoot of on-site kaizen (improvement) activities but are now implemented throughout the Company in order to generate the values demanded by customers and society.
The activities are aimed at securing the revenue and safety (personnel, facilities, environmental, and quality) that our company requires to achieve sustainable development. The activities involve setting specific targets (financial, quantitative, and delivery), planning who needs to achieve each of these targets by when, and implementing these plans without delay, meaning the activities are just the same as the daily work tasks carried out by employees.
We believe that, through the ages, technical capabilities, knowledge, experience, and tireless will that each individual has who promotes these activities will always bring about our required results.
Based on this idea, we have organized education programs targeting each employee grade and level as part of the SB School system. The planning and operation of the education is in principle carried out by employees themselves.
Attendees are required to submit reports, and the emphasis is placed on putting what they have learnt into practice in their own departments. Regular followups are carried out to track their progress.
Our training course for foremen is one example of our employee grade-based education. We began offering courses designed to foster future workplace leaders back in 2017. More than 70 people have attended these as of March 2020, and are now working to boost the safety and profitability of their respective workplaces.
Quality Control Skill Enhancement
We offer 30 quality-training programs at our SB School to increase our employees’ awareness of quality, to prevent quality problems, and to improve quality techniques. November every year is designated as “quality month,” and quality education via e-learning is provided for all employees.
We provide education for second-year employees in the engineering track through the Sumitomo Bakelite educational system by offering easy-to-understand lectures and practical training in areas such as the company’s quality policy and approach to quality, regulations, quality management systems, problem-solving methods (FTA, FMEA, Why-Why Analysis, and Further Investigation), and statistical methods from the early
Environmental Education
Our laboratories and plants handle a wide range of chemical substances. We conduct periodic group education programs for employees, including new employees, with the objective of protecting the environment in the vicinity of our business sites and ensuring that employees work in safety. These programs are designed to enhance employees’ understanding of the properties of chemical substances and the content of relevant laws and regulations, thus enabling them to handle chemical substances appropriately.
In addition to group education programs, environmental education by e-learning is conducted every year for all employees in June, a month dedicated to enhancement of environmental protection. This helps our employees learn and gain an in-depth understanding about the various activities that the company is undertaking, including Responsible Care.

stages of the career of employees assigned to the research and production engineering departments. Administrative employees were also included in the eligible group for receiving education in areas such as quality in general, regulations, and management systems.
In fiscal 2019, we gave everyone throughout the company a test of their quality control knowledge to enhance the level of our future quality control managers, and selected those who ranked highly on the test as member candidates to lead the next generation at each business site. In fiscal 2020 we will offer our training course for quality management representative as a form of leader education in aiming to raise the bar.

Every year, we provide education to all of our employees via e-learning to coincide with Human Rights Week in December. This deepens employees' understanding of typical types of harassment, including power harassment, sexual harassment, and maternity harassment, which are social problems, and teaches them points to be aware of to ensure that they do not perpetrate harassment. It has been designed to be a specific, easy-to- understand educational program that introduces employees to case studies and contact points to consult with in the event that they are harassed.
We recognize that the problem of harassment is a risk that is always liable to occur, regardless of the size of the workplace. But we will move ahead in creating spirited workplaces where it is easy to work and in which employees respect one another's individual character and human rights.

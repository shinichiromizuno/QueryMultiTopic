Epoxy resin molding compound for fixing motor magnet
Application of fastening technology using epoxy resin with greater resin strength than conventional liquid resins has made it possible to boost motor rotation speeds by 50% for greater power output and miniaturization. This helps reduce power consumption by electric vehicles and CO2 emitted when generating electric energy.

Captivating a Connected World

 Advancing Our Global Brand Further
Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
Released in January 2018, Monster Hunter: World (MH:W, below),
succeeded on two key elements of our growth strategy, namely globalization and shifting to digital. This propelled it to over 12.4 million units shipped worldwide, making it Capcom’s biggest hit ever. We aim to grow the fanbase even further by continuing to advance these two elements on
Monster Hunter World: Iceborne (MHW:I, below),
which is scheduled for release during the fiscal year ending March 2020.
For details, see p. 35 of the Integrated Report 2018.
 The two key elements to our success
1 Globalization
Increasing global users by supporting 12 languages
and launching titles simultaneously worldwide
  MH : W raised the Monster Hunter series to global brand status by increasing the overseas sales ratio to roughly 60%, compared to its historical 25%.
We plan to solidify our global user base with MHW:I by releasing it simultaneously around the globe and offering the game in 12 languages.
Overseas Approximately 25%

 2 Digital Shift
Taking our main sales and marketing channels online
We expect the bulk of MHW:I sales to be digital. While we maximize revenue using the digital marketing data we have accumulated up to this point, we will analyze user purchasing trends to utilize in digital sales going forward.

 Genesis
Capcom Co., Ltd. was established in Osaka in 1983. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) came out that same year, but it was difficult to develop high-quality arcade-level content for, so Capcom focused business development on the creation and sales of arcade games using the proprietary high-spec circuit board “CP System.”
Title history
Big hits drive business expansion
In the 1990s, the arrival of Super NES prompted Capcom to formally enter home video game development. Numerous hit titles were created that drew on Capcom’s arcade game development expertise. The Single Content Multiple Usage strategy was launched in earnest in 1994 with the release of a Hollywood movie and animated movie based on Street Fighter.
 1983
Released our first originally developed coin-op Little League.
1984
Released our first arcade video game Vulgus.
1985
Released our first home video game 1942 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
1987
Released Mega Man for the NES.
    1992
Released Street Fighter II for the Super NES.
1993
Released Breath of Fire for the Super NES.
1996
Released Resident Evil for PlayStation, establishing the genre of survival horror with this record-breaking, long-time best-seller.
    Capcom and Entertainment Culture
1988
CP System
Through leveraging our proprietary,
high-performance circuit board we were able to
captivate game players with exquisitely depicted, immersive
game worlds of the highest quality, allowing us to produce one hit after another in both the arcade and home video game markets.
1991
Street Fighter II becomes a major hit
The game became a sensation in arcades across the country, establishing the fighting game genre. In 1992, a national tournament was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan in what might be called the first ever esports tournament.

 Increasing shares
in Europe and North America
In 2000, Capcom listed its shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In the 2000s, Capcom created one hit title after another that gained popularity overseas. The Hollywood movie version of Resident Evil earned 102 million U.S. dollars globally, part of a six title hit series that continues to spread the Capcom brand throughout the world.
Globalization and the digital shift
With game consoles now offering full internet functionality and the popularization of gaming on PCs, the video game market has expanded beyond one segment of developed countries and now permeates the globe. As a result of Capcom’s early initiatives to support digital sales, including releasing past titles onto current game consoles and ongoing sales of catalog titles, operating profit margins and the overseas unit sales ratio have been on the rise.

In the fiscal year ended March 2010, the postponed release of major titles and the failure of some titles to meet sales targets overseas resulted in a temporary decline in income. In the fiscal year ended March 2011, we promoted profit structure reforms aimed at more efficient development investment. We promoted business restructuring by transitioning to in-house production and strengthened our digital sales strategy in response to rapid changes in the market beginning in the fiscal year ended March 2013. Financials were therefore sluggish until the fiscal year ended March 2014 while these reforms were implemented. Since that time, we have achieved six consecutive years of increased operating income with measures such as improving the highly profitable digital sales ratio in our Consumer sub-segment. The fiscal year ended March 2019 was the second year in a row we succeeded in breaking our top operating profit record due to new major hits and the accumulation of catalog sales.

In the fiscal years ended March 2010 and March 2012, net sales declined due to the postponed release of titles. However, the promotion of structural reforms in the Consumer sub-segment resulted in Capcom achieving net sales of 100 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 2014 for the first time.
Although net sales decreased significantly in the fiscal year ended March 2015 due to a delay in pachislo machine installation, the steady release of major titles from the Consumer sub-segment since the fiscal year ended March 2016 has resulted in an increase in net sales for four consecutive fiscal years.

Performance was sluggish in the fiscal years ended in March 2010, 2013 and 2014, as (1) structural reforms to the Amusement Equipments business, (2) development structure revisions in line with enhanced digital sales in the Consumer sub-segment and (3) strengthened Mobile sub-segment management capabilities in line with organization integration resulted in the recognition of special losses on restructuring and business restructuring expenses. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, income increased six years in a row due to the benefits from structural reforms beginning to manifest.

We believe the generation of creative and original content is our source of growth, thus approximately 90% of our annual development investments are allocated to the Digital Contents business. Recently in the Home Video Game market, development costs have been trending higher in line with increasingly high-performance devices, but we have been able to streamline development through increased employee utilization rates. Due to expanding our pipeline in recent years, costs have been on the rise; however, we expect them to remain around 30 billion yen going forward.

There was a decrease in the fiscal years ended March 2011 and 2014 due to the release of major titles, but since the fiscal year ended March 2015 it has been on the rise as a result of pipeline expansion and the release of new generation high-performance devices. In addition to the release of major titles Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5, reassessment and closing of overseas studios resulted in a significant decrease.

Although net assets increased between the fiscal years ended March 2007 and March 2009, stable net income resulted in ROE of around 14%. In the fiscal years ended in March 2010, 2013 and 2014, this figure declined due to decreases in net income from the recognition of special losses on restructuring and business restructuring expenses. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, ROE has been on the rise on the elimination of special losses and improved profitability.

The dividends prior to the fiscal year ended March 2018 are listed as the dividends on stocks prior to the split.
Capcom had a basic policy of maintaining stable dividends, and in the fiscal years ended March 2009 and 2011, the annual dividend was raised 5 yen in conjunction with improved business results. Since the fiscal year ended March 2017, the dividend policy has been to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30% and to strive for stable dividends. As a result, the payout in the fiscal year ended March 2019 was reduced due to the stock split, but effectively dividends increased, and we achieved our 29th consecutive year of paying dividends since listing publicly.

Seeking a healthier relationship between games and society
With the global rise of esports and the WHO’s international recognition of gaming disorder, in recent years gaming has transcended the framework of simple entertainment and is now recognized as content with a profound social impact, both positive and negative.

building healthy relationships with stakeholders from the unique perspective of a game publisher. This entails tackling social issues through our business activities, such as training a workforce capable of succeeding on the global stage, and the creation

               We are working to secure and train outstanding developers based on our desire to make the most entertaining games in the world. Though the closure of our development studio in Canada in the fiscal year ended March 2019 resulted in a temporary decline, the number of developers has nearly tripled over the past 10 years. We are working to improve the technical skills and motivation of our employees by such means as developing a system to train up new graduates to be fully capable team members within three years, promoting younger and mid-career employees to work on major titles, and putting together an environment that empowers developers to create the games they want to create.
One of the most important elements in developing world-class games that can keep pace with the globalization of the game player population is securing a workforce with diverse perspectives. For that reason, we are promoting diversity and working on building a workplace where women and foreign nationals can excel. We are tying this into the creation of all- new intellectual properties and successful, unconventional collaborations.

              Video games have a short history of academic research, and as evidenced by what was once called “game brain,” theories regarding their negative influence are more entrenched among the public than their educational aspects. In recent years, the WHO’s recognition of gaming disorder as an illness has also become a widely discussed subject. While it is true that spending all of your time gaming will create problems in your life, games are simulations and have the ability to provide experiences that cannot be obtained in real life. Based on our desire to promote understanding of video games in society, Capcom holds Company Visits, where we welcome children to our offices, and Guest Lectures at schools, both tailored to elementary and junior high school students.
Generally, an owner-run company excels at being flexible and fast decision- making, though concerns may exist over the issue of succession. At Capcom, we strive to make management more transparent and visible, and have implemented various governance reforms to this end, such as the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. We proactively appoint external directors, with 45.5% of our directors now being external directors.

Medium- to Long-Term Vision
Building a business portfolio
that achieves stable,
sustainable growth Responding to mega trends in the game industry
Innovation wrought by information technology keeps the game industry in a state of
constant evolution. With the spread of the internet in recent years, it has become possible
to sell games even in regions where the distribution of packaged games has traditionally proven difficult, expanding the number of global game players. In the near future, the 5G next- generation communication standard is expected to enable multi-screen play, with multiple devices used to play the same game, as well as the creation of even higher quality games.
Game Platform Diversification
Globalization of Game Players
    At Capcom, we always have our finger on the pulse of these changes, as we build a business portfolio that achieves sustainable growth through measures such as research on fundamental technologies and collaborations with knowledgeable companies.

A look at Capcom’s favorable and unique position from six perspectives
 The fiscal year ended March 2019 marked the second consecutive year we achieved record high profits. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, our medium-term management goal has been to increase operating income each year, and we have accomplished this for six consecutive years. These achievements lead me to believe that we are headed in the right direction with our strategy and the business model we are working towards.
Last year, I explained the elements that serve as the source of Capcom’ s sustained growth as a
corporate philosophy and culture that fosters the ambitions and values set out at our founding, a business model that is a competitive advantage, important management indicators that function as quantitative guideposts, a management strategy focusing on our strengths, mitigating risks, and enhancing sustainability, a relationship with society,
governance, and finally a linking of these elements. Please continue reading as I explain to our
stakeholders once again how these six elements allow us to demonstrate our favorable and unique position.

CEO Commitment
23 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
1 Corporate philosophy and culture ––– Aim to be the best in the world
The world’s best content “from Osaka to the World,” arising from our unchanging philosophy
 I jumped into the world of entertainment 50 years ago with the idea that “games are luxury items, not essentials. This is why the brand must be of world-class quality.” I still believe this to be true even today.
Accordingly, Capcom’s basic philosophy is to create an entertainment culture through the medium of games by developing highly creative content that excites and stimulates your senses and brings a smile to your face. In other words, we help make people happy and in turn build an emotionally rich society by creating the world’s most entertaining games. For details, please refer to “Corporate Philosophy” on page 04
In 1983, I founded Capcom under the motto of “originality and ingenuity,” with the vision of developing games offering world-class quality.
Underpinning this was my belief that increasingly
sophisticated graphics and more immersive worlds would eventually make games as moving and impressive for the world as a Disney film.
36 years later, I have amassed more than 2,800 colleagues who share this vision. Under the slogan “From Osaka to the World,” these values have become our corporate culture, with (1) a spirit that is always eager to take on new challenges and (2) a sense of pride to constantly strive to be world-class deeply ingrained in every Capcom employee.
Again and again, we have been able to produce unique series that are globally recognized, including Street Fighter, Resident Evil and Monster Hunter, because of the fertile soil of a corporate culture cultivated over many years.
2 Business model ––– Competitive advantage centered on global IP High-quality content creation and the business
development to maximize its use
 Capcom’s strengths are (1) the development and technological capabilities to create the world’s finest, high-quality games and (2) numerous popular branded IP known the world over.
In addition, since fiscal 2011, we have hired over 100 new graduate developers every year in anticipation of focusing on in-house development, increasing our development staff to over 2,100 people and further enhancing our strengths.
From game market characteristics and competitive factor analysis, the Consumer sub-segment has high entry barriers; combining the aforementioned strengths with our capital and the relationships of trust we have with hardware manufacturers creates significant competitive advantages (profitability). Against this backdrop, in the consumer market, technological standards and development costs rise with each hardware cycle, resulting in a situation where consumer spending and time is more concentrated on branded, popular titles. For details, please refer to “An Analysis of the
Market and Capcom” on page 69.
Furthermore, in sub-segments other than Consumer, our rollout of popular IP across multiple mediums contributes as a stable source of earnings. This is because, in addition to the fact that our IP consists of products developed 100% in-house, possessing numerous global IPs amplifies the effect of our multiple usage strategy. Moreover, expansion into other areas leads to increased brand value and subsequently an influx of new users to the game. In particular, marketing activities utilizing Hollywood adaptations of content further enhances the global competitiveness (brand power) of our IPs and maximizes synergistic effects.
For details, please refer to “The COO’s Discussion of Growth Strategies” on page 31.
In recent years, as a result of these sustained branding measures, we are increasingly seeing multiple generations of fans at event venues as IPs enjoying long-term popularity have firmly taken hold.

3 Key performance indicators (KPI) ––– Focused on stable growth for 5–10 years into the future
Creating a framework using systematization and establishing a leaner structure by improving performance indicators
 1. Analysis of management performance in the fiscal year ended March 2019 (summary)
In the fiscal year under review (ended March 2019), we achieved the sixth consecutive year of operating income growth, and all profit items from operating income downward reached record highs. What I want to point out here is that (1) Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5 were both indisputable successes, having been developed in-line with the highly stringent, world-class quality standards that drove the success of Monster Hunter: World, (2) following the home video game version, the PC version of Monster Hunter: World has also achieved success as a global brand, (3) catalog sales (past titles, including rereleases and HD versions) also grew, increasing the density of our earnings platform and (4) digital unit sales rose to 61%. All four of these items are part of our growth strategy and demonstrate our successful executions of these initiatives up to now.
For details, please refer to “Financial Review” on page 75
2. Medium-term management goal assumptions and indicators (KPI)
(1) Management direction—Thinking about what to target in the next five years
I am always thinking about what our management targets should be in the next five years. In this way, I am even able to quickly notice small changes two years from now. And, at present, our management policies are to (1) create exciting, world-class content (IP), and (2) maximize both the number of users supporting our company and earnings by leveraging our rich library of IPs across multiple platforms and media to become a company of continuous, sustainable growth.
(2) Management goals—Stable growth every year
We have established operating income growth each fiscal year as the goal for achieving the above. Rather than struggling to coordinate major title launch periods for this, we intend to take a natural approach of establishing a model of stable growth through build-up by expanding our title lineup, among other efforts. This will enable institutional investors managing pensions and individual investors on fixed incomes to maintain long-term holdings with confidence. As we are emphasizing annual growth, we have not announced a specific rate of increase, but we are considering a profit
growth rate between 5–10%. It is true that achieving growth every year in a hit-driven business like the gaming industry is a lofty goal. However, with the digital shift of sales and marketing these past few years, our profit structure has also changed. We are in fact a leader in the change-over to digital, and the profit margin of our Digital Contents business is growing steadily.
(3) Key performance indicators (KPI)
and shareholder value creation achievements
In terms of management, I place importance on operating income (growth indicator) as the basis of corporate earning power, operating margins (efficiency indicator), which are the basis of profitability, and cash flows.
The game industry is prone to drastic change; in terms of engaging in management that is always focused five years ahead, we use the above fundamental indicators, as well as a matrix that compares figures to net sales, year-over-year and to our forecast, to check for anomalies and quickly identify and address problems.
This has led to a 66% increase in operating income and
 a 7.9-point improvement in operating margins over the
 past five years, placing Capcom at the top compared
 to other companies in our industry.

Further, if we improve these performance indicators, ROE and other related indicators also increase, creating shareholder value. Specifically, in line with improved margins, ROE has improved for six years straight. And,
in the fiscal year ending March 2020, the equity spread
 (ROE – cost of capital) is expected to be 10.5%, adding
 to corporate value and exceeding the average for

     In addition, I think it is important to reward shareholders who trust our Company and hold Capcom shares over the medium- to long-term, and I have strived to deliver sustainable earnings growth and returns to shareholders.
As a result, over the past five years capital gains and
 dividends, which constitute total shareholders return
  1. Investing in human resources and development equipment to create world-class games
“Without pursuing advancement, we cannot create world-class games.” As a manager in the game industry for 50 years, I have always said, “World-class games are not just entertaining, they must also be technically advanced.” The evolution of hardware and rising quality of market entrants are proof of this. Accordingly, we must amass human resources that are highly skilled in areas such as programming and the visual arts. We are already engaged in this effort.
I focused on future game market expansion and technological advances, and since 2011, Capcom has hired over 100 new graduate developers every year. Nearly all of them are “game natives” who have played games since they were very young and have witnessed the advances in games of the past 20 years. Moreover, they are overflowing with energy, and desire to use their skills to develop new markets, which is why they joined Capcom, whose DNA is rooted in a focus on global markets. If the employee is highly capable, they
may be assigned to the development of major brands, such as Resident Evil or Devil May Cry in the early years of their career. Learning and achieving results under the tutelage of a leader while taking on more responsibility over time readies that employee to eventually take on a leadership role themselves in the future.
In addition, we are actively investing in the world’s most cutting-edge on-site R&D facilities and development equipment, such as our motion capture studio featuring 7-meter-high ceilings, our 3-D scan studio with roughly 100 cameras, and a Foley studio for recording sound effects so that our elite team of world-class creators can work to the absolute best of their abilities.
2. Marketing strategy for creating global brands
Another critical factor is our approach to marketing, focused on branding and increasing awareness of hit titles.
As it takes about three years to develop a game, we used to have issues with a progressive decline in recognition during development. I came up with the idea that the most effective method for ongoing media
(TSR), are 22.5%, beating TOPIX (8.0%) and propelling

     Value Creation Story
Medium- to Long-Term Latest Creative Report Growth Strategy
Foundation for Financial Analysis and Sustainable Growth (ESG) Corporate Data
exposure of game titles was to expand globally using Hollywood movie adaptations. In 1994, we decided to invest 4 billion yen to make a Street Fighter Hollywood movie. At that time, some thought I had taken up movies merely as a hobby, but this investment generated a return of approximately 15 billion yen and successfully established Street Fighter as a global brand. Although games receive only about two weeks of media exposure before and after their release, factors that led to the success of this Hollywood movie include (1) the theatrical release, (2) Blu-Ray and DVD sales, (3) online and cable television broadcasts and (4) broadcasts at hotels and in airplanes. It has been rebroadcast numerous times over years and decades, which has led to maintaining and even increasing the recognition of this title.
A condition to taking this marketing approach is that the games are of world-class quality; Capcom has already succeeded in a similar way with the branding of Resident Evil. We will continue to utilize this branding approach with other Capcom IPs such as Monster Hunter and Mega Man.
3. Transforming the consumer business model to mitigate earnings volatility risks
As the founder of Capcom, I think it is important to create a structure for passing the business on to the next generation. As with any structure, building the foundation is the most challenging part, but efforts launched six years ago are finally starting to take shape. To establish solid growth strategies and further enhance corporate value, there are two critical risks, earnings volatility and management decisions, that must be addressed. However, first I will talk about the stable growth mechanism (control of earnings volatility risks).
For details regarding management decision risks, please refer to page 28
To mitigate earnings volatility risks over the medium- to long-term, measures enabling sustainable growth must include (1) transforming the foundation
of our Consumer business model from a traditional one-time sale “transactional model” to a continuous “recurring revenue model” and (2) creating a business portfolio and diversifying earnings risks by thoroughly leveraging Capcom’s basic strategy, Single Content Multiple Usage. [Diagram 1]
Historically, earnings in Capcom’s core Consumer sub-segment fluctuated depending on whether or not we created hit titles. Although we achieved some success (controlled earnings volatility) through timing the releases of multiple hit titles in the past, it did not meet my objectives for stable growth.
However, since 2013, game consoles have been equipped with robust online functionality, enabling us to develop growth strategies around digital elements.
Specifically, new titles [Diagram 1-A] will work as medium- to long-term growth drivers as we (1) steadily release major titles each year, (2) extend the sales life of these titles to 3–4 years with additional content and flexible pricing strategies and (3) strengthen our presence overseas, which comprises approximately 85% of the total market.
Next, in terms of catalog titles [Diagram 1-B], we will grow our user base and generate profits on a recurring revenue basis even during periods in-between new title releases through (1) digital sales of past titles and (2) re-releasing past hit titles for current-generation game consoles.
4. Building a new medium- to long-term revenue pillar
Currently, we are several paces behind our industry competitors in terms of mobile content. This stems from the compatibility between our IPs created for home video game consoles and mobile devices, but as G (communication speed) and K (resolution) technology progresses, we believe that within the next several years we will be able to fully utilize our strength in IPs in mobile content as well. In addition, we are pursuing all immediate possibilities, such as in-house production,

collaborations, and M&A, building up a foundation for our mobile business as a further growth option (second pillar).
In addition, with a focus on the future growth of the esports market, we will strengthen title branding and attempt to make the esports business profitable.
[Diagram 1-C]
In the game industry, which is often called the “hit- driven business,” Capcom will establish a management structure and strategy able to achieve sustainable growth other companies have yet to achieve while enhancing corporate value.
5 Relationship with Society (S) ––– Global human resources and new market cultivation
Building a good relationship with our stakeholders, contributing to society through business
 27 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
From our position as a game publisher, we believe that we can increase our corporate value by building a healthy relationship with our stakeholders while also— through our business activities—nurturing talent that can play an active role on the global stage, as well as by creating new markets with cutting-edge technology that can in turn be combined to create social and economic value (creating common value).
1. Building a healthy relationship between games and society
While games have made people smile, stimulated their senses, and created a new culture up to this point, new challenges have also appeared, such as the expensive in-game purchases by minors and game addiction that have accompanied the increase of online games in recent years. As I mentioned in my explanation of our corporate philosophy, our purpose is to make people happy through games. Making people unhappy because of games is certainly not our intention. If we do not tackle these issues head on, as an industry, company, and member of society, we will not be able to earn people’s trust and continue growing. For details, please refer to “Corporate philosophy and culture” on page 23
We are aware that these are major issues for our industry as a whole, and each company has therefore come together as part of an industry organization to make efforts to (1) establish guidelines and educate people about them, (2) share problems and actual examples among member companies, and (3) exchange information on a regular basis with parents, educators, consumer groups, and government administrators.
For details, please refer to “Relationship with Customers” on page 47
In addition, since 2005 Capcom has independently continued literacy and career education support activities to raise awareness about how to properly interact with games in an effort to eliminate the social concern regarding the healthy development of youth
with regards to games. For details, please refer to “Promoting Healthy Relationships with Games” on page 50
We do our best to ensure that a broad range of customers are able to play safely and fairly. As a general rule, in our mobile games we refrain from utilizing gacha elements, and while we do sell small-scale, inexpensive additional content in games for home consoles, any content that is required to play the main game is provided free of charge.
2. Commitment to regional communities
The promotion of our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy provides society with a wide range of benefits. Specifically, these include the use of popular Capcom IP in local revitalization activities to support (1) economic development, (2) cultural development, (3) awareness for crime prevention and (4) awareness of elections. We are achieving quantitative social outcomes through solving the common problem of attracting and appealing to the youth demographic. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Regional Communies” on page 49
At the same time, these four activities deliver value to Capcom in the form of (1) improving existing customer satisfaction through event participation and (2) enhancing the image of games among the middle- aged and seniors. With respect to (2) in particular, this segment cannot be considered current customers, thus by contributing popular content to local communities, we are able to cultivate new game players through apps and games on their personal smartphones and devices.
3. Commitment to employees
As can be seen from the fact that personnel expenses (costs) account for approximately 80% of development expenses, the game industry is a labor-intensive industry and an extraordinarily knowledge-intensive industry, thus human resources are an extremely important management resource.

     Value Creation Story
Medium- to Long-Term Latest Creative Report Growth Strategy
Foundation for Financial Analysis and Sustainable Growth (ESG) Corporate Data
I recognize the importance of diversity for creating content that will resonate globally, thus Capcom promotes the retention and training of talented human resources without regard for gender or race. As I mentioned earlier, we have world-leading, cutting- edge development equipment enabling our talented workforce to fully demonstrate their abilities. As part of our efforts to improve the work environment, we have provided equipment that allows creators to give shape to their ideas, which improves product quality while also bolstering creativity. In terms of remuneration, in addition to a well-balanced salary system based on ability, we have also introduced incentives for each title and an assignment allowance system to increase motivation.
Furthermore, in fiscal 2017 we established Capcom Juku, an on-site childcare facility, to provide employees with children a fulfilling work environment where they can concentrate on their work. I would like to make Capcom Juku something beyond a simple childcare facility and see it expand into a place of learning for children all the way up through their junior high school
entrance exams. Japan is feeling pressure from countries like the United States and China in the areas of AI and IT, thus I want to provide our children with the tools to succeed when it is their turn to compete on the world stage. I believe that supporting our children up to their entrance into junior high school and nurturing Capcom employees into world-class businesspeople and game creators will contribute to the sustainable growth of our company as well as the industry. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Employees” on page 50.
In my view, the most critical aspect of human resource development is providing an environment that enables employees to take on new challenges. The manager’s role is to push employees to take on one new challenge after another, leaving alone what works and devoting their energy to devising measures when things are not working. This enables employees to take on challenges without fear of failure, develop the world’s most entertaining games and create new businesses leading to a virtuous cycle that creates business opportunities.
 6 Governance (G) ––– Management visualization mechanism Mcreating the next generation
Mechanism for avoiding management decision risks in line with accelerated growth strategy
 Avoiding management decision risks with transparency and the development of the next generation of leaders
As Capcom further accelerates its growth strategies, the risks become proportionally higher, but I believe that governance is effective at reducing and avoiding these risks.
Specifically, with myself, Capcom’s founder, as CEO and my oldest son as COO, we can avoid management decision risks by sufficiently leveraging the supervisory function of the external directors, and a unique mechanism for highly transparent and rational decision making built by the Board of Directors. [Diagram 2]
Mechanism 1
Management visualization based on numbers
Despite changes in corporate scale or business environment, to conduct flexible and integrated management, I require that materials (documents) used for decision-making are, in principle,

 quantitatively focused. Specifically, these materials compare and contrast net sales, year-on-year performance and earnings forecasts, which make it easier to identify problems by enabling us to confirm the details in multiple ways.
CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 28

CEO Commitment
 Furthermore, these materials are used by external directors for supervisory purposes and provided to investors as part of our IR activities. This is part of the mechanism I call “management visualization.” Management decisions based on visualizing operations enable us to evaluate the Company with two sets of eyes using a system attempting to achieve management transparency.
Even when I talk with developers, numbers are the common language. Using only qualitative words and sentences leaves significant room for arbitrariness on the part of the person in charge. In comparison, numbers enable comparisons from a variety of angles, facilitating decisions based on real conditions.
The risk control efforts I am focused on now involve passing on the management know-how I have accumulated as founder to the next generation of management through actual practice and ensuring the Company functions reliably in the future by systematizing management. Both of these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Mechanism 2
Organizational design that leverages the supervisory function of external directors
For the past 20 years, Capcom has executed a variety of governance reforms.
Since introducing the external director system in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, external directors have increased to account for 45.5% of the Board of Directors. This stemmed from one particular investor’s concern that “as a founder-run company, Capcom can quickly make management decisions and respond to changes in the business environment, but isn’t there a risk of arbitrary decisions and execution?”
External director appointment criteria have not changed since the system was introduced, but in short, we appoint directors with insight who are highly proficient specialists in their respective areas outside the gaming industry, capable of objectively making decisions regarding Capcom’s management and business activities. With the avoidance of business investment risk as a priority issue, Capcom appoints individuals from Japan’s leadership class (in terms of business crisis management, law and government) who are able to provide sound opinions, especially when earnings are subpar, who are not intimidated by the company founder and are able to determine validity from the general public’s point of view. In fact, fierce debates led primarily by our external directors were held regarding agenda items such as the fiscal 2015 reintroduction of takeover defense measures (currently abolished) and fiscal 2016 transitioning to a company with an audit and supervisory committee.
For details, please refer to the 2016 and 2017 Integrated Reports.
Mechanism 3
Developing management human resource capabilities and grooming successors
Within corporate management, people’s character and spirit are important management resources that have a substantial impact on corporate value. In the 2016 integrated report, I discussed my management philosophy and capabilities as founder. At present, one of the concerns among our investors is the thinness of our management team as a founder-run company; in other words, have we prepared a management structure (successor plan) for the next generation?
Capcom’s key people for the next generation are the head of business and development, Haruhiro Tsujimoto (president) and Yoichi Egawa (executive corporate officer). Both have the qualities required for management. I chose them as keypersons because, as I have discussed in past reports, they have amassed a wealth of experience since our founding and are ready and willing to take on the responsibility. As a member of Capcom’s founding family, from the time it was a small company akin to a neighborhood business, Haruihiro Tsuijmoto has assisted with a sense of responsibility and awareness of the family business. Later, he adopted the motto “diligence and earnestness” as he labored with modesty to launch the arcade operations business and develop our strategy of multiple usage for leveraging content. Yoichi Egawa joined the company soon after it was founded, and since then he has displayed a determination to stay and fight even in the most difficult situations, taking on a leadership role in the development of arcade games and the establishment of both the pachislo and mobile businesses, all the while delivering results. However, due to Capcom’s significant growth over the last 36 years, management responsibilities are also larger and carry more weight. My role as founder is to create a framework that will sustain the company and ensure that my successors have a proper understanding of that framework and can execute within it. However, if I were to simply pass the reins and walk away, management would be unsustainable in this era of rapid change. For as long as I am physically able, I feel it is my duty to remain by the side of our keypersons and guide them, both in the board room as well as in life, by spending time together on a personal level to exchange information and offer advice.
In addition to my intense and thorough training of these two different types of people, it is my intention to combine that with the corporate culture we have cultivated over many years, the aforementioned management visualization and systematization, and just governance. I believe this will result in a profound management team that our long-term investors will trust as managers implicitly.

The dividends prior to the fiscal year ended March 2018 are listed as the dividends on the stocks prior to the split.
1. Basic policy regarding dividends
During my 36 years of management since founding Capcom, my philosophy has been to pursue stable corporate growth and reward long-term shareholders with steady increases in dividend payments despite the constantly changing nature of the game industry.
I have already mentioned the factors critical for sustainably enhancing corporate value; as shareholder returns are also an important management issue, dividends are determined with consideration for future business development and changes in the management environment.
Capcom’s basic shareholder return policy aims to (1) enhance corporate value through investment in growth, (2) continue paying dividends (30% payout ratio) while striving for stable dividends and (3) acquire treasury stock to increase the value of earnings per share.
The reason I think both the payout ratio and stable dividends are important is, for example, because a sudden decrease or cessation of dividends can be the difference between life and death for pensioners who depend on dividends to cover part of their lifestyle expenses. Regular and stable revenue enables the reliable
establishment of future lifestyle plans. We also receive requests for stability from the long-term investors who manage those pensions.
Capcom shareholders represent all types of people, and I assume some of them may be facing these kinds of issues, which is why we have never once failed to provide dividends during the 29 years since we went public in 1990. In addition, the fiscal year ended March 2019 was the third consecutive year we achieved increased dividends, and considering the stock split, our dividends have actually doubled over the past 10 years. [Diagram 3]
2. Dividends for this fiscal year and the next
Dividends for the fiscal year ended March 2019 were 35 yen for the year, which is actually the highest ever taking the stock split into consideration. In the next fiscal year, we plan to pay the same amount of dividends.
As a senior manager with 50 years of experience in this industry, my goal is to increase market capitalization and achieve corporate growth exceeding that of the past 36 years in order to continue meeting the expectations of all Capcom shareholders.

   Enhance digital strategy and pursue maximizing revenue from IPs geared toward
the expanding market
 The game market continued to boom this fiscal year with the performance of each home video game platform, the popularity of new game genres in the mobile market, and the further growth of our esports business. In addition, with the next-generation mobile communication standard, 5G, being rolled out from July 2019, structural changes to the gaming business are starting to be explored, such as major IT companies announcing plans for new platforms that feature cloud gaming.
In this environment, areas of the market we are focused on are the shift to digital, which has allowed us to directly address customer needs from a business standpoint, as well as achieve remarkable globalization
and platform growth in step with the spread of digital sales in our core Consumer sub-segment, 5G, which if widely adopted will increase the likelihood of mobile content undergoing significant changes, and esports, which has the potential to change the social value of games in addition to revenue opportunities.
The game market is evolving at breakneck speed; however, through integrating the development, sales and marketing aspects of our digital strategy with our single content multiple usage strategy, which allows us to leverage our rich library of original IP across a wide array of media, we will expand our global base of customers who support and trust Capcom’s brands and continue growing our operating income annually.

 Use digital sales to increase pricing and region opportunities while extending the life of both new
and catalog titles globally
The consumer market is expected to grow to 47.9 billion dollars by 2023 (a 60.2% increase compared to 2018), thus Capcom continues to position our Consumer sub- segment as our driver of growth. We made progress toward establishing a recurring revenue model through achieving longer product lives, which includes sales growth for catalog titles, and improved profitability for new titles via ongoing initiatives that included expanding our new title lineup and strengthening digital sales. This is in addition to increased sales in emerging markets on PC platforms, which has grown in recent years, resulting in a profit margin of approximately 30% in the fiscal year ended March 2019.
In the next fiscal year and beyond, we will further promote our digital strategy and globalization as the foundation for a development structure that produces world-class quality, and aim for greater
(60-month), we have formed a title portfolio focused on delivering stable growth, and established a mechanism for placing more than 2,000 developers on the required development team at suitable times via a year-long assignment map. As a result, we shortened the launch cycle for each series, enabling the launch of multiple major titles each fiscal year.
Based on this structure, we think there is substantial room for growth in the overseas markets, which comprise 85% of the consumer market, and in addition to Resident Evil and Street Fighter, which are already popular overseas, our strategic plan to make Monster Hunter a global brand with the release of Monster Hunter: World (MH:W) in January 2018 resulted in record sales of 13.1 million units (as of June 30, 2019).[Diagram 4] Additionally, we maintained the same meticulous commitment to quality on this year’s Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5 as we had on MH:W, which, in conjunction with leveraging our know-how in digital marketing and promotion, resulted in these titles performing favorably to our sales plan. For details see page 36
We will continue to strengthen our development structure and promote further systemization to grow our pipeline of new titles geared toward the global market.
For the time being, while we are placing a priority on maximizing the revenue from current core IP, we are also actively looking to utilize dormant IP.

Increased internal R&D ratio
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, we shifted our focus to internal R&D to strengthen and rationalize development, which improved margins.
Further, as the creation of new IP is indispensable in generating medium- to long-term growth, we are working to develop new brands as well.
Measure 2
Bolstering digital sales
The merits of digital sales include (1) improved profitability due to package production cost reductions and avoidance of inventory risk (full-game downloads), (2) additional earnings opportunities through digital sales of catalog titles, which are difficult to acquire shelf space for at physical retail shops (full-game downloads), and (3) anchoring players by providing content on an ongoing basis and acquiring additional revenue (additional content).
Up to this point, Capcom has worked to strengthen our digital sales of both new and catalog full-game titles, resulting in 41 billion yen in digital sales this fiscal year and a digital sales ratio in the Consumer sub-segment of 53.3%, surpassing the 50% we set as our medium-term target. During this time, consumer profitability has improved significantly, and business performance volatility has been reduced in line with our progress toward establishing a recurring revenue model that accompanies the achievement of long-term sales.
A major driver in the rapid growth of digital sales this fiscal year was increased PC game sales, as illustrated by the PC version of MH:W, a new release. Our analysis shows that compared to conventional platforms, PC provides an advantage in expanding sales to emerging markets such as Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, where we can expect it to continue contributing to the globalization of Capcom’s business and acquisition of new users. In addition, purchases of new titles among customers are gradually shifting away from physical packages and toward digital, as evidenced

by the digital sales ratio of both of our major titles this year exceeding 40%.
In the next fiscal year, we plan to further increase
the digital sales ratio to 75.4%. The main contributing
factor in this is that we are not releasing our new major
title Monster Hunter World: Iceborne as a conventional
standalone new title (at full-price), but rather as a
massive expansion for MH:W. In other words, while
the game content will be of a volume equivalent to
that of a new title, we are selling and distributing it as
additional content primarily through digital sales
channels. For details see page 43 In light of global user
trends, we expect overall sales units to drop and net
sales to decline in our Consumer sub-segment next
fiscal year as we attempt this new sales method, but
at the same time, we expect the profit margin to rise further. [Diagram 5]
We expect that moving forward with these policies will bring the digital sales ratio closer to 80–90% or more in the medium to long-term, as well as improve Consumer sub-segment profitability, providing further progress in establishing our recurring revenue model.
Measure 3
Game business digital shift
It has long been our belief that the game business could be made more efficient by utilizing state-of-the-art internet technology.
Therefore, in addition to proposing an internal change in our way of thinking, we established the Global Marketing Group, as well as quarterly Global Marketing meetings for management and global business executives to better align our aims amongst other efforts towards improvements. As a result, MH:W, released in January 2018, became the first title on which management, development, and business came

together to make full use of internet connectivity to expand sales and realize improved quality. For example, the analysis of global user preferences, which were collected through an online demo version, contributed to this record-breaking hit, and we have applied this method to the two major titles released this fiscal year with successful results. The critical factor is to extract and analyze data from the standpoint of user satisfaction, which is extremely important for luxury items like games. This importance will continue to increase going forward as digital natives—those people who grew up with the internet and social media—grow into core-segment game users.
Amid the global expansion of markets, it is essential to develop detailed IP brand strategies. To comprehensively analyze user attributes, platform utilization status, and price sensitivity for each IP, we are shifting the function of our overseas subsidiaries from that of sales to marketing and promotion. In addition, from this fiscal year, we have integrated management of Japan and Asia to focus our business resources on the rapidly growing Asian market. We are also conducting proactive assignments of key persons, including offering positions to those from other industries, to catalyze the evolution of our organization with new knowledge and know-how. [Diagram 6]
Measure 4
Support for new services such
as cloud gaming and subscriptions
In step with the launch of 5G service, both existing platform providers and global IT firms, one after another, are announcing new cloud gaming and subscription services in the field of consumer games. Capcom pays close attention to future developments, and has adopted a multi-platform strategy under which we welcome the opportunity for new services to enhance the game environment for users, for example: the potential that wide adoption of cloud gaming will increase the overall game player population (where “cloud gaming” implies access to games through a variety of different hardware at a lower initial cost to the user).
At the same time, it will also be necessary to objectively analyze developments as we move forward, such as what actual merits users find in the new services and whether changes will arise in doing business with platform providers.
Capcom’s top priority remains as the meticulous refinement of our content to maintain our unflagging, consistent world-class quality. If we can accomplish that, then customers will always choose us, regardless of platform. Our experience from many long years of
standing at the forefront of the industry has convinced me of this. [Diagram 7]

Case Study: Analysis of a Top Hit
    Captivating fans across generations to top four million units sold in one month
The Resident Evil series features survival horror games where players attempt to escape terrifying situations using weapons and other items. Since it was first released in 1996, the series has sold more than 91 million units total (as of March 31, 2019), becoming one of our best-known brands. Today, more than 20 years after its first appearance, it has the enthusiastic support of fans around the world.
Resident Evil 2, released on January 25, 2019, is a reimagining of the fourth best-selling title in the series, originally released in January 1998. It was rebuilt from the ground up for current-generation game consoles using our cutting-edge development tools. In addition to the highly immersive world and dramatic story enabled by the latest technology, effective promotion and digital strategy made the game successful not only among fans of the original but also with a whole new demographic of fans. It became a major hit, with sales exceeding four million copies approximately one month after its release.

 Why it became a hit
1 A remake that exceeds all expectations
The original Resident Evil 2 is one of the series most popular titles. Recreating the game for current-generation game consoles meant there were high hurdles to overcome in terms of the fans’ expectations for the game and the weight of the brand. In our effort to leave a sense of the original while remaking the game from scratch, it took 18 months of trial and error to figure out what to keep and what to change until the game’s first stage at the police station was finally complete.
As a result, it was crowned “Best of Show” at E3 where it was unveiled, marking the first time the honor of most notable game was awarded to a Japanese third-party developer, and raising the expectations of stakeholders ahead of its release.

In addition to creating entertaining photo ops at gaming events and releasing videos of influencers playing the game, we also distributed a “1-Shot Demo” trial version of the game. This limited, one-time only 30-minute trial roused user interest on social media, resulting in five million downloads.
Directing users of the trial version to the purchasing site after playing the game also led to a rise in the number of preorders and succeeded in acquiring a broad spectrum of players, ranging from casual to hardcore series fans.

Enhancing the sound as well as the graphics has enabled us to offer a deeply immersive game experience, earning the game a high 90 point* Metascore, which serves as an indicator of game player purchasing.

Meanwhile, full roll out of 5G, the next-generation telecommunications standard, is rapidly approaching. If vast improvements in communication speed result in reduced latency and the ability for simultaneous multi-user connections, according to our analysis, the likelihood will increase for us to achieve significant growth in the mobile segment with our numerous core action game IPs.

As a result of the projects we have undertaken with multiple collaborators who have track records of hits in their respective markets, as of July 2019 we have already released two titles, domestically and overseas. Further, we plan to release several more titles, including some titles developed in-house, during the fiscal year ending March 2020.[Figure 8]
Long-Term Preparation for
Measures next-generation standards
Some regions overseas have already begun tentative 5G service, and in the future, with a leap forward in communication speed said to be 100 times faster than 4G, there are expected to be dramatic advancements in services using IoT as well as in the richness of content in line with device advancements. In terms of games, we believe there are possibilities for utilizing Capcom’s action-oriented games, distinctive for their high-quality graphics, on mobile devices.
At the moment, there is still room for us to choose the timing for full-scale support of 5G and the level of service we will offer. While we conduct analysis of actual 5G use, our development divisions are engaged in technological research and the acquisition of development know-how to ensure we are able to seize this coming opportunity for growth.[Diagram 8]

In preparation for the full-scale roll out of 5G, Capcom must amass the operational know-how to improve game content and implement timely events within games; a prerequisite for success in the mobile business and something that we are lacking. In order to do so, for the last two years we have been focusing on alliances that utilize our IPs in conjunction with

Esports stands for “electronic sports,” which are video games played in competitions viewed as sporting events. They became popular in Europe and North America in the late 90’s and now enjoy popularity among young people in particular, with numerous and varied game events held throughout the world, including in Japan and Asia. They are also garnering attention as a new category in the game business.

a view to future profitability
2018 is known as the first year esports experienced
widespread popularity in Japan, and it was the turning
point in development. The Japan Esports Union (JeSU)
was established as the supervisory sports organization,
and social interest is growing with daily media reports
of participation from companies in other industries
and organizations intrigued by its business potential.
We do not see esports as a passing fad, but rather as
a new area of business in the game market. In other
words, we are on the verge of seeing a new culture of
content rise up, and I think it is important to cultivate
it from a medium- to long-term perspective of five to ten
years. To bring this idea to fruition, just as with soccer
and other sports, Capcom is working to expand the
market base by not only providing top professionals
with a place to shine, but also by encouraging
participation among young people and amateurs.
[Diagram 9]
Measure
Aiming to establish a win-win ecosystem for players, viewers,
and communities
There are three main points to the measures we will implement from this fiscal year through the next. (1) Further improved appeal with the creation of team-based
Street Fighter leagues. (2) Thorough trend analysis to attract new player and audience participation. (3) Promotion of regional development through cooperation with companies and local governments in each locality.
Regarding the first item, in addition to conventional one-on-one battles, we feel that the same allure found in traditional sports can be rendered through the human drama seen in bonds formed among team members and in playing as a team. For the second item, thoroughly analyzing player and audience data from each event, grasping what appeals to which demographics and then compiling the critical measures will lead to an increase in the number of participants. In terms of the third item, we aim to contribute to spreading esports outside of major cities as well as to regional revitalization by creating professional team franchises in various regions from 2020.
Currently, we are strengthening the workforce of our dedicated esports department, which we established early in the fiscal year, and are taking proactive steps to implement the aforementioned measures. We believe that the adoption of esports at international sporting events will increase awareness and understanding of esports among the general public, which will not only increase the value of our IPs, but will also lead to the improved status of the game industry and greater societal contributions.[Diagram 10]

  Financial Strategy According to the CFO
A stable financial base for flexible investment and growth in an ever-changing market
Kenkichi Nomura
Director, Executive Corporate Officer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
 Q This marks the second consecutive year of achieving record profits, and the current cash balance is 53 billion yen. Has there been any
Achange in your financial strategy?
We will maintain our basic policy to improve net cash and increase capital efficiency supporting our growth strategy.
Capcom is executing a growth strategy aimed at enhancing corporate value over the medium-to-long term. We are conducting R&D investment on a scale of approximately 30 billion yen each fiscal year in our core Digital Contents business. As CFO, I am engaged in increasing capital efficiency and improving net cash to build a strong and flexible financial base to enable this investment, which accounts for approximately 30% of sales.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, investments in line with this growth strategy led to record-breaking unit sales in our Consumer sub-segment, as well as all-time high profits that increased net cash by 7.9 billion yen. Currently, our market environment is undergoing major changes, such as the spread of digital sales. Furthermore, we expect these changes to accelerate all the more over the next few years with the appearance of new technologies and services. In such an environment, our revenue structure has begun to change, increasing our investment options for strategic growth.
I will continue to concentrate on investment decisions that align with our growth strategy, while continuing to review the cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and other costs to achieve an even leaner financial foundation. With our accumulated cash, we look to establish even greater profitability by increasing the value of our IPs to enable flexible investment in projects with high strategic priority, including the development of major titles and growth areas such as esports.
AQ How have you increased capital efficiency? We are making progress with our growth
strategy and steadily improving ROE.
ROE, which we prioritize as an indicator of capital efficiency, is steadily improving along with performance growth. Of the three components of ROE, we place emphasis on the net income margin, which has seen further improvement following the progress of our growth strategy. Most recently, we have been focused on improving the balance between ROE and ROA, resulting in ROA improving to 10.1%.
We expect ROE to rise to 14.9% next fiscal year. This year, we will continue to improve ROE and ROA by performing multi-faceted checks on the PL that compare performance against net sales, the plan and the previous fiscal year, and by paying close attention to BS management.
Capcom employs two management methods to efficiently generate net cash. The first method is thorough management of returns on investment, where we carry out process management for investment return using a database that houses the ROI status of each title. If a title is progressing well, we continue investment as initially planned. However, if a problem is found, we

engage measures for early detection and resolution of the specific issues.
The second strategy is to maximize working capital efficiency. To this end, we are continuously monitoring our work-in-progress assets while creating a framework to manage our investment turnover period and turnover ratio in a more visible manner.
Net cash in the fiscal year under review was 44.6 billion yen, constituting a substantial increase. Further, “effective net cash,” which was adjusted for accounts receivable and the balance of obligations at the end of the fiscal year accompanying major releases in the second half of the fiscal year—a unique feature of our industry—increased to 53.5 billion yen.
Q What is the status of cash and Afund procurement?
We have secured levels enabling us to respond to the increasing scale of game development and longer sales periods.
Consumer game software development expenses have been on the rise since the current-generation of high performance, multifunctional game consoles arrived. Moreover, in addition to the fact that major titles take more than two years to develop, the penetration of digital sales has made long-term sales possible, and as a result, the payback period for investment funds is growing longer.
Given these conditions, we have positioned the
Effective Net Cash on a Historical Basis (billion yen)
commitment line as our method for procuring funds in case of changes to working capital, and in consideration of reserves for risk management and investment for primarily title development, we have set the level of cash and cash equivalents that must be maintained to be approximately one to two years’ worth of the amount we annually invest in development.
To achieve stable medium- to long-term growth, we recognize that it is critical to secure a sufficient amount of investment for the Digital Contents business, the source for our original IP. Specifically, in addition to an enhanced title lineup and new technologies, we must invest in hiring more developers and improving our development environment. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 we will allocate 29 billion yen, or 87% of total investments (R&D investment and capital expenditure totaling 33.5 billion yen), in the Digital Contents business. Moreover, we use the asset in-development turnover rate (net sales/work in progress for game software balance) as an indicator measuring investment level adequacy. In the fiscal year under review, the asset in-development turnover rate was 5.9 times, an increase compared to 3.7 times in the previous fiscal year.

  Aiming for sustainable growth by creating and developing popular IPs
In the past three years of overseeing development, my goal has been to ensure the world’s highest quality, working under the philosophy of standing up and facing whatever may come. The missions we focused on achieving this fiscal year were (1) producing both world-class quality and profitability, (2) creating hit mobile titles, (3) supporting development in pursuing esports and a long-term sales model, and (4) strengthening network technology for multi- player competition and the like.
Regarding item (1), following Monster Hunter: World (MH:W), Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5 were also highly acclaimed. Our Mobile Department, which integrated in 2017, has taken the lead on (2), promoting development both within Capcom and with partner companies, and creating a foothold ahead of upcoming title releases. For (3), the Street Fighter League has begun and various esports activities are underway with Street Fighter V as the primary point of focus. In terms of long-term sales, we are building a track record of sustained sales with the growth of digital sales for MH:W, which achieved 12.4 million units cumulatively. Regarding (4), we are strengthening our technology, including boosting our pool of talent. The results of our efforts have contributed to two consecutive years of record high profits.
Going forward, in addition to traditional models, it will be important to work with diversified platforms, given the rise in cloud gaming service providers and the expansion of PC store channels. To that end, we are striving to establish a foundation and enhance and improve our network environment for these new services and next-generation game consoles.
IP creation and development are also consistently subjects of discussion, and we will continue to evolve to meet the players’ expectations.
In development, it is crucial that we not cut corners in our craftsmanship while maintaining strict control over expenses. We are constantly scrutinizing our work to safeguard against ineffectual investment, while at the same time analyzing the market as we look for new global opportunities.
Main Pipeline (Plan for Fiscal Years 2016–2019)
Game development engines evolve in-step with games; maintaining an environment that enables
the pinnacle of craftsmanship
One of Capcom’s greatest game development strengths is that we have a proprietary game development engine, the RE Engine. Because we can update specifications according to our titles’ evolving requirements, this toolset allows us to operate a flexible and effective work environment optimized for our games, while creating photorealistic graphics. In addition, we maintain world class, cutting- edge facilities and have been actively investing in our development equipment and R&D buildings. When creators and engineers team up in an environment such as this, they can achieve the highest quality in the world. For details, see p. 38 of the 2017 Integrated Report.
Assigning younger employees to work on popular IPs; carrying on Capcom’s tradition of craftsmanship
Since 2011, Capcom has hired more than 100 new graduates as developers each year with the aim of building an organization of 2,500 developers by 2021. In order for us to both pass down the DNA we have cultivated on 20- and even 30-year-old IPs to the next generation of creators, while at the same time providing a catalyst for the evolution of our technology and world-class development prowess through these same young developers, we deemed it necessary to focus on in-house development.
In training young employees, we sometimes assign them to development teams working on major IP, where they can grow while gaining experience and know-how right at the cutting edge of the industry. We have also established a system to train highly capable young employees under the supervision of a supportive team, with the aim of training them up to core member status, where they would then take the overall lead on their next assignment.
This is how the development mechanism we have cultivated and the intellect of the creators we have trained crystallize to generate games that delight players the world over. It is the very essence of Capcom’s craftsmanship.

Monster Hunter World: Iceborne
    The “Monster Hunter Craze”
spreads globally
“We are going to knock the world off its feet with the new Monster Hunter, developed with cutting-edge technology.” This was the spirit with which Monster Hunter: World (MH:W) was released in 2018. Just as before when Monster Hunter became a national phenomenon in Japan, it was players getting together, inviting friends and having a blast while hunting that resulted in more than 12.4 million games shipped globally, as of March 31, 2019. This is a record-high for a single title in Capcom history. Further, fans posting their gameplay videos on social media has inspired newcomers to join in the fun, resulting in continued sales growth (predominantly of the digital version) even today.
At E3 and similar events throughout the world, I got a strong sense that Monster Hunter had been accepted by the gamers of the world, and that we’d generated high
expectations for a new experience in many of our fans. In answer to this, we launched Monster Hunter World: Iceborne (MHW:I) in September.

         From domestic favorite to global hit; celebrating
15 years of the
Monster Hunter series
The Monster Hunter series consists of hunting action games that pit players against giant monsters in a beautiful natural environment. In 2007, the release of handheld title Monster Hunter Freedom 2 ignited a phenomenon known as the “Monster Hunter Craze” in Japan. While the concept of an action game “played together” remains the same, the method of play has evolved over time, along with game consoles and internet connectivity. Released in 2018, MH:W has recorded the highest number of game shipments in Capcom history.
             to make it more easily understandable worldwide, but also added a new in-game action, the “Clutch Claw,” and a new area, the “Hoarfrost Reach.” We also implemented a number of new elements, such as making the new headquarters more compact and adding a difficulty level specifically for two-player hunts so that players can enjoy the excitement of the game while also enjoying the Monster Hunter experience best suited to them.
Expanding purchasing options with download content
With MH:W, the percentage of Monster Hunter users who purchased the digital version increased significantly across the globe. To meet these expanded needs, for MHW:I we are offering the game as a massive expansion that players can purchase and download. Of course, for players who are new to the hunt, we have a range of offerings, including a Master Edition set consisting of MH:W and MHW:I.
The series celebrates its 15th anniversary this year. While we build upon the game going forward, we will continue providing enjoyment to players, spreading the love for Monster Hunter

 Esports
    Following overseas, we look to establish an ecosystem for esports in Japan with Street Fighter
As a leader in esports, it is the current mission of our eSports Business Division to build out an ecosystem leveraging our versus fighting game title Street Fighter.
An ecosystem is a framework in which all stakeholders can broadly coexist and prosper in terms of management and services. For example, we envision a system like professional baseball and soccer, in which esports grows as a business and where professional players, teams, leagues, management and operations organizations, sponsors, distribution and broadcasting media, fans, and spectators can all enjoy and benefit from esports. In North America, such a system has begun to take hold, and in 2018 the global market grew to 90 billion yen, but the esports market in Japan is still in an early growth phase. Capcom is taking the lead in establishing this system, hoping to give esports in Japan a boost and expand even further globally.
Realizing early on games had potential
as a sport, Capcom made it fun for spectators from the start
Capcom has been holding tournaments for the enjoyment of watching as well as playing games since before “esports” was a word or even a concept. The players who won the national qualifying rounds of the Street Fighter II tournament in 1992 battled for the title of Japan’s No. 1 player at Ryogoku Kokugikan.
It was really the enthusiasm of the many overseas fans that ignited the flame beneath Street Fighter as an esport. In 2013,
the Capcom Cup was first held in North America, and each year thereafter it grew in popularity, boosted by brilliant stage production, live coverage, and video distribution of the intense player battles.

We believe that these tournaments serve to discover talented players and will lead to the launch of local professional teams, driving the popularity of esports from a regional level.

Considerations in Game Development
In-game purchases
In the Japanese game market, discussions have been taking place for several years on the problem of gacha, or lottery-style game mechanics, primarily in mobile games. Overseas, gacha-like “loot boxes” have been banned in some countries.
As a creator of entertainment culture, Capcom believes that games should be enjoyed for the entertainment value they provide with gameplay, not for thrills associated with winning a lottery. We do not want to see games that are supposed to make people happy having the opposite effect as a result of excessive charges. For that reason, we are working to ensure that all users can enjoy our games fairly and safely. In principle, we minimize gacha elements in the mobile games we develop; in our home video games, we provide any content required to enjoy the full game free of charge, while offering some additional content at low cost.
Localization and culturalization
Capcom games are enjoyed worldwide. In the fiscal year ended March 2019, the percentage of home video games sold overseas was 85.4%.
Naturally, translation (localization) of video games developed in Japanese is required so that users around the world can enjoy them. Depending on the country, however, simply translating games developed under Japanese norms can end up hurting users unexpectedly due to historical, religious, or cultural differences.
As such, we employ staff from around the world to culturize the games so that they can be enjoyed by all, regardless of locale.
For the Healthy Development of Young People
Compliance with the CERO rating system and endorsement of guidelines
The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), a Specified Nonprofit Corporation, was created to provide age-appropriate ratings for video games. Capcom complies with the CERO rating system and rules.
The rating system is an initiative for the healthy development of young people that calls for voluntary restrictions on home video game content and sales methods to limit access by young people to sexual or violent content. In addition, recent home video game consoles include a parental control function that enables parents to limit the online purchase and use of certain games according to their ratings.

Capcom localization staff are part of the development team from the first stages of a project, and they actively provide insight on everything from the visuals to the game specifications. Carrying out game development and localization simultaneously makes it possible to release titles on the same day worldwide. Of course, it’s not just a matter of translating the content; culturalization also plays an important role. For example, when you complete a quest in Monster Hunter, a red logo is displayed. However, in some countries red symbolizes failure. In those countries, we made the logo gold. This is just one of the touches we add to ensure that the user’s sense of achievement is not diminished in any way.

Addressing the WHO’s recognition of gaming disorder
In May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) included gaming disorder as a new mental health condition characterized by excessive use of games to the point where it has a negative impact on health and social life. Cooperating with industry organizations such as the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association, we are taking the appropriate steps to raise awareness of the issue in response to social demand. As an independent effort, we will continue to educate elementary and junior high school students on how to interact with games in a healthy manner through our educational support program.

 Support for Community-building Among Senior Citizens
Holding regular amusement arcade tours
Today, amusement facilities are becoming increasingly popular among senior citizens as spaces for communication with friends and facility staff. Since 2012, Capcom has held amusement arcade tours free of charge on long public holidays and Respect-for-the-Aged Day for senior citizens where they can try out coin-operated games and crane games, enabling more people to make use of such facilities.
In addition, as part of efforts to create arcades where senior citizens can comfortably enjoy themselves, since 2012 Capcom has encouraged arcade staff to get the Service Assistant certification. Currently, 26 staff members have received this certification.

This department is leading our efforts to address the risk of personal information leaks by developing a system of conduct guidelines, operational controls, and audits in accordance with the law.
Expanding opportunities for customers to play our games (esports)
In recent years, we have been focusing on promoting esports as part of our efforts as a creator of entertainment culture.
We have the role of planning and organizing events as a software developer—a role that had been largely shouldered by the player community in the past—in order to provide an environment that better allows competitors and fans to enjoy the excitement of competitions.
In 2018, we established the Capcom eSports Club as a communication space at one of our amusement facilities, offering a place to try out games for free. Further, in February 2019, we launched a new team-based league to give professional players a place to show off their skills on a regular basis.
We are also working to provide amateur players with opportunities to shine, such as by with the Street Fighter League: College-JP 2019 for students, beginning in June 2019. Through these activities, we aim to increase points of contact with our customers and improve customer satisfaction.

 User support and utilizing feedback
At Capcom, we have dedicated support teams for each product to ensure that customers can fully enjoy the services they purchase. We also strive to quickly respond to customer questions by providing online FAQ pages, while each person in charge regularly engages in information exchanges with other teams, working to improve customer satisfaction.
The questions and feedback our game support teams receive are condensed and analyzed to be incorporated in development of new products.

Protecting the personal information of our customers
Capcom has more than 10 million records containing personal information on customers, accumulated from our member site, prize deliveries, product purchases, and other sources. In 2015, the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information was revised, and the revisions went into full effect on May 30, 2017. Meanwhile, overseas, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018. The data of game players falls under the category of personal information in these laws, and the scope is expanding each year.
Under these circumstances, we established our new Information Management Department in April 2019 to enhance our information

Contributions to Regional Revitalization
Utilizing the appeal and brand recognition of popular games to contribute to society
The attraction of video game content for the worldwide audience was in evidence when Japan’s Prime Minister promoted the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games by dressing as a video game character at the Closing Ceremony of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. In the same vein, Capcom is following a Single Content Multiple Usage strategy for our content, which we deploy in a wide range of fields beyond video games. As such, we are proud to have a high level of recognition and popularity among men and women, young and old alike.
Based on our corporate philosophy of making people happy through games, Capcom has been engaged in the following four regional revitalization activities not only in Osaka, where we have our head office, but across Japan, since the mid-2000s: 1) economic promotion that supports the local tourism industries; 2) cultural promotion that supports education concerning local history and culture; 3) crime prevention education through coordination with the police; and 4) raising awareness about voting in elections in coordination with the Committee for Election Administration.
Further, going forward we will provide support for esports activities regionally throughout Japan while looking into activities to promote regional revitalization through playing games.

Sakai City
Sakai is the birthplace of Sen no Rikyu, the famed tea master, and has deep connections to important historical figures like Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Many of those historic and cultural artifacts can still be found within the city. However, it is difficult to get young people to take an interest in resources such as these.
As such, the city has made a point of collaborating with animated television programs and games that are highly appealing to young people. By working with Capcom to have Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a character from Sengoku BASARA, promote a special exhibit of the Golden Teahouse, which is associated with the historical figure of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, we were able to draw the attention of a wide range of people to the appeal of the city’s historic and cultural properties.
We hope to continue working on projects that link the rich contents of Capcom with the historical and traditional industries of Sakai.

Initiatives aimed at promoting the improvement of the work environment for women and proactively hiring non-Japanese
Capcom is currently engaged in initiatives aimed at improving the work environment for women and proactively hiring Non-Japanese.
In terms of providing an environment that facilitates women, we introduced systems enabling women to take a leave of absence before and after giving birth, childcare leave and shortened working hours, and promote their use throughout the Company.
In fiscal 2018, 33 employees took childcare leave, 12 of whom were men, and 100% of eligible women took childcare leave (fiscal 2017: 6 men and 100% of 19 women took leave). A high percentage of women returned to work afterwards: 32 returned in fiscal 2018—96.0% if those still on leave are excluded. This is the same as the previous year (96%, or 25 women, returned to work in fiscal 2017). As a result, despite it being said that Japan’s gaming industry is generally dominated by men, women account for roughly 21% of Capcom’s workforce, and 24 (9.4%) of Capcom’s managers are women. In accordance with the execution of the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace, in 2016 we formulated the General Employer Action Plan, which seeks to achieve two things: (1) having women comprise at least 20% of all of new graduates hired, and (2) having women comprise at least 15% of managers. In recognition of Capcom’s efforts toward improving the workplace environment for women, since 2014 we have earned the “Kurumin” mark, the symbol of a “company supporting childcare,” from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

  Promoting Healthy Relationships with Games
More than a decade of on-site classes for children in school
Video games are a comparatively new cultural phenomenon about which there is little academic research. Rather than examining the educational aspects, discussions tend to focus on the detrimental effects, such as what used to be called “game brain.” In recent years, official recognition by WHO of a game-related disorder has made headlines. However, the idea of a future career as a video game creator is very popular among children and the decision has been made to make programming lessons compulsory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020. A host of private sector efforts are also being carried out, including opening programming academies for youth. Considering these recent developments, it is reasonable to expect that the number of children hoping to become video game creators will increase further in the future. Additionally, the ratio of smartphone use among young people—45.9% of elementary school students and 70.6% of junior high school students—is rising each year. Game apps for smartphones are also increasingly gaining in popularity and the distance between video games and children is shrinking.
Given this context, based around a desire to promote understanding in society of video games, we accept student visits to our offices, with a focus on elementary and junior high school students, and also actively conduct on-site classes at schools to help promote sustainable economic growth and a sustainable society. At these events, Capcom conducts a program with two sessions: one is a career education support session, which introduces the work done in a game software company and the difficulty and rewards of that work, and the other is a game literacy education support session, which helps students use their own judgement to establish a healthy relationship with games. These programs have in turn been well-received in educational environments. Capcom has also incorporated opinions from educators to improve its educational efforts.
In fiscal 2011, Capcom launched a program focused on the educational theme of career education support in response to classroom requests. In fiscal 2013, Capcom started a new program on work and mathematics targeted towards elementary and junior high school students to help prevent children from losing interest in math.
As a result of these efforts, Capcom has welcomed 3,095 children as part of 380 different field trips to its offices (as of the end of March 2019). Capcom has also held 151 on-site classes for 14,107 students (as of the end of March 2019) at schools such as the one held at Kitanodai Elementary School in Sapporo in November 2018.

Society and Capcom
In terms of the proactive employment of non-Japanese individuals, Capcom is making efforts to strengthen overseas expansion capabilities including creating an English hiring website.
We currently employ 149 non-Japanese workers (representing 5.6% of our employees). Going forward, we will create a system for improving motivation in an attempt to increase the ratio of foreign employees, including support for career advancement and the promotion of non-Japanese individuals to management positions.
Providing a Pleasant Workplace
Promoting work-life balance
Creating entertainment culture requires that creators themselves make time for play.
At Capcom, we have established Paid Leave Promotion Days and encourage employees to take extended leave to refresh and look for new sources of inspiration during the year-end/New Year’s holidays as well as during the series of holidays in May. Additionally, we have built a four-story bicycle parking facility near our development studio and encourage our employees to live within a five-kilometer radius to shorten commuting times. This saves time and living costs while ensuring that creators have the free time necessary to cultivate their creative powers and imaginations, which is essential for creative work. Moreover, we opened “Capcom Juku” as an on-site daycare facility in April 2017 to provide a stable workplace environment for creators. As
it is located close to work, it provides peace of mind for employees who are married or have children, and has been well-received by those who have utilized it.
Please refer to the information below or page 54 of the 2018 Integrated Report.
Supporting employees’ health management
The employee cafeteria was renovated in 2016 when the new development studio was completed. Healthy meals are served for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
There is also a massage room
staffed by nationally-certified massage therapists at both the Tokyo and Osaka locations to support our employees in maintaining their health.
Employee cafeteria
Fulfilling employee potential in a cutting-edge environment
The biggest motivation for developers working in a creative field such as games is access to an environment that allows them to make their visions a reality. Capcom maintains a cutting-edge development environment that includes 3D scanners, a motion capture studio, a dynamic sound mixing stage, and a Foley stage. In this way, we support our creators in fullfilling their potential.
    Capcom Juku
Providing an environment for vibrant childcare combining day care and education
 Given the desire to quickly improve the issue of long day care waiting lists accompanying a lack of preschools, Capcom’s top management set its sights on the future and wanted to provide an environment in which employees can raise their children with peace of mind while remaining employed over the long term. We opened Capcom Juku in April 2017, aiming to add individual education and growth to standard day care for children. Capcom Juku goes beyond caring for infants and preschool children and accepts a wide range of youth, including after-school kindergarten and elementary school students. This helps employees avoid the stress of not being able to find open facilities for their children.
Furthermore, by offering educational support in the form of a place for learning English, eurhythmics, math, science, and other subjects, Capcom Juku joins its efforts with employees and fosters the growth of children. Currently, as of March 31, 2019, the school takes care of 25 preschool children a month and accepts as many as 25 temporary pupils a month.
Going forward, plans are in place to accept after-school students from nearby elementary schools, to add further convenience for working employees. Capcom Juku also offers Spring School and Summer School with classes taught by employee instructors when standard schools are closed for seasonal breaks.
At the Spring School held in March 2019, there were hands-on classes taught by employee instructors on programming, as well as motion capture, for creating game animations that incorporate human movement. Outside instructors were also invited for painting, English, and other classes.
Additionally, students were able to eat lunch with their parents in the employee cafeteria, which was an opportunity for encouraging parent-child communication.
In the future, we will create a learning atmosphere at Capcom Juku that stimulates and broadens children’s curiosity, while also striving for an environment where parents can work with peace of mind so that both they and their families can lead fulfilling lives.

Environmental
Environmental Action as an Entertainment Company
Capcom’s Digital Contents business accounts for over 75% of the Group’s consolidated net sales and entails the development and sale of software. This gives Capcom an environmental impact that is lower than general manufacturers. Because our environmental impact comes largely from the power used for office work and at amusement facilities, as well as from distributing our products, we are focused on saving energy.
Reducing Power Usage
Reducing CO2 emissions by promoting energy saving measures companywide
Capcom has worked to cut power usage through efforts that include ongoing power saving at all of its places of business, saving energy at its amusement facilities, and implementing peak shifting for the power used by PCs and other electrical equipment. In the fiscal years ended March 2012 to March 2014, energy usage trended upward at our amusement facilities in particular due to attempts to restore normal operations following shortened business hours necessitated by the Great East Japan Earthquake. However, since the fiscal year ended March 2014, we have cut CO2 emissions by installing energy-saving gaming machines and switching to LED lighting. The fiscal year ended March 2017 saw our CO2 emissions increase compared to the previous fiscal year due to the construction of the R&D Building #2 and Capcom Technical Center. However, energy-saving equipment has been installed at these facilities, and the CO2 emissions from these buildings have been reduced by approximately 10%* compared to the original plan.

Innovations in Product Distribution
Conserving resources through digital sales of game software
In previous console generations, games included a printed instruction manual inside the package, but with games for current-generation consoles, these manuals are now included as data within the software as a way to save paper. This enables us to eliminate approximately 10 million game units’ worth of paper manuals annually.
Moreover, the increasing popularity of digital sales, where games are downloaded after purchase, has made it possible to conserve resources used to produce discs, semiconductors, software packaging, and other components in addition to paper resources.
In the fiscal year ended March 2019, the resources used in the equivalent of around 15.3 million units of game software were conserved as a result of digital sales. We will continue promoting digital sales of game software with the aim of achieving effectively zero resource consumption in the future by selling solely via digital download.
Sharing distribution networks with other companies in the industry
Sharing distribution networks with other companies in the same industry when shipping products enables the efficient supply of products. As a result, we are able to realize reductions in packing materials, fuel and emissions.
Development and Manufacturing Initiatives
Reducing the environmental impact of pachislo machines
In solidarity with the efforts of the Japan Pachislo Machine Industry Association (Nichidenkyo), Capcom manufactures and sells pachislo machines partially made from recycled parts and equipped with standardized “green devices” aimed at controlling power usage.
Reducing the environmental impact of business machines
In addition to ensuring that we make products that are easy to recycle while using durable materials and components beginning at the design stage, we actively provide version upgrade kits to allow customers to use the same machines for the long term, simply adding or upgrading game data as they go.

Features of Capcom Corporate Governance
Three Features of Capcom Corporate Governance
 1 We are a company with an audit and
supervisory committee
Since June 2016, we have been a company with an audit and supervisory committee. The Audit and Supervisory Committee works so that internal controls function effectively, monitoring the business affairs of directors and employees based on our auditing policies. Additionally, to ensure that the committee can perform duties smoothly and appropriately, we have established an Internal Audit Division under its direct control.
Composition of the Board of Directors
2 We proactively appoint external directors
Capcom’s current ratio of external directors is 45.5% due to proactively appointing external directors since June 2001. The advice, opinions, and scrutiny provided by external directors increases the transparency and credibility of Board of Directors’ meetings and vitalizes the same, while also strengthening the function of the meetings to supervise management.
Percentage of External Directors (%)
3 We incorporate market opinions in management
Capcom’s IR Department engages in discussions with analysts and investors over 400 times per year. In addition to promoting understanding of management policies and business strategies, the IR Department applies these activities to corporate management, summarizing market opinions and providing feedback to management personnel. Capcom is also further enhancing events and tools for investors, strengthening shareholder and investor relations activities.

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Structure and Initiatives
Shareholders and investors have made the effective functioning of internal control into a key issue amidst an epidemic of corporate misconduct in Japan and overseas. In this section, Capcom will explain the corporate governance structure and systems that it has initiated so far based on the key concepts of “effectiveness and visibility” in terms of the results of third party assessment. (Assessment areas are highlighted in yellow.)

Corporate Governance Structure
Enhancing management soundness and transparency while responding to changes in the environment
Capcom is aware that comprehensive corporate governance ranks among management’s most important priorities. Because of this, in addition to enhancing management soundness and transparency, we are increasing corporate value by building a trusting relationship with our stakeholders. These stakeholders include shareholders, business partners, employees and regional societies.
Shareholders’ Meeting
(Convened on June 17, 2019)
Determines important matters as the highest decision-making body
The general shareholders’ meeting serves as Capcom’s highest decision-making body and determines important matters prescribed by laws, regulations, and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as well as serves as a place for communicating the audit results of divisional reports and consolidated financial statements.
Invitations to the general shareholders’ meeting are issued approximately three weeks before convening the session, and efforts are made to allow for greater attendance by having the session about 10 days before the date on which most other companies hold their meetings. We have also made it possible for shareholders to exercise their voting rights over the internet using a computer or smartphone. In addition, we participate in an electronic voting rights exercise platform for institutional investors.
(Convened 10 times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Management decisions that incorporate external directors’ opinions
The Board of Directors is composed of 11 directors (chaired by the Representative Director and Chairman of the Board), with five (45.5%) of the directors being external directors.
The Board deliberates on important matters stipulated by laws, regulations, and the Rules of the Board of Directors, and strives to strengthen supervisory functions through the guidance, suggestions, and active comments of external directors.
In order to enrich deliberations, a portion of decision-making authority for the execution of important business is entrusted to the representative directors, while matters brought before the Board are narrowed to those of high importance, and the number of times the Board of Directors is convened is reduced. As a result, the efficiency of business execution has increased due to quick decision making and dynamic management practices.
(Convened 10 times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Cooperating with accounting auditors and the internal audit department to audit and supervise
The Audit and Supervisory Committee (chaired by an external director) is composed of three directors (two of whom are full-time members), with two of the three directors being external directors.
In principle, the committee meets before a Board of Directors’ meeting is convened. The committee deliberates on important

matters stipulated by the Rules for the Audit and Supervisory Committee and strives to strengthen audits and supervision.
Audit and Supervisory Committee members selected by the same committee carry out on-site audits themselves and, in order to increase the efficacy of audits, carry out dynamic organizational audits, including issuing instructions and other actions as necessary to, among others, the Internal Audit Division (directly under the control of the Audit and Supervisory Committee). The Internal Audit Division strives to ensure that audits function effectively by reporting the status of audits and improvements, and other issues to Audit and Supervisory Committee members.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee
(Convened three times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Selection of candidates for director and deliberating and recommending details of director compensation
The voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee (chaired by an external director) is composed of five directors (two of whom are internal directors and three of whom are external directors), with a majority of members being external directors.
Each committee member is selected based on the Board of Directors’ appraisal of his or her knowledge, insight, experience, and other qualities.
In determining candidates to be nominated for director (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee) and candidates to be nominated for director who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, and for setting the compensation of directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee), the Board of Directors finalizes decisions from an objective, transparent and fair perspective after consulting with the voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee and receiving their recommendations.
The Compliance Committee
(Convened four times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Focusing on Compliance as an Important Management Issue
The Compliance Committee is composed of 10 directors (half of whom are external directors and the committee chairman is an attorney and external director). In principle, the committee convenes once per quarter.
Its primary activities are to analyze and assess risks to Capcom Group compliance and consider what action to take. In addition, the committee strives for early detection and prevention of legal violations or inappropriate conduct by finding internal risks and reporting their probability of materializing to the Board of Directors.
Ensuring and Verifying Accounting Transparency
Capcom has concluded an auditing contract with KPMG AZSA LLC for financial audits as prescribed by the Companies Act and financial audits as prescribed by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. There is no special relationship involving financial or other interests between Capcom and this audit corporation or the engagement partners at this firm who perform audits at Capcom.

Ensuring and verifying legal compliance and operating efficiencies
In order for effective audits to be carried out, Capcom has established an Internal Audit Division and determines auditing policies, schedules, methods, and the allocation of duties after the end of the general shareholders’ meeting.
The Internal Audit Division verifies and evaluates the status of employees’ execution of duties and the efficacy (and status of operation) of internal control systems, and reports to the Audit and Supervisory Committee. When needed, division members also accompany selected Audit and Supervisory Committee members and carry out on-site audits of offices and subsidiaries inside and outside Japan.
(Convened 18 times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Supporting the Board of Directors’ decisions
The Corporate Management Council (chaired by the Representative Director and Chairman of the Board) is composed of six internal directors and, in principle, is convened several days before a meeting of the Board of Directors, or whenever necessary.
In addition to meeting to carry out preliminary deliberations of Board of Directors agenda items, it also deliberates other important items.
(Convened 13 times in the year ended March 31, 2019)
Executing operations based on clear management policy
Capcom utilizes a Corporate Officer System. In addition to clarifying the roles and responsibilities of directors focused on management and corporate officers focused on business execution, the system boosts management efficiency by allowing officers to swiftly execute business following instructions from executive directors regarding important matters determined at the Board of Directors.
The Board of Corporate Officers is composed of 21 corporate officers (four of whom serve concurrently as directors), and in principle, convenes around the end of each month.
Each corporate officer reports on the status of business execution and works to ensure that information is shared, while also discussing business items and issues that require resolution.

Corporate Governance
 External Directors
Using external perspectives to ensure effective governance
External directors ensure the effectiveness of the corporate governance function by playing key roles in the Compliance Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. They also focus efforts on compliance and the prevention of corrupt or illegal activities, and openly exchange opinions and provide counsel at Board of Directors meetings in an effort to
strengthen the management audit function. The Secretariat staff helps with the work of the external directors who are not members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. For external directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, the full-time staff of the Internal Audit Division helps with their work.
Since all five of the external directors meet the criteria for independent directors, these five individuals have been registered with Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. as independent directors.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is consulted to ensure fairness and transparency
To ensure fairness and transparency, the Board of Directors consults the voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which has an external director as chairman, on the compensation of Directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee) and then sets remuneration based on this committee’s recommendations.
Policy for setting the calculation method and amount of directors’ remuneration
1 Regarding remuneration of directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee)
To ensure the fairness and transparency of remuneration for directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee), the Board of Directors consults the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which has an external director as chairman. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee considers each board member’s position, duties, tenure, and status as either an executive director or non-executive director, evaluates individual job performance and recommends an appropriate amount. The Board of Directors then makes a decision based on this amount.
a. Monthly remuneration is fixed.
b. The bonuses are set within a reasonable range based on monthly remuneration
and the Company’s performance.
The Company has adopted a single fiscal year bonus as short-term performance-linked remuneration. Upon consultation with the Board of Directors, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee deliberates on the following items, then makes a preliminary recommendation. The Board of Directors discusses this recommendation before making a final decision.
a. Monthly remuneration (fixed)
b. Consolidated operating income performance
c. Evaluation of individual performance
Board of Directors: Attended 10 of 10 meetings (100%) Board of Directors: Attended 10 of 10 meetings (100%)
Board of Directors: Attended 8 of 8 meetings (100%)

Board of Directors: Attended 10 of 10 meetings (100%)
Audit and Supervisory Committee: Attended 10 of 10 meetings (100%)
2 The remuneration of the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee
In order to secure their independence, the remuneration of the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee is not linked to performance; it is a fixed amount determined through discussions, taking the difference of full-time or part-time service and other factors into account, by the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.

 Third-Party Assessment
Promoting more “visible” governance
An analysis of an assessment performed by a third-party organization into the validity and effectiveness of Capcom’s corporate governance shows that the company ranked 31st among 3,592 listed companies in Japan in the “NEEDS-Cges” assessment developed by Nikkei Digital Media, Inc.
NEEDS-Cges has an established reputation as a system that quantitatively assesses corporate governance using scores on a scale of 1 to 10 for eight categories, including capital efficiency, information disclosure, and external regulations, among others, based on some 150 indicators calculated from data of publicly released company documents, such as financial reports.
As of the end of June 2019, Capcom’s total score was 8.00 points, placing us in the top 0.9% of Japan’s listed companies, exceeding the 4.94-point average for all listed companies and the 7.02-point average for the industry. We also received the maximum score of 10 for “information disclosure.”
The main evaluation factors are given in the table below, but areas highlighted in yellow indicate measures that received particular notice. Going forward, we will continue making improvements based on consideration of external data to earn an even stronger assessment, and further promote the external visibility of our governance by posting this and other data on our IR web page.

Financial Analysis and Corporate Data
  Outcomes from our perception gap study with investors (excerpts)
Q. Currently, Capcom is using Street Fighter to actively target esports. How much is this contributing to performance figures? Expectations are for the industry to grow, but is it still premature to expand in this area?
A. We have addressed this.
1. Explanation of the medium- to long-term business strategy
2. Disclosure of our expectations of profit from esports
Esports are rising in popularity recently and Capcom sees our response to this as an important management issue. To date, we have encouraged sales through promotions and esports events in the U.S., and further established a dedicated department in April, as we proceed to analyze this market.
In the coming three to five years, we will explore whether we can grow business opportunities and draw in casual as well as professional players as the market develops.
       Making Use of Shareholder and Investor Opinions
Reflecting results of dialogues with investors and analysts in management
Through meetings with investors and analysts, Capcom’s IR Department attempts to promote an understanding of management policies, strategies and future outlook. Furthermore, their opinions are gathered and provided to management, and are utilized for corporate management going forward. While we are headquartered in Osaka, these proactive IR meetings enable us to minimize asymmetric information as we strive to achieve appropriate corporate value.
In fiscal 2018, we set up top management meetings between the chairman and CEO, the president and COO, and investors where medium- to long-term strategies and the direction of marketing strategies were explained. This also included candid discussions concerning management and development. Furthermore, we hold an online individual investor briefing to allow individual investors from anywhere in the world to take part, as one of a variety of new pursuits informed by stock market views and demands. In addition, Capcom conducts a perception gap study every year targeting institutional investors and analysts in Japan and overseas. Being aware of investor perception gaps gives us feedback on corporate management and IR activities. Questionnaires are also given to attendees at our Presentation of Financial Results and individual investor briefing sessions, allowing us to make proactive use of market opinions as one criterion in management decisions. Specific initiatives and examples of considerations include: (1) holding efficient discussions combining IR and SR, (2) holding on-going management meetings featuring top management, and (3) reviewing the need for meetings that include personnel responsible for development and cover explanations of development policies and strategies.

The main reasons for this are to ensure fairness for a wide range of stakeholders, and because it ensures information is easily available for inspection immediately in approximately 200 countries worldwide. Capcom’s corporate website is also positioned as our most cost-effective tool and we strive to use it in various ways, including video content for communicating information and social networking sites for timely information updates.

Corporate Governance
Message from an External Director
63 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
 The management philosophy and corporate governance of Capcom’s leaders
 as seen by External Director Toru Muranaka
In the approximately three years since being appointed external director at the June 2016 Shareholders’ Meeting, I have seen steady activity directed toward growth in Capcom’s operational divisions, in addition to an unwavering approach to governance by top management. All of this has been against the backdrop of great change in the video game market as Capcom pushes to promote digital sales and global growth. I feel that my role is to present constructive questions to management personnel, drawing on my experience as an external director at other companies and my legal knowledge as an attorney.
Toru Muranaka
External Director Independent Director
Since being appointed external director, Q what have you noticed about Capcom’s
Board of Directors?
A The adoption of external directors is compulsory for a company with an audit and supervisory committee, and at Capcom independent external directors
account for more than one third of all its directors.
We receive explanations of agenda items before Board
of Directors meetings are convened and, on each occasion, have opportunities to exchange opinions on wide-ranging management issues not limited to those agenda items. The advice and input given during these discussions are then reflected in the deliberations of the Board of Directors. I feel that being able to grasp Capcom’s management risks, initiatives, and issues during these talks prior to Board of Directors meetings is effective in supporting discussions at the board meetings.
Additionally, although the schedule is irregular, independent external directors also set up opportunities to exchange opinions with the CFO and Company directors who are full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members, which allows us to discuss company-wide management issues that are difficult to fully delve into at Board of Directors meetings. Each independent external director focuses on Capcom’s management issues using his or her particular acumen, which I think represents a diverse range of talented human capital.
As an external director, what do you Q emphasize within Capcom’s Board of
Directors?
A Under its system of being a company with an audit and supervisory committee, Capcom’s Board of Directors entrusts deliberation on what is called
“execution of critical business” to the Corporate Management Council, which is primarily comprised of internal corporate officers, and said business is largely excluded from items brought up to the Board of Directors. Consequently, all basic matters related to business execution, except for business plans, budgets, and the like, are positioned as items reported on at Capcom’s Board of Directors meetings. As an external director, I draw on my experience in similar roles at other companies and my legal knowledge as an attorney, and make sure to present questions and opinions to the Board of Directors addressing the consistency of decision making and the logic of judgment rationale pertinent to management.
Since I am an external director who is not an Audit and Supervisory Committee member, I am not directly involved in audits by that committee. However, as the chair of the Compliance Committee, I am involved in reports and deliberations on the status of Capcom’s internal hotline and cases of compliance violations. Through these activities, I am committed to building ties with the Internal Control Division and other divisions, while also monitoring initiatives to prevent and, when necessary, quickly detect legal violations and inappropriate conduct.
    
   What is necessary to further strengthen Q the functions of Capcom’s Board of
Directors, and what are your goals going forward as an external director?
Under the strong leadership of the CEO, who is Capcom’s founder, the Company has not only handled risks, but has also channeled management
control, while also progressively building and rolling out organizational and control structures for corporate governance that contributes to achieving even more intricate and flexible business expansion.
A challenge going forward—which I, as an external director, would like to have a hand in tackling—will be developing a governance structure able to propose and promote new, effective growth strategies even if the current CEO retires.

 The fitness of Capcom’s growth strategies
 as seen by External Director Yutaka Mizukoshi
Since being appointed external director at the June 2018 Shareholders’ Meeting, I have closely observed the structure of Capcom’s marketing strategies from my perspective as a management consultant.
Going forward, I will offer my advice and input on formulating and rolling out future strategies as Capcom pursues the business of creating markets around the globe.
Yutaka Mizukoshi
External Director Independent Director
How do you feel about the current video game industry compared to the 1990s, when Capcom made its full-fledged entry into developing software for home video games?
It feels like just yesterday that a game could be built by a small team of developers over the course of a few months, and that physical cartridges were the
One year has passed since your
Q appointment as external director. How
do you feel looking back at the year?
A I get the impression that the environment surrounding Capcom is changing drastically. Even compared to a year ago, the digital strategies on which Capcom
focused and promoted have yielded clear results. Furthermore, I have a visceral sense of the possibilities for new business development as the rapid global momentum of esports also spreads into Japan.
In this environment, I think that my role is to help Capcom continue its growth into the future by using my experience and knowledge as a management consultant while—from an independent, outside perspective as an external director—actively providing suggestions and advice to help structure and organize the Company’s management. In particular, I would like to strengthen supervision of the Board of Directors by lending my efforts to building management-based marketing strategies.
Q
A
    only way games were sold. Through the advance of game consoles and PCs, plus the emergence of smartphones and the dramatic evolution of the communications environment, the platforms and sales regions of the video game market have rapidly expanded. Likewise, there has been a major transition in the industry’s business environment, as the method of providing the product is changing from physical packages to digital distribution. Responding to this evolution, and given the longer duration and increasing complexity of developing blockbuster games, I think the industry has become a highly developed area, second to that of the automobile industry.
In this type of business environment, our approach to core marketing practices is of the highest importance for management. We must work out plans for the story of our long-term corporate growth and profit maximization. In my opinion, we must strive for one approach unifying marketing, development, and sales.
  
    From your experience as a management Q consultant, what elements do you think
are necessary for improving corporate value?
A Management consultant professionals must offer concrete suggestions for transforming the companies we advise. At the same time, we have to provide
proposals that the company can execute with its own resources. In growth strategies, I think that, ultimately, the key
elements for video game companies are how human resources are leveraged and how their development structures and environments are organized.
In that sense, I think that Capcom’s key assets are being equipped with world-class development facilities, an environment with an array of high-tech equipment, and a successful track record of making quality games that have won the support of customers. I have seen a continuous stream of young developers who joined Capcom because they sought this sort of environment. Additionally, in terms of management, I would like us to maintain our commitment to creating new value alongside young talent while further creating a comfortable working environment for developers through initiatives such as the on-site childcare facility we have built.
What are the necessary elements for Q Capcom to grow its global business and
what are your goals going forward as an external director?
A Although video games are now widely recognized as a major industry, this is a somewhat new development.
As 5G, for example, emerges in the future, one of the features grabbing my attention is the elimination of latency in data transmission. This is expected to spur its adoption in various areas, including remote surgery in the medical field. In video games, too, I think there will likely be a revolution in content, through such activities such as multiplayer matches over the Internet.
Also, Capcom is carrying out other new initiatives, like esports, which could bring dramatic market transformations. My goal is to see Capcom, who owns globally competitive content, become a leading company in the video game industry.
To that end, as an external director, I would like to provide advice and input from various perspectives addressing Capcom’s framework for advancing its strategies. At the same time, I feel called upon to fulfill the role of managing risk while avoiding opportunity cost, as we strive to improve corporate value.
Going forward, it is my goal to create a framework that yields new business chances for Capcom, while, as an external director, providing encouragement for management strategies aimed at further global growth.

Consumer Market Characteristics (Package + Digital)
Package and digital download contents are a 29.9 billion dollar market, forecast to grow 60% over the next five years to 47.9 billion dollars by 2023. The customer base is primarily composed of core users who are highly loyal to game titles. They have relatively high willingness to purchase sequels and remakes along with low sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Hereafter, we expect the market to grow at a faster pace as we capture the casual user segment, which has high sensitivity to price conditions, as well as new users. This will come about in conjunction with a higher digital sales ratio, resulting from growth in Asia and emerging countries and expansion of online gaming on consoles, primarily in North America, shrinking the gap between the margin in this market and those in the other two markets. Please refer to page 71
Mobile Market Characteristics
This is a 75.3 billion dollar market, forecast to grow to 109.8 billion dollars by 2023. The customer base is primarily composed of casual users, many of whom play games in their spare time, thus they demonstrate the lowest loyalty toward game titles. In contrast to core users, they have a limited willingness to purchase games and have the highest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Although this is the most profitable among the three markets, only a limited number of titles are able to generate stable earnings over the long term even if they become hits. This makes brand establishment a challenge. Going forward, we expect smartphones will continue to drive rapid growth as the most pervasive game device. Please refer to page 71
PC Online Market Characteristics
This is a 41.6 billion dollar market, forecast to grow about 6% over the next five years to 44.1 billion dollars by 2023. The customer base is primarily composed of core users who demonstrate the highest loyalty toward game titles. They have a fairly strong willingness to engage in ongoing purchases, and are unique for having the lowest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Integration with the consumer market will likely progress as the online capabilities of consoles are enhanced, so growth of this market is expected to become sluggish in the future.

Consumer Market Characteristics
(Proportion of Net Sales: 77%) Package + Digital
Capcom’s core business is to create a multitude of original content for home video game consoles. The regular release of sequels to popular IPs and focus on digital sales have, in recent years, led to an increased digital sales ratio and a greater volume of sales as well as operating margins of up to around 30%.
Mobile Contents Market Characteristics (Proportion of Net Sales: 2%)
This business distributes games featuring popular Capcom content on smartphones, cultivating new markets such as the casual user segment to create new earnings opportunities. However, insufficient know-how in ongoing game operations, which differs from Consumer, has resulted in sales underperforming market growth.

 Market Analysis
Consumer Market (Package + Digital)
Consumer Market (billion dollars) 29.9 billion
2017 2018 Package Digital
In 2018, the consumer (package + digital) market picked up, increasing significantly to 29.9 billion dollars (up 22.5% from the previous fiscal year). This was due primarily to a large increase in digital sales, despite packaged sales remaining flat.
Digital sales have expanded rapidly in North America and Europe where such sales account for 88% of the market. The highly profitable digital contents market now accounts for roughly 63% of the consumer market.
The forecast for 2019 is for the market
Mobile Contents Market
In 2018, the mobile contents market was worth 75.3 billion dollars (up 26.8% from the previous year), expanding to more than half the size of the overall game software market. The main reason for this was the continued momentum of battle royale games that have been popular since 2017, driving growth of the market despite annual smartphone shipments declining for the second year in a row to 1.45 billion units (down 4.1% from the previous year) in 2018. By region, the Asian market including Japan was worth 42.1 billion dollars (up 18.8% from the previous year), the North American market was worth 17.5 billion dollars (up 54.7% from the previous year), the European market was worth 8.7 billion dollars (up

to reach 31.9 billion dollars (up 6.7% from the previous fiscal year) owing to continued growth of the digital market, despite continued shrinking of the package market as a result of current generation game consoles running their course.
In the medium term, we see digital sales expanding rapidly in Asia and new game delivery methods such as streaming and subscriptions performing favorably. As such, we expect the market to grow to 47.9 billion dollars by 2023 (up 60.2% compared to 2018).
44.9% from the previous year), and developing countries and other regional markets were worth 6.9 billion dollars (up 4.5% from the previous year), all showing continued growth.
In the medium term, the domestic market is maturing, but we expect continued growth in Asia and emerging countries. Moreover, once 5G next-generation mobile networks are up and running, it will be possible to deliver large volumes of content at high speeds, so we believe there is potential for market expansion. We expect the 2019 mobile market to increase to 86.6 billion dollars (up 15.1% from the previous year) and grow significantly to 109.8 billion dollars by 2023 (up 45.8% from 2018).

Arcade Operations Market
The domestic arcade facilities market grew during the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018) for the third year in a row to 485.9 billion yen (up 5.2% from the previous year). This was due to improvements in the number of visitors and sales per customer due to the continued effect of the restrictions on the time that minors can be in arcades while accompanied by a guardian being relaxed in the Entertainment and Amusement Trades Act (Entertainment and Amusement Trades Rationalizing Act) in June 2016.
The total number of stores decreased to 13,103 (down 7.4% from the previous year), but the number of units installed at each store increased to 33.2 (up 1.8 units from the previous year) owing to the continued increase in the number of large stores.

Gaming Machines Market
In the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), the gaming machine market shrank for the fifth consecutive year to 759.1 billion yen (down 14.1% from the previous year). This was due to pachislo machines being hit hard by diminishing investment appetite for gaming machines among halls due to sluggish operations of gaming machines with gambling restraints in response to changes to model certification methods and a decrease in the number of new stores opened.
Arcade Game Market
In the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), the arcade game market shrank to 143.7 billion yen (down 3.6% from the previous year) due to a significant decrease in sales as diversification of sales methods
previous year), demonstrating that the management streamlining many companies have engaged in, closing small unprofitable locations with fewer machines and focusing on profitable stores in good locations, has been successful.
This year (ended March 31, 2019), the market was strong overall, and growth continued owing to hit products appearing one after another in the prizes found in prize game machines, including large plush toys of popular characters and figurines for core users, as well as the expansion of simulation games on VR equipment.
In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2020), although we expect prize games to drive the market overall, there will be difficulties in conjunction with the consumption tax hike scheduled for October.
The market continued to worsen this year (ended March 31, 2019) as the market failed to recover despite the introduction of new machines compliant with the new gaming machine regulations revised in April 2018.
In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2020), we expect the shrinking of the market to come to an end as models with improved product value are gradually introduced ahead of a market recovery and replacement demand comes into play.

 Financial Review
CAPCOM CO., LTD. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Years ended March 31
 1. Operating Results
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, our industry remained strong overall despite a deceleration of mobile gaming in Japan and a patchy home video game market due to maturation.
At the same time, esports (electronic sports), which were adopted as a demonstration event at the 2018 Asian Games held in Jakarta, have grown in popularity nationwide owing to the establishment of league competitions and professional teams to expand the fan base. In such an environment, Monster Hunter: World, which swept the market in 2018, continued to report strong sales, surpassing 12.4 million cumulative units shipped, marking a record high for any single title in Capcom’s history. Additionally, our other flagship brands demonstrated their appeal
2. Revenue and Profits
(1) Net sales
In this fiscal year, net sales were 100,031 million yen (up 5.8% from the previous fiscal year). This increase was driven primarily by our core Digital Contents business. In Digital Contents, Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5 outperformed our expectations, while sales of catalog titles, in particular Monster Hunter: World, and digital downloads grew globally, contributing to increased net sales.
In the Amusement Equipments business, sales of our pachislo machines continued to be impacted by changes in model testing methods and legal amendments of recent years.
As a result, the number of units sold was down compared with the previous year at 7,800 units. Overall, however, favorable growth of the Digital Contents business offset this, resulting in a 5,516 million yen increase in consolidated net sales over the previous fiscal year.
(2) Operating income
Cost of sales increased to 62,809 million yen (up 4.9% from the previous fiscal year) and the cost of sales ratio was 62.8%, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio has decreased in conjunction with the increase in sales, stemming mainly from the hit success of major titles.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were
and boasted strong sales during the year, as Resident Evil 2 scored a major hit, selling more than 4.2 million units, while Devil May Cry 5, which enjoys established popularity overseas, shipped 2.1 million units. Meanwhile, we took strategic steps in cultivating the new business domain of esports, an area which has attracted increased attention in the past year. This included holding the Capcom Pro Tour Japan Premier at the Tokyo Game Show 2018, which generated excitement among spectators, and launching the Capcom Street Fighter League powered by RAGE in February 2019, leveraging the popular Street Fighter fighting game series, which many consider to have started esports.
19,078 million yen (up 2.7% from the previous fiscal year) and SG&A as a percentage of sales was 19.1%, down 0.6 percentage points compared with the previous fiscal year. The cause of the increase in SG&A was increased variable costs associated with increased sales, and the SG&A expenses ratio overall was under the 21.9% figure laid out in the initial plan.
As a result, operating income was 18,144 million yen (up 13.1% from the previous fiscal year), the highest ever and the sixth consecutive year of income growth. The operating margin also increased to 18.1%, up 1.1 percentage points compared with the previous fiscal year.
(3) Net income attributable to owners of the parent
Despite recording redundancy pay of 601 million yen in conjunction with the closing of the office of an overseas subsidiary this year under non-operating expenses, ordinary income increased to 18,194 million yen (up 19.3% from the previous fiscal year), following the increase in operating income.
As a result of these increases in income, net income attributable to owners of the parent amounted to 12,551 million yen (up 14.8% from the previous fiscal year) and the net margin came to 12.5% (up 0.9 percentage points from the previous fiscal year), making all income items the highest in company history.

  5. Our Financial Strengths
(1) High profitability of core business
Our medium-term goal is stable growth of operating income. We aim to achieve both improved profitability and profit growth by increasing development cost investment efficiency, carefully reviewing the profitability of each title and employing a strategy of selection and concentration on projects that can be expected to contribute to profits. Based on this policy, in the fiscal year ended March 2019, we were second among the five main players in the domestic market* in terms of operating margin (18.1%) despite coming in last* in terms of net sales (100,031 million yen). Our Digital Contents business was also second (28.1%) in the comparison of margins in game software sales, which is the core business of each company. As for our future outlook, there will be no change to our policy of maintaining high profitability, but in preparation for changes in the market associated with rapid developments in game-related technology, we will also need to make anticipatory investments in new fields. As such,
Profitability Comparison (Year ended March 2019)
we will make investments for the future while working to increase
the operating margin.
* We have selected competing manufacturers whose core business is home video game software. We compiled the rankings based on information disclosed by each company.
(2) Financial flexibility based on high free cash flow
In the fiscal year ended March 2019, net cash gained from operating activities amounted to 19,847 million yen, primarily as a result of hit major titles in our core Consumer sub-segment. Net cash used in investing activities was 2,261 million yen, which is the standard level for us. As a result, free cash flow came to 17,586 million yen. Compared to competitors with large businesses, we were third in terms of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net sales ratio of 17.6% is the highest among the five companies. This gives us a high level of financial flexibility compared to the industry standard. We will continue to promote measures for growth from a medium- to long-term perspective and work on further enhancing our capital policy.

  Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
Consumer (Package + Digital) sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), our major new titles were well-received globally, contributing to increased revenue. Resident Evil 2, the latest title in the flagship series, sold 4.2 million units, driving improvements to business results. Meanwhile, Devil May Cry 5 sold 2.1 million units, successfully reestablishing the series. Additionally, the launch of the PC version of Monster Hunter: World resulted in an additional 4.5 million units sold, bringing the cumulative total for the title to 12.4 million units. Other titles, including Resident Evil 7 biohazard and Mega Man 11, also performed well and gave a boost to revenue. In digital sales, the PC version of Monster Hunter: World made a significant contribution, while an increase in the digital sales ratio of new titles Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5, along with digital sales of high margin catalog titles also contributed. This resulted in a substantial increase in the number of units sold, bringing it to 15.3 million. Digital sales were up 52.4% from the previous year to 41 billion yen.

As a result, package and full-game download sales totaled 25.3 million units (up 3.7% from the previous year). Package sales were 35.9 billion yen, and digital sales were 41 billion yen. Together, they again resulted in higher Consumer sales of 76.9 billion yen (up 17.9% from the previous year). Digital sales, which have a high profit margin, were also strong, bringing operating margins to approximately 30%.
For Capcom, we continue to consider Consumer business growth as one of the keys to achieving our medium-term business goals.
Our initiatives are to (1) strengthen digital sales, (2) bolster our title lineup through the full-scale execution of our 60-month and 52-week maps and (3) awaken dormant intellectual properties.
Under (1), the prevalence of digital selling has made it possible to implement measures such as limited-time sales, increasing flexibility in pricing and expanding the impact of marketing. We utilize our existing intellectual properties (IP) in addition to major titles and additional content and rerelease past titles on current-generation hardware in order to create sales opportunities and increase the digital sales ratio. In terms of (2), we have been working to establish an efficient development system for core titles by preparing 60-month and 52-week maps since March 2015. We will establish a system that allows us to release core titles on a regular basis. Finally, for (3) we will revive dormant intellectual properties for which we have not recently released new titles by increasing the number of our developers.
Next fiscal year, we will release Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, a massive expansion for Monster Hunter: World, to solidify the brand globally. The focus on digital sales has made it possible to reach regions that were once difficult to access, so we aim to further expand global sales by focusing on catalog sales of Monster Hunter: World, Resident Evil 2, and Devil May Cry 5. As a result of these efforts, we expect to increase unit sales to 26.3 million units (up 4.0% compared to the previous year) and for the digital sales ratio to come to 75.4%, a substantial increase from the previous year. Accordingly, we forecast increased profit

2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 (Plan)
despite an 18.5% drop in net sales from the previous year to 62.7 billion yen.
Mobile Contents Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), performance of existing titles such as Monster Hunter Explore and Snoopy’s Sugar Drop declined due to maturation of the market. Additionally, the launch of alliance titles in Japan and Asia that was planned for this year was postponed until next year.
As a result, net sales decreased to 2.3 billion yen (down 43.9% from the previous year). Profits were also down this year following licensing revenue recorded in the previous year received in conjunction with alliances in Asia.
In the future, we will continue to explore a wide range of possibilities, including developing new titles using our intellectual properties and forming alliances with companies in Japan and other countries. We will work on development in the mobile field and accumulating operational know-how. We will also promote technical research on development of apps utilizing the 5G next-generation wireless standard.
Next fiscal year we expect net sales of 4.1 billion yen (up 78.3% from the previous year) due primarily to distribution of new titles like Sengoku BASARA: Battle Party and TEPPEN an alliance title released together with GungHo Online Entertainment, Inc.
PC Online Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), net sales fell to 3.7 billion yen (down 22.9% from the previous year) due to the declining contribution of existing titles Monster Hunter Frontier Z (MHFZ) and Dragon’s Dogma Online (DDON). Profitability was restored with elimination of the amortization burden of DDON.
Capcom will continue to work on improving our revenue base by reducing SG&A.
In light of the blurring of the lines between PC online and consumer games, this disclosure segment will be consolidated under the Consumer business starting next fiscal year.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), relaxation of restrictions in the Entertainment and Amusement Trades Act that took effect in June 2016 continued to provide favorable conditions for a sustained recovery in market size. In addition to increased sales per customer resulting from more time spent in arcades, the draw of prizes featuring specific characters and popular products, higher operating rates of newly released cabinets, and other factors contributed to results.
We also launched an online crane game service that allows players to operate the game remotely using a computer or smartphone to win original prizes.
Additionally, as an esports undertaking, events were held at the Capcom Esports Club at Plaza Capcom Kichijoji, and tournaments were held at stores in six cities around Japan to expand the field of users.
As for stores, Plaza Capcom Hiroshima was opened in Hiroshima, and we launched Capcom Net Catcher Cap Tore, an online crane game, while Plaza Capcom Tsuchiura was closed in Ibaraki Prefecture. This brought the total number of stores to 37.
As a result, same store sales were up 2% from the previous
year, bringing segment net sales to 11.050 billion yen (up 8.0% from the previous year) and operating income to 1.096 billion yen (up 24.6% from the previous year), so that both sales and profit were up compared with the previous year.
In the next fiscal year, Capcom will promote streamlining of management through its ongoing scrap-and-build policy and continue opening stores in places with strong customer drawing power. We will also work to expand the user base by providing playable demonstrations of consumer titles and operating original stores utilizing our intellectual properties.
We plan to open five facilities, including Plaza Capcom Ikebukuro, bringing the total number of stores to 42.
As a result of these measures, we expect same store sales to be down 4.0%, and we forecast net sales of 11.2 billion yen (up 1.4% from the previous year). We expect lower operating income of 700 million yen (down 36.1% from the previous year) due to factors such as the consumption tax hike and the burden of initial investments in new stores.

  Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), five pachislo machines (Okami–Kaidouhen–, Street Fighter V, Mega Man Ability, BIOHAZARD into the Panic, and Sengoku BASARA: Heroes Party) were launched by the Pachinko & Pachislo (PS) sub-segment, and 7,800 units were sold. Additionally, in the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment, we focused on catalog sales.
Changes in the market environment resulting from such things as changes to methods of pachislo machine model certification continued to have an impact, causing a substantial decrease in the number of units sold. As a result, net sales fell to 3.422 billion yen (down 56.1% from the previous year). The loss on valuation and loss on suspension recorded in the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment in the previous fiscal year were eliminated, but a loss on valuation and loss on suspension were recorded for some titles on top of the decline in income associated with decreased revenue in the PS sub-segment. As a result, we recorded an operating loss of 2.668 billion yen (compared to an operating loss of 764 million yen the previous year).
In the next fiscal year, Capcom will keep an eye on trends as the situation remains uncertain in the midst of a difficult market
environment in the PS sub-segment, despite some replacement demand. Under these circumstances, we will review our development system with an eye toward releasing machines built to current standards in order to impress hall operators and end-users. We will continue to (1) develop machines not dependent on speculation and that feature a variety of entertaining video elements and playing styles and (2) secure a strong sales network and improve machine quality through an alliance with a major sales company. In this way, we will supply proprietary cabinets for current standard machines and work on improving profitability through restoring the market’s evaluation of us.
In the next fiscal year, we plan to release three models and sell 15,000 units (7,200 units more than the year under review). As a result, we expect net sales to increase to 4 billion yen (up 16.9% from the year under review) and to record 100 million in operating income owing to the elimination of the loss on valuation and loss on suspension recorded in the year under review.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2019), we worked to improve our brand value through such efforts as broadcasting the animated television shows Gyakuten Saiban: Sono “Shinjitsu”, Igiari! Season 2 and Gakuen BASARA. We also established a dedicated department for creating business opportunities in the esports market, which is expanding rapidly worldwide, and held our first league competition utilizing Street Fighter, one of our leading IP which has a high affinity with esports.
As a result, net sales increased to 2.575 billion yen (up 10.2% from the previous year), but operating income decreased to 811 million yen (down 28.0% from the previous year) due to upfront investments, including increased prize money for esports events and holding events to expand the field of users.
We will continue to leverage our strength of being able to reap substantial synergetic benefits with the Consumer Games businesses by diversifying the use of our rich library of intellectual properties (content) and rolling them out across various mediums, including movies, animated television programs, theatrical productions, and events. Additionally, in our esports initiatives we are focused on expanding the player base from a medium- to
long-term perspective, and as part of this will create the STREET FIGHTER LEAGUE: Pro-US in the United States and the STREET FIGHTER LEAGUE Pro-JP professional league in Japan, as well as new university and arcade leagues that will serve as gateways to our professional league in Japan.
We will also continue to actively leverage our intellectual properties (content), based on our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy with a stage play called Zangeki Sengoku BASARA Tenseihoukan and the Monster Hunter 15th Anniversary Orchestral Concert—Hunting Music Festival 2019—, as we work to increase the value of our core brands through adaptations and collaborations.
As a result of these measures, we expect net sales to increase to 3.0 billion yen (up 16.5% from the previous year), but due to continued upfront investments in esports, we expect to record an operating loss of 400 million yen.

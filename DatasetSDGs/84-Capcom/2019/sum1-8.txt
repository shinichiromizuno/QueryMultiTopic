We are working to secure and train outstanding developers based on our desire to make the most entertaining games in the world. Though the closure of our development studio in Canada in the fiscal year ended March 2019 resulted in a temporary decline, the number of developers has nearly tripled over the past 10 years. We are working to improve the technical skills and motivation of our employees by such means as developing a system to train up new graduates to be fully capable team members within three years, promoting younger and mid-career employees to work on major titles, and putting together an environment that empowers developers to create the games they want to create.

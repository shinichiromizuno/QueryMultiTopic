We are working to secure and train outstanding developers based on our desire to make the most entertaining games in the world, which has resulted in a nearly three-fold increase in developers over the past 10 years. We are working to improve the technical skills and motivation of our employees by such means as developing a system to train up new graduates to be fully capable team members within three years, promoting younger and mid-career employees to work on major titles, and putting together an environment that empowers developers to create the games they want to create.

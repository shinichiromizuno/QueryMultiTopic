 Genesis
1983, Capcom Co., Ltd. was established in Osaka.

In line with structural reforms conducted in the fiscal year ended March 2004, operating income increased steadily until the fiscal year ended March 2009. In the fiscal year ended March 2010, the postponed release of major titles and the failure of some titles to meet sales targets overseas resulted in a temporary decline in income. In the fiscal year ended March 2011, we promoted profit structure reforms aimed at more efficient development investment. We promoted business restructuring by transitioning to in-house production and strengthened our digital download strategy in response to rapid changes in the market beginning in the fiscal year ended March 2013. As a result, operating income and operating margins underperformed until the fiscal year ended March 2014 while these reforms were implemented. However, since the fiscal year ended March 2014, operating income has increased for five consecutive fiscal years thanks to growth of the Consumer and Amusement Equipments businesses. Notably, in the fiscal year ended March 2018, the hit performance of Monster Hunter: World resulted in record income, and the operating margin also improved.

In the fiscal years ended March 2010 and March 2012, net sales declined due to the postponed release of titles. However, the promotion of structural reforms in the Consumer business resulted in Capcom achieving net sales of 100 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 2014 for the first time. Although net sales decreased significantly in the fiscal year ended March 2015 due to a delay in pachislo machine releases, the steady release of major titles from the Consumer business since the fiscal year ended March 2016 has resulted in an increase in net sales for three consecutive fiscal years.
2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (Years ended March 31)
Performance was sluggish in the fiscal years ended in March 2010, 2013 and 2014, as (1) a complete overhaul to the Amusement Equipments’ underperforming profit structure, (2) development structure revisions in line with enhanced digital downloads in the Consumer business and (3) strengthened Mobile Contents business management capabilities in line with development organization integration resulted in the recognition of special losses on restructuring and business restructuring expenses. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, income increased five years in a row due to the benefits from development organization reforms beginning to manifest.

At Capcom, we believe the generation of creative and original content is the source of corporate growth, thus 90% or more of our annual development investments are allocated to the Digital Contents business. Recently in the Consumer segment, development costs have been trending higher in line with increasingly high-performance hardware, but we have been able to streamline development through increased employee utilization rates. Due to expanding our lineup, costs have been on the rise since the fiscal year ended March 2008; however, we expect them to remain around 30 billion yen going forward.

The balance of work in progress for game software has been on the rise in line with increasingly high-performance hardware. In the fiscal years ended March 2011 and 2014, it decreased with the release of major titles. Since the fiscal year ended March 2015, it has been increasing again with expansion of the lineup and release of new-generation hardware, but in the fiscal year ended March 2018 it decreased owing to the release of Monster Hunter: World and the reevaluation of some unprofitable titles.

Up to the fiscal year ended March 2016, Capcom had a basic policy of maintaining stable dividends, and in the fiscal years ended March 2009 and 2011, the annual dividend was raised 5 yen in conjunction with improved business results. Since the fiscal year ended March 2017, the basic policy has been to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30% and to strive for stable dividends. As a result, the annual dividend per share in the fiscal year ended March 2018 was 60 yen, the highest ever in the 28 years of continuous dividends since our listing.

Although net assets increased between the fiscal years ended March 2007 and March 2009, stable net income resulted in ROE of around 14%. In the fiscal years ended in March 2010, 2013 and 2014, this figure declined due to decreases in net income from the recognition of special losses on restructuring and business restructuring expenses. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, ROE has once again been on the rise on the elimination of special losses and improved profitability.

 Financial and ESG Highlights Present
 ESG Highlights
At Capcom, we believe that sustainable growth is achieved by delivering social and economic value, while at the same time building healthy relationships with stakeholders from the unique perspective of a game publisher.

We are working to secure and train outstanding developers based on our desire to make the most entertaining games in the world, which has resulted in a nearly three-fold increase in developers over the past 10 years. We are working to improve the technical skills and motivation of our employees by such means as developing a system to train up new graduates to be fully capable team members within three years, promoting younger and mid-career employees to work on major titles, and putting together an environment that empowers developers to create the games they want to create.
Securing a pool of human resources with diverse thinking is an important element for developing world-class games. For that reason, we are promoting diversity, working on building a workplace where women can excel, and actively hiring foreign nationals. We are tying this into the creation of all-new intellectual properties and successful, unconventional collaborations.

To Create the World’s Most Entertaining Games
Targeting Stable Growth through Management Systematization and Content Branding
Six Elements Required for the Sustainable Enhancement of Corporate Value
It has been 35 years since I founded Capcom. However, I have no interest in past successes. Even now that we have once again achieved record earnings, we are always focused on the world in 5, 10 or 50 years from now, wondering what we should be aiming for and what kind of mechanism can we create that will lead to sustainable growth.
I believe this will require the linking of six elements: a corporate philosophy and culture that fosters the ambitions and values set out at our founding,
a business model that is a competitive advantage,
important management indicators that function as quantitative guideposts, a management strategy focusing our strengths, a relationship with society and governance that reduces risks and enhances sustainability.
On the following pages, I will explain to our shareholders how we are favorably and uniquely positioned with respect to each of these six elements that facilitate the sustainable enhancement of corporate value.

1 Corporate Philosophy and Culture —Aim to be the Best in the World
“From Osaka to the World”: Our Motto, and
The DNA to Continue Taking on Global Challenges
 I jumped into the world of entertainment 50 years ago with the idea that “games are luxury items, not essentials. This is why the brand must be of world-class quality.” I still believe this to be true even today.
Accordingly, Capcom’s basic philosophy is to create an entertainment culture through the medium of games by developing highly creative content that excites and stimulates the senses. In other words, we help build an emotionally rich society by creating entertainment culture with the world’s most entertaining games. For details, please refer to “Corporate Philosophy” on page 02
In 1983, I founded Capcom under the motto of “originality and ingenuity,” with the vision of developing games offering world-class quality.
Underpinning this was my belief that increasingly
sophisticated graphics and more immersive worlds would eventually make games as moving and impressive for the world as a Disney film.
35 years later, I have amassed more than 2,900 colleagues who share this vision. Under the slogan “From Osaka to the World,” these values have become our corporate culture and DNA, with (1) a spirit that is always eager to take on new challenges and (2) a sense of pride to constantly strive to be world-class deeply ingrained in every Capcom employee.
Again and again, we have been able to produce unique series, including Street Fighter, Resident Evil and Monster Hunter because of the fertile soil of a corporate culture cultivated over many years.
2 Business Model —Competitive Advantage Centered on Global IP
Business Development Leveraging Development and Technological Capabilities and Brand Advantages
Capcom’s strengths are (1) the development and technological capabilities to create world-class, high-quality games and (2) numerous popular branded IP known the world over.
In addition, for the past six years, we have hired over 100 new employees every year, increasing our development staff to over 2,100 people and further enhancing our strengths. From game market characteristics and competitive factor analysis, the Consumer sub-segment has high entry barriers; combining the aforementioned strengths with our capital and the relationships of trust we have with hardware manufacturers creates significant competitive advantages (profitability). Against this backdrop, in the consumer market, technological standards and development costs rise with each hardware cycle,
resulting in a situation where only branded popular titles continue to sell over the long term, creating a situation where consumer spend and time is more concentrated. For details, please refer to “An Analysis of the Market and Capcom” on page 73
Furthermore, in sub-segments other than Consumer, our rollout of popular IP across multiple mediums contributes as a stable source of earnings. This is because, in addition to the fact that our IP consists of products developed 100% in-house, possessing numerous global IP amplifies the effect of our multiple usage strategy. Also, marketing activities utilizing Hollywood movies further enhances the global competitiveness (brand power) of our IP, and maximizes synergistic effects. For details, please refer to “The COO’s Discussion of Growth Strategies” on page 29

3 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) —Focused on Stable Growth for 5–10 Years into the Future
Creating a Framework Using Systematization
and Establishing a Leaner Structure by Improving Performance Indicators
 1. Analysis of Management Performance in the Fiscal Year Ended March 2018 (Summary)
In the fiscal year under review (ended March 2018), we achieved the fifth consecutive year of operating income growth, and all profit items from operating income downward reached record highs. What I want to point out here is that (1) we successfully positioned Monster Hunter: World as a global brand, (2) catalog sales (past titles, including rereleases and HD versions) also grew, increasing the density of our earnings platform and (3) digital unit sales rose to 53%. All three of these items are part of our growth strategy and demonstrate our successful executions of these initiatives up to now.
For details, please refer to “Financial Review” on page 79
2. Medium-Term Management Goal Assumptions and Indicators (KPI)
(1) Management Direction—Thinking About What to Target in the Next Five Years
I am always thinking about what our management targets should be in the next five years. In this way, I am even able to quickly notice small changes two years from now. And, at present, our management policies are to (1) create exciting, world-class content (IP), (2) maximize earnings by leveraging our rich library of IP across multiple platforms and media and (3) maintain these activities to become a company of continuous, sustainable growth.
(2) Management Goals—Stable Growth Every Year
We have established operating income growth each fiscal year as the goal for achieving the above. Rather than struggling to coordinate major title launch periods for this, we intend to take a natural approach of establishing a model of stable growth through build-up by expanding our title lineup among other efforts. This will enable institutional investors managing pensions and individual investors on fixed incomes to maintain long-term holdings with confidence. As we are emphasizing annual growth, we have not announced a specific rate of increase, but we are considering a profit growth rate between 5%–10%.
(3) Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and Shareholder Value Creation Achievements
In terms of management, I place importance on operating
income (growth indicator) as the basis of corporate earning power, operating margins (efficiency indicator), which are the basis of profitability, and cash flows.
The game industry is prone to drastic change; in terms of engaging in management that is always focused five years ahead, we use the above fundamental indicators, as well as a matrix that compares figures to net sales, year-over-year and to our forecast, to check for anomalies and quickly identify and address problems. This has led to a 204% increase in operating income and a 9.3-points improvement in operating margins over the past 10 years, placing Capcom at the top compared to other companies in our industry.

Further, if we improve these performance indicators, ROE and other related indicators also increase, creating shareholder value. Specifically, in line with improved margins, ROE has improved for five years straight. And, in the fiscal year ending March 2019, the equity spread (ROE – cost of capital) is expected to be 8.46%, adding to corporate value and exceeding the average for companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (3.28%) as well as those in the same industry.

In addition, I think it is important to reward shareholders who trust our Company and hold Capcom shares over the medium-to-long term, and I have strived to deliver sustainable earnings growth and returns to shareholders. As a result, over the past five years capital gains and dividends, which constitute total shareholders return (TSR), are 27.85%, beating TOPIX (12.91%) and propelling Capcom to the top position compared to other companies in our industry.
Going forward, we will create a framework for management systematization with the aim of creating a leaner corporate structure by improving basic performance indicators. For details, please refer to “Financial Strategy According to the CFO” on page 39

4 Management Strategy —Development and Marketing Strategies Focused on Strengths
Enhancing Brands and Expanding Customer Segments with Proprietary Development and Marketing Strategies
1. Investing in Human Resources and Development Equipment to Create World-Class Games
“Without pursuing advancement, we cannot create world-class games.” As a manager in the game industry for 50 years, I have always said, “World-class games are not just entertaining, they must also be technically advanced.” The evolution of hardware and rising quality of market entrants are proof of this. Accordingly, we must amass human resources that are highly skilled in areas such as programming and the visual arts. We are already engaged in this effort.
I focused on future game market expansion and technological advances, and for the past six years Capcom has hired over 100 new employees every year. Neary all of them are “game natives” who have played games since they were very young and have witnessed the advances in games of the past 20 years. Moreover, they are overflowing with energy, and desire to use their skills to develop new markets, which is why they joined Capcom, whose DNA is rooted in a focus on global markets.
To make the most of the talents possessed by our gang of game natives, we are creating mechanisms for human resource development and aggressively investing in the world’s most advanced R&D centers and development equipment. For details, please refer to “Investment in Human Capital” on page 51
2. Marketing Strategy for Creating Global Brands
Another critical factor is our approach to marketing, focused on branding and increasing awareness of hit titles.
As it takes about three years to develop a game, we used to have issues with a progressive decline in recognition during development. I came up with the idea that the most effective method for ongoing media exposure of game titles was to expand globally using Hollywood movie adaptations. In 1994, we decided to invest 4 billion yen to make a Street Fighter Hollywood movie. At that time, some thought I had taken up movies merely as a hobby, but this investment generated a 15 billion yen return and successfully established Street Fighter as a global brand. Although games receive only about two weeks of media exposure before and after their release, factors that led to the success of this Hollywood movie include (1) the theatrical release, (2) Blu-Ray and DVD sales, (3) cable television broadcasts and (4) broadcasts at hotels and in airplanes. It has been rebroadcast numerous times over years and decades, which has led to maintaining and even increasing the recognition of this title.
A condition to taking this marketing approach is that the games are of world-class quality; Capcom has already succeeded in a similar way with the branding of Resident Evil. We will continue to utilize this branding approach with other Capcom IP.

ESG-Based Value Creation Financial Analysis and Corporate Data
3. Growth Strategy Aimed at Increasing the User Base of Each IP
As the founder of Capcom, I think it is important to create a structure for passing the business on to the next-generation. As with any structure, building the foundation is the most challenging part, but efforts launched five years ago are finally starting to take shape. To establish solid growth strategies and further enhance corporate value, there are two risks that are critical to address; first, I will talk about the stable growth mechanism (control of earnings volatility risks).
To mitigate earnings volatility risks over the medium-to-long term, measures enabling sustainable growth must include (1) transforming the foundation of our Consumer business model from a traditional one-time sale “transactional model” to a continuous “recurring revenue model” and (2) creating a business portfolio and diversifying earnings risks by thoroughly leveraging Capcom’s basic strategy, Single Content Multiple Usage. [Diagram 1]
Historically, earnings in Capcom’s core Consumer business fluctuated depending on whether or not we created hit titles. Although we achieved some success (controlled earnings volatility) through timing the releases of multiple hit titles in the past, it did not meet my objectives for stable growth.
However, since 2013, game consoles have been equipped with robust online functionality, enabling us to develop growth strategies around digital elements.
Specifically, new titles [Diagram 1-A] will work as growth
Diagram 1
Medium- to Long-Term Growth
Profit Medium-term
drivers as we (1) release approximately three major titles each year, (2) extend the sales life of these titles to 3–4 years with additional content and pricing strategies and (3) strengthen our presence overseas, which comprises approximately 85% of the total market.
Next, in terms of catalog titles [Diagram 1-B], we will grow our user base and generate profits on a recurring revenue basis through (1) download sales of past titles and (2) rereleasing past hit titles for current-generation game consoles.
Furthermore, our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy has not yet been of a scale sufficient to offset volatility in Consumer games. In Mobile contents however, through the advance of G (generations of communication speed) and K (display resolution) technologies, we will build a business foundation as a second pillar for future growth by thoroughly leveraging our core strength of IP while pursuing in-house development, alliances, M&A and a variety of other possibilities.
In addition, with a focus on growth of the esports
market five years from now, we will strengthen title
branding and attempt to commercialize the esports business. [Diagram 1-C]
In the game industry, which is often called the “hit business,” Capcom will establish a management structure and strategy able to achieve sustainable growth other companies have yet to achieve while enhancing corporate value.

5 Relationship with Society (S) —Global Human Resources and New Market Cultivation
Developing Global Human Resources and Contributing to Society through Game Development
I believe that corporate value is enhanced by resolving social issues through business activities. This includes the development of human resources able to play an active role on the world stage, the creation of new markets using cutting-edge technologies and the building of healthy relationships with stakeholders from the unique perspective of a game maker while generating social and economic benefits.
1. Building a Healthy Relationship Between Games and Society
Traditionally, games have provided joy and stress relief; in recent years however, following an increase in mobile games, new issues such as minors spending large amounts of money on in-game purchases, real money trading (RMT) and game addiction are beginning to appear. In recognition that this is a substantial problem for the industry overall, companies are working together primarily through industrial organizations to (1) establish guidelines and educate, (2) share information on issues and examples among member companies and (3) regularly exchange information with guardians, educators, consumer organizations and governments.
For details, please refer to “Relationship with Customers” on page 55
In addition, Capcom conducts game literacy and career education to spread awareness of the proper way to interact with games as part of its educational support activities. These efforts are aimed at supporting the healthy development of young people and easing the concerns society has about the influence of video games.
For details, please refer to “On-Site Classes” on page 56
2. Commitment to Regional Communities
The promotion of our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy provides society with a wide range of benefits. Specifically, these include the use of popular Capcom IP in local revitalization activities to support (1) economic development, (2) cultural development, (3) awareness for improved public safety and (4) awareness of elections. We are achieving quantitative social outcomes through solving the common problem of attracting and appealing to the youth demographic. For details, please refer to “Regional Revitalization Activities” on page 57
At the same time, these four activities deliver value to Capcom in the form of (1) improving existing customer satisfaction through event participation and (2) enhancing the image of games among the middle-
aged and seniors. With respect to (2) in particular, this segment cannot be considered current customers, thus by contributing popular content to local communities, we are able to cultivate new game players through apps and games on their personal smartphones and devices.
3. Commitment to Employees
As can be seen from the fact that personnel expenses (costs) account for approximately 80% of development expenses, the game industry is a labor-intensive industry and an extraordinarily knowledge-intensive industry, thus human resources are an especially important management resource.
I recognize the importance of diversity for creating content that will resonate globally, thus Capcom promotes the retention and training of talented human resources without regard for gender or race. One example of our results from this is the creation of a hit title in a new genre thanks to a development team led primarily by women. We also conduct various development programs, because human resource development is directly linked to strengthening our R&D capabilities. In addition, we not only bring together the world’s most advanced development facilities and technologies, but also ensure a robust working environment that includes facilities such as Capcom Juku, an on-site daycare center, all of which allows developers to concentrate on their work. Regarding remuneration, in addition to regular bonuses, Capcom has introduced a system offering incentives and assignment bonuses for each title in an attempt to further increase motivation.
Furthermore, rather than a mere daycare center, I want to make Capcom Juku a facility for learning that looks after children until they enter middle school. The children who buy games are the ones investing the most in Capcom. Thus, we must give something back to these children. Japan is trailing the United States and other nations in the fields of AI and IT, but we will rise to the challenge with human resources capable of competing globally. To this end, we will support children until they enter middle school and those who join Capcom will be developed into business people and game creators that can succeed on the world stage. I think this is the best we can give back to Capcom supporters. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Employees” on page 53
In my view, the most critical aspect of human resource development is providing an environment

that enables employees to take on new challenges. The manager’s role is to push employees to take on one new challenge after another, leaving alone what works and devoting their energy to devising measures when things are not working. This enables employees
to take on challenges without fear of failure, develop the world’s most entertaining games and create new businesses leading to a virtuous cycle that creates business opportunities.
6 Governance (G) —Management Visualization Mechanism Creating the Next Generation
Designing Systems and Developing
the Next Generation of Management to Reduce Management Decision Risks
 As Capcom further accelerates its growth strategies, the risks become proportionally higher, but I believe that governance is effective at reducing and avoiding these risks.
Specifically, with myself, Capcom’s founder, as CEO and my oldest son as COO, we can avoid management decision risks by sufficiently leveraging the supervisory function of the Board of Directors, which includes external directors, and building an unique mechanism for highly transparent and rational decision making. [Diagram 2]
Mechanism 1 Management Visualization Based on Numbers
Despite changes in corporate scale or business environment, to conduct flexible and integrated management, I require that materials (documents) used for decision-making are, in principle, quantitatively

and forecast comparisons
focused. Specifically, these materials compare and contrast net sales, year-on-year performance and earnings forecasts, which make it easier to identify problems by enabling us to confirm complex combinations of data.
Furthermore, these materials are used by external directors for supervisory purposes and provided to investors as part of our IR activities. This is part of the mechanism I call “management visualization.” Management decisions based on visualizing operations enable us to evaluate the Company with two sets of eyes using a system attempting to achieve management transparency.
Even when I talk with developers, numbers are the common language. Using only qualitative words and sentences leaves significant room for arbitrariness on the part of the person in charge. In comparison,

 numbers enable comparisons from a variety of angles, facilitating decisions based on real conditions.
The risk control efforts I am focused on now involve passing on the management know-how I have accumulated as founder to the next-generation of management through actual practice and ensuring the Company functions reliably in the future by systematizing management. Both of these efforts are beginning to bear fruit.
Mechanism 3
Developing Management Human Resource Capabilities and Grooming Successors
 27 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2018
Mechanism 2
Organizational Design that Leverages the Supervisory Function of External Directors
Within corporate management, people’s character and spirit are important management resources that have a substantial impact on corporate value. In the 2016 integrated report, I discussed my management philosophy and capabilities as founder. At present, one of the concerns among our investors is the thinness of our management team as a founder-run company; in other words, have we prepared a management structure (successor plan) for the next generation?
Key people for the next-generation are President Haruhiro Tsujimoto and Executive Corporate Officer Yoichi Egawa. Both have the qualities necessary for management.
For example, I have chosen my oldest son, President Tsujimoto, as my successor for two major reasons. The first is because he knows more about games than anyone else. He has assisted me since he was in middle school and Capcom was still a small company akin to a neighborhood business. As a result, he has accumulated over 40 years of experience in the industry with knowledge spanning the construction of game machines to software development.
The second reason is that he is prepared to stand his ground as a member of the founding family. Since he was a student, Haruhiro Tsujimoto has been willing and intended to take over the family business as the oldest son. He has looked after employees who joined Capcom as new graduates and their families for 50 years, and even when earnings were lackluster, he continued to create entertaining games for children, who invest the most in Capcom. Only a person who is willing to stand and fight can accomplish these things. I cannot allow Capcom to be run by someone with the tendency to give up as soon as his position becomes difficult.
Of course, as a Company, governance is important. Assuming the organization functions properly, the creation of this mechanism is as explained above.
In last year’s report, I discussed Yoichi Egawa’s qualifications. In addition to my intense and thorough training of these two very different types of people, when combined with the corporate culture we have cultivated over many years and the aforementioned management visualization and systematization, I believe I have prepared a deep management team that our long-term investors will think are the type of people they can rely on as managers.
For the past 19 years, Capcom has executed a variety of governance reforms.
Since introducing the external director system in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, external directors have increased to account for 45.5% of the Board of Directors. This stemmed from one particular investor’s concern that “as a founder-run company, Capcom can quickly make management decisions and respond to changes in the business environment, but isn’t there a risk of arbitrary decisions and execution?”
External director appointment criteria have not changed since the system was introduced, but in short, we appoint directors with insight who are highly proficient specialists in their respective areas, capable of objectively making decisions regarding Capcom’s management and business activities. With the avoidance of business investment risk as a priority issue, Capcom appoints individuals from Japan’s leadership class (in terms of business crisis management, law and government) who are able to provide sound opinions, especially when earnings are subpar, who are not intimidated by the company founder and are able to determine validity from the general public’s point of view.
I have determined that we must further enhance our management foundation to execute thorough risk management and ensure the stability of Capcom operations.
In addition, we proactively demonstrate the results of these supervisory mechanisms and monitoring in dialogues with investors. This arose due to a question from an investor back in 2013, who asked “Capcom’s Governance Report states that the Board of Directors engages in lively discussions, but is this really true?” We considered the fact that this effective mechanism was unrecognized to be a problem, so in the following year we began publishing Board of Director discussions in our Annual Report and holding small meetings between external directors and institutional investors, which led to deeper mutual understanding.

Rewarding Long-Term Shareholders with 28 Consecutive Years of Returns Since Capcom’s Listing and Record-High Dividends
1. Basic Policy Regarding Dividends
During my 35 years of management since founding Capcom, my philosophy has been to pursue stable corporate growth and reward long-term shareholders with steady increases in dividend payments despite the constantly changing nature of the game industry.
I have already mentioned the factors critical for sustainably enhancing corporate value; as shareholder returns are also an important management issue, dividends are determined with consideration for future business development and changes in the management environment.
Capcom’s basic shareholder return policy aims to (1) enhance corporate value through investment in growth, (2) continue paying dividends (30% payout ratio) while striving for stable dividends and (3) acquire treasure stock to increase the value of earnings per share.
The reason I think both the payout ratio and stable dividends are important is, for example, because a sudden decrease or cessation of dividends can be the difference between life and death for pensioners who depend on dividends to cover part of their lifestyle expenses. Regular and stable revenue enables the
reliable establishment of future lifestyle plans. We also receive requests for stability from the long-term investors who manage those pensions.
Capcom shareholders represent all types of people, and I assume some of them may be facing these kinds of issues, which is why we have never once failed to provide dividends during the 28 years since we went public in 1990, and have doubled our dividend amount over the past ten years. [Diagram 3]
2. Dividends for This Fiscal Year and the Next
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the annual dividend reached an all-time high of 60 yen. In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2019), we plan to pay an annual dividend of 30 yen, which after our stock split, will substantively amount to another all-time high dividend similar to that in the year under review.
As a senior manager with 50 years of experience in this industry, my goal is to increase market capitalization and achieve corporate growth exceeding that of the past 35 years to continue meeting the expectations of all Capcom shareholders.

Promoting Digital Strategies to Meet Diversifying User Needs
The game market this fiscal year was invigorated by favorable sales of game consoles from each hardware manufacturer, becoming a year in which we saw innovations including the rise of esports and new online game genres.
Currently, the aspects of the market I am focused on are (1) the further expansion of digital download sales in the consumer market, our core business, and the changing relationship between publishers and customers via the Internet; (2), ongoing changes in the mobile market toward the next stage, from a business model that is, as I pointed out last year, over-reliant on “gatcha” lottery-style mechanics; and (3) increasing expectations for growth in the esports market as an opportunity for revenue as well as potential changes in the social value of games.
In the rapidly advancing game market, Capcom
will continue accelerating our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy, globally developing our rich library of IP, one of our strengths, for a variety of media while controlling performance volatility and realizing operating income growth every year by expanding our customer base.
To this end, in the consumer market, we will expand our new title lineup and continue promoting sales of catalog titles while strengthening trend analysis and promoting targeted approaches to meet diversifying user needs. Further, as an option for growth over the medium-to-long term, we will implement initiatives aimed at creating hit titles in the mobile segment and expanding the adoption of esports.
On the next page, I will explain the specifics of Capcom’s growth strategy.

 In Addition to Strengthening the Global Development of New and Past Titles, We Will Pursue Revenue and Profit Growth Using a Digital Approach to Sales
The consumer market is expected to grow to 35.6 billion dollars by 2022 (a 45.9% increase compared to the 2017), thus Capcom continues to position our Consumer business as our driver of growth. We have improved profitability and steadily advanced toward a recurring revenue model through ongoing initiatives that include the expansion of our new title lineup and sales promotions of catalog titles through strengthened digital downloads, achieving margins that were generally in the 30% range in the fiscal year ended March 2018. Maintaining this basic strategy, we will better respond to the needs of existing customers and increase satisfaction by utilizing networks to strengthen marketing activities, while pursuing increased brand value, including the acquisition of new customers, and promoting further profit growth and a higher level of earnings stability.
Measure 1 Steady Annual Launch of Core IP in Global Markets
Since structural reforms in the fiscal year ended March 2013, and the full-fledged use of our strategic map (60-month), we have formed a title portfolio focused on stable growth and established a mechanism for placing more than 2,000 developers on a 52-week
map at the required time on the required development team. As a result, we shortened the launch cycle for each series, enabling the launch of multiple major titles each fiscal year. Please see page 45
Based on this structure, I think there is substantial room for growth in the European and North American markets, which comprise 85% of the consumer market, and in addition to Resident Evil and Street Fighter, which are already popular in these markets, our strategic plan to make Monster Hunter a global brand with the release of Monster Hunter: World resulted in the sales of a record 7.9 million units in the fiscal year ended March 2018.
We will analyze the factors behind this success, developing and deploying this information as established know-how within the Company. At the same time, we will proactively recruit new graduates to increase our number of developers to 2,500 people by 2021, in order to increase the number of new major titles we release to global markets. [Diagram 4]
For the time being, we will place a priority on maximizing the revenue from current core IP, while also actively utilizing dormant IP. Please see page 47 As the creation of new IP is also indispensable for medium- to long-term growth, we will concurrently create new brands as well.

Measure 3 Game Business Digital Shift For some time, I have thought the game business could
be made more efficient by utilizing state-of-the-art internet technology. My sense is that our industry has not yet sufficiently introduced the digital marketing and online promotion measures commonplace in other industries.
In the past few years, we established the Global Marketing Group and engaged in improvements resulting in Monster Hunter: World becoming the first title on which management, development and business came together to make full use of the internet to expand sales and realize improved quality. For example, the analysis of global user preferences gained through the distribution of an online demo version contributed to this record-breaking hit, and we are beginning to apply this method to titles that will be released from next fiscal year onward.
The critical factor is to extract and analyze data from the standpoint of user satisfaction being extremely important for luxury items like games. This importance will continue to increase going forward as digital natives familiar with the internet and social media since birth grow into core segment game users.
Amid the global expansion of markets, it is essential to develop detailed IP brand strategies. To comprehensively analyze user attributes, platform ownership status and price sensitivity for each IP, Capcom established a specialized department utilizing new analysis tools in April of the year. We will aim for global coordination by integrating the development, marketing and sales departments to further promote earnings and brand maximization.
The merits of digital downloads include (1) improved profitability due to package production cost reductions and avoidance of inventory risk (full-game downloads), (2) additional earnings opportunities through full-game downloads of catalog titles, which can be difficult to sell in packaged form at physical retail shops, and (3) anchoring players by providing content on an ongoing basis and acquiring additional revenue (additional content).
In addition to new and catalog core IP titles, Capcom has strengthened full-game downloads for rereleases on current generation game consoles, and digital sales are growing steadily. In particular, catalog titles and rereleases/remakes Please see page 43 for current-generation game consoles have contributed to revenue over the long-term as we have promoted the transition to a recurring revenue model. We are close to achieving our medium-term objective of a 50% digital download sales ratio.
There is still a lot of room to expand our lineup, including with dormant IP, thus we will endeavor to expand earnings going forward. [Diagram 5]
Moreover, with regard to additional digital content, Capcom is focused on improving user satisfaction with free additional digital downloads to increase fans of the brand and achieve growth from the next title onward. We are developing paid additional digital downloads, such as costumes, weapons and other items, with the main objective of satisfying players in a way that is not directly related to game progress.

  Promoting Collaborations and Support for the Next Generation Aimed at Transforming Non-Growth Areas Despite achieving consolidated earnings with record high profit, in the mobile domain we continue to lag behind other companies in our industry. At the same time, there is a sense that the “gatcha” business model that swept the market has reached its peak, and because the appetite for leading IP continues to increase, our analysis is that there is still significant room for potential growth due to Capcom possessing a large number of core action game IP. We will promote measures focused on both the medium and long term in an attempt to achieve growth in the mobile segment where the strong global growth rate is expected to continue.
we have been undertaking projects with multiple collaborators with track records of hits in Japan or overseas. Of these, at least two titles are planned for release in the fiscal year ending March 2019. [Diagram 6]

In the mobile segment, the next-generation

of communications time lags and the creation of

IP, distinctive for their high-quality graphics, on mobile devices. [Diagram7]
At present, our development divisions are engaged in technological research and the acquisition of development know-how to ensure we are able to seize this coming opportunity for growth.
To pursue every possibility for mobile growth, since last fiscal year Capcom has been making a full-fledged effort toward alliances utilizing our IP in conjunction with companies specializing in the mobile segment. We aim to enhance our operational know-how in the mobile business, an area in which we have lacked the requisites for success, to improve game content and better implement timely events within games.

Esports stands for “electronic sports,” which are video games played in competitions viewed as sporting events. Since the late 1990s, esports have been gaining popularity in the United States and Europe, and at present, various companies sponsor these competitions and there are numerous professional leagues and teams driving the worldwide popularity of esports mainly among younger segments.

Establishing a Foundation and Promoting the Spread of Esports to Prepare for Future Monetization
 Accelerating Initiatives in New Areas with the Establishment of Dedicated Departments and Increased Investment At present, esports is the area of gaming attracting the most interest in society. By 2021, the esports market is expected to grow to $1.65 billion, 1.8 times larger than its scale in 2018. Competitions with substantial prize money amounts and the success of pro gamers are drawing interest. [Diagram 8]
Amid these developments, in addition to being held as a demonstration event at the 2018 Asian Games, esports are also being considered for inclusion at the 2024 Paris Olympics, while in Japan the Japan Esports Union was created as a unified sports organization. I have made esports our new focus area, and by continuing to lay down a foundation for the future, we will work at the industry level to spread esports and establish it as a new form of entertainment that people can enjoy.
Measure Initiatives Focused on Top Professionals and Expanding the Field of Amateurs
In terms of esports initiatives, Capcom already has an established track record that includes the Capcom Pro Tour, an international competition utilizing Street Fighter. In the fiscal year ending March 2019, under
the leadership of a new dedicated department, we aim to strengthen investment and expand the scope of our activities, including hosting our first major competition in Japan to promote an environment conductive to the spread of esports domestically. Specifically, we will bolster activities targeting top players, such as increasing the number of competitions and size of prize money, and issuing professional licenses to top-ranked athletes and other professionals. We will also hold qualifying competitions for amateurs and provide an environment that includes spaces for playing esports. This is because we think the participation of a wide range of people, from children to adults, is important for the full-scale adoption of esports and its elevation to a level of popularity similar to that of baseball or soccer. Although we will incur expenses in the short term, the building of a foundation for this market over the next five to ten years will enable esports to blossom as a major business over the medium-to-long term. Further, we think that increasing awareness and understanding of esports throughout wider society through its inclusion as an Olympic event and growing the player population will lead to improving the status of the game industry and contribute to society.

7.9 Million Units is Highest in Capcom History
Popular Series Grows into a Global Brand
The first Monster Hunter game, released in 2004, created a social phenomenon referred to as the “Monster Hunter craze,” firmly establishing it as a national pastime in Japan. However, the growth of its popularity overseas was an issue: in contrast to its domestic popularity, overseas sales were only one quarter those in Japan.
To address this, with the launch of Monster Hunter: World in January 2018, Capcom rolled out a variety of measures aimed at propelling Monster Hunter into a global brand.
Of these numerous measures, one involved the series’ first global simultaneous launch date. This facilitated the simultaneous dissemination of information throughout the world, attracting the attention of a greater number of consumers.
Additionally, Monster Hunter: World was developed for high-end consoles with globally large installation bases. As a result, we were able to satisfy game players who expressed their desire to play a more technologically advanced Monster Hunter, an

Monster Hunter: World was the first title in this series to have a global simultaneous launch date. It was also available in 12 different languages in an effort to cultivate users in new regions. Members of the development team also traveled the globe to aggressively promote the title, providing the latest information to the world and successfully maximizing awareness ahead of the launch date. As a result, five million units were sold in just the first three days, becoming the best launch of the series so far.

These efforts were successful, and without any loss of core series fans, we were able to overcome linguistic and cultural barriers to earn high praise from users around the world and achieve shipments of 7.9 million units, a Capcom company record. Further, we succeeded in capturing overseas users, with an overseas sales ratio of approximately 60%.
Furthermore, the PC version of Monster Hunter: World was released worldwide in August 2018, and in order to further cement its position as a global IP alongside Resident Evil and Street Fighter, we will continue working to further grow sales.

 Title Introduction
Monster Hunter Series
Hunting Action Game in Which
Players Face Off against Giant Monsters in Magnificent Natural Settings
The Monster Hunter series is a hunting action game in which players face off against giant monsters in magnificent natural settings. Establishing a new communication style of online collaborative play in which friends cooperate to battle giant monsters, this title created a social phenomenon in Japan known as the “Monster Hunter craze.” Since the first title in this series was launched in 2004, the number of fans has continued to increase over the past 14 years, growing into an extremely popular series with a cumulative 48 million units sold (as of March 31, 2018).
3 Optimized Game Content Based on User Feedback
Capcom uses social media and other sources to ascertain user preferences and trends in an attempt to improve game content. Monster Hunter: World game content was also improved by incorporating user feedback. For example, many users in the United States and Europe said that it was difficult to understand whether or not their attacks were having any effect during the game. After numerous careful discussions, we implemented a system for displaying damage to monsters not used in previous titles, among other advances that have proved popular with existing and new users.

Typically, beta testing is conducted to test server loads, but in this case, it also had a promotional effect as users who played and enjoyed the game disseminated information about it independently to the gaming community. Additionally, being able to respond in earnest to defects discovered during beta testing enabled us to successfully engage with existing Monster Hunter fans while introducing newcomers to the brand.
Beta testing conducted three times starting in December 2017 and continuing on into January 2018

 Street Fighter V
Rebounding from Adversity: Combination of Ongoing Updates and Esports Significantly Grows User Base
Creating Gameplay that Enables Everyone from Core Players to New Comers Alike to Play Together
Released in 1991, Street Fighter II’s innovative battle system made a splash, driving it to become a record hit title that established the fighting game genre. With the support of fans throughout the world, cumulative shipments in this series have surpassed 40 million units, cementing the brand’s popularity.
However, despite Street Fighter V (released in February 2016) aggressively taking on several challenging initiatives to pursue new advances in the series, the game suffered server issues beginning on the launch date, preventing us from providing a smooth play environment.
Naturally, Capcom is prepared to address such problems, and in order to resolve these, as well as other aspects that users were dissatisfied with, we implemented various measures using the PDCA cycle. For example, we rebuilt the server environment from the ground up, and carried out continuous updates to augment the game’s content. Further, while building on this concept, we

Issue Server Troubles on Day One
Based on a development concept of “reboot,” Street Fighter V was released in February 2016 following a rethought approach to game creation aimed at enabling a wide range of users to play the game. Although we took on new challenges with respect to both the software and the network environment, server issues affected areas such as fight matchups and loading times, which resulted in an inability to provide a smooth game play experience. Our first mission was to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.
released a number of highly demanded new characters and costumes.
Additionally, Street Fighter commands a presence among fighting games in the esports arena, and is utilized in the Capcom Cup, the official global tournament held since 2013, as well as at EVO, the world’s largest fighting game competition—events that work to draw in audiences who enjoy watching fighting games and convert them into new players. These multifaceted efforts led to restoring fan trust and recovery of the brand.
Going forward, we will continue to provide updates and implement flexible pricing to further expand the Street Fighter user base.
Also, while maintaining an eye toward the adoption of league competitions within esports, we will conduct initiatives unique to Street Fighter that entertain fans throughout the world.
Measures Continuous Improvements Incorporating Community Feedback
With Street Fighter V, to resolve server issues as well as other elements users were dissatisfied with, we repeatedly implemented a number of measures using the PDCA cycle. For example, we bolstered the game’s content with the addition of highly demanded, new characters and costumes. We also rebuilt the server environment from the ground up, and although this required time to accomplish, through repeated and continuous updates we were able to provide a more complete product.

 Title Introduction
Street Fighter Series
The Gold Standard of
Fighting Games that Continues
to Be Loved Throughout the World
The Street Fighter series was launched in 1987 as an arcade game title, after which Street Fighter II, released in 1991, became a massive hit. The game’s innovative fighting system became all the rage, establishing the fighting game genre, with the series going on to a cumulative 40 million units of software shipped worldwide (as of March 31, 2018). Street Fighter has gained popularity over the 30 years since its launch and continues to grow as a driving force in the esports fighting game segment.
Success Popularity in Esports, Recovery of Trust and Brand
In addition to the aforementioned efforts, from 2013 support has blossomed for Street Fighter in overseas esports events, primarily in North America. Drawing in both players and fans who enjoy watching fighting games has created a synergistic effect with regard to game software sales. As a result, the Metascore of Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, launched in January 2018, has risen significantly, restoring trust among fans and enabling brand recovery.

Progress Growing the User Base with Pricing Strategies and League Formation
Going forward, we will engage in ongoing updates and are considering a strategic lowering of software and add-on content pricing to further grow the user base. As price sensitivity is particularly high overseas, this will be an incentive for those who have been hesitant to make a purchase. Also, given the success of team league competitions in esports, we will promote the full-fledged formation of leagues outside the North America region to acquire more new players. We will leverage initiatives unique to Street Fighter to continue captivating fans throughout the world.

Kenkichi Nomura
Director, Executive Corporate Officer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
Q Having achieved record profits, are there any changes to the financial strategy?
We will maintain efforts to increase A capital efficiency and improve net cash.
Capcom is executing a growth strategy aimed at
enhancing corporate value over the medium-to-long
term. We are conducting R&D investment amounting
to approximately 30 billion yen each fiscal year, to
enhance our development environment and strengthen
the title lineup in our core Digital Contents business.

and improving net cash to build a strong and flexible financial base to make this investment possible.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018,
investments based on this growth strategy led to record-breaking major title hits, resulting in all-time high profits that increased cash on hand. In our industry, which continues to rapidly advance, the rise of numerous new technologies and services is also increasing our investment options.
That being said, I will maintain the standards we have established for investment decisions and strive for selection and concentration while engaging in a thorough review of the cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and other costs to achieve an even leaner financial foundation. Moreover, we will stably secure a financial base at a level commensurate with the scale of investment to enable flexible investment in projects with high strategic priority, such as the development of major titles contributing to enhanced IP value, and growth areas including esports.

ROE (%) 10.6 11.6 13.4 13.4
We forecast ROE of 13.4% in the next fiscal year. We will perform composite checks comparing ROE to net sales, to the forecast, as well as year-over-year in order to continue improving these three factors.
Q How will Capcom secure net cash and manage risks?
We will carefully manage ROI for each title A and visualize working capital efficiency.
For Capcom to efficiently generate net cash, we formulated two financial strategies focused on generating cash flows through process management. The first is to thoroughly manage return on investment. Accordingly, we manage a database housing the ROI status of each title while ascertaining and analyzing investment profitability. The second strategy is to maximize working capital efficiency. To this end, we are creating a framework to manage our investment turnover period and turnover ratio in a more visible manner.
Moreover, net cash in the fiscal year under review was 36.7 billion yen, constituting a substantial increase. Further, “effective net cash,” which was adjusted for accounts receivable and the balance of obligations at the end of the fiscal year accompanying the release of a major title in the second half of the fiscal year—

We focus on ROE as an indicator of capital efficiency, which is steadily increasing with performance growth. Of the three components of ROE, we place emphasis

maintained to be approximately one to two years’ worth of the amount we annually invest in development. This amount is supplemented with cash on hand (46,539 million yen) as well as an unused 26.7 billion yen commitment line of credit (total contract value: 26.7 billion yen) to maintain an appropriate range.
Q Specifically, what kind of growth strategy investments do you make?
We invest 84% of management resources A in the core Digital Contents business.
To achieve stable medium- to long-term growth, we recognize that it is critical to secure a sufficient amount of investment for the Digital Contents business, the source for our original IP. Specifically, in addition to an enhanced title lineup and new technologies, we must invest in hiring more developers and improving our development environment. Accordingly, we will allocate 84% of management resources (R&D investment and capital expenditure totaling 34.5 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019), amounting to an investment of 29.0 billion yen, in the Digital Contents business. Moreover, we use the asset in-development turnover rate as an indicator measuring investment level adequacy. In the fiscal year under review, the asset in- development turnover rate was 3.7 times, an increase compared to 2.9 times in the previous fiscal year.

  Financial Strategy Overview
Strategy 1 Improving Net Cash
Thoroughly track the Return on Investment (ROI) status for each title and

a unique feature of our industry—increased to 46.2 billion yen. Although the balance of work in progress for game software declined due to the release of major titles at the end of the fiscal year and revisions to the valuation of some balances, overall assets that contribute to future growth continued to steadily increase.
Q What is the status of internal reserves and fund procurement?
We have secured levels enabling us to A respond to the increasing scale of game
development and longer investment recovery periods.
Consumer game software development expenses have been on the rise since the current-generation of high performance, multifunctional game consoles arrived. In addition to requiring a development period of two or more years for a major title, greater penetration of digital download sales has enabled a longer lifecycle for games, resulting in a longer investment payback period. Furthermore, even online games require ongoing investments for regular post-release updates and network infrastructure maintenance, thus we are required to keep a certain amount of cash on hand.
Given these conditions, to simplify our ability to procure funds, and in consideration of reserves for the investment plan and risk management, we have set the level of cash and cash equivalents that must be

Shocking the World Once More with Horror Resident Evil 2
Tsuyoshi Kanda Resident Evil 2 Producer
Joined Capcom in 2002. After being involved in domestic marketing and overseas-related business, was assigned to Capcom U.S.A. Returned to Japan in 2015 and became a producer. Worked as a producer on Resident Evil 7 biohazard and Resident Evil 2.
 Nostalgic and New, the Legendary “RE 2” is Reborn
“The zombies are horrifying!”
“It looks so real, it’s terrifying... But I
can’t stop playing!”
These were just some of the player
reactions at E3, one of the world’s largest game expos, held annually in the United States. When Resident Evil 2 (hereinafter, RE 2) was announced at the conference venue, the audience erupted with cheers. Lines formed at the Capcom booth, where attendees waited to play a demo version of the game. Fans who experienced this new horror cried out, “This is the Resident Evil I have been waiting for!”
The reaction was even more positive than we expected, energizing and motivating the development team.
The original Resident Evil 2, released in 1998, is often called a masterpiece even today, 20 years on. It is no easy task to take that original title, and recreate it using
current technology in a way that will satisfy both new and long-time game players.
However, it is because this was such a big challenge that our development team was all the more motivated to take it on. We launched into development of RE 2 with our minds set on satisfying the players’ expectations, and utilizing the best tools at our disposal to recreate the game anew.
Actually, around that time, many of us were working on Resident Evil 7 biohazard (hereinafter “7”). Survival horror game fans have more than one need. 7 attempted to provide the ultimate horror experience with an overwhelming sense of immersion using VR. RE 2 aims for horror and entertainment, a game that is both scary and exciting. Each pursues a different way to enjoy the game. I think the diversity of this series, while always centered on horror, is very appealing.

 Sight and Sound: Depicting Horror by Appealing to the Senses with Overwhelming Realism
 With this title, it was important to respect the original while making the newly rebuilt RE 2 enjoyable. To this end, in addition to the story, game system and visuals, we focused on the audio.
In terms of the story, we followed the original while creating an even stronger sense of drama. For the game system, to maximize the fear of being eaten by zombies, we employed an over-the-shoulder third- person perspective, enabling the user to see both the character they are playing and the attacking zombie.
For the visuals, we used our proprietary RE ENGINE to create a photorealistic world of horror that could be mistaken for live action.
In terms of audio, we used Capcom’s dynamic mixing stage, a newly built 3D
audio booth in our R&D building with 7.1.4 channel Dolby Atmos.
This enables changes in sound in real time using binaural technology, enabling realistic audio that makes players feel as if they are actually there. Zombie moans can be heard to the right and left, in front and behind, affecting not only the sense of sight but of sound to make users experience a greater feeling of horror.
Going forward, we will leverage the marketing expertise we’ve accumulated thus far to promote the game in major regions ahead of launch, primarily at major events, in areas such as North America, Europe, Japan and Asia, as well as in the rapidly growing South American market. I hope everyone is looking forward to the rebirth of RE 2, which is both nostalgic and new.

 Bringing Back the Devil Hunters to Appeal to the Global Market
“In the beginning, one of the main characters, Nero, loses his right hand. He attaches the Devil Breaker to where his right hand was and sets off to battle the demons!” Devil May Cry 5, the latest title in this series, starts with this scene, which was the idea of the Director, Hideaki Itsuno.
With the help of his new partner, weapons craftswoman Nico, Nero takes down demons one after the other in a way that is not only stylish, but feels good. This “good feeling” is a distinctive feature of the Devil May Cry series. The exhilaration of using guns and swords to stylishly defeat demons, interwoven with the story of main characters Nero and Dante’s hidden pasts engrossed fans all over the world, leading the series to become a hit, with cumulative sales of 16 million units.
As this series is immensely popular overseas, we’ve brought on Matt Walker
as well. Matt, who initially began studying Japanese because of Street Fighter, is a producer who has absorbed the Capcom DNA, and now works to push forward our strategy.
This new title was announced at E3, one of the world’s largest game expos, held in June.
The announcement coincided with that of Resident Evil 2, the latest Resident Evil title, which is the sister series to Devil May Cry. Both announcements received a standing ovation.
I think announcing both of these titles at E3 conveyed the momentum we have going at Capcom.

 Driving to the Apex of Action Games With the RE ENGINE
The stylishness of this game is what makes it appealing, so it goes without saying that it demands cutting-edge visuals and action.
Our aim was to create a new Devil May Cry legend that satisfies users by incorporating photorealism, which is mainstream overseas, and a sense of speed and exhilaration unlike previous titles. Capcom’s technical capabilities make this possible.
Further striving for visual perfection, we cast models in England for the main characters and created real costumes from scratch. After makeup was applied, the fully costumed models were scanned as 3D objects.
For character expressions, we used the latest facial technologies developed by Serbian company 3Lateral. The exhilarating movement of the game uses motion capture, with each individual part combined
using Capcom’s RE ENGINE to successfully express realistic details in the characters’ appearances, expressions and action.
With facial expressions in particular, when voice actors later recorded the lines, they understood the emotions just by looking at the video, lending a realism that could be mistaken for live action. My sense is that we were able to achieve extremely fine quality by combining cutting-edge technology with the development expertise Capcom has accumulated over the years.
The release is scheduled for March 8, 2019. We want to deliver this to the world as the apex of action games—DMC is back! We hope you are excited!

A Beloved Series That Spans Generations
Mega Man, born in 1987 when home video game consoles began to gain popularity, is a one of the best-known 2D side-scrolling action games and has long captured the hearts of fans.
This series has sold a cumulative total of 32 million units, which includes several spin-off titles. 30 years since the launch of the first title, Mega Man continues to be very popular overseas, and we are often asked whether we are going to release a new title.
Of course, Capcom would never forget Mega Man. In 2017, on the 30th anniversary of Mega Man, we announced the Mega Man Project.
This announcement included the release of two collections allowing past titles to be enjoyed on modern consoles, as well as the completely new Mega Man 11.
The key to this newest game can be
found in the title: the word “gear,” and there are two meanings here. One is the “Double Gear” system that powers up the abilities given to the main character Mega Man. The other meaning is in the story, where the gears of fate revolve around the past connection between the two scientists, one who is Mega Man’s creator and the other who is his enemy.
There will also be never-before revealed surprises, reaching back to before the first title, with some real "Aha!" moments for fans. At the same time, we are making innovations so that this title will place everyone, even those trying the series for the first time, at the same starting point when they play the game.

     The New Mega Man, Born from Diversity
The objective behind creating the first new title in eight years was to maintain the essence of Mega Man while creating a new standard. To this end, the development team consisted of veteran, mid-career and younger employees, as well as members with completely different histories and sensibilities, rather than only those with past experience on Mega Man.
This is because we thought diversity was necessary to create a new foundation. Each member wrote down their sense of the essence of Mega Man and how they would convey that using modern game consoles, then we considered each idea. The result was to use 2.5D to render side-scrolling 3D graphics. But this turned out to be fairly challenging.
Distortion occurs during 3D parsing, and creating rich visual expressions hampers the agile movements of the pixel graphics
era. To address this, we are fine tuning the graphics using a trick art method to make it look more natural.
On first look, it may not appear to be technically impressive, but actually, it is loaded with techniques that could be described as “master handicraft.”
The Mega Man series is a top-tier IP that will serve as a model for action games stemming from its 30 years of familiar quality.
In preparing promotions ahead of the launch, we are pulling out all the stops, including a 30th anniversary concert in Japan and an animated TV show in North America. We are making a truly enjoyable game that goes beyond countries and cultures, and with this title as a new starting point, we aim to capture the hearts of game fans around the world.

The thinking that lies at the foundation of Capcom’s development ideals and

pursue global brands, you won’t survive in the game industry.
It’s been about two years since I took charge of development. During this time, I’ve
emphasized my personal motto of “never run away, never give up,” and have been able to tackle the issue of ensuring world-class quality, which is a
big win for us. Moreover, within the development organization overall, a more conscious focus on

In manufacturing, quality and budget are often at odds, but our developers have a great deal of artisan pride, which gives them the aptitude for creating hit titles. I will fulfil my responsibility of balancing their ideals with profitability.
Achieving this mission will require expansion of development resources (personnel), so I will continue to pour effort into hiring and training developers.

 The Head of Development Discusses Human Resources Strategy
Investment in Human Capital
Strengthening the Development Organization and Human Resources
Basic Approach to Human Capital
The game industry continues to evolve year after year. A major key to survival will be adapting to advances in communication speeds and screen resolution.
Further, the most important factor in being able to quickly adapt to the ever-increasing scale of game development, while at the same time bolstering the lineup of major titles needed to provide stable growth, is building up our personnel base. To this end, we have hired 100 developers every year since fiscal 2011, with the goal of maintaining a workforce of 2,500 developers by fiscal 2021.
The reason we choose in-house production over subcontracting, despite increased fixed costs, can be found in advancements in and the growing scale of game development. We judged that, in addition to there being few subcontractors able to provide us with the necessary support, creating an environment of friendly competition is essential to world-class development and technological capabilities.
Based on the above policy, around 90% of our development human resources are allocated to the Digital Contents business.
Human Resources Development System
To ensure the quality and quantity of our human resources, particularly for new graduates, we have introduced unique training and mentoring systems to increase both soft skills and technical skills, establishing a practical means of developing young employees to become fully self-sufficient by their third year of employment. As for mid-career and younger employees (core development framework), we selectively promote talented personnel in key areas and cultivate them through title development to help them grow into “core members” who will lead overall game development. Occasionally, our employees must cope with failure, and sometimes they will hit a wall, but a wealth of experiences is the source of personal growth.
We will look into brand-based human resources allocation in order to develop an organizational structure specialized for brands. The skills required for a game like Resident Evil are quite different from those required for a game like Monster Hunter, so we believe that identifying which developer is suited to which brand and putting the right people in the right places will allow us to create games of higher quality.
Improving Motivation
In addition to compensation like title-specific incentives and assignment allowances, we have put together a pleasant workplace environment that includes an on-site day care center as motivation for employees. However, the biggest motivation for developers involved in building creative games is undoubtedly being in an environment that allows them to create the games they want to create. My background is in R&D as well, and I see that as the wellspring of development at Capcom. As such, beyond budget and delivery schedules, I am working to give as much freedom in craftsmanship as possible.
Investment in Intellectual Capital
Acquiring and Generalizing the Latest Technologies
Capcom invests aggressively in R&D centers and development facilities based on the conviction that you can’t create world-class games without pursuing evolution, and the technical results lead to a competitive edge over other companies. The key point in differentiation from other companies is generalizing the latest technologies and making development easier to increase efficiency. For example, the RE ENGINE development engine not only enables graphical expressions nearly indistinguishable from live action but also dramatically shortens the time required for each process in game development. Our in-house oriented development structure allows us to improve specifications constantly, and this makes such things possible.

Message from Core Member
Working as Director to Promote the Full-Scale Overseas Expansion of Monster Hunter
I’ve been involved with the Monster Hunter series since I joined the company, but Monster Hunter: World was my first time as director. The main responsibilities of the director are presenting the vision for the title to the staff, judging the deliverables produced by the staff, and making course corrections when necessary. In part because it’s such a large development team, when development first started, I was unable to properly communicate my intent, and the deliverables were off the mark. However, things changed dramatically when I reviewed the PDCA cycle and got
better at communicating my thoughts. I became painfully aware of the importance of the director’s role in that Capcom has many outstanding creators, but whether those skills are leveraged or not depends on me.
Before becoming director, I worked as a planner, but with each new title, I was given jobs of greater importance, so I could feel I was moving up even while still working as a planner. While continuing to work on building up Monster Hunter, I plan to work on creating intellectual properties that will surpass Monster Hunter in the future.
Satoshi Ueda Programming Lead
Resident Evil 6 Rerelease
Career
Ueda joined the Company as a programmer in 2006 having just graduated, and participated in the development of Mega Man Star Force, Monster Hunter, and other series. After directing a mobile application development project by young employees, he was selected for promotion to be a programming lead on the Resident Evil 6 rerelease. He is currently working on development of Resident Evil 2.
Yuya Tokuda Director
Monster Hunter: World
Career
Tokuda joined the Company in 2004 as a planner, having just graduated. Since that time, he has been continuously involved in the Monster Hunter series. His first experience as the main planner was on Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Promoted to director with Monster Hunter: World, he has been successful in the mission of expanding the brand to the overseas markets.
 Creating an Environment for
Smooth Game Development to
Contribute to Expansion of the Title Lineup
 As a programming lead, when we were engaged in the development of the Resident Evil 6 rerelease, a project by young employees, I was in charge of assigning duties, progress management, and negotiation with our internal Quality Control Department and outside parties. It was my first time to manage the work of young employees on top of my own programming duties. As such, I stumbled a lot, but by working on creating an atmosphere in which we could proceed smoothly with game development, such as putting our heads together on ways to solve problems and engaging in active communication, we successfully completed development.
I personally think it’s important that creators not only have well-rounded capabilities but also a special skill or weapon of their own that they can wield better than anyone else. What’s good about Capcom is that you can choose the direction you want to go in yourself. By having a clear handle on the fields you’re interested in and knowing what you want to do, you can develop the skills you want. In the ever-evolving game industry, if you don’t grow on a daily basis, you’ll get left behind. The young people joining the Company in recent years have extensive knowledge of programming, so I’m going to continue to devote myself to the job so that I stay ahead of the pack.

Initiatives Aimed at Promoting the Improvement of the Work Environment for Women and Proactively Hiring Non-Japanese
Capcom is currently engaged in initiatives aimed at improving the work environment for women and proactively hiring Non-Japanese. In terms of providing an environment that facilitates women,
we introduced systems enabling women to take a leave of absence before and after giving birth, childcare leave and shortened working hours, and promote their use throughout the Company. In fiscal 2017, 25 employees took childcare leave, six of whom were men, and 100% of eligible women took childcare leave (fiscal 2016: 3 men and 100% of 23 women took leave). A high percentage of women returned to work afterwards: 25 returned in fiscal 2017 — 96.0% if those still on leave are excluded. This is an increase over last fiscal year (95.6%, or 22 women, returned to work in fiscal 2016). As a result, despite it being said that Japan’s gaming industry is generally dominated by men, women account for roughly 21% of Capcom’s workforce, and 25 (10.3%) of Capcom’s managers are women. In accordance with the execution of the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace, in 2016 we formulated the General Employer Action Plan, which seeks to achieve two things: (1) having women comprise at least 20% of all of new graduates hired, and (2) having women comprise at
Number of Female Managers and Ratio of Female Employees (Capcom Co., Ltd.)
least 15% of managers. In recognition of Capcom’s efforts toward improving the workplace environment for women, since 2014 we have earned the “Kurumin” mark, the symbol of a “company supporting childcare,” from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
In terms of the proactive employment of non-Japanese individuals, Capcom is making efforts to strengthen overseas expansion capabilities including creating an English hiring website. We currently employ 107 non-Japanese workers (representing 4.2% of our employees). Going forward, we will create a system for improving motivation in an attempt to increase the ratio of foreign employees, including support for career advancement and the promotion of non-Japanese individuals to management positions.
These measures have contributed to generating new IPs such as Toraware no Paruma.

 Capcom Juku
Providing an Environment for Vibrant Childcare Combining Day Care and Education
Given the desire to quickly improve the issue of long day care waiting lists accompanying a lack of preschools, Capcom’s top management set its sights on the future and wanted to provide an environment in which employees can raise their children with peace of mind while remaining employed over the long term. We opened Capcom Juku in April 2017, aiming to add individual education and growth to standard day care for children. Capcom Juku goes beyond caring for infants and preschool children and accepts a wide range of youth, including after-school kindergarten and elementary school students. This helps employees avoid the stress of not being able to find open facilities for their children. Furthermore, by offering educational support in the form of a place for learning English, eurhythmics, math, science, and other subjects, Capcom Juku joins its efforts with employees and fosters the growth of children. Currently, as of March 31, 2018, the school takes care of 14 preschool children and accepts as many as 40 temporary pupils a month. Going forward, plans are in place to accept after-school students from nearby elementary schools, to add further convenience for working employees. Capcom Juku also offers Spring School and Summer School with classes taught by employee instructors when standard schools are closed for seasonal breaks. The Spring School on March 28, 2018 was the first time for a Capcom employee to serve as an instructor. This class took place in Capcom’s dedicated Foley Stage, a studio for creating video game sound effects, and covered how to make games and the role of game music. Students were allowed to experience making sound effects, such as the flapping wings of a monster, as well as character voices, during a class that showcased some of the characteristic features of a video game company.
Additionally, students were able to eat lunch with their parents in the employee cafeteria, which was an opportunity for encouraging parent-child communication.
In the future, we will create a learning atmosphere at Capcom Juku that stimulates and broadens children’s curiosity, while also striving for an environment where parents can work with peace of mind so that both they and their families can lead fulfilling lives.
My Experience
Natsuki Shiozawa
Produce Section 2
Management Department 2,
Consumer Games Development Division 2 Capcom Co., Ltd.
I have been using Capcom Juku on a monthly contract since it opened. The location is convenient for drop-off and pick-up because it is near the office and has a parking lot. I think the surroundings are nice, too, since it has a park in front of it.
I feel at ease because the parents of the other children there are also employees of my company.
Capcom Juku prepares meals on site, which is another way in which the facility is both convenient and safe.
The daily activities of the school are important to me. It is more than just day care. They bring in external instructors to teach English conversation, while others teach eurhythmics and the children get to learn how to grow vegetables in planter boxes. During the summer, they have well-designed activities such as pool time. I am really satisfied with the facility.

  Holding Amusement Arcade Tours for Seniors and Contributing to Livelier Local Communities
Senior Tours
Today, amusement facilities are becoming increasingly popular among retired senior citizens as spaces for communication with other people. Since 2012, Capcom has held amusement arcade tours free of charge on long public holidays and Respect-for-the-Aged Day for senior citizens where they can try out coin-operated games and crane games, enabling more people to make use of such facilities.
In addition, as part of efforts to create arcades where senior citizens can comfortably enjoy themselves, since 2012 Capcom has encouraged arcade staff to get the Service Assistant certification. Currently, 27 staff members have received this certification.

Comments from a Tour Organizer

Area Leader, Operations Team Arcade Operations Department, Arcade Operations Business Division Capcom Co., Ltd.
The people who take part in the senior tours show lots of happy smiles. The ones who bring their grandchildren seem especially pleased, and many of them say that they are really glad to have more to talk about with their grandkids than usual, thanks to video games. The tours are also a chance for senior participants to have more social interactions, with some of them even becoming regulars at the arcade. We are trying to be more proactive in our communication so that visitors will be able to comfortably use the arcade as a local community gathering place where they can make connections with both the staff and each other. Going forward, we will continue contributing to a livelier local community, including taking part in events hosted by the city government.

Encouraging an Appropriate Understanding of Video Games with On-Site Classes for Children in School
Video games are a comparatively new cultural phenomenon about which there is little academic research. Rather than examining the educational aspects, discussions tend to focus on the detrimental effects of violent content. However, the idea of a future career as a video game creator is very popular among children and the decision has been made to make programming lessons compulsory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020. A host of private sector efforts are also being carried out, including opening programming academies for youth. Considering these recent developments, it is reasonable to expect that the number of children hoping to become video game creators will increase further in the future. Additionally, the ratio of smartphone ownership among young people—29.9% of elementary school students and 58.1% of junior high school students—is rising year by year. Game apps for smartphones are also increasingly gaining in popularity and the distance between video games and children is shrinking.
Given this context, as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts as a video game software producer, and based around a desire to promote understanding in society of video games, we accept student visits to our offices, with a focus on elementary and junior high school students, and also actively conduct on-site classes at schools. At these events, Capcom conducts a program with two sessions: one is a career education support session, which introduces the work done in a game software company and the difficulty and rewards of that work, and the other is a game literacy education support session, which helps students use their own judgement to establish a healthy relationship with games. These programs have in turn been
well-received in educational environments. Capcom has also incorporated opinions from educators to improve its educational efforts. In fiscal 2011, Capcom launched its second educational program, focused on the educational theme of career education support. In fiscal 2013, Capcom started a new class program on work and mathematics targeted towards elementary and junior high school students to help prevent children from losing interest in math, a challenge in recent years.
As a result of these efforts, Capcom has welcomed 2,950 children as part of 366 different field trips to its offices (as of the end of March 2018). Capcom has also held 136 on-site classes for 12,715 students (as of the end of March 2018) at schools such as Edogawa Ward Seishin Daini Junior High School in Tokyo.
Impressions of the On-Site Classes
(A Portion of This Fiscal Year’s Comments)
The work done at a video game company uses a lot of math and I’m glad that I was reminded how important math is. (Junior high school student)
I saw students more engaged and energetic than in our normal classes. It made me feel that pupils will participate more seriously in subjects that interest them. (Junior high school teacher)
During the class, nearly all of the children seemed nervous, but in the post-class surveys, they said that they want to have this kind of job and want to know more about it. (Local learning center leader)
I thought it was really good that the videos let children hear the voices of people actually doing this kind of work, which was a nice way to convey information to the students. (City Hall official)

 Supporting Regional Revitalization Using the Activities Appeal of Capcom Video Game Content
Regional Revitalization
The attraction of video game content for the worldwide audience was in evidence when Japan’s Prime Minister promoted the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games by dressing as a video game character at the Closing Ceremony of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. In the same vein, Capcom is following a Single Content Multiple Usage strategy for our content, which we deploy in a wide range of fields beyond video games. As such, we are proud to have a high level of recognition and popularity among men and women, young and old alike.
Utilizing the power of our game content to capture the attention of people, Capcom has been engaged in the following four regional revitalization activities not only in Osaka, where we have our head office, but across Japan, since the mid- 2000s: 1) economic promotion that supports the local tourism industries; 2) cultural promotion that supports education concerning local history and culture; 3) the improvement of public order through coordination with the police; and 4) raising awareness about voting in elections in coordination with the Committee for Election Administration.
In 2017, Capcom provided support for a stamp rally that used our characters, as well as collaborated to make the commemorative goods for the 73rd National Athletic Meet’s Ice Skating Winter Competition (known as Fujinokuni Yamanashi-Kokutai), in Kofu Yamanashi Prefecture, a city with which Capcom entered into a Comprehensive Agreement to Promote Vitalization of the Local Economy. These events were part of Capcom’s efforts to help achieve regional development by 2019. In Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, which is seizing the opportunity of a televised historical drama series to boost tourism, we collaborated with decorating the exterior of a train (the “Naotora Express”) by providing a Capcom character. Furthermore, in March 2018, we provided characters for
inclusion in promotional posters and handouts for performances at the National Bunraku Theatre in Osaka, which is striving to better communicate to young people the appeal of bunraku, an art form included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List. These examples highlight some of our dedicated efforts to help regional revitalization activities.
Also, in October 2017, Monster Hunter series characters were used in materials to promote efforts by the Osaka Prefectural Police Department to raise awareness and prevent the theft of valuables from unattended cars. Car interior cleaner wipes with packaging featuring the characters were distributed to promote the campaign.
Comments from a City Official
Shinya Kawai
HAMAMATSU CITY
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT Tourism & City Promotion Division
With the airing of a televised historical drama series and the boom in popularity of history from the Sengoku period, Hamamatsu city signed an agreement in 2016 to license Capcom content. We have used Ii Naotora, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and other Sengoku BASARA characters in our promotions.
We are striving to promote Hamamatsu to new demographics, such as young people and women, and have been able to attract visitors to related locations within the city. There were particularly spirited responses to the live on-stage talk, the sumie ink art exhibit, and the announcements played inside buses decorated with character images. Information spread on social media and I think the PR activities were effective. Additionally, visitors from outside Japan also asked to receive some of the collaboration posters, which showed us how strong the appeal of popular video games can be.

 Environmental
Capcom’s Digital Contents business accounts for over 75% of the Group’s consolidated net sales and entails the development and sale of software. This gives Capcom an environmental impact that is lower than general manufacturers. Because our environmental impact comes largely from the power used for office work and at amusement facilities, as well as from distributing our products, we are focused on saving energy.
Reducing Power Usage
Reducing CO2 Emissions by Promoting Energy Saving Measures Companywide
Capcom has worked to cut power usage through efforts that include ongoing power saving at all of its places of business, saving energy at its amusement facilities, and implementing peak shifting for the power used by PCs and other electrical equipment. In the fiscal years ended March 2012 to March 2014, energy usage trended upward at our amusement facilities in particular due to attempts to restore normal operations following shortened business hours necessitated by the Great East Japan Earthquake. However, since the fiscal year ended March 2014, we have cut CO2 emissions by installing energy-saving gaming machines and switching to LED lighting. The fiscal year ended March 2017 saw our CO2 emissions increase compared to the previous fiscal year due to the construction of the R&D Building #2 and Capcom Technical Center. However, as a result of having a range of energy-saving equipment, the CO2 emissions from these buildings have been reduced by approximately 10%* compared to the original plan.

Innovations in Product Distribution
Sharing Distribution Networks with Other Companies in the Industry
Sharing distribution networks with other companies in the same industry when shipping products enables the efficient supply of products. As a result, we are able to realize reductions in packing materials, fuel and emissions.
Paperless Instruction Manuals
In previous console generations, games included a printed instruction manual inside the package, but with games for current-generation consoles, these manuals are now included as data within the software as a way to save paper. This enables us to eliminate approximately 11.5 million game units’ worth of paper manuals shipped annually.
Development and Manufacturing Initiatives
Reducing the Environmental Impact of Pachislo Machines
In solidarity with the efforts of the Japan Pachislot Machine Industry Association (Nichidenkyo), Capcom manufactures and sells pachislo machines partially made from recycled parts and equipped with standardized “green devices” aimed at controlling power usage.
Reducing the Environmental Impact of Business Machines
In addition to ensuring that we make products that are easy to recycle while using durable materials and components beginning at the design stage, we actively provide version upgrade kits to allow customers to use the same machines for the long term, simply adding or upgrading game data as they go.

Features of Capcom Corporate Governance
 Four Features of Capcom Corporate Governance
1 Transition into a Company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee to Strengthen Governance
In June 2016, we transitioned into a company with an audit and supervisory committee. The Audit and Supervisory Committee works so that the internal control system functions effectively, auditing the execution of operations by directors and employees based on auditing policies and, as necessary, submitting items found in audits and giving advice and making suggestions for corrections, etc. Additionally, we have established an Internal Audit Division directly under the control of the Audit and Supervisory Committee to ensure the committee can perform duties smoothly and appropriately. This division has a full-time staff of 18 who help with the execution of operations of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.
= External Directors
3 Full Disclosure of 73 Corporate Governance Code Items
Capcom has disclosed all 73 of its Corporate Governance Code items in order to fulfil its responsibility to explain each item while reaffirming the current state of the company’s governance system contrasted with its ideal state. Capcom attaches particular importance to 26 items, which are comprised of 10 items that contribute to our growth strategy, three items that contribute to our management system and 13 items that serve as the base for achieving these, and provides greater detail concerning the same.
Proactive Appointment of External Directors
Capcom’s current ratio of external directors is 45.5% through proactively appointing external directors since June 2001. The advice, opinions, and scrutiny provided by external directors increases the transparency and credibility of Board of Directors’ meetings and vitalizes the same, while also strengthening the function of the meetings to supervise management.

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Structure and Initiatives
Shareholders and investors have made the practical and effective functioning of internal control into a key issue amidst an epidemic of corporate misconduct in Japan and overseas. In this section, Capcom will explain the corporate governance structure and systems that it has initiated so far based on the key concepts of “effectiveness and visibility” in terms of the results of third party assessment.

Enhancing Management Soundness and Transparency While Responding to Changes in the Environment
Capcom is aware that comprehensive corporate governance ranks among management’s most important priorities. Because of this, in addition to enhancing management soundness and transparency, we are increasing corporate value by building a trusting relationship with our stakeholders. These stakeholders include shareholders, business partners, employees and regional societies.
Shareholders’ Meeting
(Convened on June 11, 2018)
Determines Important Matters as the Highest Decision-Making Body
The general shareholders’ meeting serves as Capcom’s highest decision-making body and determines important matters as well as serves as a place for reporting audit results of consolidated financial statements.
Invitations to the general shareholders’ meeting are issued approximately three weeks before convening the session, and efforts are made to allow for greater attendance by having the session about 10 days before the date on which most other companies hold their meetings. We have also made it possible for shareholders to exercise their voting rights over the internet using a computer or smartphone. In addition, we participate in an electronic voting
rights exercise platform for institutional investors.
Four resolutions were brought up for discussion at the shareholders’ meeting this year, all of which were approved

The Board of Directors is composed of eight directors (excluding Audit and Supervisory Committee members), three of whom are external directors, in addition to three directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members (two of whom are external directors), for a total of 11 directors.
More than one-third of directors are external directors (five out of eleven) and all five of the external directors have been registered with Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. as independent directors.

two of whom are external directors. We carry out organizational audits and supervision by selecting two full-time members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee to collect and share information, while also making use of our internal control system.
To this end, we have established an Internal Audit Division, etc. with 18 full-time staff members directly under the control of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. This Division makes regular reports and carries out appropriate work through organizational audits that include issuing instructions and other actions as necessary.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee
Providing Consultation on the Selection of Candidates for Director and Recommending Details of Director Compensation
Capcom has established a voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee with five members, a majority of whom are external directors. The committee has an external director as committee chairman, and serves as a consulting organization to the Board of Directors, as necessary, to ensure the objectivity and appropriateness of the decision-making process for nominating candidates for director and for setting the compensation of directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee).
The Compliance Committee The Compliance Committee
prescribed by the Companies Act and financial audits as prescribed by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. There is no special relationship involving financial or other interests between Capcom and this audit corporation or the engagement partners at this firm who perform audits at Capcom.
 Internal Audit Division
Ensuring and Verifying Legal Compliance and Operating Efficiencies
Audit
We have established an Internal Audit Division, etc. as an auditing body to support the Audit and Supervisory Committee. This division conducts regular monitoring of each division and Group company, primarily from the standpoint of risk management. The Internal Audit Division collects and analyzes information on legality, propriety, and efficiency, accurately assesses Group internal operational risk and inefficiencies, and works to prevent the occurrence of crises and improve operations. Additionally, in the event of an unforeseen situation, the Internal Audit Division contributes to making appropriate management decisions by quickly giving a report examining and analyzing the causal factors to the Audit and Supervisory Committee in order to minimize losses to the Company.

Focusing on Compliance as an Important Management Issue
To ensure compliance, Capcom has established a Compliance Committee that meets quarterly and has an external director, who is also a certified attorney, as the chairman. In order to prevent illegal activities and misconduct, and so that all employees can directly report any instances of these, Capcom has established Compliance Hotline Rules and an internal hotline. Capcom also regularly monitors its compliance status with a compliance check sheet. To ensure effectiveness, Capcom properly disposes of problems confirmed by this committee and other issues that must be dealt with.
Accounting Auditors Audit Ensuring and Verifying Accounting Transparency
Capcom has engaged KPMG AZSA LLC for financial audits as
Supporting the Board of Directors’ Decisions
The Chairman, President and Executive Corporate Officers participate in the Corporate Management Council, which meets the day before a meeting of the Board of Directors. The Corporate Management Council ensures the fairness and transparency of the decision-making process by carefully reviewing special items, items brought up to the Board of Directors, and items delegated to Representative Directors.
Board of Corporate Officers Implementation (Convened 12 times in the year ended March 31, 2018)
Executing Operations Based on Clear Management Policy
In order to clarify monitoring and business operation functions, Capcom adopted the corporate officer system. The Board of Corporate Officers is convened, in principle, once a month. In addition to carrying out business based on Board of Directors’ decisions, reports on business affairs policy are given and plans are formulated at meetings of the Board of Corporate Officers. Status reports on business being carried out by Corporate Officers are given at the meetings of the Board of Directors.

Corporate Governance
 External Directors
Using External Perspectives to Ensure Effective Governance
External directors ensure the effectiveness of the corporate governance function by playing key roles in the Compliance Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. They also focus efforts on compliance and the prevention of corrupt or illegal activities, and openly exchange opinions and provide
counsel at Board of Directors meetings in an effort to strengthen the management audit function. The Secretariat staff helps with the work of the external directors who are not members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. For external directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, the full-time staff of the Internal Audit Division helps with their work.

Officer Remuneration
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee Makes Recommendations to Ensure Fairness and Transparency
To ensure fairness and transparency, the compensation of Directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee) is consulted on with the voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which has an external director as chairman. The Board of Directors sets remuneration based on this committee’s recommendations. The current remuneration system is composed of set monthly remuneration and performance-based bonuses paid in cash, however, the percentage of set remuneration is high. Because of this, we are looking into introducing a new remuneration system to increase the directors’ incentive to increase corporate value over the medium-to-long term. Also, as part of an overall environment to support risk-taking, the remuneration linked to performance will be set to an appropriate percentage.
Regarding the Decision on the Calculation Method and Amount of Directors’ Remuneration
1 Regarding remuneration of directors (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee)
To ensure fairness and transparency of directors’ remuneration, the Board of Directors consults the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which has an external director as chairman. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee considers each board member’s position, duties, tenure, and full/part-time service, as well as individual job performance and Capcom’s earnings, and recommends an appropriate amount. The Board of Directors makes a decision based on this amount.
a. Monthly remuneration is fixed.
b. The bonuses are set within a reasonable range based on monthly
remuneration and the Company’s performance.
Board of Directors: Attended 15 of 15 meetings (100%) Board of Directors: Attended 15 of 15 meetings (100%)

Audit and Supervisory Committee: Attended 16 of 16 meetings (100%)
c. In addition to the remuneration listed above, appropriate remuneration based on individual achievement may be paid within a set range.
2 The remuneration of the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee
In order to secure their independence, the remuneration of the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee is not linked to performance; it is a fixed amount determined through discussions, taking the difference of full-time or part-time service into account, by the directors who serve as members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.

Promoting More “Visible” Governance
An analysis of an assessment performed by a third-party organization into the validity and effectiveness of Capcom’s corporate governance shows that the company ranked 184th among 3,548 listed companies in Japan in the “NEEDS-Cges” assessment developed by Nikkei Digital Media, Inc.
NEEDS-Cges has an established reputation as a system that quantitatively assesses corporate governance using scores on a scale of 1 to 10 for eight categories, including capital efficiency, information disclosure, and external regulations, among others, based on some 150 indicators calculated from data of publicly released company documents, such as financial reports.
As of the end of June 2018, Capcom’s total score was 7.20 points, placing us in the top 5.2% of Japan’s listed companies, exceeding the 4.91-point average for all listed companies and the 7.02-point average for the industry. We also received the maximum score of 10 for “equity market evaluation” and “information disclosure.”
The main evaluation factors are given in the table below, but areas highlighted in yellow indicate measures that received particular notice. Going forward, we will continue making improvements based on consideration of external data to earn an even stronger assessment, and further promote the external visibility of our governance by posting this and other data on our IR web page.

  Making Use of Shareholder and Investor Opinions
Reflecting Results of Dialogues with Investors and Analysts in Management
Through meetings with investors and analysts, Capcom’s IR Department attempts to promote an understanding of management policies, strategies and future outlook with these parties. Furthermore, their opinions are gathered and provided to management, and are utilized for corporate management going forward. As a company based in Osaka, proactive IR meetings with these parties enables us to minimize asymmetric information as we strive to achieve appropriate corporate value.
In fiscal 2017, we set up top management meetings between the chairman and CEO, the president and COO, and investors where medium- to long-term strategies and the direction of marketing strategies were explained. This also included candid discussions concerning management and development. Furthermore, we held an online individual investor briefing to allow individual investors from anywhere in the world to take part, as one of a variety of new pursuits informed by stock market views and demands. In addition, Capcom conducts a perception gap study every year targeting institutional investors and analysts in Japan and overseas. Being aware of investor perception gaps gives us feedback on corporate management and IR activities. Questionnaires are also given to attendees at our Presentation of Financial Results and individual investor briefing sessions, allowing us to make proactive use of market opinions as one criterion in management decisions. Specific examples of the diverse use of this information include: (1) reviewing disclosure materials (disclosing new KPI) and
(2) assessing earnings briefing sessions and (3) holding meetings with management personnel.
Outcomes from Our Perception Gap Study with Investors (excerpts)
Q. Rather than earnings and performance matters, I would like to see opportunities created where we can ask top management and those in charge of development about their ideas, management theories and philosophy. In particular, since the founder is the Capcom CEO, this would be extremely informative for investors like us.
A. We held such a meeting.
We held a top management meeting to communicate the management policies and strategies being considered by the Chairman and CEO (our founder) and the President and COO (his successor), in addition to shedding some light on their personalities. The attendees seemed tremendously pleased and the event facilitated a deeper understanding of Capcom’s business strategies. We will continue to have such meetings to provide opportunities for even more meaningful, mutual dialogue.
Q. The recording of development costs in the Consumer business is difficult to understand. I would like to see a little more disclosure.
A. We have made additional disclosures.
With the advance of digitization, consumer games have adopted longer sales cycles than before. Consequently, following accounting principles, Capcom now records expenses in accord with the sales period and, in principle, depreciates costs over approximately two years.
IR Activities on Our Website
Providing a Website Easily Accessible to Everyone
Since 2001, Capcom has made proactive use of its corporate website as a tool for disseminating information pertaining to IR activities. The main reasons for this are to ensure fairness for a wide range of stakeholders, and because it ensures information is easily available for inspection immediately in approximately 200 countries worldwide. Capcom’ s corporate website is also positioned as our most cost-effective tool.
IR Team
Full-Time Staff Engaged in a Wide Variety of Activities
Capcom IR activities are conducted by four full-time staff members in addition to the chairman, the president, and the director overseeing IR for shareholders and investors in Japan and overseas. For earnings information and other IR-related inquiries, please use the contact information below.

Corporate Governance
Major Discussions at Board of Directors Meetings and Audit and Supervisory Committee Meetings Held in Fiscal 2017
 The Capcom Board of Directors ensures management transparency and soundness, with its six external directors (as of March 31, 2018) taking the lead in proactively offering opinions and advice. In addition to addressing dividend payments and discontinuing takeover defense measures, the Board engages in lively discussion concerning Capcom’s growth strategies, such as esports, while promoting those strategies through corporate governance. While there were more than a few heated discussions with external directors, including with the Audit and Supervisory Committee, on this page, we will present an overview of two examples.
(Light blue highlights indicate external director comments.)
     Topic 1
Entering a New Business Overseas
Executive officer in charge of overseas business (After finishing an overview explanation of new businesses) Regarding this issue, Japan is not a possible target of business for legal reasons, but many areas in Europe and the U.S. are. When thinking about entering this business, I would like to consider feasibility from a multi-faceted perspective, including marketability, platform technology, legality, etc.
Tsujimoto (Kenzo) This is not an agenda item, but merely a preliminary report. If there are any questions regarding entering this new business, I would like to ask for recommendations by the time of our next meeting, where we will make decisions. The reason that I would like to press forward with some optimism is that, while there are risks, it is necessary to take healthy risk in order to achieve sustainable growth. But if we are slow to act, we lose. So, with that, I would like to identify the risks and returns, and thoroughly discuss their suitability.
Sato I’ve heard that access from Japan and some other areas is excluded based on a player’s location information, but would it be possible for them to play via a third country?
Executive officer in charge of overseas business The specifications will be set so that they will be excluded based on GPS data.
Tsujimoto (Kenzo) Even if they do access the game, they will not be able to make in-game purchases. Also, when entering a new business, I would like to hear everyone’s opinion as to what you would like us to preserve.
Matsuo OK, I understand that players cannot play these games from Japan. However, as a publicly traded Japanese company, not an American one, is there any meaning for us in this new business? Who will operate it and whose idea is it? I would like those points to be clarified.
Executive officer in charge of overseas business In principle, the business will be run by a U.S. company.
Tsujimoto (Kenzo) By way of example, if a Japanese company buys a Las Vegas casino, it is legal to run it as an overseas subsidiary, and it is also legal for a Japanese person to visit the casino. But it is a problem to place bets from Japan. This case (though not gambling) is the same situation. I would like our deliberations to consider this point when making a decision.
Muranaka When the division in charge moves this project forward, I would like the legality to be assured. I would like us to proceed following a sound third-party monitoring approach, such as having a separate division check whether the division in charge is properly managing legality and the like. As an ideal, I understand the desire to promote this business, but I would like consideration to be paid to operating it.
Iwasaki Since the target area includes the EU, I would like us to carefully consider whether we clear the regional restrictions related to the EU competition law.
Tsujimoto (Kenzo) We will take into account the issues raised by our external directors and reassess risks as we outline the suitability of entering this business.

      Topic 2
Discussion on Policies for Improving the Mobile Business*
External Audit and Supervisory Committee member I think that the Mobile business is one growth area, but it has not led to major gains for Capcom thus far. What analysis has been done looking into the reasons why? Is it a problem of not investing sufficient management resources, such as people, material, and money? Or, is it a problem with Capcom’s mobile development expertise and capabilities?
Internal Audit Officer Although this is an interim report, I think the reason why expected results have not emerged from the Mobile Business to date is due to both issues you mentioned. These were included in the issues I reported on today, and, I would like internal auditing to proceed by verifying matters through further interviews, as well as data gathering and analysis. After these steps, we can clarify the challenges and propose improvements to the business division.
Internal Audit and Supervisory Committee member To add to that, our in-house resources are not sufficient for mobile game development, so for the Asian market, we are trying to work on multiple titles through an out-licensing approach with local development companies. We are also trying to find a starting point domestically, such as pursuing joint development with mobile development companies.
External Audit and Supervisory Committee member Since mobile is an important field within Capcom’s growth strategies, we need
to be quick in our approach. Also, from a macro perspective, the Asian market’s growth rate is extremely high, so I think one issue is how we should tackle this market going forward.
External Audit and Supervisory Committee member Regional preferences are particularly important for mobile games. A game that is a hit in Japan will not necessarily do well overseas. I would like that point to be covered as well when internal audits are performed.
Internal Audit Officer Currently, the division has deployed a strategy that first emphasizes business in Japan. As for overseas markets, such as Europe, the U.S. and Asia, it will confirm plans going forward.
External Audit and Supervisory Committee member Approximately what percentage of the global market is the Japanese market?
Internal Audit Officer The Japanese market has about a one-fifth share. The Japanese market has evolved in a very peculiar direction (emphasizing ”gatcha,” or lottery-style microtransactions).
External Audit and Supervisory Committee member Thank you. This gives me a better understanding of the current state and issues for the Mobile business. I hope we can continue to have timely progress reports on internal audits.
Internal Audit Officer Understood. I plan to proceed so that we
can further clarify any problem points and make proposals that
will translate to future growth.
* This discussion contains comments gathered from the Audit and Supervisory Committee meetings during the period under review, and from other individual meetings as well.

Consumer Market Characteristics (Package + Digital Download Contents)
Package and digital download contents are a 24.4 billion dollar market, forecast to grow 46% over the next five years to 35.6 billion dollars by 2022. The customer base is composed mainly of core users who are highly loyal to game titles. They have relatively high willingness to purchase sequels and remakes along with low sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Hereafter, we expect the market to grow as we capture the casual user segment, which has high sensitivity to price conditions, in conjunction with a higher digital sales ratio, shrinking the gap between the margin in this market and those in the other two markets. Please refer to page 75
Mobile Market Characteristics
This is a 59.4 billion dollar market, forecast to grow to 92 billion dollars by 2022. The customer segment is primarily composed of casual users, many of whom play games in their spare time, thus they demonstrate the lowest loyalty toward game titles. They have a limited willingness to purchase games and have the highest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Although this is the most profitable among the three markets, only a limited number of titles are able to generate stable earnings over the long term. Going forward, we expect smartphones will continue to grow rapidly as the most pervasive game device. Please refer to page 75
PC Online Market Characteristics
This is a 38.4 billion dollar market, forecast to grow about 19% over the next five years to 45.8 billion dollars by 2022. The customer base is primarily composed of core users who demonstrate the highest loyalty toward game titles. They have a fairly strong willingness to engage in ongoing purchases, and are unique for having the lowest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Among the three markets, profitability is comparatively high, and hit titles tend to generate stable earnings over the long term; however, the influx of new customers is expected to taper off, causing growth to be sluggish in the future. Please refer to page 75

 Market Analysis
 Consumer Market (Package + Digital Download Contents)
Consumer Market (Billions of dollars) 24.4 billion
2016 2017 Package DLC
In 2017, the consumer (package + digital download contents) market picked up, increasing to 24.4 billion dollars (up 15.1% from the previous fiscal year). This was due primarily to an increase in digital download sales as a result of steady growth in the installation base of current generation game consoles and the arrival of the Nintendo Switch, despite packaged sales remaining flat. The consumer market is primarily comprised of North America, Europe and Japan, and this trend was especially evident in the North American and European markets, which account for approximately 85% of this market. The highly profitable digital
Mobile Contents Market
In 2017, the mobile contents market was worth 59.4 billion dollars (up 22.5% from the previous year), expanding to half the size of the overall game software market. The main reasons for this were (1) the ongoing adoption of smartphones throughout the world and (2) the increase of popular native app games particularly in Japan and Asia that continue to attract game users. By region, the Asian market including Japan was worth 35.4 billion dollars (up 28.3% from the previous year), the North American market was worth 11.3 billion dollars (up 13.0% from the previous year), Eastern European, developing countries and other regional markets were worth 6.6 billion dollars (up 8.2% from the previous year), all showing continued growth.

PC Online Market
In 2017, the PC online market grew substantially to 38.4 billion dollars (up 23.9% from the previous year) owing to worldwide growth, especially in China and Asia, which account for more than 40% of the market.

download contents market now accounts for roughly 54% of the consumer market. The forecast for 2018 is for the market to reach 27.6 billion dollars (up 13.1% from the previous fiscal year) owing to a continued virtuous cycle of increased software sales driven by the growing user base of current
generation game consoles.
In the medium term, our user segment
will grow as a result of the spread of consumer game consoles and development of new digital distribution methods such as cloud games. As such, we expect the market to grow to 35.6 billion dollars by 2022 (up 45.9% compared to 2017).
content as needed, has predominated the market since about 2010. With freemium games, the key success factors are IP (brand/ game content) coupled with operating know-how, which includes offering the appropriate services in conjunction with monetization. Because of this, the opportunity to improve earnings is growing for game companies with many popular titles as well as mobile development companies with operational expertise.
In 2017, the annual shipment of smartphones stayed roughly the same as the previous year at 1.46 billion units (down 0.7% from the previous year). For the next five years, the average annual growth rate is expected to be 2.8%, with shipments reaching 1.68 billion units by 2022. As a result, we expect the 2018 mobile market to increase to 68.9 billion dollars (up 16.0% from the previous year) and grow to 92 billion dollars by 2022 (up 54.9% from 2017).
increase to 40.9 billion dollars (up 6.5% from the previous year), with the shift to mobile among leading game companies continuing, and further, although it will grow to 45.8 billion dollars by 2022 (up 19.3% from 2017), growth will slow in the future.

Arcade Operations Market
The domestic arcade facilities market grew during the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017) for the second year in a row to 462 billion yen (up 6.5% from the previous year). This was due to improvements in the number of visitors and sales per customer due to restrictions on the time that minors can be in arcades while accompanied by a guardian being relaxed in the Entertainment and Amusement Trades Act (Entertainment and Amusement Trades Rationalizing Act) and popularity of new models of video game consoles. The total number of arcades decreased to 14,154 (down 4.8% from the previous year), and the number of units installed at each arcade decreased to 31.4 (down 2.2 units from the previous year). However, annual sales per facility increased
Gaming Machines Market
In the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017), the gaming machine market shrank for the fourth consecutive year to 882.1 billion yen (down 10.2% from the previous year). This was due to both pachinko and pachislo machines being hit hard by diminishing investment appetite for gaming machines among halls due to worsening financial results and a decrease in the number of new stores opened.
The market continued to worsen this year (ended March 31, 2018) due to
Arcade Game Market
In the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017), the arcade game market grew to 149 billion yen (up 2.0% from the previous year) thanks to hit crane and networked card-based games , despite a decrease in the number of amusement vendors.
This year (ended March 31, 2018), sales
to 32.64 million yen (up 11.8% from the previous year), demonstrating that the management streamlining many companies have engaged in, closing unprofitable locations and focusing on profitable stores in good locations, has been successful.
This year (ended March 31, 2018), the market was strong overall, and growth continued owing to hit products appearing one after another in the prizes found in prize game machines.
In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2019), we expect the market to remain flat due to prizes that were hits this year losing steam, despite the introduction of networked card-based games and video games featuring popular characters.
changes to gaming machine regulations in February 2018.
In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2019), we expect the shrinking of the market to come to an end as the number of users recovers with the gradual introduction of models with improved product value beginning in the second half. This is in conjunction with the enforcement of new self-imposed restraints in April 2019 despite the changes to the gaming machine regulations.
of new crane games and prizes continued to grow and are slowly on the rise.
In the next fiscal year (ending March 31, 2019), we expect the market to perform well in conjunction with increased investment appetite among facility operators and the launch of multiple popular models.

CAPCOM CO., LTD. AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. YEARS ENDED MARCH 31
 1. Operating Results
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, our industry saw major growth in the market for home video games due to the strong performance of both hardware and software. In addition, “esports” (electronic sports), which are becoming increasingly popular in Europe, the U.S., China, South Korea and other overseas markets, are raising hopes for further market growth. This is driven by games coming to be recognized as a new sport, following esports’ adoption as an official event at the 2022 Asian Games. Furthermore, opportunities to develop this new business domain in Japan, a region that trails other countries, have been building, as evidenced by the overwhelming audience response for Street Fighter V, one of the Company’s popular titles, at the esports event held duiring the Tokyo Game Show 2017.
Under these circumstances, the Company’s flagship title Monster Hunter: World (for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), which was released worldwide in January 2018, significantly contributed to the Company’s performance after garnering immense popularity for its near-flawless execution and shipping more than 7.9 million units worldwide, a landmark achievement that made it the bestselling
2. Revenue and Profits
(1) Net sales
In this fiscal year, net sales were 94,515 million yen (up 8.4% from the previous fiscal year). This increase was driven primarily by our core Digital Contents and Amusement Equipments businesses. In Digital Contents, Monster Hunter: World was a record hit, while Resident Evil 7 biohazard and other catalog titles also contributed to increased net sales, especially in digital downloads.
In the Amusement Equipments business, sales of our pachislo machines were down 35,000 units year over year due to the impact of model testing methods and legal amendments of recent years. Overall, however, favorable growth of the Digital Contents business offset this, resulting in a 7,345 million yen increase in consolidated net sales over the previous fiscal year.
(2) Operating income
Cost of sales increased to 59,895 million yen (up 6.1% from the previous fiscal year) and the cost of sales ratio was 63.4%, down 1.3 percentage points from the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio has decreased in conjunction with the increase in sales
game in the Company’s history. Of particular note is that the worldwide expansion of the user base due to the game’s tremendous success overseas—in addition to its established domestic popularity— has marked the start of a new era for the brand, and that this international recognition has served to energize the Company’s global operations. The Company has made strategic preparations for a full-scale entry into the esports business in Japan, which include the establishment of the Capcom Esports Club at the Plaza Capcom arcade in Kichijoji (Tokyo). Additionally, the Company strove to bolster its management structure, enhance its development team and improve its development environment, enabling it to focus on home video game software development, which is the source of its competitiveness. Further, in addition to one-time physical product sales, the Company concentrated its efforts on expanding its digital offerings, which promise recurring revenues.
At the same time, in an effort to shore up its stagnant mobile contents performance, the Company made organizational reforms and developed appealing titles, aiming to increase customer satisfaction.
stemming mainly from the hit success of major titles.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 18,582 million yen (up 8.8% from the previous fiscal year) and
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 19.7%, up 0.1 percentage points compared with the previous fiscal year. The cause of the increase in SG&A was increased variable costs associated with increased sales, and the SG&A expenses ratio overall was in-line with the 19.9% figure in the initial plan.
As a result, operating income was 16,037 million yen (up 17.5% from the previous fiscal year), the highest ever and the fifth consecutive year of income growth. The operating margin also increased to 17.0%, up 1.3 percentage points compared with the previous fiscal year.
(3) Net income attributable to owners of the parent
Despite recording an exchange loss, net of 407 million yen this year under non-operating expenses, ordinary income increased to 15,254 million yen (up 21.2% from the previous fiscal year), following the increase in operating income.

   5. Our Financial Strengths
(1) High profitability of core business
Our medium-term goal is stable growth of operating income. We aim to achieve both improved profitability and profit growth by increasing development cost investment efficiency, carefully reviewing the profitability of each title and employing a strategy of selection and concentration on projects that can be expected to contribute to profits. Based on this policy, in the fiscal year ended March 2018, we were second among the five main players in the domestic market* in terms of operating margin (17.0%) despite coming in last* in terms of net sales (94,515 million yen). Our Digital Contents business was also second (25.8%) in the comparison of margins in game software sales, which is the core business of each company. As for our future outlook, there will be no change to our policy of maintaining high profitability, but in preparation for changes in the market associated with rapid developments in game-related technology, we will also need to make anticipatory investments in new fields. As such, we will make investments for growth in the medium-to-long term
Profitability Comparison (Year ended March 2018)
while maintaining a minimum operating margin of 15%.
* We have selected competing manufacturers whose core business is home video game software. We compiled the rankings based on information disclosed by each company.
(2) Financial flexibility based on high free cash flow
In the fiscal year ended March 2018, net cash gained from operating activities amounted to 34,721 million yen, primarily as a result of a record-breaking hit major title in our core Consumer business. Net cash used in investing activities was 2,847 million yen, which is the standard level for us. As a result, free cash flow came to 31,874 million yen. Compared to competitors with large businesses, we were second in terms of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net sales ratio of 33.7% is the highest among the five companies. This gives us a high level of financial flexibility compared to the industry standard. We will continue to promote measures for growth from a medium-to-long term perspective and work on further enhancing our capital policy.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
Consumer (Package + Digital Download Contents) Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), Monster Hunter: World, the latest title in the flagship series, significantly contributed to increased profitability by delivering record high sales of 7.9 million units. Additionally, Resident Evil 7 biohazard sold 1.6 million units, bringing the cumulative total for the title to 5.1 million units. Moreover, sales of Monster Hunter XX (Double Cross) Nintendo Switch Ver., Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers and other titles also grew slightly to boost profitability. On the other hand, Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite delivered a certain level of sales, primarily overseas owing to deep-rooted popularity, but underperformed overall. In digital download contents, in addition to contributions from sales of Monster Hunter: World, accelerated sales of rereleases for current-generation hardware and catalog titles with wide profit margins in North America and Europe resulted in solid sales growth to 12.9 million units, amounting to 26.9 billion yen, an increase up 73.5% over the previous year.
As a result, package and full-game download sales totaled 24.4 million units (up 25.8% from the previous year). Package

Corporate Data
sales were 38.3 billion yen, and digital download sales were 26.9 billion yen. Together, they resulted in substantially higher Consumer sales of 65.2 billion yen (up 32.5% from the previous year). In terms of profit, the strong performance of Monster Hunter: World made up for the shortfalls of other titles and re-evaluation of work in progress, bringing operating margins to approximately 30%.
For Capcom, we continue to consider Consumer business growth as one of the keys to achieving our medium-term business goals. Our initiatives are to (1) strengthen digital downloads, (2) bolster our title lineup through the full-scale execution of our 60-month title development plan and 52-week map and (3) awaken dormant intellectual properties.
Under (1), the prevalence of digital selling has made it possible to implement measures such as limited-time sales, increasing flexibility in pricing and expanding the impact of marketing. By strategically releasing major titles and additional content, while promoting catalog title sales, we aim to grow overall unit sales of a given series. Also, as one method of utilizing our existing intellectual properties, we will rerelease past titles on current-generation hardware primarily digitally in order to create sales opportunities and increase the digital download sales ratio. In terms of (2), we have been working to establish an efficient development system by preparing 60-month and 52-week maps since March 2015 in order to shorten the development period of core titles. Currently, we are aiming to establish a system whereby core titles can be developed in two and a half years, and we release two to three million-seller titles every fiscal year. Finally, for (3) we will continue to increase the number of developers and will work to expand profitability by reviving dormant intellectual properties for which we have not recently released new titles.
Next fiscal year, we will release new titles in major series targeting the global market, including Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry 5. Additionally, the development of a PC version of last fiscal year’s Monster Hunter: World has made it possible to reach regions that were once difficult to access; we aim to increase the number of units sold globally through ongoing sales, including catalog sales of this game. Further, we will strengthen digital download sales to increase unit sales to 25 million units (up 2.5%
Capcom Mobile Contents Sales (Billions of yen)
2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (Plan)
compared to the previous year), forecasting net sales of 67 billion yen (up 2.8% from the previous year) and a high level of operating income approximately the same as the fiscal year under review.
Mobile Contents Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), existing titles Monster Hunter Explore and Snoopy’s Sugar Drop remained stably popular, however, the performance of a portion of other existing titles declined. Meanwhile, licensing revenue from Asian companies associated with development alliances contributed greatly to profits.
As a result, net sales increased to 4.1 billion yen (up 7.9% from the previous year). Profits were also up, driven by licensing revenue. In the future, we will continue to develop new titles using our
intellectual properties and localize existing titles for Asia. At the same time, we will explore a wide range of possibilities, including alliances with companies in Japan and overseas, to create the next hit title. Next fiscal year we expect net sales of 5.5 billion yen (up 34.1% from the previous year) due primarily to licensing revenue from alliances, strengthening of existing titles and the launch of the Android/iOS version of new titles like Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2.
PC Online Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), net sales fell to 4.8 billion yen (down 15.8% from the previous year) due to the declining contribution of existing titles Monster Hunter Frontier Z (MHFZ) and Dragon’s Dogma Online (DDON). Losses shrank substantially due to elimination of the amortization burden of Breath of Fire 6, which was sunset last year, despite recording an appraisal loss for DDON.
Capcom will continue working to improve our revenue base through ongoing updates to existing titles such as MHFZ and DDON and by reducing SG&A by such means as streamlining management and reducing server costs.
As a result of these measures, next fiscal year we expect to shrink the operating loss as our cost burden decreases with the full amortization of DDON, despite net sales falling to 3 billion yen (down 37.5% from the previous year).

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), relaxation of restrictions in the Entertainment and Amusement Trades Act that took effect in June 2016 created favorable conditions for a continued recovery in market size. In addition to increased sales per customer resulting from more time spent in arcades, the draw of prizes featuring specific characters and popular products, higher operating rates of newly released cabinets, and other factors contributed to results. Sales from Capcom Cafes, which are themed restaurants featuring Capcom characters, and Chara Cap stores, which specialize in character merchandise, exhibited growth with the addition of new stores. Additionally, as an esports undertaking to grow the market, the Capcom Esports Club was opened at Plaza Capcom Kichijoji.
During this fiscal year, Plaza Capcom Tokushige was opened in Aichi, and Game Land Tsudanuma was opened in Chiba, while Playland Nara and Plaza Capcom Mobara were closed. The total number of stores remained unchanged at 36.
As a result, same store sales were up 2% from the previous year, bringing overall net sales to 10.231 billion yen (up 7.4% from the previous year) and operating income to 879 million yen (up 17.0% from the previous year), so that both sales and profit
were up compared to the previous year.
In the next fiscal year, Capcom will promote streamlining of
management through its ongoing scrap-and-build policy and ensure earnings at the same level as the previous fiscal year through the creation of new earning opportunities. We will work to expand the user base by providing playble demonstrations of consumer titles and operating original stores utilizing our intellectual properties. Additionally, as an esports undertaking, we will hold tournaments at stores in six cities nationwide in conjunction with the Capcom Pro Tour Japan Premier. In terms of the opening and closing of facilities, in an attempt to further strengthen efficient arcade management operations, we will open facilities in locations with high concentrations of customers to secure new revenue streams. In the next fiscal year, we plan to open four facilities, including Plaza Capcom Hiroshima, bringing the total number of stores to 40.
As a result of these measures, we expect same store sales to be up 2%, we forecast net sales of 11 billion yen (up 7.5% from the previous year) and operating income of 1 billion yen (up 13.8% from the previous year).

  Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), Ace Attorney and Resident Evil: Revelations machines were launched by the Pachinko & Pachislo (PS) sub-segment, and 22,000 units were sold. Additionally, in the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment, we launched the Monster Hunter Medal Hunting G game and focused on catalog sales, but sales were weak due to a lack of products.
Changes in the market environment resulting from such things as changes to rules concerning pachislo machine model certification caused a delay in two machines scheduled to launch this year, and we recorded loss on valuation and loss on suspension of some titles in the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment. As a result, net sales fell to 7.83 billion yen (down 53.7% from the previous year), and an operating loss of 764 million yen was recorded (as opposed to operating income of 5.16 billion yen the previous year).
In the future, Capcom aims to increase unit sales by continuing to (1) supply four proprietary cabinets per year, (2) secure a strong sales network and improve development quality through an alliance with major sales company Fields Corp., and (3) release proprietary pachislo machines not dependent on speculation and that feature a variety of clever video elements and playing styles.
Next year, although some voluntary restrictions in the PS sub-segment will be relaxed, the situation remains uncertain, so market trends will need to be watched. Under these circumstances, we are forecasting sales of 24,000 units, up slightly from the 22,000 sold in the year under review, as we launch a total of five machines, including Okami –Kaidouhen–, Street Fighter V, and Mega Man Ability. We are also shrinking the scale of the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment in order to respond flexibly to new trends in the market. As a result, we expect net sales to fall to 7 billion yen (down 10.3% from the previous year), but owing to the elimination of the loss on valuation and loss on suspension recorded in the Arcade Games Sales sub-segment in the year under review, we expect to record operating income of 1 billion yen.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2018), we continued to appeal to the non-game user segment through efforts such as broadcasting the animated TV show Monster Hunter Stories RIDE ON and rolling out experience-based attractions like Monster Hunter the Real at Universal Studios Japan’s Universal Cool Japan 2018 beginning in January 2018.
As a result, both sales and profits were up, with net sales at 2.338 billion yen (up 12.2% from the previous year) and operating income at 1.126 billion yen (up 16.2% from the previous year).
We will continue to leverage our strength of being able to reap substantial synergetic benefits with the Consumer and PC Online Games businesses by diversifying the use of our rich library of intellectual properties (content) and rolling them out across various mediums, including movies, animated television programs, theatrical productions, and events.
Next year, in order create business opportunities in the esports market, and to invigorate the domestic market in particular, we will establish a specialized esports division and leverage fighting games, such as Street Fighter, which has a high affinity for esports. At the same time, we will focus on increasing brand value and
expanding license royalty revenue on a global basis.
We will also continue to actively leverage our intellectual
properties (content), based on our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy with the broadcast of animated television shows Gyakuten Saiban: Sono “Shinjitsu”, Igiari! Season 2 and Gakuen BASARA, as well as with the continuation of Monster Hunter the Real, as we work to increase the value of our core brands through adaptations and collaborations.
As a result of these measures, we expect net sales to increase to 2.5 billion yen (up 6.9% from the previous year), but due to upfront investments in esports, including increasing prize amounts at events and holding events to expand the user base, we expect to record an operating loss of 400 million yen.

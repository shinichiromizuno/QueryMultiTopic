        The game industry is continuously changing, in step with the evolution of AI, communications, and other advanced technologies.

Capcom Co., Ltd. was established in Osaka in 1983. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) came out that same year, but it was difficult to develop high-quality arcade-level content for, so Capcom focused business development on the creation and sales of arcade games using the proprietary high-spec circuit board “CP System.”
Big hits drive business expansion
In the 1990s, the arrival of Super NES prompted Capcom to formally enter home video game development. Numerous hit titles were created that drew on Capcom’s arcade game development expertise. The Single Content Multiple Usage strategy was launched in earnest in 1994 with the release of a Hollywood movie and animated movie based on Street Fighter.

 ESG Highlights
Creating social value as a game publisher
With the rise in popularity of esports and the WHO’s international recognition of gaming disorder, in recent years gaming has transcended the framework of simple entertainment and is now recognized as content with a profound social impact. At Capcom, we believe that sustainable growth is achieved by delivering social and economic value, while at the same time building healthy relationships with stakeholders from the perspective of a game publisher. This entails tackling social issues through our business activities, such as training a workforce capable of succeeding on the global stage, and the creation of new markets.
Fundamental ESG policy
We believe that the principle of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*, namely that “all cultures and civilizations can contribute to sustainable development,” and our own corporate philosophy, which is that we are “creators of entertainment culture that brings you smiles and stimulates your senses,” are closely related. As such, in order to balance our own sustainable economic growth with a sustainable society, we intend to contribute to the development of social sustainability by selecting and addressing four priority issues within the ESG framework based on our fundamental ESG policy outlined below.
   ESG
Environmental Social Governance
The Capcom Group has been minimizing the negative impact of its businesses on climate change (e.g., CO2 and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions), and with respect to pollution, use of resources, etc., we have been striving to reduce our consumption of resources by adopting LEDs in lighting and promoting the digitization of software made available for sale.
The Capcom Group will continue to promote these initiatives.
The Capcom Group will respect human rights, prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, nationality, etc., thoroughly eliminate inequality by protecting the vulnerable, create a pleasant working environment for employees, and promote the securing and developing of human resources. In addition, we will promote initiatives to build a healthy relationship with local communities and customers, such as engaging in activities to assist children suffering from poverty in the hope of their healthy growth and development.
The Capcom Group has been enhancing management transparency and soundness, endeavoring to build a structure that is capable of adapting to changes in the environment and striving to boost its corporate value by enhancing its corporate governance function, including utilizing voluntary committees. Going forward, we will continue to further initiatives to meet the expectations of our stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and employees.
 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
SDGs are 17 goals that were adopted by the over 150 member countries of the United Nations at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit held in September of 2015 at the UN headquarters in New York. It was determined that in order to eliminate poverty and achieve a sustainable world, we must priotize the resolution of these 17 goals on a global scale.

We continue to hire more than 100 new graduates each year to enhance our product lineup and improve quality. Over the last 10 years we have increased our developer numbers by approximately 1,000 people. We are working to improve the technical skills and motivation of our employees by such means as enhancing our system to train new graduates, promoting younger and mid-career employees to work on major titles and achieve their own personal goals.
For details see p.53
Material 3 Development of Solid Relationship
One of the most important elements in developing world-class games that can keep pace with the globalization of the game player population is securing a workforce with diverse perspectives. For that reason, we have been promoting diversity and working on building a workplace where women and foreign nationals can excel. As a result, the numbers of both women and foreign nationals continue to climb, in turn helping Capcom create captivating content and growth on a global level.

For details see p.61
Support activities to eliminate poverty
For a game manufacturer, while the children who play with our products are our customers, they are also our future as they have the potential to one day become employees. It goes without saying that in order to play games, you need a stable environment, and in order to choose a career, an education is essential. Capcom is helping to create an environment for children today and in the future by
Generally, an owner-run company excels at being flexible and fast decision-making, though concerns may exist over the issue of succession. At Capcom, we strive to make management more transparent and visible, and have implemented various governance reforms to this end, such as the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. We proactively appoint external directors, and on March 31, 2021, external directors accounted for 50% of the entire board of directors. However, the transfer of one of our directors put the ratio at 45.5% as of June 2021. For details see p.67

In the fiscal year ended March 2011, we promoted profit structure reforms aimed at more efficient development investment. We promoted business restructuring by transitioning to in-house production and strengthened our digital sales strategy in response to rapid changes in the market beginning in the fiscal year ended March 2013. Financials were therefore sluggish that year while these reforms were implemented. From the following year onward we have achieved eight consecutive years of increased operating income with measures such as improving the highly profitable digital sales ratio in our Consumer sub-segment. The fiscal year ended March 2021 was the fourth year in a row we succeeded in breaking our operating profit record. This was due to a new major hit title and the accumulation of catalog sales, in addition to the fact that the highly profitable digital sales trend continues to grow.

In the fiscal year ended March 2012, net sales declined due to the postponed release of titles. However, the promotion of structural reforms in the Consumer sub-segment resulted in Capcom achieving net sales of 100 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 2014 for the first time. Revenue declined in the fiscal year ended March 2020 due to lowered unit prices accompanying digitalization, but in recent years, we have been experiencing stable growth as the Consumer sub-segment continues to release multiple major titles each year.

In the fiscal years ended in March 2013 and 2014 respectively, (1) structural reforms to the Amusement Equipments business, (2) development structure revisions in line with enhanced digital sales in the Consumer sub-segment and (3) strengthened Mobile sub-segment management capabilities in line with organization integration resulted in special losses on restructuring and business restructuring expenses. From the fiscal year ended March 2015, net income increased eight years in a row in step with operating income, due to the benefits from structural reforms beginning to manifest.

2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 (Note) With an effective date of April 1, 2018, Capcom performed a 2-for-1 (Years ended March 31)
stock split of its common stock. For the years ended March 31, 2018 and earlier, dividends paid show the actual amounts prior to the stock split.
Based on Capcom’s basic policy of maintaining stable dividends, in the fiscal year ended March 2011, the annual dividend was raised 5 yen. Since the fiscal year ended March 2017, the dividend policy has been to maintain a consolidated payout ratio of 30% and to strive for stable dividends. As a result, the payout in the fiscal year ended March 2019 was reduced due to the stock split, but effectively dividends increased, and we were able to maintain our unbroken record of paying out dividends since listing publicly. In the fiscal years ended March 2020 and 2021, we once again continued to increase dividends paid.

We believe the generation of creative and original content is our source of growth, thus approximately 90% of our annual development investments are allocated to the Digital Contents business. Recently in the Home Video Game market, development costs have been trending higher in line with increasingly high-performance devices, but we have been able to streamline development by building a cutting-edge development environtment and through increased employee utilization rates. Due to expanding our pipeline, we expect costs to be approximately 30 billion yen going forward.

There was a decrease in the fiscal years ended March 2011 and 2014 due to the release of major titles, but since the fiscal year ended March 2015 it has been on the rise as a result of pipeline expansion. In addition to the release of major titles in the fiscal year ended March 2019, reassessment and closing of overseas studios resulted in a significant decrease. However, in the fiscal year ended March 2020, there was an increase due to work on major titles we will continue to release in upcoming fiscal years.

In 2020, the consumer (package + digital) market grew to 42.9 billion dollars (up 22.2% from 597
the previous year). This was due primarily to favorable packaged and digital sales. Digital sales have continued to expand in North America and Europe where such sales account for 81% of the market. The highly profitable digital contents market now accounts for roughly 71% of the consumer market.

The forecast for 2021 is for the market to reach 51.8 billion dollars (up 20.7% from the 217 previous year) owing to continued growth of the digital market and revitalization of the market
303 380 454
with the popularization of new hardware. In the medium term, we see the digital market expanding rapidly in Southeast Asia and other developing regions and new game delivery methods such as streaming and subscriptions growing. As such, we expect the market to grow to 70.6 billion dollars by 2025 (up 64.6% compared to 2020). We also expect continued growth in the mobile market.
Arcade Operations Market
The domestic arcade facilities market grew during the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2020) for the fifth year in a row to 540.8 billion yen (up 4.0% from the previous year). The total number of facilities remained flat at 12,212 (up 0.4% from the previous year), and annual sales per store grew to 44.28 million yen (up 3.6% from the previous year.)
This fiscal year (ended March 2021), the market was severely impacted by COVID-19 as stores were forced to suspend operations or shorten operating hours during states of emergency while foot traffic decreased due to efforts to avoid crowds. The market situation next fiscal year (ending March 2022) is expected to remain harsh, although we can expect some recovery due to the operational know-how we have acquired thus far in the pandemic.
Gaming Machines Markets
In the previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2020), the gaming machine market shrank for the seventh consecutive year to 564.7 billion yen (down 16.1% from the previous year).
This was due to diminishing investment appetite for gaming machines at halls due to the sluggish performance of machines with gambling restraints (implemented in response to model certification methods changes), and fewer new stores. This fiscal year (ended March 2021), the new machine types showed promise, however COVID-19 created a tough market environment. Next fiscal year (ending March 2022), we expect some demand for new machines replacing older types (which was initially delayed due to COVID-19), but believe the situation will remain harsh from increased investment burdens on halls and operational suspensions due to COVID-19.
Esports Market
The Esports Market last fiscal year (ended March 2020) was 940 million U.S. dollars, and because people were consciously avoiding crowded events, that remains almost unchanged from the previous year. In 2021, we expect the market to grow to 1.08 billion U.S. dollars (up 14.5% from the previous year) owing to increased sponsorship and media rights fees, primarily in China, which accounts for the largest share. The future remains unclear due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, but the growth of live broadcasts has resulted in a steady increase of viewers, and it is expected to grow to 1.61 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.

Rooted in our unwavering philosophy, we are generating sustainable corporate value with our world-class development capabilities and management foundation.
To everyone battling this global challenge
 In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grip the world in fear. Cybercrimes taking advantage of this situation are now a frequent occurrence. In November 2020, Capcom was also a victim of one such incident.
Despite putting our best efforts into our information systems, ultimately personal information was compromised. I would like to offer my sincere apologies once again to all of our stakeholders for any complications or concerns caused by the incident.
COVID-19 is one of the many difficulties society is forced to contend with. Unlike vaccines and other medicines, or infrastructures, such as networks, entertainment is not essential to our daily lives.
However, in times like this, I believe that entertainment can bring people some joy and hope. It is my hope that our business activities bring
the people of the world the energy to fight through whatever difficulties they are facing.

1 Corporate philosophy and culture ––– Our unwavering philosophy since the company’s inception Aiming to be #1: delivering the world’s best content
 "From Osaka to the world"
I jumped into the world of entertainment more than 50 year ago with the idea that “games are luxury items, not essentials. This is why the brand must be of world- class quality.” I still believe this to be true even today.
Accordingly, Capcom’s basic philosophy is to create an entertainment culture through the medium of games by developing highly creative content that excites and stimulates your senses and brings a smile to your face.
In other words, we help make people happy and in turn build an emotionally rich society by creating the world’s most entertaining games. For details, please refer to “Corporate Philosophy” on p.03
In 1983, I founded Capcom under the motto of “originality and ingenuity,” with the vision of developing games offering world-class quality.
Underpinning this was my belief that increasingly
sophisticated graphics and more immersive worlds would eventually make games as moving and impressive for the world as a Disney film.
38 years later under the banner of Capcom, I have amassed more than 3,000 colleagues who share this vision. Under the slogan “From Osaka to the World,” these values have become our corporate culture, with (1) a spirit that is always eager to take on new challenges and (2) a sense of pride to constantly strive to be world-class deeply ingrained in every Capcom employee.
Our games are enjoyed across the entire world in more than 200 countries and regions, outnumbering the membership of the United Nations, because of the fertile soil of a corporate culture cultivated over many years.
2 Business model ––– Creativity and formidable IP assets
Maximizing utilization of high-quality content
 in a wide range of markets
Capcom’s strengths are (1) the development and technological capabilities to create the world’s finest, high-quality games and (2) numerous popular branded IP known the world over.
In addition, since fiscal 2013, we have strategically hired over 100 new graduate developers every year in anticipation of focusing on in-house development, increasing our development staff to over 2,450 people (as of May 31, 2021) and further enhancing our strengths.
From game market characteristics and competitive factor analysis, the Consumer sub-segment has high entry barriers; combining the aforementioned strengths with our capital and the relationships of trust we have with hardware manufacturers creates significant competitive advantages (profitability).
In addition, with the spread of PC as a game platform and the standardization of selling software digitally over the Internet, the home video game market that was once limited to only some developed nations has now expanded across the globe.
For details, please refer to “An Analysis of the Market and Capcom” on p.75
At Capcom, we see this market expansion as an opportunity. Since the latter half of the 2010s we have achieved sustainable performance growth by releasing PC versions of new titles and promoting the rerelease of major titles that were originally created for older game consoles for current-generation game consoles and PC.
Furthermore, in businesses and sub-segments other than Consumer, our rollout of popular IP across multiple mediums contributes as a stable source of earnings. This is because, in addition to the fact that our IP consists of products developed 100% in-house, possessing numerous global IPs amplifies the effect of our multiple usage strategy. Additionally, expansion into other areas leads to increased brand value and subsequently an influx of new users to the game. In particular, marketing activities utilizing Hollywood adaptations of content further enhances the global competitiveness (brand power) of our IPs and maximizes synergistic effects. In recent years, as a result of these sustained branding measures, we are increasingly seeing multiple generations of fans at event venues as IPs enjoying long-term popularity

Disney, which I once aspired to emulate, began

Our performance this fiscal year (the period ended March 31, 2021) exhibited an increase in operating income for the 8th consecutive year and all of the profit items from operating income down reached record highs.
This fiscal year, social activities were generally restricted due to the spread of COVID-19, but thanks to the strong performance of the major titles Monster Hunter Rise and Resident Evil 3, in addition to a solid performance from highly profitable digital versions of catalog titles, we were able to achieve over 50% in profit growth compared to the previous year.
In response to these results, those in the stock market have asked if the lockdowns had a significant positive influence on demand. It is true that the lockdowns due to COVID-19 became a great opportunity for those who do not normally play games, to try them. It seems everyone is concerned that this demand is something temporary and once we have resolved the COVID-19 issue, we will see the pendulum swing. However, I am not concerned about this at all, as evidenced by the 20% increase in profits we have guided for in the fiscal year ending March 2022. Most of our major titles target core gamers, and I believe that compared to our competitors, the benefits we received from any influx of light users was relatively small. Still, I see this as an opportunity for these first-time game players to become repeat customers who will now continue to play games.
I am starting to see a future where Capcom continues to expand the game market and new users with annual sales someday exceeding 100 million units.
2. Medium-term management goal assumptions and indicators
(1) Management direction—Handling the global trend toward digital
In corporate management, it is important to always think about things in terms of the future. For example,
nearly 10 years ago I gave an interview to a business magazine where I said, “if we are able to sell world-class quality products at a low price digitally, we will see even greater improvement in our performance.” At the time, packaged sales were the mainstream and there were very few customers who purchased digital versions, so that idea may have been inconceivable to most people. Also, because packaged sales were the mainstream, pirated versions of games prevailed in most developing countries, but I also spoke about how that “will become a sort of promotion if we look at in the long term.” As a result, now that digital sales have spread throughout the world, we are selling the more than 300 different titles we have created in more than 200 countries and regions, a number that exceeds that of the United Nations’ membership.
Creating top-class content not only produced this fiscal year’s performance, it will be the tool that paves the way for our future. That is precisely why our management policy is to (1) create exciting, world-class content (IPs), and (2) maximize earnings by leveraging our rich library of IPs across multiple platforms and media, while (3) maintaining these policies to become a company of continuous, sustainable growth.
(2) Medium-term management goal
Since the fiscal year ended March 2018, our sustainable medium-term management goal has been to increase operating income each fiscal year. Rather than struggling to coordinate major title launch periods for this, we intend to take a natural approach of establishing a model of stable growth through build- up by expanding our title lineup, among other efforts, in order to enable institutional investors managing pensions and individual investors on fixed incomes to maintain long-term holdings with confidence.
Historically, we had not set forth a specific profit margin growth goal, but from the fiscal year ended March 2021, when we were able to see the distinct results of the shift to digital, we have set a goal of 10% profit growth for each fiscal year.

(3) Key performance indicators (KPI) and shareholder value creation achievements
In terms of management, in addition to operating income (growth indicator), which is the basis of corporate earning power, and operating margins (efficiency indicator), which are the basis of profitability, I also place importance on current net income and cash flows, but our CFO offers a fully detailed account from a financial perspective. For details, please refer to “Financial Strategy According to the CFO” on p.43
Here, I will explain sales volume for game software, which I consider an important indicator for achieving our long-term goal. With the shift to digital, Capcom’s operating margin has increased for five consecutive years since the fiscal year ended March 2017, ( for details, please refer to “Financial Highlights” on p.17) but we are gradually approaching a ceiling
Diagram 1
Home video game software sales trends (units in ten thousands)
to that growth. In order to continue achieving increased profits for the future, we need to increase unit sales and increase our actual net sales.
Before we began the roll out of our full-scale digital strategy in the fiscal year ended March 2016, sales volume varied greatly depending on whether or not we released a new major title. However, in recent years, units sold displayed steady growth due to (1) enhanced digital sales, (2) longer product lives of major titles, and (3) the promotion of digital marketing and other measures. [Diagram 1] If digital sales continue to grow along with markets such as those in developing nations, the number of units sold will continue on to trend upward. I believe that by promoting these efforts, our realistic vision of 50 million units in annual sales volume will be our goal in the near future.

4 Management strategy ––– Development and marketing strategy geared toward achieving stable growth Using our long years of experience to
help us achieve our medium-term goal
(Years ending March 31)
 1. Investing in human resources and development equipment to create world-class games
With 50 years of management experience in this industry, I have a keen awareness of the vital importance of technology that meets the highest standards in order to create the world’s most exciting games. The game industry is a treasure chest of cutting-edge technology constantly providing the world with entertainment that utilizes the most advanced techniques, such as online battles, VR, and
AR. I believe we will see this trend intensify even further with GAFA entering the market. Therefore, in order to create games that become worldwide hits, we have to assemble a staff of employees who possess the most advanced skills possible. I have strengthened employment of newly graduated developers with an eye on the expanding game market and evolution of technology. Recently, our younger personnel are digital natives who grew up being familiar with games and IT. As such, even from a young age, particularly talented and motivated staff members may be

assigned to development teams for major titles or to our game development engine team, which comprises the core of our R&D. In addition, we have a world-leading development studio in-house and are vigorously investing in development equipment so that our creators can perform to their maximum potential. For details, please refer to p.53
2. Marketing strategy for becoming a global brand
Another important aspect is increasing recognition of hit titles and branding them.
One issue we needed to address was the fact that it takes approximately three years to develop a game, but after its release, there was a progressive decline in recognition. I thought a Hollywood film adaptation would be an effective means of ensuring the continued media exposure of a game title on a global scale, and in 1994, we decided to invest 4 billion yen into making Street Fighter into a Hollywood movie. At that time, some thought I had taken up movies merely as a hobby, but this investment generated a return of approximately 15 billion yen and successfully established Street Fighter as a global brand. Before and after a game is released, it receives media exposure for two weeks at most. However, by turning the game into a Hollywood movie, it will continue to be shown around the world for decades to come through its (1) theatrical release, (2) package sales, and (3) VOD services and other subscription-based video distribution services, maintaining and increasing awareness of the title.
The high level of awareness we earned here is now leading to growing sales of game software in newly expanding emerging markets. However, what makes this marketing possible is the fact that the games

The 4 Management Stages and Operating Profit Trends
themselves are world-class content. We have already achieved this success with Resident Evil, and in 2020, Monster Hunter was also turned into a Hollywood film. We will leverage these successful experiences to focus on continuing to create new brands on a global scale.
3. Medium term growth phases
I have always said that in order to continue achieving an increase in operating income each year, we have to (1) revamp our business model in the Consumer sub-segment from one-time purchases to continuous purchases, and (2) build a new profit pillar to flow into the Consumer sub-segment with our comprehensive Single Content Multiple Usage approach. Now, I would like to look back and explain the results we have seen from (1) together with the growth stages we have experienced.
In Stage 1 (March 1990 – March 1998), Street Fighter II became a global sensation and the world learned about Capcom’s development capabilities. However, the absence of any subsequent hit titles, inventory disposal issues and other challenges resulted in a nine-year period of significant fluctuations in income.
In Stage 2 (March 1999 – March 2007) we addressed the aforementioned issues of dependence on specific titles and inventory management overseas. We serialized multiple major titles, including Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, and Monster Hunter, establishing a system that allowed us to release a new major title every year. In addition, we conducted a thorough analysis of overseas consumer habits that differ from those in Japan and introduced a system of direct sales while devising a mechanism that keeps inventory below 10% of sales volume. As a result, we were able to build a foundation for stable earnings. However,

CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 30

CEO Commitment
with the globalization of the game market, the limits of a development division-led title strategy emerged, and we began implementing structural reforms to switch to a management-led approach that included the establishment of a two-phase approval system for prototypes and full-scale development.
Stage 3 (March 2008 – March 2016) is the period in which we engaged in governance reforms to strengthen our management structure and a digital strategy in the Consumer sub-segment. I will discuss our governance structure later, however in the Consumer sub-segment, in order to ensure the steady release of major titles, we began the comprehensive use of our 60-month map, which is a medium-term strategic map indicating the titles to be released over the next five years, and our 52-week map, which optimizes development personnel assignments over the course of a year, in addition to hiring 100 new graduates each year. Also, to prepare for the game industry’s upcoming shift to digital, we focused on releasing major titles also on the PC platform and rereleasing catalog titles for current-generation game consoles and PC. This had a synergistic effect with the structural reforms from Stage 2, and as a result, not only did our profit level display significant growth compared to the previous stage, but we also laid the groundwork for the next stage with achievements that include increasing our digital ratio.
Today we are in Stage 4, where we are achieving stable growth. The support for the PC platform and rereleases of catalog titles we implemented in Stage 3
were successful. Major titles have been contributing to profit earnings over the course of several years, and catalog titles that did not receive a sufficient chance to be sold physically are growing in both sales volume and earnings with digital sales. All of this has translated to achieving eight consecutive years of earnings growth. The game industry is looking toward a stage of further growth with GAFA’s entry into the market and the dissemination of new-generation hardware. In addition to maximizing the use of the organizational structure and know-how we have amassed, we will continue to increase operating income each year by, I. strengthening digital marketing with a clear view of the needs of each region, II. selling catalog titles that have already amortized their development costs at lower prices, and III. continuing to act while looking toward the future, such as by supporting new platforms like cloud gaming. [Diagram 2]
Regarding (2) a new profit pillar, we have been struggling with our mobile content due to issues such as compatibility between our major IP and mobile devices. However, with the evolution of communication standards, we believe we will have an opportunity to make significant progress here in the future. In order to do so, we are currently working on research and development in anticipation of the next generation of such technologies. We are also promoting investment in esports in preparation for future market expansion.

5 ESG ––– Initiatives geared toward sustainable growth
Increasing corporate value by building healthy
relationships and a sturdy framework
 31 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2021
1. Game company ESG initiatives
According to a public opinion survey conducted by the Cabinet Office in 2019, more than 62% of the Japanese people who responded said “Now that I have attained a certain level of material wealth, I would like to focus on living a more relaxed, fulfilling life” indicating that in recent years the number of people seeking emotional wellness over material wealth is increasing.
Games have made people smile, stimulated their senses, and created a new culture. They have also contributed to running a healthy society, receiving an endorsement from the WHO as for their value as entertainment while we have been asked to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I believe that building a healthy relationship with stakeholders through business activities leads to
improved corporate value. Therefore, focusing particularly on “S” (social) and “G” (corporate governance) of ESG, I recognize our critical issues as (1) developer numbers, (2) diversity, (3) support for education, and (4) the ratio of external directors. We will continue to promote ESG initiatives based on the SDG goals of creating a sustainable society and strive for sustainable growth while building a relationship of trust with our stakeholders. For details, please refer to “ESG Highlights” on p.13
2. Game company environmental measures
Capcom has been promoting the digitalization of game sales for some time. This initiative not only improves profitability from a financial standpoint, but it also reduces our environmental footprint by

     Value Creation Story
Medium- to Long-Term Latest Creative Report Growth Strategy
Foundation for Financial Analysis and Sustainable Growth (ESG) Corporate Data
removing the manufacturing, packaging, and shipping packaged products require from the equation. In order to promote better work-life balance among our employees, we also encourage employees to live closer to their workplaces by arranging company housing and bicycle parking areas. We can expect this to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases incurred by long commutes. Our work in selling digital content itself has a low impact on the environment but mitigating climate change is an issue that requires the cooperation of everyone who inhabits the planet, and we will continue to promote environment preservation initiatives.
3. Building a healthy relationship between games and society
Although there is a need for games in society, there are also some challenges, such as expensive in-game purchases made by minors and game addiction.
Our purpose is to make people happy through games. Making people unhappy because of games is certainly not our intention. We are aware that these are major issues for our industry as a whole, and each company is cooperating as part of an industry organization to make efforts to (1) establish guidelines and educate people about them, (2) share problems and actual examples among member companies, and (3) exchange information on a regular basis with parents, educators, consumer groups, and government administrators. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Customers” on p.57
In addition, since 2004, we have independently continued to be involved in game-related educational support activities as an initiative to alleviate social concerns surrounding games. For details, please refer to “Promoting Healthy Relationships with Games” on p.61
We also do our best to ensure a broad range of customers are able to play safely and fairly through measures such as refraining from adding “gacha” elements as a general rule when we develop mobile games.
Furthermore, for the pachislo market, we provide sponsorship and cooperation through industry organizations for the activities of pachinko addiction consultation agencies, such as Recovery Support Network (RSN).
4. Commitment to regional communities
The promotion of our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy provides society with a wide range of benefits. Specifically, these include the use of popular Capcom IP in local revitalization activities to support (1) economic development, (2) cultural development, (3) awareness for crime prevention and (4) awareness of elections.
We are achieving quantitative social outcomes through solving the common problem of attracting and
appealing to the youth demographic. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Regional Communies” on p.60
The above four activities are benefiting Capcom as well by I. increasing satisfaction among existing users through event participation, and II. creating a more favorable impression of games among those with less interest.
We will continue these sustainable activities that are a win for both parties as our popular content contributes to society while garnering interest in that content.
5. Commitment to employees
As can be seen from the fact that personnel expenses account for approximately 80% of development expenses, the game industry is not a labor-intensive industry but a knowledge-intensive industry, thus human resources are an extremely important management resource.
I recognize the importance of diversity for creating content that will resonate globally, thus Capcom promotes the retention and training of talented human resources without regard for gender or race. As I mentioned earlier, we have world-leading, cutting-edge development equipment enabling our talented workforce to fully demonstrate their abilities.
In terms of remuneration, in addition to a well-balanced salary system based on ability, we have also introduced incentives for each title and an assignment allowance system to increase motivation.
In addition, in the fiscal year ended March 2017, we established Capcom Juku for on-site childcare, to provide an environment for employees with children that allows them to work with peace of mind. For details, please refer to “Relationship with Employees” on p.61
In my view, the most critical aspect of human resource development is providing an environment that enables employees to take on new challenges. The manager’s role is to push employees to take on one new challenge after another and to focus more on devising measures for the things that are not working rather than those that are. This enables employees to take on challenges without fear of failure, develop the world’s most entertaining games and create new businesses leading to a virtuous cycle of business opportunity creation.
6.Continued anti-fraud measures for stable growth
As a company that handles data, it is important that we protect its value and associated rights. As the Chairman of the Association for Copyright for Computer Software, I have worked toward resolving piracy and various other issues for more than a quarter of a century.
Today, with the popularization of digital sales, we have stopped seeing the roadside sales of pirated
CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 32

CEO Commitment
versions of games that were once a common site in areas with many electronics stores. Meanwhile, the risk of cyber-attacks is growing as digital network technology becomes more widespread.
In light of the unauthorized access we experienced in 2020, we have established the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee, in addition to various other measures. For details please refer to “Information Security Initiatives” on p.72
It goes without saying that even once security measures are in place, it does not mean they are perfect. We will continuously enhance measures as we move forward.
7. Strengthening the governance structure
Risks increase in proportion to the strength with which you step on the accelerator for growth, but governance is useful in avoiding or mitigating these risks. Specifically, with myself, Capcom’s founder, as CEO and my oldest son as COO, we can avoid management decision risks by sufficiently leveraging the supervisory function of the external directors, and with unique mechanisms for highly transparent and rational decision making built by the Board of Directors.
Mechanism 1
Management visualization based on numbers
Despite changes in corporate scale or business environment, to conduct flexible and integrated management, I require that materials (documents) used for decision-making are, in principle, quantitatively focused. These materials compare and contrast net sales, year-on-year performance and earnings forecasts, which make it easier to identify problems by enabling us to confirm the details in multiple ways.
Furthermore, these materials are used for supervision by external directors and as IR materials for investors. We call this series of mechanisms “management visualization.” Management decisions based on visualizing operations enable us to evaluate the Company with two sets of eyes using a system that seeks management transparency.
In addition, when I speak with developers, I use quantitative data as our common language. The bias of the person speaking can be infused into words, while numbers never lie. I want to pass on the management know-how I have cultivated as founder of the company to the next generation in a practical manner as we work to strengthen risk control in order to create a framework for management that will ensure the performance of the company into the future.
Mechanism 2
Continued governance reforms
For the past 22 years, Capcom has executed a variety of governance reforms.
in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, external directors have increased to account for 45.5% of the Board of Directors.
External director appointment criteria have not changed since the system was introduced, but in short, we appoint directors with insight who are highly proficient specialists in their respective areas outside the gaming industry, capable of objectively making decisions regarding Capcom’s management and business activities. With the avoidance of business investment risk as a priority issue, Capcom appoints individuals who are able to provide sound opinions, especially when earnings are subpar, who are not intimidated by the company founder and are able to determine validity from the general public’s point of view. For more details, please refer to "Message from an external director" on p.73
In addition, in 2016, in order to further strengthen governance and achieve a swifter decision-making process, we transitioned from a company with a board of corporate auditors to a company with an audit and supervisory committee. The audit and supervisory committee is responsible for strengthening internal control by auditing how business is carried out by executives and employees and making recommendations for modifications.
Furthermore, since the fiscal year ended March 2021, we conduct an evaluation of the Board of Director’s effectiveness. The results showed that the effectiveness of the system has been ensured, and we received new issues to work on. We will continue to deepen our understanding of those issues and strive to improve functionality. For more details, please refer to “Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors” on p.69
Mechanism 3
Developing management human resource capabilities and grooming successors
I have grown Capcom for the last 38 years, and as the founding executive, it is also my responsibility to ensure my successors have a proper understanding of its mechanisms and are able to execute them. I actively engage in information exchange and advise our next generation of key personnel, namely (President) Haruhiro Tsujimoto, who leads the business side of our organization, and (Executive Corporate Officer) Yoichi Egawa, who leads development. Plans for my successor are being made through discussions with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee; if we can prepare my successor and enmesh that with our
corporate philosophy and well-structured governance, we can achieve stable growth.

In closing I would like to share my ideas regarding our capital policy, which is an important element of the relationship I have with our shareholders.
1. Basic policy regarding dividends
During my 38 years of management since founding Capcom, my philosophy has been to pursue stable corporate growth and reward long-term shareholders with steady increases in dividend payments despite the constantly changing nature of the game industry.
I have already mentioned the factors critical for sustainably enhancing corporate value; as shareholder returns are also an important management issue, dividends are determined with consideration for future business development and changes in the management environment.
Capcom’s basic shareholder return policy aims to (1) enhance corporate value (market capitalization) through investment in growth, (2) continue paying dividends (30% payout ratio) while striving for stable dividends and (3) flexibly acquire treasury stock to increase the value of earnings per share.
The reason I think both the payout ratio and stable dividends are important is, for example, because a sudden decrease or cessation of dividends can be risky for pensioners who depend on dividends to cover part of their lifestyle expenses. Regular revenue leads to the establishment of a stable lifestyle plan for the
future. We also receive requests for stability from the long-term investors who manage those pensions. Capcom shareholders represent all types of
people, and I assume some of them may be facing these kinds of issues, which is why we have never once failed to provide dividends during the 31 years since we went public in 1990. The fiscal year ended March 2021 marks five consecutive years of increased dividends. [Diagram 3]
As a result, the total shareholder return (TSR), including the rise in stock price over the last five years, was +538.9%, exceeding TOPIX (+162.3%) and positioning Capcom ahead of any of our industry competitors. [Diagram 4]
2. Dividends for this fiscal year and the next
Dividends for the fiscal year ended March 2021 were 71 yen for the year.
For the next fiscal year, we plan to pay a dividend of 36 yen, which would be the sixth consecutive year of dividend increases if the stock split is taken into account.
As a senior executive with many long years of experience in the game industry, my goal is to increase market capitalization and achieve corporate growth exceeding that of the past 38 years in order to continue meeting the expectations of all Capcom shareholders.

   Accelerating our digital strategy for our long-term goal of becoming a digital content company whose scope goes beyond games.
I have been involved in the game industry for more than 35 years, and it has always been moving forward with great speed, but the global game software market has seen remarkable growth in recent years with a 140% growth rate over the last five years and an expected growth rate of 39% over the next five years. Behind this is the growth of digital sales in the Consumer home video game market and the globalization of the market, including mobile content. At Capcom, we are actively promoting a growth strategy that focuses on the Consumer home video game market, and our medium-term management goal is to achieve increased operating income of 10% each fiscal year.
Since the mid-2010’s, we have adopted a digital strategy as we work to achieve our medium-term goal, and by maximizing use of the Internet as a sales channel, we are strengthening global long-term sales of game software. In recent years, the sales data we have accumulated has helped us predict trends for new titles and improve the accuracy of our pricing
strategies, leading to more efficient revenue acquisition. Also, we cannot forget that the traditional B2B business model in the game industry is now shifting to a B2C model. Getting closer to our users through digital marketing that makes use of our websites and social media will change the results we see in our business dramatically.
As our digital strategy comes to fruition and the scale of our annual global game sales volume reaches new domains, my vison for the future is to see Capcom becoming one of the world’s leading digital content companies with our brand’s content going beyond the boundaries of games as we adapt it to esports, movies, and merchandise, turning our brands into well-known staples worldwide.
I will now explain the path we have started along that will lead us to this vision of Capcom in the near future.

Growth Strategy

Achieve long-term sales globally
by further increasing the digital ratio
in our core Consumer sub-segment
It stands to reason that the Consumer sub-segment is the core of our business and the source of our content creation. As a result of our improved profitability and progress in our recurring revenue model due to our proactive measures for promoting digital sales in recent years, our operating margin, which had previously been stalled in the single digits, is gradually improving, and reached the 50% level by the fiscal year ended March 2021. This fiscal year we were also able to achieve what was previously a near-term goal of 30 million units in annual sales of software ahead of schedule.
The market is expected to grow by 65% to $70.6 billion by 2025, which will likely give the shift to digital a further boost. Considering these circumstances, Capcom will continue releasing high-quality content to the Consumer market underpinned by our world- leading development system in the next fiscal year and beyond.
For details, please refer to “the Head of Development Discusses Development Strategy” on page 47.
We will also enhance our pricing strategies and digital promotion and address a broad range of user needs over the long term to reach a new high of 32 million units in annual sales of software in the next
fiscal year and steadily grow toward the next milestone. [Diagram 5]
Measure 1
Steady annual launch of core IP
in global markets
The steady release of new high-quality titles is a prerequisite for digitalization, globalization, and for the evolution of our business structure. Since Capcom restructured in 2013, we have been using our “60- month map,” which is our medium term title portfolio map, in tandem with our “52-week map,” which manages the annual assignments of our developers, establishing a mechanism for the timely allocation of our roughly 2,450 developers (as of June 30, 2021) to the titles that require their skills. This has allowed us to continue releasing major titles each fiscal year contributing to stable growth.
In addition, one of our strengths has been the fact that our most famous brands, such as Resident Evil and Street Fighter, are very popular outside of Japan, which accounts for 90% of the market. However, when we released Monster Hunter: World (referred to as MH:W herein) in 2018 as part of our strategy to globalize the Monster Hunter series, the title received worldwide acclaim and has sold a record 17.3 million copies (as of June 30, 2021). Moreover, most of the

         major titles we released thereafter employ the same meticulous approach to quality and digital strategy as MH:W, resulting in strong sales globally. [Diagram 7]
However, we have not yet amassed enough developers for our future growth. We will continue to hire more than 100 new graduates and combine that with the hiring of seasoned mid-career professionals in priority fields to utilize our dormant IPs in addition to our existing IPs. This is a necessary measure for our long-term growth along with the creation of entirely new IPs, such as Pragmata, which we announced in June 2020.
Measure 2
Increased profitability and long-term sales globally with the digitalization of sales channels
Here I will explain our digital strategy, a central pillar in our growth strategy. We feel the main advantages of digital sales are (1) improved profitability per unit due to package production cost reductions and avoidance of inventory risk, (2) additional earning opportunities and long-term sales of catalog titles, which is a sales opportunity that was not available at physical retail shops, and (3) marketization of emerging regions where game consoles were not distributed. These items brought a major transformation to the game business. [Diagram 6]
The strategy originated in 2013, before the latest
game consoles at the time (PlayStation 4, etc.) were launched, after I learned that these game consoles would have constant internet connectivity. I knew a major change was coming to the game business and we established strengthening our digital adaptability as a priority strategy. Eight years have now past, and our digital sales, which were 5.2 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 2013, have grown more than nine times to 48.0 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 2021. During this time, our Consumer sub-segment improved significantly in profitability.
Digitalization increased earnings for each title, as mentioned above, but it also carries the further advantages of long-term sales and globalization. In the past, performance in the Consumer sub-segment was largely dependent on whether or not Capcom had released a new hit title that year, but now, once a high-quality new title is released, it contributes to earnings for more than 3-5 years. In addition to that, in package sales, second-hand distributors dominated sales of the last 36 years of Capcom’s content assets, but because we are now able to meet that demand directly through download sales, they have become a steady source of earnings for us. As a result, some 300 content assets are contributing to our earnings today. In addition, from the users’ perspective, digital has the substantial advantage of being available at the time you want it, and the digital ratio is rising each year, even for new titles. Our latest release Resident Evil Village has demonstrated a digital ratio exceeding

our marketing plans and ensure that globally everyone at Capcom is on the same page regarding our digital measures. As a result, since launching MH:W in 2018, management, development and business have integrated, and utilized Capcom’s websites and social media to adjust the quality of our titles in line with users’ needs and establish an appropriate funnel for purchasing digital versions enabling us to institute a system that is expanding sales. [Diagram 8] [Diagram 9]
Next, in terms of long-term sales and globalization, we promoted detailed and flexible pricing measures, such as limited-time sale offers that consider the needs of each individual region and user demographic. As a result, in the year-end holiday sales seasons in both 2019 and 2020, we succeeded in generating higher digital sales than the previous year.
Another positive example is the long-term sales of MH:W. More than three years have passed since its release in January 2018, but as a result of maintaining sales while gradually lowering the price, its cumulative sales volume has exceeded 17 million units; more than half of which were sold in the second year or later. The lowest price it has sold for thus far is approximately 10 dollars, but its development costs have already been amortized, so even at 10 dollars or, as an extreme example, 5 dollars, it will contribute to income. We will continue to keep an eye on sales trends as we implement pricing measures that appeal to worldwide users who have not yet purchased the game in order to further expand our user base before the next title in the series is released.
I have been asked if this will create pressure to drop prices in the future, but I do not believe that is a concern. In the world of luxury items, as long as you can provide one-of-a-kind high-quality content, there will always be those with the need to play the newest

In recent years, PC platform versions have also
increased their contribution to digital sales. We are now able to sell in more than 200 countries and regions, a number that far exceeds the conventional console market, and we have analyzed that there is strength in expanding sales in emerging regions, such as Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. I think that there is great potential for future growth in this area and have designated PCs a priority platform.
We will continue promoting these digital strategies in the next fiscal year and project achieving record high net digital sales of 51.5 billion yen. As there is still room for growth in pipeline expansion, long-term sales, and in global markets, we expect the digital sales ratio to rise to a level of 80-90% in the medium-term and believe that the Consumer sub- segment profitability will continue to increase while we make progress in our recurring revenue model.
Measure 3
Greater efficiency and maximized opportunities with the shift to digital Next, I will explain how digital has made the game business more efficient. As interest in digital transformation has grown in recent years, we have been focusing on using it more in our business. Games are a luxury item, and if we consider that in the near future digital natives will be the biggest consumers, it is extremely important that we meet users’ needs using digital communication.
In the initial stage, we established the Global Marketing Meeting, where management and global department heads meet each quarter to formulate

content as soon as possible, even at full price. Pricing measures allow us to present users with a variety of prices so that they can make their purchase at a price where they feel satisfied, and this is an enormous advantage for both the seller and buyer.
As initiatives for the next fiscal year, (1) we are promoting the formulation of sales periods and pricing optimized for users’ needs by improving the accuracy of our pricing strategies, and (2) we are working to make the process from when users become aware of titles until they make a purchase more visible by strengthening digital promotions to further improve our business efficiency and maximize profit opportunities.
Measure 4
Support for mobile content
and new services, such as cloud gaming
We expect Capcom’s growth resulting from the digital
strategies I have set forth thus far to continue for the
foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the appearance of
new services and technologies, such as cloud gaming
and 5G, have the potential to bring dramatic changes
to the game industry over the next 10 years. In addition
to adopting a multi-platform strategy, Capcom has
a track record of being quick off the mark in adapting
to new technologies, such as VR. It goes without
saying that we will continue to maintain a keen
awareness of new fields and conduct technical testing.
[Diagram 10]
If we look at it from a historic perspective as well, we can see that it has been new services and technologies that have made games even more interesting. I have great expectations for the further evolution of the world of games, and further am also
very interested to see what kind of merits it will bring to users.
Currently, I cannot say that we have had great success with mobile content yet. We have analyzed the issue to be that we have yet to acquire the know- how to monetize through the continuous services unique to the mobile arena. At this point, we are prioritizing the investment of our resources toward growing the Consumer sub-segment, so we are not in a rush to see results. However, with the new 5G communication standard, or its 6G successor, our dynamic, action-orientated content should become equally compatible with mobile devices. For example, we may see a breakthrough when it is combined with light-weight, next-generation VR devices. I have instructed the Development section to carry out technological research to ensure we are ready to grab the opportunity when it comes.
Finally, I want to properly convey that although our business format may change, Capcom’s top priority will not. That is to consistently produce world-class, meticulously refined content as we have always done. If we can continue to do that properly, then users will always choose our products to use with any platform or service. Conversely, if we fail to do so, even if we are able to ride the transient wave of a trend, we will not see medium or long-term growth. Our experience from many long years of standing at the forefront of the industry has convinced me of this.

Esports stands for “electronic sports,” which are video games played in competitions viewed as sporting events. They became popular in Europe and North America in the late 90’s and now enjoy popularity among young people in particular, with numerous and varied game events held throughout the world, including in Japan and Asia. They are also garnering attention as a new category in the game business.

Our businesses outside Digital Contents play the role of (1) pursuing business revenue, in addition to (2) providing peripheral support geared toward improving our brand value. [Diagram 11]
First, from the perspective of business revenue, we are working on initiatives for acquiring expertise and monetizing real-life and online entertainment using Street Fighter in the rapidly growing esports market [Diagram 12] as an option for future growth. Our Arcade Operations and Amusement Equipments businesses are positioned as stable businesses contributing to Capcom’s revenue by providing underlying support. In addition, from the perspective of achieving long-term stable growth for the company as a whole, we are focusing on expanding awareness of our IPs and corporate brand and fostering loyal users through these businesses, which will lead to increased sales in our core Consumer sub-segment and generate a cycle of returning profits.
Measure
Efforts to expand our esports foundation
The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to reconsider the safety of players and spectators, and therefore the format of how we had planned to hold many of the live events this fiscal year changed. On the other hand, the fact that holding tournaments online is a
viable online alternative is one of esports’ major advantages. In order to maintain the momentum we have built in popularizing esports thus far, as one of our two main pillar initiatives the Capcom Pro Tour, a worldwide series of one-on-one tournaments that are held throughout the year, was held online as it has been since June 2020. The second initiative, team battles, has also moved online since September 2020 with the domestic Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2020 competition—for which we have brought on roughly 10 new tournament sponsors. In addition, Street Fighter League: Pro-US 2020 is being held online in the U.S.
In 2021, as well, the Capcom Pro Tour Online 2021 is being held with approximately double the number of tournaments compared to the previous year, and the Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2021 tournament has expanded to eight teams participating in the team battles. These developments, and the fact that we introduced a corporate-ownership systems for teams for the first time, are helping us lay the groundwork for establishing regional team franchises and training institutions in the future. We will continue to work on promotional measures and to expand our esports foundation from a medium- to long-term perspective to firmly establish this new form of entertainment and implement initiatives so that when esports is widely recognized and understood by the general population, it will not only increase IP value, it will elevate the status of the game industry as well as contribute to society.

Shifting from a stable business to
a growth business
I believe that game content will eventually achieve a status on par with the world’s most famous animated characters. In the early 1990s, the booming popularity of Street Fighter II became the spark that led us to actively pursue adapting our content to products and Hollywood films. In the 2000’s, Capcom universally adopted the Single Content Multiple Usage strategy leading the industry in the development of cross media expansion. Today, as the number of users playing Capcom games around the world increases along with the growth of our business performance, I believe we are on the brink of major growth for our content business as well. [Diagram 13] In addition, my long-term vision is to see further growth in our business performance while we become one of the world’s leading digital content companies with our brand’s content reaching beyond the boundaries of games as we adapt them to movies, merchandise, and esports, turning our brands into well-known staples worldwide.
Measure
Consolidating strategic functions domestically
Traditionally, we have developed content at each of our offices in Japan, the U.S., and Europe, which has contributed to supplementing software income,
increasing awareness, and expanding our base of loyal users. However, in terms of growth rate, game sales
have grown 80% over the last eight years where our content business (Other Businesses) has experienced a growth rate of 12%. I believe there is still a lot of room for growth in this area and have therefore consolidated all of the strategic functions of our content business at our Japan offices just as it oversees our entire Consumer digital strategy. We have divided global operations into four zones: Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Asia, and will implement measures geared toward growth based on software sales trends and brand popularity in each respective region. The industries that we collaborate with are also diversifying to include industries such as apparel and theme parks. We can already feel the brand influence of our IPs increasing, and we will link this to the rapid expansion of this business.
Measure
Promotion of Hollywood movie adaptations and films for streaming
From a content branding standpoint, the effects of a Hollywood movie adaptation are immense. Adding to our track record with the Street Fighter and Resident Evil brands, the first Hollywood movie adaptation of Monster Hunter, released in 2020, was instrumental in providing a foundation for Monster Hunter Rise getting off to a strong start and helping MH:W get closer toward its goal of 20 million unit sales. In the future, we are planning to leverage our content into video streaming services which are becoming increasingly popular.

Medium-term growth strategy progress
Changes in the business environment
Capcom is making efforts to expand our users globally. In other words, we are working on increasing annual unit sales of game software. Due to the digital shift that has taken place in recent years, sales channels are diversifying. Our target sales areas have now expanded to more than 200 countries and regions, and annual sales of game software exceeded 30 million units in the fiscal year ended March 2021.
This is due to the fact that as digitalization progresses, game content is spreading throughout the world beyond the framework of traditional distribution channels, which means there has been a major change in user purchasing behavior. On top of that, the multiple platform strategy Capcom has been pursuing for some time has been effective in responding to the diversification of devices, such as PCs and smartphones that can now be used in addition to home video game consoles.
Our user base has expanded due to the promotion of a digital strategy that includes responding to the expansion of distribution channels, such as PCs and subscriptions, and the aggregation and analysis of

Changes to the revenue structure
in the last five years
First, I will explain the financial index Capcom prioritized these last five years. The table on the left shows a comparison between the fiscal year ended March 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 2021. The increase in operating income is quite impressive compared to the increase in net sales. This can be attributed to the expansion of our global user base (i.e., increase in unit sales), but also from a financial perspective, we are making progress in cost management with a lower cost-of-sales ratio and lower SG&A expenses ratio.
This is due to the following factors: (1) by developing and providing content that meets users’ expectations in the consumer game division, we have achieved net sales and unit sales numbers that exceed what we had planned, and we have posted performance results that exceed our assumed ROI, and (2) due to the evolution of development methods
Net sales / Cash flows from operating activities (million yen) Net sales (million yen) Cash flows from operating
activities (million yen)
and technology, we have become more efficient, which serves the function of absorbing increases in cost. In the last few years in particular, progress and cost management methods have evolved in development, along with a system that allows us to identify the problems and issues that arise in content creation and address them as soon as possible.
In addition, our practice of steadily hiring new employees each year and developing their talent as soon as possible is absorbing the increased development costs that accompany the evolution of gaming devices. As a result of these efforts, our work in progress for game software balance has remained at almost the same level as it was five years ago. This has contributed to improved operating cash flow, which is an indication of our earning power.
Changes have also been occurring in SG&A expenses resulting from the progress of our digital strategy. We are in the process of evolving from traditional sales promotion methods to using digital media to disseminate information. Promoting digitalization is helping us achieve lowered costs in terms of business and administration as well.
At Capcom, we are also aiming to lengthen the sales life of each title, and we are expanding our user base while maintaining the freshness of titles by releasing updates and holding events, even after a titlehasbeenreleased.Thisleadstoafasterrecovery of development costs post-release, and catalog titles released prior to the last year in particular show extremely high profitability. Expanded sales of catalog titles is one of the main factors behind the improvement in ROI of titles and the increase in profit margins.

Financial Strategy According to the CFO
Investment in future growth
strategies rooted in a strengthened financial foundation
I think everyone understands that the aforementioned strengthening of our digital strategy has brought about significant changes in our financial and profit structure, and that we have moved up to the next stage.
As a result, our ROE and ROA, which we focus on as indicators of improved capital efficiency, have made significant strides.
If you compare the same figures for the fiscal year ended March 2021 with those in our industry, you will see that we are positioned at the top. Looking at this, I believe that our strong performance this fiscal year was not only the result of being bolstered by the demand created from people staying at home to prevent the further spread of COVID-19, but rather the main factor was the steady progress we have made in our growth strategy, which we have been advancing for some time now, and that our medium-term management goal of stable profit growth each year can be achieved next fiscal year and beyond.
deposits balance of 100 billion yen. This is based on our aim to secure approximately three times the amount of our annual development investment. As the nature of our business is creating hits, we are constantly exposed to various changes and risks. Our desire to secure three years of development funds stems from the risk of being unable to immediately adapt to these changes. At the end of fiscal year 2020, our cash and deposits balance was 71.2 billion yen. Though, taking into consideration the amount of accounts receivable from new title sales released immediately prior to the end of the fiscal year, effective net cash was 87.0 billion yen, thus we are on track to reach a balance of 100 billion yen in cash and deposits.
Our basic stance of prioritizing cash, strengthening earning power, and enhancing capital efficiency will remain unchanged, but we will make swift and effective strategic investments based on our medium-to-long term strategy while we anticipate changes in the business environment, such as the Digital Contents business, where we expect to see further significant changes in the future.
I. R&D Investment
in cutting-edge technology
There is no question that the environment surrounding games will be changing increasingly. In addition to the evolving communications environment, we will need to incorporate the latest various technologies, including technologies peripheral to games, in our research and development to a greater degree than before. Bringing our research and development related to these new technologies to the next level will become an important management issue in the future, and we will have to address it proactively. In order to so, we will have to secure even more new human resources than we have in the past and aggressively invest in the research and development of new technologies.

II. Investment in business infrastructure
We will also have to respond to changes in our business structure. In order to achieve 100 million units in annual sales in the near future, we have to analyze how game users around the world gather information about games and make their purchasing decisions. In addition, we plan to accelerate investment in business infrastructure, which includes strengthening our approach to unauthorized access from external sources, such as the incident we experienced in November 2020 that was a source of complications and concern for our stakeholders.
III. Investment in securing
and developing human resources
R&D and content production are ultimately investments in human resources. In order to further expand our sales globally, securing and develop diverse human resources is essential.
We recognize that diversity is an important issue in promoting our medium-to-long-term strategy for the future, and as such we will continue to focus on hiring women as well as foreign nationals.
From the perspective of developing human resources, we have begun promoting management committee level issue awareness, to give highly motivated human resources, regardless of whether they are longtime or younger employees, the opportunity to proactively experience management issues, share new management issues in the future, and from among them, strengthen new proposals and our ability to respond to issues.
IV. Addressing ESG & SDGs
I would like as many people as possible around the world to enjoy our game content, and it is from that perspective as well that we will continue to be proactive in addressing ESG and SDGs. When we first launched our policy to expand and strengthen digital sales five years ago, we were also thinking about how
Capital investments / R&D investment costs (million yen)
digitalization would reduce the use of plastic and contribute to more effective usage of resources. Today, the way in which companies are addressing climate change is receiving a lot of attention, and we will continue to be aggressive in examining what Capcom can do as a company regarding this issue.
In addition, as one of our basic social contributions, we conduct a certain scale of philanthropic activities, and it is our intention to continue strengthening these activities into the future.
Approach to shareholder returns accompanying corporate growth
Our approach to shareholder returns remains the same. We will continue to strive for stable dividends with a basic policy of maintaining a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30%. As of the fiscal year ended March 2021, we have achieved five consecutive years of increased dividends if you take the stock split into consideration, and we hope to achieve steadily increasing dividends by continuing to demonstrate stable growth performance. I recognize that acquiring treasury stock is one of the most important policies that contributes to return of profits to shareholders, so we will take the appropriate action as opportunities arise when we can determine that it will contribute to an increase in stock value, as we have done in the past. Meanwhile, we are currently reviewing specific ways in which we can use treasury stock.
According to our estimates, as of the fiscal year ended March 2021, the cost of capital (WACC) was 3.52%. We focus on ROE rather than ROIC because of Capcom’s high capital adequacy ratio and small amount of debt, and our ROE for the same period (22.6%) far surpasses this number. We will continue to achieve our medium-term goal of a stable increase in operating profits each year, which will help us maintain our high standards and meet the expectations of our shareholders.

 1 Overall development policy
As we usher in the age of cloud computing and 5G, the global trend of being able to play games anytime, anywhere is accelerating. Furthermore, with the spread of social media, anyone can be an influencer, and the formula for turning a game into a hit is also changing. In this environment, it is essential that we develop games while taking into consideration expanding online services and coordinating with marketing divisions. Meanwhile, it remains crucial that we continue to produce one-of-a-kind content that can be successful in the global market.
Capcom aims to be the world’s best game content company. It goes without saying that we are putting great effort into producing games of world-class quality, but we are also striving to create fans via ongoing services that continuously stimulate user interest with strategic digital sales and the steady release of additional content to support that quality.
On top of the know-how we have amassed thus far, looking to the future, we are challenging ourselves to create games that will pioneer the next generation of Capcom quality with visual technology that produces impactful graphics and improved network technology that supports various devices and cross-platform play.
3 Cooperative technology approach
I believe that hit titles are not the product of chance, but that they are the result of the entire development organization’s collaborative efforts.
Game development at Capcom takes place on a large scale. One team can consist of more than 300 people. That is why we need an organization that is optimized for sharing knowledge and technology. In that respect, the division of Capcom that performs technology research, which is the foundation for title development, is the key to our success. RE ENGINE, which was created by the R&D Foundational Technology Department, made its debut with Resident Evil 7 biohazard, and most recently it was utilized in Monster Hunter Rise. These two brands are different in terms of both game characteristics and user demographics. In order to fully express the respective characteristics of each title while adapting them for multiple platforms, those in charge of technical development transcend departmental boundaries in their engagement with title development teams to provide the optimal development environement for each title. One of the biggest advantages of using a proprietary engine is that it provides an environement that allows our development team to focus on high quality game creation.
Monster Hunter Rise, which was developed in this environment, exceeded expectations in sales and has been well received among users. Going forward, we will continue to create high-quality titles that win over players across the globe by maximizing and evolving the use of RE ENGINE in our world-class development environment.

2 Development strategy
Based on our medium-term goals, as the head of development, I am striving to fulfill my revenue responsibilities by allocating 80% of the development investment budget to steaily developing popular IP series such as Resident Evil and Monster Hunter for various platforms. At the same time, we are also working on creating new IPs utilizing the talent pool we have expanded through our proactive hiring efforts. Most recently, we announced the action adventure title PRAGMATA for the new generation of consoles, and we are making steady progress on its development. Our proprietary game development engine, RE ENGINE, is an integral part of Capcom’s content development. RE ENGINE is an outstanding game engine that not only makes it possible to develop high quality games while reducing development costs, it maximizes the performance of each piece of hardware. For example, in Monster Hunter Rise it enables seamless cooperative play without interuptions due to data loading. We will continue to evolve this proprietary engine while promoting Capcom’s unique approach to game creation.
Further, we will drive our customer management to understand the playing trends and preferences of users while also building a business model for online operations, taking into account the situation of our free additional DLC for titles such as Monster Hunter Rise and Resident Evil Village.
4 Training developers
The starting point for creating an interesting game is people. At Capcom, we believe game development is the development of people, so we focus a lot of effort on hiring, training, and advancing our human resources. In terms of hiring, since 2013, we have strategically hired approximately 100 developers each year, and we soon plan to have 2,500 people in our ranks of developers. Newly hired young employees are given the chance to acquire know-how and skills through hands-on experience in the field as they are assigned to the development of popular IPs and major titles. PRAGMATA is just one such endeavor for our young employees. I feel that incorporating the youthful sensibilities of digital natives adds a new appeal to IP. In addition, the framework we have introduced ensures that that our highly capable younger employees are supported and trained by their teams so that for the next title they work on, they can take on the role of a core member leading its overall development. In this way, we are steadily training the next generation of leadership candidates.
Development amid the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a series a of trials and errors, as it was last year, but the pursuit of something through trial and error is also the very essence of craftsmanship.
We will never give up on our commitment to create entertaining games so that even more people around the world can experience Capcom’s content.

Monster Hunter Rise
  Whether solo or with friends, it's easy to pick up and play, and will leave you wanting more. Get ready to rise to a new hunting ground.
Managing Corporate Officer
Head of Consumer Games Development Division 2
 Ryozo Tsujimoto
He has served as the series producer since the release of Monster Hunter Freedom 2 in 2007. As producer for the latest title, Monster Hunter Rise, he oversees all aspects of production.
    A new “Mon-Hun,” perfect for playing anywhere
The concept of Monster Hunter, which has not changed since the first title in the series, is an action game that can be played cooperatively with others. When it was decided that we would develop a title for Nintendo Switch, which is highly portable, it inspired a strong desire in me to create a Monster Hunter game that was different from the record-breaking hit Monster Hunter: World (MH:W herein) that also took into account the portability of the platform. Game devices that can be taken on the go require a unique tempo and an “anytime, anywhere” playing style. I decided to create an entirely new title that allowed players to effortlessly invite friends to go hunting, providing a different feel from MH:W, which was created to sit back and enjoy playing on a
stationary console. Mr. Kadowaki serving as producer and Mr. Ichinose serving as director took the lead as we began development on Monster Hunter Rise (MHRise herein).
Balance between graphics
and action achieved with RE ENGINE
In order to give the hunting
action in MHRise a new
feel, we made use of our
proprietary development
engine RE ENGINE. Based
on the concept of
“anytime, anywhere,
effortlessly,” new additions
were introduced to the
game, such as the Wirebug hunting actions that allows players to freely traverse over terrain and Palamutes, which are dog-like hunting Buddies that players can ride to move between the seamlessly connected locales at high speed. We were also able to achieve both the highest standard of graphics for the Nintendo Switch and a short loading time. All of these innovations are the result of our efforts to provide stress-free play even without a TV or other large screen.
I feel that RE ENGINE played a large role in our ability to achieve this new hunting experience. The development team and engine are the two pillars expanding the possibilities for expression and action in MHRise.

The joys of hunting—now and in the future
Development was a series of challenges made even more difficult by the COVID-19 pandemic, but our team members overcame these obstacles and took great pride in developing this title. The staff members who will be responsible for the next title are making steady strides in their training. I am also happy to see synergistic effects, like users who enjoyed MHRise now purchasing MH:W.
The series has now grown into a brand that has sold a total of 75 million units (as of June 30, 2021), but we are not yet satisfied. There are still people out in the world who are unfamiliar with “Mon-Hun,” and there is still plenty of room for further expansion in game development.

Oversaw production on Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 and Sengoku BASARA 4. He became a member of the Monster Hunter development team on Monster Hunter Generations and now serves as a producer on this title.
The latest title in the series, MHRise was announced for Nintendo Switch in September 2020, along with the release date, price, and purchase bonuses, with preorders kicking off as well. Unlike traditional title announcements, our strategy was to announce all of the information relevant to players right from the start to grab the interest of as many people as possible. We then focused on increasing the frequency of user interactions with game information simultaneously worldwide by using social media to share game elements in videos and images spread over several posts. We continued to stir interest among users by releasing two free demos online that allowed cooperative play prior to launch. As we aim to acquire fans globally, we will continue honing our operational know-how with downloadable content, such as event quests, even after the game’s release and transform MHRise into a new pillar for the series.

I want each and every user to have more fun playing “Mon-Hun” than they ever imagined
When I heard from the producer, Ryozo Tsujimoto, that he wanted to position the new title different from MH:W, I started to think about how to establish MHRise as a new brand. The answer we came up with was an action-oriented hunting game developed for the Nintendo Switch. Using our in-house game development engine, RE ENGINE, we took on the difficult challenge of strengthening the action aspects with seamless locales while maintaining the quality of the visuals. This hunting environment is the first Japanese-themed world since Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. We created the game to incorporate new characters featuring more in-depth characterizations and new elements, such as the Wirebug and Palamutes, while also developing carefully selected quests to satisfy even those players with a limited amount of time to play. We will continue to provide players with moments they can truly enjoy. I think you will love it.

Wowing players with just how far we can push the portable game console experience!
The decision was made to develop MHRise using RE ENGINE, and I participated on the title’s development team as an RE ENGINE engineer. I connected the creators with the technical department in charge of engine development, and our mission was to achieve both stable performance on the Nintendo Switch and the highest quality possible. I was mainly in charge of selecting and implementing graphics technology and optimizing the overall performance of the game. It was a real challenge to make online cooperative play among a maximum of four players, four Buddies, three large monsters, and numerous smaller monsters and environmental creatures all operate on a seamless locale. On top of that, we devised ways to leverage the hardware to its limits in order to provide a satisfying game experience with beautiful visuals and short loading times. It was my great honor as an engineer, to be able to focus on the seemingly unexciting aspects that underpin this game.

Now a global brand, “Mon-Hun” has turned the digital shift into an opportunity to reach fans worldwide
With the pandemic limiting our ability to go out, I want as many people as possible to enjoy playing MHRise. With that desire in mind, we developed the strategic proposals and formulated a roadmap that would provide the framework for promotions and sales, in addition to coordinating with each country. As 80% of sales of the previous title, MH:W, came from overseas, the global market was key in our strategy. We did our best to ensure a promotion where everyone would win, not only in Japan, but globally. As all live events had to be cancelled, the entire promotion immediately shifted to digital. It was difficult to coordinate each measure while incorporating the demands from each country and region, such as release times and languages, but we worked in close cooperation with the leads in each area as we progressed. Globally we worked together as one, and we were overcome with joy when we succeeded in selling more than 5 million units in the first week after the game was released. Our team will continue working together to expand globally.

Using Instagram to convey the development team’s passion and allure of the game with the goal of acquiring new fans
The mission of the Interactive PR Team was to increase awareness of MHRise by conducting PR activities using publicity tools such as social media for communicating information and the internet to broadcast online programs. My job in particular was setting up and running an official Instagram account. Young people and women are the largest segments on Instagram, and our goal was to tap into new target demographics. I actively exchanged opinions with the development team and posted the most up-to-date information as it was happening. Every Friday, we posted cute illustrations of the Buddies and comments to arouse interest in users, striving to attract new MHRise fans. I’m grateful of the corporate culture that allowed me to be in charge of the game’s social media in my first year of employment, and I hope to grow along with MHRise as it spreads its wings and soars around the world.

Aiming for stable growth with a staff of 2,500
The path Capcom has chosen to ensure stable growth into the future is consolidating game development technology and knowledge within the company and steadily passing Capcom’s DNA to the next generation. There are some titles that are developed by smaller sized teams, but these days hundreds of people are needed during the peak development of a major title. We are actively hiring and training human resources ourselves. By doing so, we are able to improve quality and expand our lineup in addition to making games even more interesting by incorporating the sensibilities of the younger generation in each title. That is the aim of our human resources strategy to create a development team 2,500 people strong.
Three human resource development policies to strengthen employee capabilities
Our three human resource policies are early development of talent, putting the right person in the right place, and self-learning.
First, regarding early development of talent, when we hire new graduates, upon joining the company they attend a short-term concentrated program based on their job type, and we teach them specialized skills to develop talent early. Later, they are assigned to actual projects, and under the guidance of those in charge of training, they develop their skills and individuality by experiencing Capcom’s craftsmanship firsthand.
Next, our policy to put the right person in the right place is an effort to strengthen the training of managers so that they can manage human resources appropriately while we make efforts to centralize and analyze personnel information to be used in human resource development and strive to ensure strategic talent management.
And finally, the most important policy is self-learning. We propose and implement human resources training measures based on an approach which holds that people cannot grow on the basis of coercion from others, but rather only through their own aspirations. This is embodied by our Virtual Muchaburi Dojo (roughly meaning, “virtual audacious training ground”), which is a program for training mid- level development personnel. This hands-on
educational program was developed jointly by the human resources and development departments that clearly defines the thinking and behavioral characteristics common to model employees and allows participants to experience simulated situations that mimic development situations. The goal is for participants to gain awareness autonomously through this program. It has been well-received among participants who have said that the level design is wonderful and that they were completely engrossed and enjoyed it immensely. Our unique program encourages autonomous learning while honing awareness.
Transforming employee insight
into customer delight,
all around the world!
“I want to devote my life to the pursuit of fun.” Capcom is looking for people with such ambitions. I am happy to say that we are receiving an increasing number of applications from students who specialized in AI, networks, data analysis, and other areas essential to next- generation game development in their studies. We have high expectations that they will make Capcom’s craftsmanship even more robust.
Capcom has the potential to be the best game company in the world. We can turn the insights of each of our employees into pure joy for players across the world! The human resources department will do everything we can to support our employees and provide a place where they can shine.
World-class 3D scanner and motion capture capable of reproducing realistic movement
Our 3D scanning studio is one of the world’s largest equipped with approximately 130 cameras. Photographing objects from 360°, enables us to scan them as 3D objects. This significantly shortens the CG modeling process and allows to pursue an even higher level of precision and quality.
We have built one of the largest motion capture studios in Japan, boasting a 7-meter-high ceiling, which is equipped with infrared cameras to detect and film humans performing and then converts the footage into computer data. This enables us to pursue action that incorporates different heights and other realistic movements of characters.
Dynamic Mixing Stage, a 3D sound booth recreating reality!
We use a cutting-edge Dolby Atmos system, which can also be found in movie theaters, and which uses binaural technology capable of reproducing sounds with such reality you feel as if you are right there. It also supports aural changes that are happening in real-time and can reproduce any sound or voice from the front or back, or left or right sides, enhancing visual experiences with more realistic acoustics.
Capcom’s continuously evolving propriety development engine, RE ENGINE
It not only enables expressions that appear to be live action, but it is also compatible with the latest technologies, such as VR. In addition, it has dramatically reduced the time required for each process in game development. Another advantage of our proprietary development engine manufactured in-house is that we are able to constantly evolve its specifications with the cooperation of the game development team. It is an important element in the foundation of our ability to achieve world-class quality.

Environmental Environmental Action as an Entertainment Company
Capcom’s Digital Contents business accounts for approximately 80% of the Group’s consolidated net sales and primarily entails the development and sale of software. This gives Capcom an environmental impact that is lower than the general manufacturing industry. Because our environmental impact comes largely from the power used at amusement facilities and for manufacturing pachislo machines, as well as from distributing our products, we are focused on saving energy.
Reducing Power Usage
Reducing CO2 emissions by promoting energy saving measures companywide
    Capcom has worked to cut power usage through efforts that include ongoing power saving at all of its places of business, saving energy at its amusement facilities, and implementing peak shifting for the power used by PCs and other electrical equipment. The fiscal year ended March 2017 saw our CO2 emissions increase compared to the previous fiscal year due to the construction of the R&D Building #2 and Capcom Technical Center. However, in the fiscal year ended March 2021, we succeeded in reducing emissions by 9.5% compared to the previous year by introducing energy-saving equipment at those facilities and promoting the switch to LED lighting at each workplace.
Promoted energy-saving initiatives, including switching to LED lighting at each workplace

Every year Capcom has achieved year-on-year reductions to its energy intensity. For these efforts, Capcom has been awarded S Class (out of classes S, A, B, and C) status for six years running under the Business Operator Class-Based Assessment System that has been administered since 2016 by the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy in accordance with the Act on Rationalizing Energy Use (Measures Pertaining to Factories).

Innovations in Product Distribution
Conserving resources through digital sales of game software
In the past, games included a printed instruction manual inside the package, but in recent years, these manuals are now included as data within the software as a way to save paper. This enables us to eliminate approximately 30.10 million game units’ worth of paper manuals annually.
Moreover, the increasing popularity of digital sales, where games are downloaded after purchase, has made it possible to conserve resources used to produce discs, semiconductors, software packaging, and other components in addition to paper resources.
In the fiscal year ended March 2021, the resources used in the equivalent of around 23.15 million units of game software were conserved as a result of digital sales. We will continue promoting digital sales of game software with the aim of achieving effectively zero resource consumption in the future by selling solely via digital download.
Sharing distribution networks with other companies in the industry
Sharing distribution networks with other companies in the same industry when shipping products enables the efficient supply of products. As a result, we are able to realize reductions in packing materials, fuel and emissions. In the future, we aim to achieve further reductions by decreasing the volume of distribution through the promotion of digital sales.

Considerations in Game Development
In-game purchases
In the Japanese game market, discussions have been taking place for several years on the problem of gacha, or high-priced lottery-style game mechanics, primarily in mobile games. Overseas, gacha-like “loot boxes” have been banned in some countries.
As a creator of entertainment culture, Capcom believes that games should be enjoyed for the entertainment value they provide with gameplay, not for thrills associated with winning a lottery. We do not want to see games that are supposed to make people happy having the opposite effect as a result of excessive charges. For that reason, we are working to ensure that all users can enjoy our games fairly and safely. In principle, we minimize gacha elements in the mobile games we develop; in our home video games, we provide any content required to enjoy the full game free of charge, while offering some additional content at low cost.
Localization and culturalization
Capcom games are enjoyed worldwide. In the fiscal year ended March 2021, the percentage of home video games sold overseas was 80.9%. Naturally, translation (localization) of video games developed in Japanese is required so that game players around the world can enjoy them. The volume and importance of localization is increasing year after year due to factors such as improvements in game machine performance, support for online gameplay, and an increase in the number of languages accompanying a more diversified, global audience. As such, Capcom’s localization team is involved in game development from the initial stages.
By carrying out localization concurrently with development, rather than following completion of the Japanese language version as had been done in the past, Capcom is able to launch games simultaneously around the globe. What is more, depending on the country, simply translating games developed under Japanese norms can end up hurting users unexpectedly due to historical, religious, or cultural differences.
As such, we focus on employing staff from around the world to culturize the games so that they can be enjoyed by all, regardless of locale.
  Development and Manufacturing Initiatives
Reducing the environmental impact of pachislo machines
In solidarity with the efforts of the Japan Pachislo Machine Industry Association (Nichidenkyo), Capcom manufactures and sells pachislo machines partially made from recycled parts and equipped with standardized “green devices” aimed at controlling power usage.

Promoting workplace proximity
At Capcom, we encourage employees to live within five kilometers of their place of work and to commute by bicycle. As such, we have arranged company housing near our offices and built bicycle parking close to our R&D facilities. The primary goal is to promote a proper work-life balance by shortening commuting distances, but at the same time, it also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with use of transportation.
Bicycle parking
Exploring renewable energy
In October 2020, the Japanese government pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050. The goal is to realize a carbon-free society by 2050 and effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.
Realizing carbon neutrality will require the introduction of renewable energy that does not produce CO2 emissions. At Capcom, we have begun looking into the introduction of renewable energy to do our part to bring about a sustainable society.

 Healthy Development of Entertainment
Compliance with the CERO rating system and endorsement of guidelines
The Computer Entertainment Rating Organization (CERO), a Specified Nonprofit Corporation, was created to provide age-appropriate ratings for video games. Capcom complies with the CERO rating system and rules.
The rating system is an initiative for the healthy development of young people that calls for voluntary restrictions on home video game content and sales methods to limit access by young people to sexual or violent content. In addition, recent game platforms include a parental control function that enables parents to limit the online purchase and use of certain games according to their ratings.
Guidelines issued by the Computer Entertainment Suppliers’ Association (CESA)
Addressing addiction to pachinko and pachislo
Pachinko and pachislo are a form of entertainment that has taken root in society. At the same time, however, there is concern over players becoming addicted. For that reason, the Recovery Support Network (RSN), a pachinko addiction consultation hotline, was established in 2006 with the support of industry organizations. In addition to the launch of this free phone-based consultation service, various measures were implemented in the industry to prevent addiction. These measures included putting up posters at all locations nationwide to raise awareness of RSN, establishing a system in which pachinko and pachislo advisors (specialist staff) are stationed at each location to provide customers with appropriate information on addiction, and preparing guidelines for addressing addiction at pachinko parlors. In 2017, the Pachinko and Pachislo Industry Association for the 21st Century, which consists of 13 organizations from the amusement industry, announced the “Declaration on Pachinko and Pachislo Addiction,” strengthening measures to address pachinko and pachislo addiction and declaring it as a top priority. In May 2021, the association played a central role in holding online forums on the “Special Website for the Issue of Pachinko and Pachislo Addiction,” which provides an overview of addiction and information on industry initiatives. The website has rolled out various educational activities.
In fiscal 2019, the “Basic Guidelines for Measures to Address Pachinko Addiction” and the “Pachinko and Pachislo Industry Guidelines for Measures to Address Addiction” were established based on the government’s Basic Plan for Promoting Measures to Address Gambling and Other Addictions.
Capcom endorses and cooperates with these initiatives to contribute to healthy development of the industry.
Support for Community-building among Senior Citizens
Holding regular amusement arcade tours
Today, amusement facilities are becoming increasingly popular among senior citizens as spaces for communication with friends and facility staff. Since 2012, Capcom has held amusement arcade tours free of charge on long public holidays and Respect-for-the-Aged Day for senior citizens where they can try out coin-operated games and crane games, enabling more people to make use of such facilities.
* The tours were suspended in fiscal 2020 to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
In addition, as part of efforts to create arcades where senior citizens can comfortably enjoy themselves, since 2012 Capcom has encouraged arcade staff to get the Service Assistant certification. Currently, 24 staff members have received this certification.

Addressing the WHO’s recognition of gaming disorder
In May 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) included gaming disorder as a new mental health condition characterized by excessive use of games to the point where it has a negative impact on health and social life. Cooperating with industry organizations such as the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association, we are taking the appropriate steps to raise awareness of the issue in response to social demand. As an independent effort, we will continue to educate elementary and junior high school students on how to interact with games in a healthy manner through our educational support program.

In response to the unauthorized access of Capcom’s network in 2020, improvements were made to the security system to prevent recurrence. Additionally, the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee, which includes multiple outside experts, was established in January 2021. It holds regular meetings with the aim of further improving information security.
Expanding opportunities for customers to play games
In recent years, we have been focusing on promoting esports as part of our efforts as a creator of entertainment culture.
We have the role of planning and organizing events as a game manufacturer—a role that had been largely shouldered by the player community in the past—in order to provide an environment that better allows competitors and fans to enjoy the excitement of competitions.
Since 2013, we have held Capcom Cup to determine the top players in the world. We are also working to provide amateur players with opportunities to shine, such as with the new Street Fighter League: College-JP 2019 for students, in June 2019.
Through these activities, we aim to increase points of contact with our customers and improve customer satisfaction. In fiscal 2021, we will hold Capcom Pro Tour Online 2021, a series of 32 1-on-1 tournaments carried out in 19 regions across the globe. We are also introducing a team ownership system in the Japanese esports league Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2021, in which eight companies form original teams that participate. In these and other ways, we are expanding the scope of our activities.

Contributions to Regional Revitalization
Utilizing the appeal and brand recognition of popular games to contribute to society
The appeal of video game content was demonstrated to the world during the opening ceremonies of the preeminent international sporting event of summer 2021 held in Tokyo when video game music was played to accompany the entrance of the athletic teams. In the same vein, Capcom is following a Single Content Multiple Usage strategy for our content, which we deploy in a wide range of fields beyond video games. As such, we are proud to have a high level of recognition and popularity among men and women, young and old alike.
Based on our corporate philosophy of making people happy through games, Capcom has been engaged in the following four regional revitalization activities not only in Osaka, where we have our head office, but across Japan, since the mid-2000s: 1) economic promotion that supports the local tourism industries; 2) cultural awareness raising that supports education concerning local history and culture; 3) crime prevention education through coordination with the police; and 4) raising awareness about voting in elections in coordination with the Committee for Election Administration.
Further, going forward we will provide support for esports activities regionally throughout Japan while looking into activities to promote regional revitalization through playing games.

Miharu is an historic castle town known as the birthplace of Megohime, the daughter of Tamura Kiyoaki (who was the lord of the Miharu Castle), and wife of Date Masumune, who was nicknamed Dokuganryu, or the One-Eyed Dragon.
We collaborated with Capcom to utilize the Felyne characters from Monster Hunter in a traffic safety PR campaign. The main target of the campaign was elementary and junior high school students, and the Felyne were a big hit with children and students.
Going forward, we hope to continue collaborating with Capcom, a company that values community engagement, utilizing anime and game content that appeals to young people in regional revitalization efforts.

  Promoting Healthy Relationships with Games
More than a decade of on-site classes for children in school
Games are a relatively new cultural phenomenon with little academic research, and discussions tend to focus on the detrimental effects rather than the educational aspects. Recently, recognition by WHO of gaming disorder made headlines as did the establishment of the Kagawa Prefectural Ordinance on Countermeasures for Addiction to Internet and Computer Games. However, video game creator is a popular future career choice among children, and programming and other such lessons will be made compulsory in Japanese elementary schools starting in 2020. Many private sector efforts are also underway, including opening programming academies for youth. Considering these developments, it is reasonable to expect that the number of children hoping to become game creators will increase. Additionally, smartphone use rates among young people—53.1% of elementary school students and 79.3% of junior high school students—are rising each year. Smartphone games are also gaining popularity and children are growing more familiar with games.
Given this, with a desire to promote social understanding of games, we accept visits to our offices from primarily elementary and junior high school students and conduct on-site classes at schools to promote sustainable economic growth and social development. Class programs have three sessions: Career Education introduces the work done in a game company and its challenges and rewards; Game Literacy Education helps students use their judgement to build a healthy relationship with games; and CAPCOM: Work × Mathematics shows students how mathematics—typically not a favorite subject—is used in work. These programs have been well-received with schools, and Capcom is incorporating educators’ feedback to improve them. In addition, based on prior feedback expressed by educators we launched an online program starting in fiscal 2021, which also allows us to hold classes smoothly even during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to launch new initiatives to enable us to respond flexibly over a wider geographical area than before.
Altogether, Capcom has welcomed 3,355 children as part of 403 different field trips to its offices (as of March 31, 2021). Capcom has also held 174 on-site classes for 15,726 students (as of March 31, 2021) at schools such as the one held at Miharu Junior High School in Fukushima Prefecture in November 2020.
Relationship with Employees
Promotion of Diversity
Initiatives aimed at promoting the improvement of the work environment for women and proactively hiring non-Japanese
Capcom is currently engaged in initiatives aimed at improving the work environment for women and proactively hiring non-Japanese.
In terms of providing an environment that facilitates women, we introduced systems enabling women to take a leave of absence before and after giving birth, childcare leave and shortened working hours, and promote their use throughout the Company. In fiscal 2020, 34 employees took childcare leave, 17 of whom were men, and 100% of eligible women took childcare leave (fiscal 2019: 23 employees, 10 of whom were men and 100% of eligible women took leave). A high percentage of women returned to work afterwards: 31 (96.9%) returned in fiscal 2020 (fiscal 2019: 27 (100%) returned). As a result, despite it being said that Japan’s gaming industry is generally dominated by men, women account for roughly 22% of Capcom’s workforce, and 27 (10.3%) of Capcom’s managers are women. In accordance with the execution of the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children and the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace, in 2019 we formulated the General Employer Action Plan, which seeks to achieve two things: (1) developing a personnel system that contributes to diversity in work styles, and (2) having women comprise at least 15% of managers by the end of fiscal 2024. In recognition of Capcom’s efforts toward improving the workplace environment for women, since 2014 we have earned the “Kurumin” mark, the symbol of a “company supporting childcare,” from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
In terms of the proactive employment of non-Japanese individuals, Capcom is making efforts to strengthen overseas expansion capabilities including creating an English hiring website. We currently employ 192 non-Japanese workers (representing 6.5% of our employees). Going forward, we will create a system for improving motivation in an attempt to increase the ratio of foreign employees, including support for career advancement and the promotion of non-Japanese individuals to management positions.

Listening to the stories of people who do the work, such as programmers and sound creators, and observing their enthusiasm made me want to be like them when I start working in the future. (Elementary school student)
Because it came from a game creator rather than a teacher, the lesson of how to make and interact with games really resonated with the children. (Elementary school teacher) (The students) seemed to recognize that they themselves were consumers and realize that on the other side of the games there are efforts being made by the game creators.

Supporting employees’ health management
The employee cafeteria was renovated in 2015 when the new development studio was completed. Healthy meals are served for breakfast, lunch, and supper. There is also a massage room staffed by nationally-certified massage therapists at both the Tokyo and Osaka locations to support our employees in managing their health.
Fulfilling employee potential in a cutting-edge environment
The biggest thing when it comes to motivating developers working in a creative field such as games is access to an environment that allows them to bring their ideas to life. Capcom maintains a cutting-edge development environment that includes 3D scanners, a motion capture studio, a dynamic sound mixing stage, and a Foley stage. In this way, we support our creators in fulfilling their vision.
Capcom Juku
Providing an environment for vibrant childcare combining day care and education
Given the desire to quickly improve the issue of long day care waiting lists accompanying a lack of preschools, Capcom’s top management set its sights on the future, desiring to provide an environment in which employees can raise their children with peace of mind while remaining employed over the long term. We operate Capcom Juku aiming to add individual education and growth to standard day care for children.
Capcom Juku goes beyond caring for infants and preschool children and accepts a wide range of youth, including after-school kindergarten and elementary school students. This helps employees avoid the stress of not being able to find open facilities for their children. Furthermore, by offering educational support in the form of a place for learning English, eurhythmics, math, science, and other subjects, Capcom Juku joins its efforts with employees and fosters the growth of children. Currently, as of March 31, 2021, the school takes care of 19 children a month and accepts as many as 18 temporary pupils a month.
In the future, we will create a learning atmosphere at Capcom Juku that stimulates and broadens children’s curiosity, while also striving for an environment where parents can work with peace of mind so that both they and their families can lead fulfilling lives.

I oversee the North/South American PR, social/community, and customer service teams, which are responsible for communications including those with media, fans and customers. I myself am a big fan of Capcom’s games which makes it even more rewarding to see the recognition and reputation of our brands grow through our hard work. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were restrictions in place preventing us from having regular face-to-face interactions with others including colleagues, media partners and player communities. However, by adapting our approach to use digital tools and strategies, we were able to find new ways to achieve our goals in an effective manner. As a manager, I endeavor to lead in such a way that allows team members to demonstrate their full potential by fostering a supportive atmosphere and collaborative culture.

  Providing a Pleasant Workplace
Promoting work-life balance
Creating entertainment culture requires that creators themselves make time for play.
At Capcom, we have established Paid Leave Promotion Days and encourage employees to take extended leave to refresh and look for new sources of inspiration during the year-end/New Year’s holidays as well as during the series of holidays in May. Additionally, we have built a four-story bicycle parking facility near our development studio and encourage our employees to live within a five-kilometer radius to shorten commuting times. This saves time and living costs while giving creators the free time necessary to cultivate their creative powers and imaginations, which is essential for creative work. Moreover, we opened Capcom Juku as an on-site daycare

   Corporate Governance Structure
Enhancing management soundness and transparency while responding to changes in the environment
Capcom is aware that comprehensive corporate governance ranks among management’s most important priorities. Because of this, in addition to enhancing management soundness and transparency, we are increasing corporate value by building a trusting relationship with our stakeholders. These stakeholders include shareholders, business partners, employees and regional societies.
Shareholders’ Meeting
(Convened on June 22, 2021)
Determines important matters as the highest decision-making body
The general shareholders’ meeting serves as Capcom’s highest decision-making body and determines important matters prescribed by laws, regulations, and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as well as serves as a place for communicating the audit results of divisional reports and consolidated financial statements.
Invitations to the general shareholders’ meeting are issued approximately three weeks before convening the session, and efforts are made to allow for greater attendance by having the session about 10 days before the date on which most other companies hold their meetings. We have also made it possible for shareholders to exercise their voting rights over the internet using a computer, smartphone or mobile phone. In addition, we participate in an electronic voting rights exercise platform for institutional investors so that they will have sufficient time to review the proposals.

(Convened 10 times in the year ended March 31, 2021)
Supervision
Cooperating with accounting auditors and the internal audit department to audit and supervise
The Audit and Supervisory Committee (chaired by an external director) is composed of three directors (two of whom are full-time members), with two of the three directors being external directors.
In principle, the committee meets before a Board of Directors’ meeting is convened. The committee deliberates on important matters stipulated by the Rules for the Audit and Supervisory Committee and strives to strengthen audits and supervision.
Audit and Supervisory Committee members selected by the same committee carry out on-site audits themselves and, in order to increase the efficacy of audits, carry out dynamic organizational audits, including issuing instructions and other actions as necessary to, among others, the Internal Audit Division (directly under the control of the Audit and Supervisory Committee). The Internal Audit Division strives to ensure that audits function effectively by reporting the status of audits and improvements, and other issues to Audit and Supervisory Committee members.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee
(Convened three times in the year ended March 31, 2021)
Selection of candidates for director and deliberating and recommending details of director compensation
The voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee (chaired by an external director) is composed of five directors (two of whom are internal directors and three of whom are external directors), with a majority of members being external directors.
Each committee member is selected based on the Board of Directors’ appraisal of his or her knowledge, insight, experience, and other qualities.
When selecting candidates to be nominated for director (excluding directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee) and candidates to be nominated for director who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, the Board of Directors makes its decisions after consulting with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and takes their recommendations into account in order to increase transparency and objectivity. The consent of the Audit and Supervisory Committee is obtained when selecting candidates to be nominated for director who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.
In addition, when determining individual compensation of top management and directors, the Board of Directors makes its decisions after consulting with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which deliberates and makes recommendations based on the policy for determining compensation, and takes their recommendations into account in order to ensure fairness and transparency. Individual compensation of directors who are members of the Audit and
Management decisions that incorporate external directors’ opinions
The Board of Directors is composed of 11 directors (chaired by the Representative Director and Chairman of the Board), with five of the directors being external directors.
The Board deliberates on important matters stipulated by laws, regulations, and the Rules of the Board of Directors, and strives to strengthen supervisory functions through the guidance, suggestions, and active comments of external directors.
In order to enrich deliberations, a portion of decision-making authority for the execution of important business is entrusted to the representative directors and others, while matters brought before the Board are narrowed to those of high importance, and the number of times the Board of Directors is convened is reduced. As a result, the efficiency of business execution has increased due to quick decision making and dynamic management practices.
 CAPCOM INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 66

Corporate Governance
Supervisory Committee is determined through discussion with each director who is a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, taking into account such factors as whether they are full time or part time. In order to ensure their independence, the compensation is fixed and not linked to performance of the Company.
The Compliance Committee
(Convened four times in the year ended March 31, 2021)
Focusing on Compliance as an Important Management Issue
The Compliance Committee is composed of 10 directors (five of whom are external directors, and the committee chairman is an attorney and external director).
In principle, the committee convenes once per quarter. Its primary activities are to analyze and assess risks to Capcom Group compliance and consider what action to take. In addition, the committee strives for early detection and prevention of legal violations or inappropriate conduct by finding internal risks and reporting their probability of materializing to the Board of Directors.
Accounting Auditors Audit Ensuring and Verifying Accounting Transparency
Capcom has concluded an auditing contract with KPMG AZSA LLC for financial audits as prescribed by the Companies Act and financial audits as prescribed by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. There is no special relationship involving financial or other interests between Capcom and this audit corporation or the engagement partners at this firm who perform audits at Capcom.
The main activities of the Internal Audit Division are verifying and evaluating the status of employees’ execution of duties and the efficacy (and status of operation) of internal control systems, and reporting to the Audit and Supervisory Committee. When needed, division members also accompany selected Audit and Supervisory Committee members and carry out on-site audits of offices and subsidiaries inside and outside Japan.
Corporate Management Council Implementation (Convened 15 times in the year ended March 31, 2021)
Supporting the Board of Directors’ decisions
The Corporate Management Council (chaired by the Representative Director and Chairman of the Board) is composed of six internal directors and, in principle, is convened several days before a meeting of the Board of Directors, or whenever necessary.
In addition to meeting to carry out preliminary deliberations of Board of Directors agenda items, it also deliberates other important items.
Board of Corporate Officers Implementation (Convened 12 times in the year ended March 31, 2021)
Executing operations based on management policy
Capcom utilizes a Corporate Officer System. In addition to clarifying the roles and responsibilities of directors focused on management and corporate officers focused on business execution, the system boosts management efficiency by allowing officers to swiftly execute business following instructions from executive directors regarding important matters determined at the Board of Directors.
The Board of Corporate Officers is composed of 15 corporate officers (four of whom serve concurrently as directors), and in principle, convenes once a month. Each corporate officer reports on the status of business execution and works to ensure that information is shared, while also exchanging opinions on business items and issues that require resolution.
External Directors
Using external perspectives to ensure effective governance
External directors ensure the effectiveness of the corporate governance function by playing key roles in the Compliance Committee and the voluntary Nomination and Remuneration Committee. They also focus efforts on compliance and the prevention of corrupt or illegal activities, and openly exchange opinions and provide counsel at Board of Directors meetings in an effort to strengthen the management audit function. The Secretariat staff helps with the work of the external directors who are not members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. For external directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, the full-time staff of the Internal Audit Division helps with their work.

            Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
The Company performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in fiscal 2020 to further improve its function. In order to solicit individual opinions, each board member
was given a questionnaire or interviewed. We then exchanged opinions based on an analysis of those results.
In this evaluation, we found that the Board of Directors is functioning effectively and, as shown on the right, confirmed new areas to enhance the supervisory function of management. We will continue to leverage the strengths of the Board of Directors and deepen our understanding of the challenges faced as we work to further improve its function.
Initiatives for the Shareholders’ Meeting
Making shareholders’ meetings lively and facilitating the exercise of voting rights
To ensure our shareholders’ meetings are lively, we hold our meeting about 10 days before the period when most Japanese companies typically hold their meetings in an attempt to encourage the attendance of as many shareholders as possible.
Also, voting rights can be exercised online via PC, smartphone or mobile phone. In addition, we have participated from an early stage in a platform for the online exercise of voting rights, so institutional investors are ensured a sufficient amount of time to

 External Assessment of Corporate Governance
Promoting more “visible” governance
An analysis of an assessment performed by a third-party organization into the validity and effectiveness of Capcom’s corporate governance shows that the company ranked 45th among 3,701 listed companies in Japan in the “NEEDS-Cges” assessment developed by Nikkei Inc.
NEEDS-Cges has an established reputation as a system that quantitatively assesses corporate governance using scores on a scale of 1 to 10 for eight categories, including capital efficiency, external regulations, and information disclosure, among others, based on some 150 indicators calculated from data of publicly released company documents, such as financial reports.
As of the end of June 2021, Capcom’s total score was 7.60 points, placing us in the top 1.46% of Japan’s listed companies (excluding some in the financial and other sectors), exceeding the 4.75-point average for all listed companies and the 6.66-point average for the industry. We also received the maximum score of 10 for “equity market’s assessment.”
The main evaluation factors are given in the table below, and areas highlighted in yellow indicate measures that received particular notice. Going forward, we will continue making improvements to earn an even stronger assessment, and further promote the visibility of our governance by posting this and other data on our IR web page.

 Policies Regarding IR Activities
1. Disclosure policies
Capcom is aware that comprehensive corporate governance ranks among management’s most important priorities. As such, in addition to increasing corporate value by enhancing management soundness and transparency, we are building a relationship of trust with our stakeholders, such as shareholders, business partners, employees and regional societies.
2. Disclosure criteria
Capcom provides timely disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Law and other regulations including the “Rules on Timely Disclosure of Corporate Information by Issuer of Listed Security” (hereinafter Timely Disclosure Rules) stipulated by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
It is our policy to disclose as much information as possible, including the disclosure of information not required by the
Third-Party Assessment of IR Activities
High praise for proactive IR initiatives
Timely Disclosure Rules and other regulations, to accommodate our investors’ needs. We also disclose information through our corporate website in an attempt to provide quick and fair disclosure. Shareholders are informed of operating results and business conditions through shareholder letters and the convocation notice for the shareholders’ meetings.
3. Quiet period
To prevent the unauthorized disclosure of quarterly earnings information prior to official announcements, Capcom has established a quiet period starting the day following the end of a fiscal period and ending on the day that financial information for that period is announced. During this period, we refuse all inquiries relating to our business performance. However, if significant changes to our earnings outlook are anticipated during the quiet period, we will disclose information pursuant to the Timely Disclosure Rules and other regulations.
      In recognition of our ongoing pursuit of timely and appropriate information disclosure, our IR activities and various IR tools have received a number of awards from third-party organizations. With an awareness of the importance of accountability, we will continue our efforts to earn the trust of investors and improve timely disclosure.

       Making Use of Shareholder and Investor Opinions
Reflecting results of dialogues with investors and analysts in management
Through meetings with investors and analysts, Capcom’s IR Department attempts to promote an understanding of management policies, strategies and future outlook. Furthermore, their opinions are gathered and provided to management, and are utilized for corporate management going forward. While we are headquartered in Osaka, these proactive IR meetings enable us to minimize asymmetric information as we strive to achieve appropriate corporate value.
In fiscal 2020, the top management meetings between the chairman and CEO, the president and COO, and investors where medium- to long-term strategies and the direction of marketing strategies were explained had to be cancelled due to COVID-19 along with overseas IR visits. However, we held the presentation of financial results online and offered video conferences in an effort to communicate with our many investors and analysts.
In addition, Capcom conducts a regular perception gap study targeting institutional investors and analysts in Japan and overseas. Being aware of investor perception gaps gives us feedback on corporate management and IR activities. Questionnaires are also given to attendees at our Presentation of Financial Results and individual investor briefing sessions, allowing us to make proactive use of market opinions and demands as one criterion in management decisions.

Information Security Initiatives
As our main business is planning and developing software and we operate in an environment in which the latest information technology is always used, we believe that our information security risks are greater than companies in general. For that reason, we have implemented perimeter*1 security measures for some time; further, we had begun working on introducing defensive measures like SOC*2 services and EDR*3, however in 2020 a third party was able to gain unauthorized access to our systems. Because of this incident, we have implemented various security reinforcement measures to prevent recurrence in addition to our perimeter security measures. These include the establishment of the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee, which includes several external experts, and the introduction of SOC services for around-the-clock monitoring of external connections and EDR for early detection of unusual activity taking place on devices.
Main Measures (Table 1)
Technical Measures
1. Leading software company carried out cleaning of all compromised devices
2. Reverified the safety of all VPN devices and that security measures are in place
3. Introduced SOC (Security Operation Center) service in order to monitor external connections around the clock
4. Introduced the latest EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to provide early detection of unusual activity and computer virus infection on devices
5. Business accounts have been reviewed
6. Further improvements to administrative methods have been made such as long-term retention of logs for swiftly addressing incidents involving VPN devices and other equipment
Organizational Measures
1. Launched the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee in late January 2021 in order to receive recommendations on a continuous basis from external experts based on the latest trends, with an aim to procure external checks and the swift accumulation of knowhow regarding strengthening cyber security (including data protection for securing personal information, etc.). Externally, there are four Committee members who consist of two university professors who are cyber security experts, one lawyer who is an expert on both cyber security and the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and one certified public accountant that is an IT system audit specialist; internally, one director as well as three technicians who oversee security and networks participate. The Committee plans to continue to regularly hold meetings to strengthen protection standards.
2. Established the Information Technology Surveillance Section in December 2020, a new section directly under the Information Technology Security Oversight Committee, which gathers information regarding cyber security and builds knowledge of preventative measures to make recommendations.
3. Strengthened the system for regular verification, including for the adoption of tools, in the management of business accounts.
4. Constructed a system to further raise awareness of security and the management of personal information at the Group overall.
*1 Security measures that include placing a firewall at the perimeter between external networks and internal networks.
*2 Acronym for Security Operation Center. A SOC service is a system that monitors systems and networks around-the-clock, and supports the detection, analysis and handling of attacks.
*3 Acronym for Endpoint Detection and Response. A system that introduces software to detect unusual activity on devices such as the PCs and servers utilized by end-users and supports quick responses to issues.

The main reasons for this are to ensure fairness for a wide range of stakeholders, and because it ensures information is easily available for inspection immediately in approximately 200 countries and regions worldwide. Capcom’s corporate website is also positioned as our most cost-effective tool and we strive to use it in various ways, including video content for communicating information and social networking sites for timely information updates.

Corporate Governance
Message from an External Director
  Pursuing governance that takes sustainable growth into account, including ensuring effectiveness of the Board of Directors and the diversity of key human resources.
Yoshihiko Iwasaki
External Director (Independent Director)
<Full-time member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee>
How do you evaluate the Company’s
Q management structure as a member of the
What do you see as necessary for further Q enhancing the function of the Board of
Directors in the future?
A I think stakeholders from all quarters would agree that the growth of the Company has been driven by the strong leadership of the founder.
At the same time, this demonstrates that the Board of Directors has sufficiently carried out its responsibilities.
On the other hand, the Corporate Governance Code was revised this past June seeking that companies provide more aggressive governance while taking sustainable growth into account. This requires further action from the Board of Directors and securing diversity for its key human resources. The Company has carried out efforts in line with the thinking of the Corporate Governance Code, including establishment of a Nomination and Remuneration Committee. However,
I believe further improvement is necessary when it comes to the issue of diversity among core members of the management team.
Sustainable growth is of great concern to all stakeholders, including investors and employees.
I hope to personally contribute as much as possible to strengthening the role of the Board of Directors to steadily achieve this as we move into the future.
A
Audit and Supervisory Committee?
I was appointed external director in 2012. The first thing I noticed was the corporate culture of diligently addressing issues while stressing the
basics. One of the characteristics of the game industry is that changes—both in technology and user preferences —are sudden. Under such circumstances, the Company has maintained a focus on providing users with entertainment of first-rate quality while promoting global and digital strategies to achieve steady growth.
I believe that the prescient, timely, and accurate judgment of management and this well-developed corporate culture have both contributed significantly.
How do you evaluate the Company’s audit Q structure?
A
The Company made the transition into a company with an audit and supervisory committee in 2016. At the same time, in
addition to the staff that had previously supported the corporate auditors, the Internal Audit Division was brought under the direct control of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. This facilitated collaboration, making it possible to implement efficient and effective organizational audits, including timely and accurate understanding of the internal situation from each perspective and internal dissemination of the necessary information. The Audit and Supervisory Committee itself has a balanced composition. The three members have different specialties and come from inside and outside the Company.

  Capcom will quickly ascertain management risks and make ongoing improvements to a governance structure that features a balance of offensive and defensive approaches.
Makoto Matsuo
External Director (Independent Director)

Since becoming an external director in 2007, it has not been easy to judge the ever-progressing game industry or the measures that the Company

enhance the functions of the Board of Directors?
Since Capcom transitioned to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee in 2016, the Audit and Supervisory Committee has been
should take under those circumstances. I think it is very rare to have an industry that requires—to this extent —such a quick and flexible response to change in order not to be left behind.
Owing to the strong leadership and unifying work of the founder, the Company has been able to anticipate long-term developments and make quick and bold decisions. At the same time, the support that has been provided by external directors with different specialist knowledge in relation to risk management has enabled the Company to establish a unique management structure and corporate governance system corresponding to its circumstances. Together with the Audit and Supervisory Committee, the Audit Committee, which conducts operational audits that are closer to the work site, forms a hands-on system unique to the Company.
I believe my role is to leverage my knowledge as an attorney and as an external officer of other companies to identify management risks and issues related to company measures based on my practical experience in the industry and management of the Company during my tenure, while listening to the thoughts of management, and providing my opinions and suggestions. In addition, by keeping watch to ensure that future leadership succession, which seems to be making steady progress, leads to the development of a corporate system more consistent with the next generation, I will offer support to facilitate discussion on both ensuring sustainable growth of the main businesses while accelerating growth by expanding the Company’s intellectual capital into adjacent markets such as visual media and AI in the future.
providing support for the risk management function of the Board of Directors and building a structure for systematic audits in collaboration with the Internal Audit Division and other internal organizations.
Capcom continues to innovate as a true leader in the global content industry, which is undergoing rapid and advanced digitalization. As such, it must adequately communicate its activities to shareholders and other stakeholders. It also must continue to make ongoing improvements to a governance structure that features a balance of offensive and defensive approaches to properly address the risks that arise in its continued pursuit of new challenges. As Chairman of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, I will work to ensure that the committee can fulfill its expected role, contributing to enhancement of corporate governance from the standpoint of cross-organizational compliance and appropriateness. This will be accomplished by providing timely and appropriate suggestions and advice to the Board of Directors to quickly ascertain and address the management risks faced by the Company based on a recognition of these circumstances.
What kind of a role will you play as an external Q director in light of the circumstances
surrounding the Company?

 An Analysis of the Market and Capcom
 Game Industry Characteristics
Consumer Market Characteristics (Package + Digital)
Package and digital download contents are a 42.9 billion dollar market, forecast to grow 1.6 times that size over the next five years to 70.6 billion dollars by 2025. The customer base is primarily composed of core users who are loyal to game titles. They have relatively high willingness to purchase sequels and remakes along with low sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Hereafter, we expect the market to grow at a faster pace as we capture the casual user segment, which has high sensitivity to price conditions, as well as new users. This will come about in conjunction with a higher digital sales ratio, resulting from growth in Asia and emerging countries and expansion of online gaming on consoles, primarily in North America, shrinking the gap between the margin in this market and those in the other two markets. For details see p.19
Mobile Market Characteristics
This is a 121.1 billion dollar market, forecast to continue growing to 169.7 billion dollars by 2025. The customer base is primarily composed of casual users, many of whom play games in their spare time, thus they demonstrate the lowest loyalty toward game titles. In contrast to core users, they have a limited willingness to purchase games and have the highest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Although this is the most profitable among the three markets, only a limited number of titles are able to generate stable earnings over the long term even if they become hits. This makes brand establishment a challenge. Going forward, as 5G becomes more widespread and further next generation mobile communication standards are developed, we expect smartphones will continue to drive rapid growth as the most pervasive game device.
PC Online Market Characteristics
This is a 42.2 billion dollar market, forecast to grow about 10% over the next five years to 46.7 billion dollars by 2025. The customer base is primarily composed of core users who demonstrate the highest loyalty toward game titles. They have a fairly strong willingness to engage in ongoing purchases, and are unique for having the lowest sensitivity to price and economic conditions. Integration with the consumer market will likely progress as the online capabilities of consoles are enhanced, so growth of this market is expected to become sluggish in the future.

Mobile
      Capcom’s core business is to create a multitude of original content on home video game consoles. The regular release of sequels to popular IPs and focus on digital sales have, in recent years, led to an increased digital sales ratio and operating margins in the 50% level.
Mobile Contents (Proportion of Net Sales: 7%)
This business distributes games featuring popular Capcom content on smartphones, but insufficient know-how in ongoing game operations has resulted in sales trends underperforming market growth. We are working on research and development in anticipation of future technological innovations, such as next generation mobile communication standards.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
Consumer (Package + Digital) sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2021), new titles performed well, including Resident Evil 3, which was launched in April, selling 3.9 million units and Monster Hunter Rise, which was launched in March 2021, selling 4.8 million units. Together with focusing business development on high-margin digital sales, this drove improvements in business results.
Additionally, catalog title Monster Hunter: World continued to sell well, bringing the cumulative total for the title to 17.1 million units shipped. This performance, along with healthy sales of other catalog titles, gave a boost to revenue. Titles such as Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, Resident Evil 2, and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard also demonstrated staying power and gave a boost to revenue. We further made efforts to expand our lineup of titles, including Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition, a title for the new generation of game consoles (PlayStation 5

and Xbox Series X|S), and Ghosts’n Goblins Resurrection, the long-awaited latest entry in the Ghosts’n Goblins series.
As a result, package sales were 20.8 billion yen, and digital sales were 48.0 billion yen. Together, they resulted in Consumer sales of 68.8 billion yen (up 24.0% from the previous year) for a continued increase. The operating margin has also improved to just under 50%.
Moreover, the growth in our library of titles due to a steady new release pipeline in recent years along with successful holiday season discount measures pushed up digital sales to 23.15 million units (up 12.7% from the previous year). As a result, this year’s package and full-game download sales totaled 30.10 million units (up 18.0% from the previous year), making this the sixth consecutive year of growth.
For Capcom, we consider Consumer business growth as one of the keys to achieving our medium-term business goals. Our initiatives are to (1) strengthen digital sales, (2) bolster our title lineup through the continued execution of our 60-month and 52-week maps, and (3) utilize both new and dormant intellectual properties.
Under (1), the prevalence of digital selling has made it possible to implement measures such as limited-time sales, increasing flexibility in pricing and expanding the impact of marketing. We utilize our existing intellectual properties (IP) in addition to major titles and additional content, and remake or rerelease past titles on current-generation hardware, in order to create sales opportunities and increase the digital sales ratio. In terms of (2), since March 2015 we have been carrying out operations according to both our medium-term title portfolio map, called the “60-month map,” and our yearly developer assignment plan, called the “52-week map.” We will work toward establishing an efficient development structure, enabling us to release major titles on a regular basis. Finally, for (3) we seek to revive dormant intellectual properties for which we have not recently released new titles by increasing the

number of our developers.
Next fiscal year, we expect a continued contribution from
catalog title Monster Hunter Rise on top of new titles Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. We will also work to further expand sales globally based on our digital strategy for other major titles, including Resident Evil 3 and Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. As a result of these efforts, we expect to increase unit sales to 32.0 million units (up 6.3% from the year under review), net sales to 73.3 billion yen (up 6.5% from the year under review), and for the digital sales ratio to remain in the 70% range.
Mobile Contents Sub-segment
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2021), we launched ROCKMAN X DiVE in Japan, and licensing income associated with the launch of collaborative title Street Fighter: Duel in China contributed as well to bring net sales up to 6.5 billion yen (up 47.7% from the previous year).
In the future, we will continue to explore a wide range of possibilities, including cultivating existing titles, developing new titles using our intellectual properties, and forming alliances with companies in Japan and elsewhere. We will work on development in the mobile field and accumulating operational know-how. We will also work on research and development in anticipation of future technological innovation, including the new generation of mobile communication standards.
In the next fiscal year, we expect net sales to decrease to 4.5 billion yen (down 30.8% from the year under review) due to the lack of licensing income recorded in the year under review and aging existing titles. However, we expect a slight improvement to the profit margin, owing to such factors as lower costs.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2021), operations were suspended at all stores (excluding Capcom Net Catcher Cap Tore, the online crane game) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after operations were resumed, minimizing the risk of infection was our top priority.
As for the number of stores, we opened our second showroom, Capcom Store Osaka, bringing the total number of stores to 41. We also focused on steady openings and operations, including major renovations at Plaza Capcom Kochi.
In October and November, we benefitted from customer foot traffic, primarily at stores in shopping malls with movie theaters in conjunction with hit movies based on manga, and recorded healthy net sales at existing stores that exceeded those of the previous year.
For the full year, we worked aggressively on reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Although net sales at existing stores were down 22% compared to the previous year, bringing segment net sales down to 9.871 billion yen (down 18.4% from the
previous year) and operating income to 149 million yen (down 87.7% from the previous year), we were able to turn a profit.
In the next fiscal year, we will work to recover from the impact we experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic this year and continue to make efforts toward efficient operations while continuing measures to prevent infection. We forecast an increase in both sales and profit with net sales at existing stores up 23% from the previous year, bringing net sales to 13.0 billion yen (up 31.7% from the year under review) and operating income to 700 million yen (up 369.8% from the year under review).
As for the number of stores, we will continue to promote store openings in prime locations with strong customer appeal based on our basic strategy of scrap-and-build. We plan to open three stores and close one, bringing the total number to 43.

  Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2021), three machines designed to current regulations, including Monster Hunter: World were launched by the Pachinko & Pachislo (PS) sub-segment, selling 27,000 units.
Shifts in the market environment resulting from such things as changes to methods of pachislo machine model certification and suspension of hall operations due to COVID-19 continued to have an impact. In the midst of these circumstances, Monster Hunter: World performed well, and other new models gave a boost to profits. As a result, both sales and profit were up with net sales coming in at 7.09 billion yen (up 8.5% from the previous year) and operating income at 2.407 billion yen (up 15.4% from the previous year).
In the next fiscal year, we expect some demand for cabinets in conjunction with replacement of machines designed to old standards, which was delayed due to COVID-19. However, increased investment costs at halls and operational suspensions due to COVID-19 mean that we must continue monitoring market
trends. Under these circumstances, we will work to release models that impress hall operators and end-users, continuing to (1) develop machines not dependent on speculation and that feature a variety of playing styles and entertaining video elements that utilize content from our popular Consumer content, while (2) working on securing a strong sales network and improving machine quality through cooperating with a major specialist company.
In the next fiscal year, we plan to introduce four models while continuing to monitor progress on model certification tests and sell 28,000 units (1,000 units more than the year under review).
Both sales and income will be down, with net sales at 5.5 billion yen (down 22.4% from the year under review) and operating income at 2.0 billion yen (down 16.9% from the year under review), but we expect profitability to improve owing to effective utilization of cabinet parts and the adoption of diverse business models.

 Operating Results for This Fiscal Year and Outlook for the Next Fiscal Year
This fiscal year (ended March 31, 2021), we worked to improve brand value with merchandise using popular IPs, such as apparel and figurines, and the release of Hollywood film Monster Hunter, rolled out globally starting in December 2020.
In eSports we held online tournaments, seeing the ability for online spectating and play as a strength during the COVID-19 pandemic. Capcom Pro Tour Online 2020 was held completely online for the first time and streamed live in multiple languages with players and commentators participating from home. Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2020 also made progress this year, gaining more than ten new companies as league sponsors.
As a result, both sales and profit rose with growth of the licensing business pushing net sales to 3.045 billion yen (up 0.9% from the previous year) and operating income to 987 million yen (up 81.2% from the previous year).
In the next fiscal year, we will leverage the substantial synergies with the Consumer Games businesses by diversifying the use of our rich library of IPs and rolling them out across various
mediums, including movies, animated television programs, theatrical productions, and events. In eSports, we plan to roughly double the scale of Capcom Pro Tour compared to the year under review. In addition, with NTT Docomo cosponsoring Street Fighter League: Pro-JP, we will receive advanced technical support, including 5G, as we aim to build a new viewing environment.
We will also continue to leverage our IPs based on our Single Content Multiple Usage strategy, with the first CG drama in the Resident Evil series launching globally in July 2021 exclusively on Netflix and the new Hollywood live action movie Resident Evil opening in North America in November, as we work to increase the value of our core brands through adaptations and collaborations.
We expect net sales to increase to 3.7 billion yen (up 21.5% from the previous year) and operating income to be 1.0 billion yen (up 1.3% from the previous year), for an increase in both sales and profit.

Custom Pumps Business
Reinforcement of Custom Pump S&S Network
The EBARA Group has a robust track record of delivering custom pumps to oil and gas, water infrastructure, elec- tricity, and other markets around the world. An important initiative in E-Plan 2019 and for our material ESG issues is to reinforce our S&S systems to ensure that delivered products can operate reliably with little to no downtime, and we are taking action to accomplish this objective. One example would be the service shop in Saudi Arabia we established in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017. We are also moving forward with efforts to develop service systems that are more closely connected to cus- tomers at existing overseas service bases. At these bases sales staff and engineers perform proposal-based sales activities while local field service engineers supply parts and conduct overhaul services. Going forward, we will continue to respond to customer needs for parts supply, repairs, and maintenance as we seek to enhance S&S offerings throughout all areas of product lifecycles.

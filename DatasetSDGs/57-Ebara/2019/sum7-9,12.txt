Release of New Air-Cooled Dry Vacuum
Pump Model
There is a rising need for clean vacuum environments and for dry vacuum pumps that require less maintenance in the analytical instrument, medical equipment, food, and coating industries. We have developed and released our new Model EV-PA air-cooled dry vacuum pump to meet these growing market demands through the utilization of the unique dry vacuum pump technologies we have culti- vated over our history of responding to the sophisticated specification demands of the semiconductor industry.
This product boasts user-friendly characteristics such
as a non-contact seal that eliminates the need for seal replacement and extends maintenance intervals and an exceptionally light weight of 9 kg to 21 kg, allowing for easy movement. We will increasingly focus on the development of products and services that contribute to increasing productivity for customers while simultaneously
reducing costs.

Launch of New Model RHD Absorption
Chiller Heater
We launched the model RHD absorption chiller heater, a new eco-friendly product in the Japanese market in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. This new product was designed with thorough consideration paid to energy efficiency and to customer needs. Features include quick start-up, an energy conservation mode, a wide range of operation variations, reduced use of refrigerants (fluoro- carbons), and other superior capabilities to contribute to lower energy use and environmental impact. In particular, this modelâ€™s quick start-up unlocks new possibilities for the applications of absorption chiller heaters. This makes it an ideal solution for environmentally conscious custom- ers while also having the potential to make large contribu- tions to addressing material ESG issues (specifically, Action Policy 1: provide products and services that mini- mize the use of energy and resources).

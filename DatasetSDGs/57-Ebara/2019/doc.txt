   EBARA Way
Creation of New Value by Acting
Based on the “EBARA Way”
The EBARA Group’s beginnings were in answer to the calls of society, and we have continued to provide value to society through our business in addition to fulfilling our social responsibilities.
In conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the Company’s founding in 2012, we reflected on the type of company we are and want to be and reorganized those fundamental values and ethics into the EBARA Group Business Ethics Framework, to support our ethical operation over the next 100 years. As part of this undertaking, we redefined the Group’s founding spirit, corporate philosophy, and CSR Policy as the “EBARA Way,” the transcendental value shared across the EBARA Group.
By acting based on the “EBARA Way,” we will create new social, environmental, and economic value.
01 EBARA Group Integrated Report 2019

EBARA’s History of Ambition
EBARA’s Founding Spirit of “Netsu to Makoto” (Passion and Dedication) is a philosophy
of engaging with work with passion and completing tasks with dedication. This Founding Spirit has continued to propel the Group forward throughout its history, driving it to fulfill
its mission of contributing to society in the areas of water, air, and the environment since its founding in 1912. The Group’s businesses support social and industrial infrastructure and through this, we have continued to grow while addressing the social issues of the given era.

Development of the EBARA Group’s Foundations
EBARA was founded by Issey Hatakeyama with the goal of supplying products based on Dr. Ariya Inokuty’s world-renowned volute pump research. In the years that followed, EBARA continued to contribute to the modernization of Japan by pro- ducing the first domestically manufactured water- works pumps, installing water infrastructure to prepare for natural disasters, developing the first water purifiers for waterworks manufactured in Japan, and undertaking other initiatives ahead of its time.
Pressing Social Issues
Modernization of Japan
• Installation of water infrastructure
• Lack of arable land
• Reconstruction after Great Kanto Earthquake • Widespread industrialization
1945~
EBARA Technologies Responding to Social Demand
EBARA contributed to the stabilization of the lives of people in Japan after World War II by mass- producing pumps for increasing food production and for farmland reclamation. In addition, we delivered the first domestically produced feed water pump for supercritical pressure power plants to help address power shortages. At the same time, the Group began exporting plant equipment and establishing overseas bases to lay the groundwork for its overseas expansion.
Pressing Social Issues
Post-World War II Reconstruction and Japanese Postwar Economic Miracle
• Lack of food and other basic necessities for people
of Japan
• Power shortages
• Advancement of heavy and chemical industries • Increased construction of plants overseas
1980~
EBARA Technologies Permeating Society
It was during this time that the Group succeeded in developing and realizing practical application of a gasification and ash melting furnace for use as a next-generation waste treatment facility capable of completely decomposing dioxins and recycling residue. In addition, technologies accumulated thus far were applied to the development of dry vacuum pumps, resulting in the start of the Preci- sion Machinery Business.
Pressing Social Issues
Development of the Information Society
• Lack of waste disposal sites
• Need to realize recycling-oriented society
• Growth of semiconductor market and increased
semiconductor demand
• Ozone depletion, desertification, and advancement of climate change

This target will be pursued by achieving a debt/ equity ratio of 0.40 times–0.60 times and return on equity (ROE) of 11.0%–13.0%. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, ROIC was 4.9% while ROE was 6.6%. Improvements to prof- itability are behind schedule centered on the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, and we are projecting that we will be unable to meet the target for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

P O I N T E-Plan 2019 sets an operating income to sales ratio target of 9.0% or more. Operating income levels have been down in recent years due to the persistence of sluggish conditions in the oil and gas market. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, a recovery trend emerged in the oil and gas market. Together with the benefits of profitability improvement measures in all of our businesses, this recovery trend has been driving grad- ual improvement in profitability.

Investments in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, and forward have included those for the automation of standard pump and dry vacuum pump assembly lines as well as for the construction of test development facilities for components to be supplied to the semiconductor market.
P O I N T EBARA has been issuing consistent dividends over the past several years due to improvements in its financial position. During the period of E-Plan 2019, we will target a total return ratio of 30% or more. The targeted indicator for shareholder returns was changed from dividend payout ratio to total return ratio with the goal of allowing for flexible capital policies while maintaining consistent dividends over the long term.
  P O I N T The accumulation of retained earnings drove increases in shareholders’ equity and the equity ratio.
P O I N T Interest-bearing debt is on the decline following improvements in financial health. On December 31, 2018, the debt/equity ratio was 0.28 times, lower than the level of 0.40 times–0.60 times targeted over the period of E-Plan 2019.

Contributions to the Environment through Business Activities
P O I N T Ongoing reductions of CO2 emissions are one of the EBARA Group’s FY2020 Environmental Targets. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, emissions were down 4.0% from the reference figure for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017. The Company will continue efforts to minimize environmental impact as it grows its business in the future.
  Energy-Efficient Standard Pumps Waste-to-Energy Generation in the Environmental Plants Business Environmental Benefits: Environmental Benefits:
6,789,600 kWh reduction in electricity use

  P O I N T KPIs regarding the electricity usage of several standard pump models have been set for Action Policy 1 for addressing EBARA’s material ESG issues. Based on a preliminary calculation by the Company, the pumps that have been delivered to end-users have made reductions in electricity use during operation of 6,789,600 kWh when compared to prior models, which equates to an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of around 3,400 tons.
We will continue to develop the most efficient pumps we can in order to lower the overall CO2 emissions of factories or buildings in which those pumps are used.

 Message from the President
“Technology. Passion. Support our Globe”—Our Commitment to Enriching People’s Lives
Masao Asami
President and Representative Executive Officer
Vision for EBARA’s Corporate Culture
Greetings. My name is Masao Asami, and I took up the mantle of President and Representative Executive Offi- cer of EBARA CORPORATION in March 2019. After joining the Company in 1986, I spent the majority of my career in the Precision Machinery Business, which mainly caters to the semiconductor industry. The pace of change in this industry is blinding, and the competi- tiveness of a company can be greatly diminished if it falls a minute, or even a second, behind. Over the years, I have continued to serve customers that oper- ate in this high-pressure industry, where they are con- stantly pressed to make high-risk decisions. My daily work was to examine various ways of helping our customers survive amid this fierce competition and
to produce as many viable ideas as possible. Rising to this challenge spurred my own growth. Committing to a perpetual cycle of addressing customer needs, under any circumstances; searching for the necessary solutions with tenacity and passion; and overcoming the challenges that present themselves to satisfy cus- tomers are what, I believe, drives the growth of people and companies. The EBARA Group operates three businesses—the Fluid Machinery & Systems Busi- ness, the Environmental Plants Business, and the Precision Machinery Business—each of which faces different operating environments and organizational speeds. Amid what is being called the Fourth Indus- trial Revolution, weathering the turbulent climate of social change will require that every employee in each business remains receptive toward tackling arising social challenges while approaching their work with an earnest dedication.
The EBARA Group is home to those who are com- mitted to contributing to people, society, and the envi- ronment through its businesses. When all employees are able to exert their full effort to fulfill this commit- ment, they will find pride and motivation in their work. It is my mission to cultivate such a corporate culture, and I am sure that accomplishing this mission will drive the growth of the entire EBARA Group.
EBARA’s Purpose and Vision
The EBARA Group has continued to develop its busi- ness based on “Netsu to Makoto” (Passion and Dedica- tion), the Founding Spirit that we have valued since our inception. Throughout our history of over 100 years, we have proceeded to hone our exceptional technological capabilities in order to deliver products and services that support society, industry, and everyday life. This is the purpose of EBARA’s existence, and this will not change going forward. The heart of our technological capabilities is the Inokuty-type volute pump* principle. This principle is a point of origin for our various fluid and rotation technologies as well as for the related control technologies. Our unique research and devel- opment activities aimed at elevating our core technol- ogies to higher levels of performance have always been, and will always be, the driving force behind EBARA’s growth. The Company’s ongoing existence is predicated on its ability to continue applying, evolving, and combining its core technologies to create new products and solutions in response to the needs of society and of local customers in any given era.
In consideration of this, I believe we can summarize the EBARA Group’s mission into the words “Technol- ogy. Passion. Support our Globe.” Our present goal in the current medium-term management plan, E-Plan 2019, is to develop our businesses on a global basis and grow continuously as a manufacturer of industrial machinery. The operating environment at the moment is plagued by political risks such as the trade war between the United States and China, not to mention the massive transformations taking place in the man- ufacturing industry globally, making it difficult to for- mulate an outlook for the future. Nevertheless, I am confident that there will be many opportunities for EBARA as technological progress changes society and industries. We often speak of “ICAC5 technolo- gies,” a term which we use to refer to Internet of Things (IoT), technologies that will connect all things; cloud technologies that will support IoT; arti- ficial intelligence; car (automated driving) technolo- gies; and 5G communications technologies boasting
* The Inokuty-type volute pump is a centrifugal pump based on the theory of Dr. Ariya Inokuty, who was an inspiration to founder Issey Hatakeyama.

Message from the President
transmission speeds 100 times faster than those of current technologies. We recognize that these tech- nologies have great potential to enrich people’s lives while simultaneously contributing to the preservation of the environment. The development of ICAC5 tech- nologies is dependent on the further development of semiconductors, a core EBARA market. Figuring out how to facilitate the creation of this smarter and more comfortable society, supported by ICAC5 technologies, while also realizing the sustainable society so desired by the entire world and growing our businesses, will require that we look even more closely at the true needs of the world and at what we can do to provide even more appealing products and services. I want to lead EBARA so that it will always be a company that approaches this and every challenge with passion and dedication and a strong sense of purpose to support the world with its technologies.
EBARA’s Value Creation and KPIs
The EBARA Group aspires to raise its overall corporate value by increasing the social value, environmental value, and economic value it creates through its busi- ness activities. Accordingly, return on invested capital (ROIC) and the operating income to sales ratio have been identified as financial key performance indicators (KPIs) in E-Plan 2019. The nature of our business means that a large portion of our customer base is the infrastructure sector. It is therefore important that we manufacture and supply our products through cost- competitive, eco-friendly processes while ensuring that these products deliver both energy efficiency and high-quality performance when used by customers. It is also our responsibility to prevent halts to operations from equipment failures and to offer service and sup- port (S&S), including parts exchanges and inspections, to guarantee that our products can continue operating reliably over long periods of time. Meanwhile, there is heightened interest in environmental, social, and gov- ernance (ESG) issues as well as in the set of shared global targets that is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Given this interest, we must share information with our wide range of stake- holders regarding the EBARA Group’s initiatives for increasing its value and the progress of these
EBARA must be a company that evolves together with society to continue contributing thereto. I will take

initiatives. We approached this in 2017 by first identify- ing the material ESG issues of the Group and setting KPIs for gauging our progress in addressing these issues. We then considered how relevant these initia- tives were to each of the 169 targets of the SDGs. A year and a half has passed since the material ESG issues were identified, and we are seeing progress on this front. Nevertheless, it is crucial that we develop a clear understanding of the challenges we face in accomplishing the targets we set for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and respond accordingly. We must also constantly reevaluate our KPIs to deter- mine if they are truly the most ideal for our goals and thereby implement a PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle for setting KPIs that are best suited to maximizing cor- porate value and to boosting employee motivation.
Review of the Current Medium-Term Management Plan, E-Plan 2019
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the second year of E-Plan 2019, smooth progress was made in measures for all businesses. As a result, orders in all three businesses exceeded those in the first year of the plan. Net sales were also higher in the second year of E-Plan 2019, as growth in sales in the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business and the Precision Machinery Business was able to compen- sate for the decline in sales in the Environmental Plants Business.
However, we were unable to improve profitability due to delayed recovery in the operating environments of these businesses as well as certain one-time inter- nal detractors. As a result, consolidated ROIC was 4.9% while the operating income to sales ratio was 6.4%. The most significant factor behind our failure to improve profitability was that the projected recovery in plant investments in the oil and gas markets, which primarily impacted the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, was delayed and we were unable to furnish an appropriate response to this situation. We are committed to identifying the causes of this failure by reevaluating our market forecasts and measures, so that we can revise our approach and make up for this delayed recovery in profitability to the greatest extent possible in the final year of E-Plan 2019.
  17 EBARA Group Integrated Report 2019

 The first commitment I made after becoming President and Representative Executive Officer was to thoroughly examine the issues all of our busi- nesses are facing to pinpoint the causes of our decline in profitability and to formulate effective measures for addressing these causes. I will take a hands-on approach toward this process, joining in the search and playing a central role in enacting change. Up until now, a great deal of authority for managing the progress of business measures was delegated to the respective in-house company pres- idents. Each business acted in accordance with its own markets and as a result, each business has developed different conceptions of reasonable time- frames or what constitutes a sense of urgency. I view bridging that gap between the businesses and creating a united sense of urgency as a challenge that lies ahead. This has led me to start holding meetings of all Executive Officers once a week, in addition to follow-up one-on-one meetings when necessary. I believe that by doing this, I will be able to make better-informed management decisions based on an overarching perspective gained from the opinions of in-house company presidents and Executive Officers. It will also enable me to maintain an up-to-date understanding of the conditions of each business to raise the speed of my responses and thus allow for prompt measures to be put in place at the earliest sign of an issue.
Pursuit of Future Growth
We are currently in the process of formulating E-Vision 2030, which will lay out our vision for EBARA in 2030. We will be using a backcasting approach from E-Vision 2030 to prepare the next medium-term management plan in order to facilitate management that maximizes economic, social, and environmental value created by the EBARA Group as well as the Group’s profits.
Over the next 10 or 20 years, it is anticipated that society, infrastructure, and people’s lives will become more sophisticated, as symbolized by the ICAC5 tech- nologies. The EBARA Group will respond to this trend by leveraging AI and IoT to make its products more sophisticated and to accelerate the automation of its production processes. For example, I see the potential
to embed sensors into pumps in order to remotely monitor and control operating status or to develop systems that create operating conditions based on customer specifications or to help customers achieve their energy conservation targets or other such plans. Evolving our products and services to the point that we may even be able to exceed our customers’ expecta- tions regarding the levels of optimization in their oper- ations would in turn enable us to improve our profitability. Under the next medium-term manage- ment plan, I look to focus on expanding our S&S oper- ations from the customer’s perspective and to prepare us to make proposals that go as far as to effect change in customers’ business infrastructure.
I believe that each of our employees possesses a desire to contribute to society through their work. To help them give form to this desire, I will work to find new business opportunities by fully leveraging EBARA’s technological capabilities. My search will not be limited to extensions of current operations, but will rather seek new opportunities based on the society of the future. EBARA must be a company that evolves together with society to continue contributing thereto. To accomplish this goal, I will take the initiative in thinking and working together with employees to transform the EBARA Group.

 Summary of Progress in Second Year of E-Plan 2019
ROIC improvement was stifled by slumping operating income to sales ratios in all businesses.
External: Slow energy market recovery, sluggish Chinese market, curtailing of capital investment among customers in semiconductor market
Internal: Additional costs in Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, loss associ- ated with partial withdrawal from business of a Chinese manufactur- ing subsidiary in Environmental Plants Business
   Positive Occurrences
Negative Occurrences
    Contributions to profit realized along with more or less smooth initiative progress in all businesses
   Measures Approaching Final Year of E-Plan 2019
The accomplishment of targets will be delayed, but initiatives for improving ROIC will continue to be implemented to drive growth in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, and beyond.

Financial Strategies as Explained by the Executive in Charge of Finance
  Akihiko Nagamine
Executive Officer
Division Executive, Finance & Accounting Division
Q. Why has ROIC* been designated as the most important KPI? A. The EBARA Group operates with capital borrowed from finan- cial institutions and procured from corporate bond and equity markets. These funds are comprised of the precious savings people have invested in stocks, pensions, securities, insurance, or investment trusts to enrich their lives or save for retirement. Accordingly, one of the important obligations of a publicly listed company is to generate the interest expected by bondholders and profits in line with the returns anticipated by shareholders. Publicly listed companies operate their businesses using soci- ety’s assets, and they are thus charged with a heavy responsibil- ity. In order to fulfill this obligation, we have chosen to set ROIC as our most important KPI and target a level for this indicator that exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
Q. What are EBARA’s ROIC targets and the cash allocation policies for the period of E-Plan 2019?
A. Under the current medium-term management plan, E-Plan 2019, we are targeting ROIC of 8.0% or more in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the final year of the plan. This target is meant to achieve a level of ROIC that exceeds the Company’s WACC, which is estimated to be between 6% and 7%. We will look to generate ROIC of 8.0% or more by accomplishing return on equity (ROE) of between 11% and 13%, a debt/equity ratio of 0.4 times to 0.6 times, and an operating income to sales ratio of at least 9.0%.
To this end, our cash allocation policies for the three-year period of E-Plan 2019 will see us prioritizing growth investments for improving profitability, and we have earmarked ¥60.0 billion for capital investments, ¥35.0 billion for research and develop- ment (R&D), and ¥10.0 billion for M&A accordingly. These amounts are a reflection of our intent to conduct capital invest- ments and M&A totaling more than one-third of profit attribut- able to owners of parent plus depreciation and amortizations and to invest 2% or more of annual net sales in R&D.
In addition, more than one-third of profit is to be returned to shareholders each year, and we are thus targeting a consoli- dated total return ratio of 30% or more.
The remaining one-third of profit will be retained to fund human resource investments in subsequent fiscal years. Such investments will include development programs, employee edu- cation, work systems and the creation of workplaces that sup- port diverse workstyles, and improvements in salary levels and welfare benefits. Through these investments, we aim to cultivate a workplace environment that is conducive to innovation.
Our business is such that there is a long period of time between the receipt of an order and the payment for said order. Also, as a supplier for products and services that support social and industrial infrastructure, we have an obligation to continue our business even under extreme circumstances, such as after large-scale natural disasters or during financial crises. In recog- nition of these factors, we have a policy of maintaining roughly two months of sales worth of cash and deposits, securing a little bit of leeway with regard to necessary working capital.
The remaining funds will be allocated to the repayment of interest-bearing debt. Should funds be insufficient, the neces- sary amount will be procured. In addition, we will keep a level of shareholders’ equity that will enable us to maintain a R&I Credit Rating of A in order to ensure that we can procure funds even under extreme circumstances.
Q. What is the progress with regard to these efforts?
A. We have made smooth progress so far based on these poli- cies, investing a total of ¥17.9 billion over the past two years in R&D, equivalent to 2% of net sales, and deciding to invest more than ¥60.0 billion over a three-year period in capital investments such as fully automated plants. However, capital investments are slightly behind schedule and M&A have not been progressing as

 Targeted Balance Sheet
 Cash and deposits: Reduce through global cash management systems and target on-hand liquidity equivalent to 2 months’ worth of sales
Notes and accounts receivable-trade: Lower through contract condition improvement, overdue debt reduction, and turnover management
Inventory assets: Lower through improved produc- tion efficiency, shorter production lead times, supply chain reinforcement, and turnover management
Other current assets: Reduce cross-shareholdings
Fixed assets: Increase through growth invest- ments (invest in cutting-edge production facilities, S&S bases, etc.)
Interest-bearing debt (debt/equity ratio): Effec- tively utilize debt to maintain within range of 0.4– 0.6 times
Shareholders’ equity: Target consolidated total return ratio of 30% or more through shareholder returns
Equity ratio: Prioritize shareholder returns while considering ratings to prepare for extreme circumstances

 planned. For this reason, net cash used in investment activities was only ¥23.8 billion over the past two years, and we thus accu- mulated a significant amount in cash and deposits.
This situation prompted us to repurchase ¥5.0 billion worth of shares and repay ¥25.0 billion of interest-bearing debt. As a result, cash and deposits on December 31, 2018, decreased ¥27.8 billion from the previous equivalent period, to ¥110.6 bil- lion, 2.6 months’ sales worth. In light of the high level of cash and deposits, we have chosen to move forward with the acquisi- tion of another ¥15.0 billion worth of share repurchases in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
We are projecting a three-year total of more than ¥36.0 billion in shareholder returns over the period of E-Plan 2019, making for a total return ratio of over 75%. Conversely, profitability is substantially less than targeted. The operating income to sales ratio was a mere 6.4% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in figures of 4.9% and 6.6%, respectively, for the efficiency indicators of ROIC and ROE. Improving profitability is a pressing issue.
Q. What financial approach will be adopted toward improving profitability?
A. In terms of finances, we need to place more emphasis on our balance sheet if we are to improve profitability. This is because the benefits of management initiatives for enhancing the income statement appear first on the balance sheet.
For example, the Company has annual sales of ¥500.0 billion and total assets of ¥600.0 billion. This means we are not even producing an amount of sales equivalent to the assets we use to generate those sales in a year. We need to use our assets more efficiently in order to achieve sales that are on par with the scale of assets. Total asset turnover (net sales / total assets) is one
of the factors contributing to ROIC, our most important KPI. I therefore aim to realize turnover of at least 1.0 in order to prevent this indicator from dragging down ROIC.
Meanwhile, the combined total of notes and accounts receiv- able-trade and inventories exceeds ¥300.0 billion, making up half of total assets. At the same time, our annual sales of ¥500.0 bil- lion translate to daily sales of about ¥1.5 billion, and as such the ¥300.0 billion in notes and accounts receivable-trade and
inventories equates to 200 days’ worth of sales. We can cut working capital by ¥30.0 billion if we reduce this amount by 20 days. The resulting funds can then be allocated to growth invest- ments. I believe that we must realize such reductions by boost- ing the competitiveness of our business through improvements to contract conditions, product quality, and productivity as well as through shorter lead times and the reinforcement of our supply chain.
Going forward, we will invest in the development of cutting- edge, fully automated plants as well as in the construction of global S&S and sales networks that will enable us to achieve these objectives. Currently, only ¥150.0 billion, or one-fourth of total assets are fixed assets. Given our equity ratio, I believe that we could have between 40% to 50% of assets represented by fixed assets without issue. For this reason, I am looking to lower the amount of notes and accounts receivable-trade and inventory assets and use the on-hand cash created by this reduction to increase fixed assets through capital investments and M&A. I am aiming to build a strong balance sheet that will make future improvements in profitability possible, resulting in greater mar- gins on the income statement.
It is my intent to enhance our balance sheet through initia- tives for improving profitability and to thereby achieve a robust corporate constitution capable of driving ongoing growth. I plan to achieve this through continuously managing KPIs such as by- business receivable and inventory turnover periods, making investment decisions while considering the hurdle rates based on business- and country-specific WACC introduced in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, augmenting our global cash management systems, and reducing cross-shareholdings.

CORPORATE VALUE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES
Analysis of Business Results, Financial Position, and Cash Flows Business Results and Operating Environment
  Net sales increased ¥1.3 billion from the previous equivalent period, to ¥509.1 billion, due to higher sales in the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business and the Precision Machinery Business.
Cost of sales was ¥376.0 billion, making for a cost of sales ratio of 73.8%, and gross profit was ¥133.1 billion accordingly. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled ¥100.6 billion and operating income decreased ¥4.1 billion from the previous equivalent period, to ¥32.4 billion.
Non-operating income and non-operating expenses made for a net expense of ¥1.2 billion, largely due to the recording of ¥1.5 billion in interest expenses leading to ordinary income decreasing ¥4.2 billion from the previous equivalent period, to ¥31.2 billion.
Extraordinary income and extraordinary loss combined resulted in a net loss of ¥3.9 billion primarily attributable to impairment loss of ¥2.6 billion. Due to this factor, income before income taxes was ¥27.3 billion.
The combined total of income taxes-current and income taxes-deferred was ¥7.6 billion, resulting in profit attributable to non-controlling interests of ¥1.4 billion. The aforementioned factors led profit attributable to owners of parent to decrease ¥4.5 billion from the previous equivalent period, to ¥18.2 billion.
Segment Performance
In the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, orders were ¥326.2 billion, up ¥17.3 billion from the previous equivalent period; net sales were ¥308.9 billion, up ¥4.8 billion; and oper- ating income was ¥8.7 billion, down ¥5.3 billion.
Recovery was seen in capital investment in the downstream areas of the oil and gas market that are the primary targets for deliveries of our compressors and turbines and custom pumps. Against this backdrop, orders increased ¥19.3 billion from the previous equivalent period centered on the products of the compressors and turbines business. The full-fledged recovery of custom pumps orders is expected to be delayed until the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, as the lead time for these items are shorter than for compressors and tur- bines, resulting in orders being made at later times. Net sales
Consolidated Statements of Income (Billions of yen)
were favorable with regard to compressors and turbines and standard pumps. However, operating income in the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business was low as a result of several one-time detractors from profit occurring in the second half of the fiscal year. Specifically, these detractors included problems with specific models in the pumps business, intensified price competition in the compressors and turbines business, and delays in the integration of systems when consolidating facto- ries in the chillers business.
In the Environmental Plants Business, orders were ¥106.9 billion, up ¥41.8 billion from the previous equivalent period; net sales were ¥62.8 billion, down ¥7.1 billion; and operating income was ¥4.9 billion, relatively unchanged from the previous equivalent period.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Environ- mental Plants Business was successful in capturing several large-scale orders, contributing to an exceptionally high level of orders and an increase of ¥41.8 billion. Conversely, operating income decreased slightly as a result of a decrease in net sales centered on engineering, procurement, and construction orders, and the recording of a provision for loss on the partial withdrawal from the business of a Chinese manufacturing subsidiary, which occurred in the second half of the fiscal year.
In the Precision Machinery Business, orders were ¥140.6 billion, up ¥10.3 billion from the previous equivalent period; net sales were ¥135.7 billion, up ¥3.6 billion; and operating income was ¥18.5 billion, up ¥1.1 billion.
Orders, net sales, and operating income all broke records due to the brisk capital investments seen in the semiconductor market, particularly in memory-related sectors. However, per- formance growth slowed heading into the second half of the fiscal year as customers began to curtail investments.
Note: The previous fiscal period was a nine-month period beginning April 1, 2017, and ending December 31, 2017. Comparisons with the previous equivalent period compare performance between the period from January 1 to December 31, 2017, and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

 Financial Position
Total assets as of December 31, 2018, stood at ¥591.5 billion, down ¥21.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end. Increases of ¥8.5 billion in notes and accounts receivable-trade and ¥13.1 billion in inventories were outweighed by decreases of ¥27.8 billion in cash and deposits and ¥7.4 billion in investments and other assets.
Total liabilities amounted to ¥304.8 billion on December 31, 2018, a decrease of ¥23.3 billion from a year earlier. This decrease was primarily a result of the repayment of short- term loans payable and the redemption of current portion of

  ENHANCEMENT OF MANAGEMENT CAPITAL
Intellectual Capital—Management Resources Underpinning Competitive Edge—Research and Development and Intellectual Property Management
 Message from Executive Officer Responsible for Technologies, R&D, and Intellectual Property
Guided by the basic intellectual capital management policy of BRDIP,*1 which pro- motes coordination between Businesses, Research and Development, and Intellectual Properties, and the basic strategy of ABA,*2 which encourages collaboration between Academia, Businesses, and Associations, the EBARA Group has proceeded to hone the competitive edge of its business by advancing R&D and intellectual property activ- ities through its proprietary frameworks. I hope to help support the growth of the EBARA Group as a global conglomerate by evolving and building upon the BRDIP policy and the ABA strategy going forward.

Basic Approach
The EBARA Group has developed several proprietary frame- works under its ABA strategy. Ebara Open Innovation (EOI)*3 is a framework for strengthening fundamental technologies through partnership with universities. Ebara Open Laboratory (EOL)*4 is a framework for enhancing product technologies through coordination between business and research divisions. Ebara Innovation for “X” (EIX)*5 is a framework for advancing projects for creating new products and businesses. Lastly, Ebara Open for Supplier (EOS)*6 is a framework for bolstering prototyping functions. The unique open innovation activities advanced through these frameworks have consistently sup- ported the reinforcement of the Group’s business. We will con- tinue to evolve and build upon these frameworks in order to strengthen the technologies that contribute to our business
while aggressively advancing forward-looking research and development.
Meanwhile, several unique frameworks are in place to invigorate intellectual property activities. With these frame- works, the Group has been promoting a shift toward quality over quantity in intellectual property and evolving its patent portfolio to be more strategically viable. We are also managing and utilizing the intellectual properties of Group companies on a global basis while engaging in technology branding activities. Going forward, the EBARA Group’s intellectual property divi- sions will remain receptive to social trends, pursuing close coordination with business divisions as they support operations through proactive intellectual property activities.

   Initiatives for Bolstering Intellectual Capital
First EOI International Symposium
Industry-academia collaboration activities through the EOI framework are in their ninth year. This year saw the holding of the first EOI International Symposium. A total of eight profes- sors, four from domestic universities and four from overseas universities, were invited to give structured lectures on the results of their research activities. More than 100 employees attended, making the event a site of vigorous discussion. At this event, many questions and opinions were voiced by younger engineers, and one of the guest lecturers stated that the number of questions from engineers was proof of the improvement made in EBARA’s technical capabilities.

external researchers invited to act as guest lecturers and six training sessions were conducted in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The training sessions were based on a curriculum designed to foster the intuition of junior employees to help them better understand technologies and various phe- nomena on an intuitive level. This focus on human resource development supports the development of fundamental tech- nologies of the EBARA Group.

Technology Branding Strategies
Technology branding activities are being advanced as part of the EBARA Group’s efforts in the area of intellectual proper- ties. As one facet of these activities, the technology brand “eDYNAMiQ” for EBARA’s standard pump technology was launched in 2018. Created through cooperation with business divisions, this brand is meant to help communicate to custom- ers the passion that EBARA has poured into its standard pumps over the years. An acronym of the words Eco, Dynamic, and Integrated Quality, the brand name of “eDYNAMiQ” repre- sents the characteristics of EBARA’s standard pump technology.

    EBARA’s R&D Activities for Creating a New Era
Evolution of Virtual Factories to Shape the Future
of Manufacturing with Suppliers
It has been 10 years since EBARA CORPORATION disbanded its prior research laboratories to launch a new R&D struc- ture. Over this period, we have promoted the advancement of various initiatives aimed at strengthening EBARA’s innova- tive R&D structure, which is unlike anything seen among its peers. One such initiative is Ebara Open for Supplier (EOS). The following is a discussion with the Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion, an indispensable co-creation partner, on the EOS initiatives implemented thus far and the future of manufacturing.
  Atsushi Miura
Director, Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion
Inception of EOS
——What exactly is EOS?
Tsujimura: EOS is a special R&D prototyping framework put in place by EBARA. In 2009, the Company disbanded its research laboratories. With its previous systems and frameworks abol- ished, EBARA began looking for a new R&D method. The Com- pany was faced with a situation in which it needed to continue research and development, but it had no labs or researchers. The solution it found was the creation of a completely new R&D structure focused on open innovation with researchers from both inside and outside the Company conducting joint research through a virtual environment. Moving forward with the resulting EOI and EOL initiatives, our R&D activities over the decade have consistently bore fruit. However, one issue that arose regarded the establishment of a prototyping factory that was ideally suited to this new R&D system. EBARA’s exist- ing factories were exclusive for products and consequently, incompatibilities were sure to appear whenever we tried to produce new prototype articles there. What we needed was a production framework that could adapt as necessary when we sought to create something completely new, a virtual prototyp- ing factory to complement our virtual R&D system that did not

  need factory staff and equipment in the Company. The frame- work we created to achieve this was EOS. We realized that working with suppliers that could join us in developing various manufacturing processes and realizing these production tech- nologies was the key to better R&D. This was when we heard about the Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion and its work supporting 1,500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Kawasaki City, prompting us to visit the institution, enabling us to take a large step forward in EOS realization.
What is the Kawasaki model supporting EOS?
Miura: Kawasaki City is a central part of the Keihin industrial district, which is home to many major companies and SMEs. The Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion has been sup- porting SMEs amid the globalization of society and the spread of information technologies for 30 years. Our basic approach is to focus on frontline operations, actively visiting SMEs to gain an understanding of the visions of their presidents and working together with them to further their development. We have gained recognition for this commitment, and this approach to supporting companies based on a shared vision has produced results, thereby coming to be known throughout Japan as the “Kawasaki Model.” Among our initiatives, we are attracting particular attention with regard to how we help create new products, based on our focus on frontline operations, infusing SMEs with the intellectual properties of major companies and promoting open use of patents with the potential to give rise to

new products and technologies.
Tsujimura: EBARA has had relationships with several SME associations in the past. However, most of the associations simply introduced us to SMEs, and usually no transactions came of those meetings. That’s why when I met with the Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion, I was surprised at how swift and attentive its approach for SMEs was. The Insti- tute’s commitment to matching the desires of SMEs with those of EBARA as an order placer and to tying these desires to actual orders could be said to represent the core of the Kawasaki Model. This commitment coincided with the hopes of our staff, and I felt confident that this model would help us realize the goals of the EOS framework.
Actual EOS Initiatives
——How have EOS initiatives been advancing?
Miura: One major characteristic of the Kawasaki Model is team dispatch initiatives. In these initiatives, teams formed by government employees, representatives from local financial institutions, and staff from the Institute visit SMEs to explain the various subsidy systems and measures available to them.
I remember when you, Mr. Tsujimura, asked to accompany these teams. To us, the idea of having the head of technology at a major company visit the frontlines with us on such a team was inconceivable. This unexpected development led us to refer to the team as the “Tsujimura Caravan” when you accom- panied us. We asked our coordinators, who had amassed
 EBARA’s R&D system is comprised of the EOI (joint research), EOL (in-house research), and EIX (new business / field research) frameworks. Research is also being advanced through the EOS framework for reinforcing prototyping functions and the EHU program for fostering the human resources that support technological development. EBARA strives to create new business by promoting coordination with business divisions and with external institutions and by fully capitalizing on this R&D system. For more information regarding each framework, please see the footnotes on P.31–32.

extensive raw data through our frontline-oriented initiatives thus far, to choose the SMEs to be visited from among the approximately 1,500 companies under our jurisdiction, and these visits were thus made a reality.
Tsujimura: I have found participation in these dispatch teams to be most meaningful as they have enabled me to communi- cate our desire to create a framework through which we could request the production of prototypes for R&D purposes. To date, I have joined the teams five times, visiting 18 companies. Later, we were able to hold open innovation forums at our Fujisawa District and Futtsu Plant through co-sponsorship by the Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion. Technologies were explained and exhibited at these forums, which provided
a prime opportunity for exchanges between SME representa- tives and EBARA engineers. More than 100 EBARA employees participated in each forum, engaging in lively exchanges of opinion. These activities were connected to four prototyping and examination requests in 2016, seven in 2017, and six in 2018. Miura: Mr. Toichi Maeda, then President and Representative Executive Officer and current Chairman & Director of the Com- pany, as well as business division executives and other repre- sentatives from EBARA participated in the open innovation forums, making it a truly revolutionary event entailing collabo- ration between SMEs not only from Kawasaki City but also from the greater Keihin area including Yokohama and Ota City. There, EBARA employees engaged in daily research activities and the representatives of SMEs were able to have a frank and open discussion about their hopes and the realities of manu- facturing. The atmosphere at the forums indicated a flat rela- tionship, contrasting the standard hierarchical structure found at most major manufacturing companies. All participants were moved by this atmosphere. The opportunity to hear the presi- dent of a major company explain their vision in person was another factor that truly impressed me about these forums. Tsujimura: The policies based on which we advance EOS initia- tives are all principles gleaned from the stance of the Kawasaki Institute of Industrial Promotion.
EOS is a new undertaking, and we knew we would experi- ence setbacks as we moved forward, but we were able to arrive at where we are today by addressing these head-on and changing our approach when needed. For example, usually when companies place orders, they will conduct credit investi- gations and go through various other procedures. As such, a great amount of time and work is required before the actual order can be placed. However, EBARA recognizes that the companies from which we request prototyping activities want orders with prompt payments. We therefore adjusted our pur- chasing system to allow for orders to be placed immediately for articles that offer the desired quality and for payments to be issued within two months. There have even been times when
visiting companies as a member of the Institute’s dispatch teams in which I have paid in cash to purchase items I found appealing on the spot. At the same time, there were cases in which orders were placed, but the companies were unable to produce the requested articles in a satisfactory manner. How- ever, we believe that these failures should be treated in the same way as those that occur at our own factories and that we have a responsibility to pay for the time spent on making the product. While we may refer to the framework as a “virtual fac- tory” scheme, this does not change the fact that our partners are important allies in a co-production process. Our commit- ment to this sentiment has driven ongoing improvements in EOS initiatives.
Miura: EOS initiatives are an incredibly ambitious undertaking with the potential to change not only the manufacturing system at EBARA but also the very concept of manufacturing in Japan. Today, we are in an era in which industry structures are trans- forming, and manufacturing operations are being transferred to locations with lower personnel costs like China and other emerging countries. We are approaching the limits of what can be accomplished with the conventional hierarchical manufac- turing systems found at most major companies. Given this backdrop, I have great praise for how EBARA is designing a framework for maintaining an open and equal relationship with suppliers and for using these relationships to realize a virtual factory scheme. This initiative is truly groundbreaking and reflective of the society to come.
  35 EBARA Group Integrated Report 2019

  As the EOS framework has improved, I have witnessed changes to SMEs’ traditional hierarchical values and engrained customs and cultures. It could be said that it is customary for SMEs to passively receive and fulfill orders from major compa- nies. EBARA’s EOS framework puts a new twist on that custom that can challenge traditional perspectives, leading to changes in the culture of the companies involved. I see great potential for EOS to change the very nature of SMEs in Japan.
——What successes have been achieved thus far?
Tsujimura: When we launched the EOI and EOL frameworks, we consolidated previously inconsistent research themes with a focus on heightening our product development capabilities. The transition to virtual laboratories then changed our prior year-based perspective on research to a day-by-day research perspective. The result was an astounding improvement in research efficiency. Today, R&D expenses are half those of 2009, while output is two to three times higher and research efficiency is four to six times higher.
Through the EOS framework, we aim to develop a virtual factory scheme for prototyping. This scheme will not be able to create immediate results akin to those of the EOI and EOL frameworks. However, compared to the massive amounts of time and money required to build factories, virtual factories can be set up quickly and at low cost. We are still in the pro- cess of creating this scheme, and ongoing effort is required. As such, the successes thus far are still few. Nevertheless, we are making steady progress in the development of virtual factories through our connections with the Institute and with our suppliers.
In 2018, we launched new initiatives aimed at starting up virtual factories. Specifically, we began building the Connected Lab within the Fujisawa District. This lab will be a site for joint efforts with external suppliers. Our decision to create such a facility was based on the recognition that, no matter how “virtual” these factories may be, we will still need physical venues through which to connect with suppliers.
Miura: I think that the virtual factory scheme of EOS is a mar- riage of both virtual and physical relationships in that it is built upon both trust-based, face-to-face interpersonal connections and digital technologies.
The passion and dedication of EBARA is giving rise to a new type of relationship between large enterprises and SMEs. The successes of these initiatives may not yet be tan- gible, but the efforts of today will no doubt grow gradually into greater successes tomorrow. I anticipate that these efforts will one day create new technologies, new products, and maybe even new industries.
Future of EOS
——What are EBARA’s goals going forward?
Tsujimura: EBARA is currently in the process of building the Connected Lab to furnish the physical infrastructure for con- necting with the people that we are linked to through the EOS framework. Going forward, we hope to make this lab into a place that enables involved parties to discuss and share ideas for the prototype being created through panels in virtual
ENHANCEMENT OF MANAGEMENT CAPITAL
R&D Enhancement Case Study
spaces and that makes easy the close coordination needed to realize the mutual heightening of knowledge and technologies. The R&D system I envision a century from now is one in which one can write their idea on a big panel and have it immediately shared with all project members, who can then send their responses. This system will allow for a swift transition to development through coordination between the EOI, EOL, and EOS frameworks. As one step toward realizing this vision, we are currently working to realize the use of avatars to coordinate with people both inside and outside of the Company through virtual spaces. If we can apply augmented reality technologies to this system in the future, it will make it possible to share product information through virtual spaces, and to view this information and collaborate. This is one of my goals.
Miura: KEIDANREN is currently searching for ways to realize a new manufacturing style known as digital fabrication. However, it seems as though EBARA is already working toward realizing digital fabrication through the virtual factories of its EOS scheme. Other companies are probably engaging in similar undertakings, but there are likely none that have managed to establish the actual frameworks for this manufacturing style. The EOS framework is a system for linking major companies and SMEs and driving the ongoing growth of both. The number of SMEs in Japan is half that of 20 years ago, but those that still survive undoubtedly boast exceptional technologies. The current rapid pace of change in today’s world means that adapting to this speed will be crucial to survival going forward. I think that utilizing one’s own technologies while effectively connecting these technologies to others will be an important part of this adaptation. Meanwhile, collaboration between completely different fields can create unprecedented technolo- gies. Such technologies have the potential to generate value for society and to contribute to the resolution of the various issues faced by communities. I hope to work toward this vision in order to evolve our approach into what may one day come to be referred to as the “Ebara-Kawasaki Model.”
Tsujimura: EBARA’s R&D system includes the EOI, EOL, EIX, and now EOS frameworks. Next, we will expand our efforts to incorporate the EHU and NIH (Not Invented Here) programs. The phrase “not invented here” generally carries a negative meaning, but we use it in a positive sense as in “we don’t do that here, but we want to.” I see the potential for EBARA to adapt its technologies to various fields, not just to the evolution of the automotive and semiconductor fields that are garnering attention today but also to space, medicine, and other fields that the Company has yet to explore. Through our EOS initia- tives, we are developing the infrastructure that will allow us to take a realistic approach toward judging what we can accom- plish and how these accomplishments can be achieved when we actually go to use our technologies in these fields. Further- more, I hope to utilize the connections we have formed through the EOS framework to broaden the scope of technologies we can access and return the benefits to society. As we adopt a forward-looking perspective and place value in mutual trust, I am confident in our ability to start small and grow gradually to realize our goals.

The EBARA Group seeks to cultivate a corporate culture that encourages all employees to tackle their work with a competitive spirit and embrace challenge
with passion and dedication. To this end, we replaced our prior seniority-based grad- ing system with a system that evaluates employees based on their demonstrated role and accomplishments in the workplace, regardless of age, gender, or nationality. To facilitate the ongoing development and growth of EBARA’s business on a global scale, we will continue to implement system reforms aimed at utilizing global human resources more effectively and promoting Group unity.

Human Resource System Reforms
Management-level employees were incorporated into the new system in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, and all union members were incorporated in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The following initiatives were implemented to facilitate the transition.
• Enables optimal placement of individuals to management positions based on ability as opposed to seniority
• Enables the formation of strategic placement plans for capable individuals to develop in different areas of the organization
• Expands succession management program toward Groupwide/global positions to accelerate global mobility
• Restructured a traditional seniority-based HR system to a system that evaluates and motivates employ- ees based on their contribution and performance, more comparable to systems globally
• Eliminates employee classifications which allows all employees to be evaluated and rewarded for highly skilled work and performance results
• Talented employees are promoted to management-level positions faster than before
• Promotion of youngest employee to a management-level position at age 28 (previously youngest was 35)
• Surveyed approximately 9,000 employees at domestic Group companies
• Exceeded the average score for questions regarding work motivation for companies with more than
      10,000 employees
Promotion of Diversity and Work Style Innovation
A priority in EBARA’s diversity promotion
initiatives has been to step up efforts for
empowering female employees. These
efforts have earned recognition, and, in
May 2018, the Company received the highest
rating (Rank 3) in the “Eruboshi” certification
mark program. In this program, the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare grants this certification to the companies that present excellence in empowering female employees based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.
In addition, the Operations Innovation Division was estab- lished in April 2018, after which EBARA began implementing Companywide work style innovations. In promoting diversity, the EBARA Group seeks to go beyond just empowering female employees to cultivate workplace environments in which each and every employee is able to fully exercise their talents and realize their ideal work-life balance.
Human Resource Development
Under the new human resource system, the roles and respon- sibilities of section and department managers have changed drastically. In reflection of these new roles and responsibilities, training programs for new section and department managers at EBARA CORPORATION and domestic Group companies were introduced to facilitate awareness reforms and skill acquisition. Going forward, we will continue efforts to enhance the capabilities of managers.
In addition, Self-Development Workshops were held for employees who were previously general/assistant staff to help them better understand the changes in their roles and to take the first step in tackling new challenges. We will enhance the line-up of these self-development training programs to sup- port employee skill development going forward.

EBARA’S PEOPLE
Engaging in Competition and Embracing Challenge
We asked employees for their stories regarding their goals and how they are taking on challenges to better society and support the growth of the Company.
   Could you please tell us about the project that you are currently engaged in?
My team is currently in the midst of implementing a Groupwide enterprise resource planning system. I believe that, as the EBARA Group grows as a global company, it is crucial to develop foundations and implement a work process optimization and standardization system that unites the Group and lives up to the expectations of markets and customers worldwide.
Currently, we have a 107-year history that has been supported by the introduction of operation systems and the pursuit of opti- mization on a by-business or by-division basis.
However, we realize that this approach has limits with regard to our ability to utilize digital technologies in management. This is why in implementing this new system, we will need to consider iconoclastic reforms while maintaining our traditional strengths and following the “EBARA Way.” In order to effectively utilize this new system, we will need to change how every employee thinks, along with our very corporate culture. This is the end goal of my project, and I have no doubt that this massive undertaking will go down in EBARA Group history.
How do you intend to further build upon the EBARA Group’s strengths through this project? Also, what challenges do you hope to tackle in the future and what do you want to accomplish?
The EBARA Group has a wide range of businesses and boasts sophisticated technologies, diverse products, and extensive base, sales, and service networks. This system between business seg- ments and countries is very complex, and it is currently difficult to identify and share important information between business seg- ments and departments efficiently. If, however, we could find a way to standardize and share relevant information and data within the Group, it would become possible for all organizations within the Group to utilize the strengths of others in a greater range of instances and on a mutual basis. I want to see the EBARA Group become an organization in which all employees are united as one, and driven by passion and dedication to swiftly deliver highly reli- able products and services to customers around the world. I am devoted to helping create the foundations and corporate culture that will be required to accomplish this vision.

 QUESTION
You worked overseas for quite a while. What kinds of challenges did you face there and what kinds of results did you see from those efforts?
ANSWER
For around eight years, I worked at Ebara Pumps Europe S.p.A., an Italian consolidated subsidiary that functions as an overseas production base for manufacturing stainless steel standard pumps.* I was in charge of development and sales support for the EVMS model pump, a global core product, as a project coordinator.
As part of this project, we introduced a development method- ology that entailed advancing all processes simultaneously in order to realize substantially shorter development periods. Before the project, our development was relay-race-style, meaning each design, production, and sales process was fully completed before passing the baton to the next process. However, this style of pro- duction resulted in a very long total development process, as the creation of the dies for production or sales materials had to wait until after the design phase had been totally completed. The initial design phase also had a substantial impact on the entire development process and it was difficult to realize optimal designs that also took ease of production or procurement
into account.
To address these downsides, we organized a dedicated team
comprised of representatives from all relevant divisions. Through this team, the basic design data necessary for the production and sales processes was shared while the design phase was still underway to allow all processes to be conducted at the same time. We were thereby able to shorten what used to be four-year development periods down to two years. Moreover, by accounting for ease of production and procurement in the design phase, this project realized a 30% cost reduction.
QUESTION
What kinds of challenges do you hope to tackle in the future?
ANSWER
In the past, I had the opportunity to take part in an official devel- opment assistance project in the Republic of Gambia in the west of Africa, where we constructed a regional water supply system. In the future, I hope to utilize the business strategy formulation and project management experience I gained to tackle the chal- lenge of reinforcing businesses at existing bases and establishing new bases in the global market. The memory of villagers’ tears of joy when we completed construction of the water supply system in Gambia will serve as my motivation going forward and as one source of the pride I feel working at EBARA.

       Initiatives for Strengthening Environmental Management
 Enhanced Monitoring of Global Environmental Data
To facilitate the formulation of environmental targets for 2030, Groupwide IT infrastructure has been installed to collect, manage, and aggregate quantitative environmental perfor- mance data. The scope of environmental performance data collection includes 100% of domestic consolidated subsidiaries and 92% of overseas consolidated subsidiaries (based on per- centage of sales). We have been continuously expanding the scope of our data collection, beginning with the manufacturing facilities with the largest impact and are working to include all consolidated subsidiaries.
Environmental Measures through Products
The following are examples of standard pumps launched in 2018 that contribute to reduced environmental impact during use.
• FSD4 model: Compared with conventional shaft direct con-
nection type pumps, this pump is more compact and space
efficient, contributing to resource conservation.
• DL model: With a simple structure that is easy to inspect and
repair, this pump achieves a longer lifespan and uses stan-
dardized parts to help conserve resources.
• Sewage pumps with premium-efficiency IE3 motors: These
pumps conserve energy with premium-efficiency motors and are thus being promoted as strategic global products.
Global Reinforcement of Environmental Management
The Company has been performing on-site environmental and safety surveys of overseas production bases since 2014. These surveys were focused on the bases under the control of the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business up until 2017. The scope of the surveys was then expanded in 2018 to include the sites of all companies under the jurisdiction of the Precision Machinery Business. Checklists have been established for these surveys to ensure that the precursors of environmental risks are addressed. The effectiveness of these checklists is reviewed with each on-site survey in a process of ongoing enhancement aimed at ensuring accurate risk assessment.
Improvement of Sales and Production Efficiency and Environmental Initiative Transparency
Estimate and inquiry centers have been established to expedite customer support, facilitate reductions in per unit of produc- tion energy consumption from automated pump assembly lines, and promote renewable energy use.

 BUSINESS STRATEGIES
Fluid Machinery & Systems Business
   Aspiring to deliver greater bene- fits to customers, we endeavored to develop new high-efficiency products and to augment our S&S systems.
Nobuharu Noji
Senior Managing Executive Officer
President, Fluid Machinery & Systems Company
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, net sales in the Fluid Machin- ery & Systems (FMS) Business were up in comparison to the previous full- year period, even though conditions in building equipment and other principal markets were relatively unchanged. This was largely due to the recovery in the investment appetite of the oil and gas market. However, operating income was down due to the continuation of fierce price compe- tition and the incurring of one-time costs for the purpose of addressing defective products.
Throughout the year, we continued to advance various initiatives in accordance with the basic policies of the medium-term management plan, E-Plan 2019, to improve our profitability and market share in Japan and expand the scale of our operations overseas. Initiatives for improving prof- itability in Japan included commencing operations of an automated stan- dard pump assembly line on schedule as part of our broader efforts to optimize our production systems. In addition, steady progress was made in the consolidation and standardization of product lineups and in work pro- cess reforms spanning from sales to production. To improve market shares and expand operations in Japan and overseas, we endeavored to develop new high-efficiency products and augment service and support (S&S) sys- tems. These efforts were geared toward achieving our targets for reducing electricity consumption during product use and for expanding S&S opera- tions to help maximize product lifespans and minimize equipment down- times, both Action Policy KPIs which address our material ESG issues.
We are committed to making steady progress toward the accomplishment of ESG-related and other management targets and to completing the mea- sures prescribed for the final year of E-Plan 2019.

  TOPICS
Examples of Initiatives Pertaining to E-Plan 2019 and Material ESG Issues
  Standard Pumps Business
Commencement of Operations for Automated Pump Assembly Line
Operation of an automated assembly line for horizontal multi-stage pumps commenced at the Fujisawa District in September 2018. The installation of this line entailed replacing the production processes from assembly to inspection with four robots. The result is a production system that requires less human labor and is able to respond flexibly to changes in demand. In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, we plan to construct a new automated submerged pump assembly line and to com- mence mass production of these pumps thereafter. Addi- tionally, the number of models handled by the existing automated horizontal multi-stage pump assembly line will be expanded from one to four. Going forward, further improvements to productivity will be pursued through fully automated assembly lines as the Group endeavors
to establish systems for supplying products that are more acutely matched to customer needs.
Custom Pumps Business
Reinforcement of Custom Pump S&S Network
The EBARA Group has a robust track record of delivering custom pumps to oil and gas, water infrastructure, elec- tricity, and other markets around the world. An important initiative in E-Plan 2019 and for our material ESG issues is to reinforce our S&S systems to ensure that delivered products can operate reliably with little to no downtime, and we are taking action to accomplish this objective. One example would be the service shop in Saudi Arabia we established in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017. We are also moving forward with efforts to develop service systems that are more closely connected to cus- tomers at existing overseas service bases. At these bases sales staff and engineers perform proposal-based sales activities while local field service engineers supply parts and conduct overhaul services. Going forward, we will continue to respond to customer needs for parts supply, repairs, and maintenance as we seek to enhance S&S offerings throughout all areas of product lifecycles.

Tetsuji Togawa
Senior Managing Executive Officer President, Precision Machinery Company
The Precision Machinery Business has proceeded to seize growth opportu- nities by fostering a reputation as a reliable partner through swift propos- als that incorporate customer feedback and exhaustive support. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we responded to the brisk capital investment in Asia by catering to customer needs through increased coor- dination with suppliers. The result was record-breaking income. Market slowdown is being seen in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, due to factors such as the trade dispute between the United States and China. Nevertheless, we look to make steady progress in initiatives for addressing EBARA’s material ESG issues and for achieving the targets of E-Plan 2019.
Eying the future growth of the semiconductor market, we built a new semiconductor manufacturing equipment factory in 2016 and plan to com- plete construction of an automated dry vacuum pump assembly line by the end of 2019. This will help us reinvent our production and work processes to realize increased product competitiveness and improved profitability. However, given the growth in demand, we realize that it will not be enough to simply boost our own production capacity; we will need to advance initiatives with a view of the entire supply chain. For this reason, we plan
to pursue greater coordination with suppliers and construct ideal procure- ment systems. Looking ahead, we will augment our lineups of products along with our S&S offerings to match customer needs and contribute
to the ongoing growth and development of both the Group and its stakeholders.

Discussion between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Company
SAKON UDA × TOICHI MAEDA
The following is a discussion between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Company in which they look at some of the key points of the most recent transformation, explain their commitments to improved effectiveness, and reflect on initiatives conducted to date.
   Sakon Uda
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Member of the Nomination Committee
Uda: The most recent transformation to EBARA’s corporate governance system drew a clear divide between the oversight function and the execution function. The prior transition to the Company with Three Committees format described in the Companies Act of Japan resulted in the delegation of addi- tional authority to Executive Officers while also reinforcing the oversight function of the Board of Directors, thereby evolving the Company’s corporate governance system to increase the effectiveness of both functions.
Now, there is only one Director serving concurrently as an Executive Officer, and that is President and Representative Executive Officer Masao Asami. As President, Mr. Asami repre- sents the execution function at meetings of the Board, provid- ing explanations as such and shouldering the responsibility of answering any questions raised during discussion with the seven Independent Directors and the three Non-Executive Inside Directors. This change further solidified the structure
of the executive function with the President as the head while clarifying the division between the oversight function and the executive function.
Up until now, in-house company presidents had also been appointed as Directors. However, as the role expected of a Director is oversight, which is fundamentally different from the execution role expected of an Executive Officer, I suspect that when an in-house company president served concurrently as a Director, they may have often found it difficult to fulfill the oversight function toward other Directors also in charge of

Evolution of Corporate Governance System Propelled by Ongoing Pursuit of Effectiveness
EBARA has continued to evolve its corporate governance system in its ongoing pursuit of effectiveness. In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the Company began implementing initiatives under its new corporate governance system.
 
in-house companies. The new system eliminates such issues. Maeda: EBARA’s corporate governance system is not merely an adopted template. Rather, it has continued to evolve based on our history. In 2008, we appointed our first two Independent Directors, and the number of Independent Directors was increased gradually to steadily develop and reinforce an over- sight framework based around these individuals. When the Company transitioned to the Company with Three Committees format in 2015, the number of Independent Directors grew to seven, representing a majority of the Board. Meanwhile, we had failed to sufficiently discuss the role of Inside Directors that also had executive responsibilities. When deliberating on the topic of the effectiveness of the Board in 2018, we reached the conclu- sion that only one Director with executive responsibilities would be sufficient for effective deliberation: the President. The result- ing change in the corporate governance system narrowed the scope of the Board’s roles to focus on oversight, and thus allows for more effective discussions at Board meetings. Although
the President is the only Director on the Board with execution responsibilities, we ask Executive Officers to attend if we expect to have discussions pertinent to their area of responsibility. Moreover, Executive Officers make quarterly reports on the exe- cution of their duties to the Board so we can periodically review progress made on important executive issues.
Uda: It was not as though we began considering the new system last year out of the blue. Quite the contrary, the idea of such a system was nurtured over the course of many years through ongoing discussions on how to improve the effective- ness of the Board. It might be more accurate to say that the current system is a checkpoint on the road of our ongoing dis- cussion of corporate governance systems, and that an impor- tant foundation of these systems is the need for all members of the EBARA Group, particularly management, to hold a con- stant sense of urgency and awareness of potential risks. This is true even in times when the management base is stable. One example of this mindset coming to fruition is the recently announced succession plan. We did not merely think about the succession plan for the President and Representative Execu- tive Officer in response to questions directed toward us, but rather seriously delved into this subject with years-long dis- cussions resulting in us now being able to explain EBARA’s plans to external stakeholders transparently. All of manage- ment shares the belief that increasing the effectiveness of the Board and the committees will be positive for the Company
as a whole. For this reason, management does not merely look to change the form of the Company’s corporate governance system to fit expectations. Instead, earnest effort is made based on thorough discussion to pursue real improvements
in the functionality of the Board.
Maeda: I became a Director in 2011, and I remember how fresh the opinions of the Independent Directors felt at that time. It was an eye-opening experience hearing their objec- tive and logical input, which was very different from the discussions in prior Board meetings without Independent Directors. After that, we continued to increase the number of Independent Directors while moving ahead with corporate governance reforms based on the discussions and suc- cesses thus far. This ongoing progress was rooted in our
desire to realize genuine improvements in the effectiveness of the Board, not simply an attempt to conform with trends of the time, such as the move to respond to the establish- ment of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code.
Background and Reason for Appointing an Indepen- dent Director to be Chairman of the Board of Directors Uda: Previously, the Chairman of the Company, who did not have execution responsibilities, served concurrently as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. However, these two posi- tions are generally meant to fulfill different roles. It is common for the chairman of a company to play a role in which they interact with outside stakeholders and provide advice based on their execution experience while the chairman of the board of directors is responsible for the effective operation of the board. EBARA assigned these positions to different individuals to establish a clear division between these roles. Another reason for making an Independent Director the Chairman of the Board of Directors was to help invigorate discussions among the Board. An important characteristic of EBARA’s Board of Direc- tors is that the Chairman of the Board of Directors, now an Independent Director, is responsible for the meeting agendas. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is thus charged with choosing the matters to be discussed by the Board from an objective standpoint, as opposed to merely focusing on the matters raised in-house. Fulfilling this role as an Independent Director, who is not constantly immersed in the internal cir- cumstances of the Company in the manner that previous chairmen were, requires a strong commitment. If I do not familiarize myself with the discussions going on at the Man- agement Meetings and with the fundamental issues faced by the Company, there will be no point in me being involved in the process of deciding the agenda items for Board meetings. I will also be unable to gain the trust of those inside the Company. However, as I cannot be inside the Company on a full-time basis, I would like to ask you, Chairman Maeda, for your assistance in fulfilling this role.
Maeda: I see the act of assigning the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors to an Independent Director to be a step forward in the evolution of the Company’s corporate gover- nance. The idea of this assignment was identified as an important item for discussion by the Board of Directors in 2018 and during this discussion it was decided that the Chair- man of the Company would fill a supportive role of offering consultation regarding agenda items and helping liaise with Executive Officers.
Activities of the Nomination Committee that Selected the New President
Uda: EBARA established its voluntary Nomination Committee in 2008, and this committee began interviewing possible suc- cessors to the President long before it was time for the change. The committee was therefore able to discuss succes- sion plans for the President and Representative Executive Officer based on the understanding of the Company’s human resources that had been obtained through interviews and questions at meetings of the Board up until that point. The big- gest issue, however, was the fact that as the chairperson of the

Nomination Committee was an Independent Director, there was no guarantee that the rest of the Company would be accepting of the committee’s decision. The Nomination Com- mittee had, in fact, been preparing for the leadership change for a period of between three and six years, during which members had met with a substantial number of candidates, learning about their dispositions, while also receiving informa- tion from Inside Directors and through external evaluations. Accordingly, the committee had a working understanding of the thinking, leadership style, and other qualities required of the President of EBARA.
Maeda: When the new President was announced, there were those who asked if I had made the decision. However, I was not a member of the Nomination Committee at that time, and I therefore did not know who was selected until just before the announcement. Of course, I had heard the names of the candi- dates, but thoroughly respected that it was the duty of the Nomination Committee to recommend candidates to the Board. In this manner, the Nomination Committee and the succession plan did not merely exist in form but were able to fully achieve their intended function. This fact filled me with pride for EBARA’s corporate governance.
Uda: There are still very few cases among Japanese compa- nies in which independent and transparent succession plans function as intended. Much more common are cases in which the plans existed in form, but were not put into effect, and cases in which it cannot be clearly stated who or what organi- zation actually truly nominated the president. EBARA, however, is very effectively exercising the functions of the Company with Three Committees format. The evaluation of the Nomination Committee for this succession plan is left to be made five to
10 years from now based on the performance of the new man- agement team.
Review and Evaluation of Past Corporate Governance System Evolutions
Uda: Compared to 2011, when I became an Independent Direc- tor, the substance of discussions at EBARA’s Board of Direc- tors has changed greatly. When I first joined, the impacts of the harsh reforms conducted previously were still lingering, and there was a very significant need to provide checks on man- agement. Over the years, the topics of discussion have gradu- ally shifted to more forward-looking subjects aimed at future growth. In addition, whereas prior discussions were largely focused on compliance and the progress of business plans, a great deal of time has been dedicated to the medium-to-long- term enhancement of corporate value over the past two or three years. We are also starting to see Independent Director- only meetings. These meetings precede Board meetings and serve as venues for productive discussion among Independent Directors, enabling us to enhance our capacity to pose ques- tions based on the specialized perspectives and insights of individual Independent Directors. This has led to discussions that are more substantial, and I truly believe initiatives of this nature contribute to increased effectiveness of the Board. I am sure the investors will also have praise for this system, which will help increase EBARA’s corporate value.
Maeda: I became President in 2013 while former President 69 EBARA Group Integrated Report 2019
Natsunosuke Yago assumed the position of Chairman. He was strongly committed to making governance reforms due to experiencing a crisis that threatened the existence of the Company caused by the overreach of EBARA’s top manage- ment. I too experienced this crisis, and am committed to building strong frameworks—in other words, governance systems—to prevent such crises from occurring in the future. As the number of employees that do not know of this past increases, it is even more important for management to build unshakeable frameworks. Our various initiatives to build these frameworks have led EBARA to be praised for the advanced governance initiatives it is implementing today. However, these frameworks are not perfect and it is crucial we maintain our commitment to preventing management overreach and con- tinue to evolve our corporate governance frameworks.
Uda: It is common for the chairman of a company to become a consultant or advisor after resigning. Former Chairman Yago, however, resigned completely when his term was up out of a desire for EBARA to arrive at the corporate governance sys- tems it has currently. The terms of the President and the Chairman are both limited to six years and I think that these limits are reflective of the wisdom EBARA has accumulated. Former Chairman Yago adhered to this precedent, rather than trying to create an exception for himself. I hope to encourage management to maintain this mindset and to continue to communicate the background behind the current system going forward.
Recent Issues and Future Initiatives
Uda: I believe that the Board of Directors has two roles: to per- form checks for preventing damage to corporate value and to drive the Company toward future growth. Concerning the latter, while the Board is unable to draft growth strategies on its own, it is important for it to recognize that it too has to take respon- sibility for the growth of the Company. Another responsibility of the Board is to nominate the President. After a new President is nominated, one cannot help but wonder how this individual will contribute to the growth of the Company through their exe- cution duties over the duration of their term. By sharing this sentiment among all Directors, I hope to create a framework through which the Board goes beyond just performing checks and even takes initiative to encourage the endeavors of the executive team with the ultimate goal of boosting corporate value.
Maeda: The change in our corporate governance system has simultaneously resulted in a change in the atmosphere of the Board, making meetings more conducive to discussions of how EBARA should pursue future growth. Every single report made by the executive team to the Board is met with stern com- ments, but this allows opportunities to examine measures from new perspectives or at deeper levels. I have high praise for the fact that discussions at the Board have been adding new levels of depth to the plans of the executive team.
Uda: Currently, I am in a position in which I coordinate with you, Chairman Maeda, to decide which management issues should be raised as agenda items at meetings of the Board. The most important among these issues is the formulation of the next medium-term management plan. A critical point in
 
formulating this plan will be projecting the trends that will be seen in society a decade from now and considering how to incorporate these into medium-term strategies. The Board and other relevant parties are engaged in deep discussion with this regard.
Maeda: The process for formulating medium-term manage- ment plans at EBARA has improved significantly in comparison to when I was appointed President six years ago. At that time, it was customary for the President to be the central figure responsible for compiling plans. We have since broken away from this custom, and plans have come to be forged through an ongoing process of discussion by the Board. EBARA has already furnished the necessary governance system and finan- cial base for the creation of a successful plan, and looking
Corporate Governance Systems (As of March 28, 2019)
ahead, I hope to use my position as Chairman to spur the President and the other Executive Officers forward toward future growth.
Uda: Now, the Board is pressed to support the President as he seeks to navigate the currently opaque social trends. Should a large wave of change strike, the Board and its seven Indepen- dent Directors with diverse backgrounds will need to be pre- pared to assist the President in swiftly adjusting course. I also hope to create a greater range of opportunities for individual Directors to voice their opinions to Executive Officers in order to help them improve upon their plans. I aim to realize genuine improvements to the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and thereby create an organization that is committed to driving aggressive growth.

Corporate Governance
The EBARA Group has established the “EBARA Way,” composed of its Founding Spirit, Corporate Philosophy, and CSR Policy, as the EBARA Group’s identity and set of values to be shared across the Group. Under the “EBARA Way,” the enhancement of corporate value through sustainable business development and sharing the results with all stakeholders, including shareholders, are EBARA’s most important management objectives. To achieve such objectives, we constantly seek the best possible corporate governance systems and strive toward further enhancement.
Basic Policies
1) The Company respects shareholders’ rights and fosters an environment for shareholders to effectively exercise their rights while ensuring equality among shareholders.

The Company also strives to develop a corporate culture and climate in which such stakeholders’ rights and viewpoints are respected and business is effectively executed.
3) The Company strives to ensure management transparency through adequate disclosure of its corporate information.
4) The Company incorporates the organizational form of a Company with Three Committees to ensure the clear separation between supervision and business execution. This system is centered on the objective perspectives gained from Independent Directors and
Non-Executive Inside Directors and the pivotal roles they play in supervision.
5) The Company engages in constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors on the basis of its IR Basic Policy, with a view to
contributing to sustainable growth and the medium-to-long-term enhancement of corporate value.
Major Initiatives Taken in the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018
    The Board of Directors is charged with three major responsi- bilities: indicating the directions for important corporate strat- egies, establishing frameworks to allow for appropriate risks to be taken in business execution, and providing highly effective oversight of business execution from an objective and indepen- dent standpoint. In addition, the Board of Directors is expected to exercise both leadership from the perspectives of defensive functions and growth-oriented functions. In terms of defensive functions, the Board will work to establish regulatory frame- works for preventing the occurrence of scandals and the mate- rialization of other downside risks. From the perspective of growth-oriented functions, the Board will ensure that systems are in place to allow management to take bold action to pre- vent the loss of upside risk (such as business opportunities).
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, based on the results of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, time was devoted to discussing the progress and challenges faced with regard to growth strategies and the medium-term management plan, E-Plan 2019, in all of EBARA’s business segments. Also, an additional Independent Director was appointed in March 2018. With experience as a corporate manager, this individual brought the number of directors with management experience to four out of seven
Independent Directors, enabling new depth in discussions. Furthermore, brisk discussions were held on the ideal form (scale, composition, etc.) of the Board of Directors and the Company’s committees. The Nomination Committee reflected the opinions raised during these discussions into its delibera- tions on the Director candidate nomination policies for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

   Evaluation of the Board of Directors Effectiveness in the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018
 Analysis and Evaluation Process
With the cooperation of a third-party organization, the Com- pany had each Director complete a questionnaire and then held individual interviews with all of the Directors based on their responses to the questionnaire. The state and effective- ness of the Board of Directors was analyzed based on the results, and meetings were held in February 2019 to confirm the evaluation and future action items.
Contents of Questionnaires
The Company formulates questions concerning the effective- ness of the Board of Directors and the Committees.
Summary of the Results of Analysis and Evaluation
It was found that the evaluation of the current state of opera- tion of the Board of Directors and the Company’s committees were generally high and that adequate discussion is being car- ried out on important issues at meetings of the Board of Direc- tors and the committees, indicating that they are being operated appropriately. It was confirmed that issues identified during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017 (enhancement of identification and discussion of long-term issues (growth strategies, etc.); increasing monitoring of the state of progress of E-Plan 2019; periodic reviews of the size and composition of the Board; enhancement of discussions on succession planning for the President and Representative Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Independent Directors) are being addressed and improvements are being made, although issues still remain. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the quality of discussion in Board meetings has improved due to the efforts of both Independent Directors and Inside Directors and the increase in Independent Directors

with management experience. It was also found that Indepen- dent Directors made substantial contributions to discussions by making statements based on their experience and expertise while remaining aware of the importance of their roles.
However, it was found that it is necessary to continuously engage in the enhancement of identification and discussion of long-term issues contributing to the improvement of corporate value and in the monitoring of the progress of the medium- term management plan. Another area identified as needing improvement was increased support for monitoring and follow-up efforts post-deliberation by the Board of Directors.

The Nomination Committee is mainly responsible for deciding on the proposals to be submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders concerning the appointment and dismissal of Directors, recommendations to the Board of Directors con- cerning the appointment and dismissal of Executive Officers, and recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning the appointment and dismissal of Directors with special titles and Executive Officers with special titles, in addition to succes- sion planning for the President and Representative Executive Officer.
Succession Plan for the President and Representative Executive Officer
The establishment and implementation of the succession plan for the President and Representative Executive Officer is one of the most important tasks for the Nomination Committee. In March 2019, a new President and Representative Executive Officer was appointed. However, the process of cultivating and selecting candidates by the Nomination Committee began three years prior.
The Company’s succession plan has two major characteris- tics. The first characteristic is that this plan is formulated pri- marily by the Nomination Committee, of which the current President is not a member. The second characteristic is that no separation exists between human resource development and the selection of the next President, but rather that the
Action to Be Taken
FOUNDATIONS FOR GROWTH
Corporate Governance
 The evaluation of the Board conducted in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, identified a need for ongoing action in the following four areas.
 ■ Enhancement of discussion of long-term issues contributing to the improvement of corporate value along with progress of and issues with the medium-term management plan
■ Increasing support for monitoring and follow-up efforts post-deliberation by the Board of Directors
■ Periodic reviews of the size and composition of the Board of Directors
■ Enhancement of discussion on succession plans for Independent Directors
  Nomination Committee coordinates with the executive team
to systematically cultivate human resources while narrowing down the scope of candidates for the position of President. This approach means that, as opposed to choosing the next Presi- dent at the end of the current President’s term, potential can- didates are gradually cultivated and evaluated before the Nomination Committee makes the final decision of who to nominate to be the next President.
The Nomination Committee is comprised of three Non- Executive Directors, including two Independent Directors and the Chairman of the Company. This membership ensures the objective selection of ideal candidates.
The Company has a policy stating that excessive terms should be avoided for members of senior management (the President and the Chairman of the Company) and that individu- als in these positions should be changed periodically. The term of the President is six years and we plan to implement an exec- utive development plan over the course of the term of each President to cultivate future candidates.
Cultivation and Selection Process
EBARA’s succession plan begins with searching for candidates with the potential to fill the position of President in the future. A development program is then conducted to instill in candidates the basic skills expected of executives. This basic skill develop- ment program includes discussions with managers from Japan and from overseas, coaching from external specialists on introspective thinking, and other provisions designed to cul- tivate the sense of commitment required of an executive while improving the viability of candidates. During this process, the individuals that will be advanced to the next step are chosen.
The next step of the plan is to have candidates address spe- cific business issues via the management issue resolution pro- gram. Candidates who proceed to this stage are placed in positions that take them out of the area in which they have experience or have previously been responsible for through means such as transfer to another division. They are then

expected to work to address actual management issues while experiencing various new aspects of business. The candidates to be submitted to final consideration are selected from among the individuals that have excelled at this step.
Final consideration candidates receive coaching on the mindset and thought processes necessary of the President from a professional executive coach and are expected to apply what they learn accordingly. Candidates are evaluated during the coaching process, and the results of these evaluations are reported to the Nomination Committee.
The qualities required in the President include persever- ance and passion in addition to other qualities expected of executives. Additional requirements are also defined based on the management circumstances at a given time. The final

   decision of who will become the next President is made by the Nomination Committee based on the degree to which the required qualities are possessed as well as on qualities such as flexibility and growth potential as decided based on the extent to which the candidate grew before and after receiving coaching.
Future Succession Plans
EBARA will continue efforts to create the most ideal process for selecting future Presidents going forward. At the same time, we will endeavor to construct integrated management candidate development and selection programs that begin with junior employees in order to cultivate a corporate culture that encourages competition and embraces challenge.
  Message from the Chairperson of the Nomination Committee
 The Nomination Committee selected the new President through a three-year process leading up to 2018. To deter- mine whether or not candidates fully embodied the neces- sary qualities, members of the Nomination Committee sat down to talk with candidates on several occasions. Based on these discussions, exhaustive deliberations were held among the members of the Nomination Committee before we finally chose the next President. This approach made for a transparent and impartial selection process while also ensuring that others would trust and be accepting of our selection.
In addition to the selection of the current President, 2018 also saw us draft a succession plan for systematically cultivating management candidates and selecting new Presidents every six years. The plan was enacted in 2019. I believe this plan to be cutting-edge in terms of systematic management candidate development, and I expect the benefits to be immense.
Going forward, the Nomination Committee will continue
to discuss themes as necessary to improve the effective- ness of EBARA’s corporate governance system.

Introduction of Restricted Stock Compensation Plan and Performance-Linked Stock Compensation Plan
In 2018, the Company introduced a restricted stock compensa- tion plan and a performance-linked stock compensation plan for Directors, Executive Officers, and certain employees of the Company as well as for certain directors and employees of subsidiaries. The restricted stock compensation plan is condi- tional on applicable officers and employees remaining in their position for a defined period of time. The performance-linked stock compensation plan is also conditional on the aforemen- tioned period of ongoing service, and the issuance of compen- sation under this system is predicated on the accomplishment of targets set in advance by the Board of Directors. These sys- tems are designed to serve as incentive for applicable officers and employees to pursue ongoing improvements in the corpo- rate value of the Company and better share that value with shareholders.

• Restricted stock compensation: In principle, shares of the Company’s
stock are allocated during the first year of a medium-term manage- ment plan with a defined transfer restriction period coinciding with the period of the medium-term management plan.
• Performance-linked stock compensation: Common shares of the Com- pany’s stock are allocated to applicable officers and employees in amounts calculated based on their rank at the end of a performance evaluation period, which is set to coincide with the period of the current medium-term management plan, and in correspondence with the rate of accomplishment of targets set in advance for given performance indicators upon the conclusion of the period.

The Audit Committee is responsible for conducting audits to assess whether or not Directors, Executive Officers, and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are in compli- ance with legal obligations and internal regulations. In addi- tion, the Audit Committee endeavors to monitor Executive Officers and verify whether they execute their duties in a sound, fair, appropriate, and efficient manner in accordance with basic policies for management and medium- and long- term management plans established by the Board of Directors.
Major Areas Assessed by the Audit Committee
• The Audit Committee investigates the status of operations and assets at the head office and at major operating sites and subsidiaries as described below to verify the implemen- tation and operational status of internal control systems at the Company and at Group companies.
• The Audit Committee confirms that the Independent Auditor maintains a position of independence and conducts audits appropriately. The committee also receives reports from the Independent Auditor on a regular and as-needed basis on the status execution of its duties. Based on the results of annual evaluations of the suitability of the Independent Audi- tor for reappointment as well as of the eligibility, indepen- dence, and overall capabilities of the Independent Auditor, the Audit Committee decided to reappoint Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC as the Company’s Independent Auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
• In addition to the items audited every fiscal year based on annual audit plans, the Audit Committee also designates other items requiring particularly intensive audits. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, intensive audits of the following items were performed.

• Members of the Audit Committee attend meetings of the Management Meeting, the CSR Committee, the Risk Man- agement Panel, and other important meetings to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of audits. In addition, exchanges of information and opinions are held with the Internal Audit Division and with divisions responsible for
Cross-Shareholdings
In principle, the Company does not hold cross-shareholdings. However, it is possible that the Company will hold shares of other companies only in cases in which it is determined that partnerships with investees through shareholding will contrib- ute to the enhancement of the Group’s corporate value. The rationale for cross-shareholding relationships is subject to regular examination by the Board of Directors based on the following items, and shareholdings deemed by the Board of Directors to no longer be rational shall be dissolved when appropriate by disposal or other means.
Matters Confirmed in Examination of Shareholding Rationale
• Importance of partnership with investee and necessity of
continuation of relationship
• Appropriateness of returns and risks associated with the
shareholding in comparison to cost of capital

internal control and risk management on a monthly and as- needed basis in order to maintain an accurate and up-to- date understanding of relevant information. Advice is also provided to the executive team as necessary.
• Documents of important resolutions are reviewed by the Audit Committee to confirm that decisions made are appro- priate and in compliance with internal regulations.
• On-site audits are performed at domestic and overseas offices, operating sites, and subsidiaries (including observa- tions of internal audits by executive teams and audits by the Independent Auditor) to confirm that internal control systems are functioning effectively across the Group.
• Group Auditor Conferences are held twice a year and attended by auditors of subsidiaries to share information. The Audit Committee also requests business reports from subsidiaries when necessary.
In exercising voting rights attached to cross-shareholdings, the Company determines whether to vote for or against each individual agenda item after consideration of whether it con- tributes to the medium-to-long-term enhancement of the cor- porate value of the Group and investees. Discussions are held with investees on the content of agenda items as required with particular emphasis placed on the following items.
• Changes to articles of incorporation

Risk Management
Basic Approach
EBARA’s risk management divisions support the global devel- opment of Groupwide business activities by reinforcing Group governance and risk management systems to furnish frame- works for facilitating the accomplishment of business results.
Group administration regulations require that assessments be performed prior to exposure to serious risks with the poten- tial to impact Group companies or the entire Group and that reports be submitted after risks have been assumed. In
Priority Strategies and Progress
Main Risks and Countermeasures
The Risk Management Panel is one of the Company’s meeting bodies for business execution and is tasked with supporting risk-related deliberations and activities.
Compliance risks are combatted through education and monitoring by specialized corporate divisions via the Anti- Corruption Program and other measures. Countermeasures for risks associated with the reliability of financial reporting include developing, enhancing, and implementing internal control systems. Meanwhile, the Environmental Control Committee takes steps to improve the status of environmental management to counter environmental risks.
In addition, crisis response procedures have been defined, anticipated crises are assessed, and education and training programs have been implemented to ensure preparedness.
addition, shared risk management and internal control guide- lines have been established for the Group to further support Group companies in developing their risk management and internal control systems.

 Initiatives Pertaining to Priority Strategies Risk Assessment
We conduct risk management centered on the Risk Manage- ment Panel which holds regular quarterly meetings along with special meetings when necessary (seven meetings held in 2018) to implement a single-fiscal-year-basis risk manage- ment PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle. As part of EBARA’s medium-term initiatives for risk management systems, a risk assessment was performed in 2018.
The assessment compiled the projected risks into around 100 items and was carried out through surveys and interviews with the individuals responsible for relevant businesses and divisions to reassess the amount of risk exposure, probability of risk materialization, and adequacy of response measures for each item. Risks warranting Companywide responses were assigned and risk owners and other response systems were decided upon by the Risk Management Panel.
Going forward, the Company plans to conduct risk assess- ments in three-year cycles to continuously implement improvements to its risk management systems.

Employee Awareness Survey Based on Compliance Risk and Employee Satisfaction Analyses
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, an employee awareness survey was conducted with a third-party institution to ensure objectivity. This survey combined conventional com- pliance risk analysis that looks at the compliance awareness of employees and overall corporate culture with employee satis- faction analysis. We decided to integrate these analyses out of recognition of the importance of employee satisfaction and the provision of comfortable working environments on overall compliance risks.
The compliance risk analysis was focused on determining whether EBARA is a reliable company. This analysis entailed attaching quantitative scores to various compliance risks by organization and employee group and mapping the issues that surfaced.
The employee satisfaction analysis identified issues through questions designed to measure the levels of motivation among employees on an individual, organizational, and company level.

Results of Employee Awareness Survey in the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2018
The employee awareness survey was designed to track yearly changes not only in comparison to data from within the Group but also in comparison to external benchmarks and on an indi- vidual question basis. The relative positions of the Company and of Group companies were shared with management via the CSR Committee to establish an objective understanding of the circumstances within the Group. Issues were addressed through follow-up initiatives driven by coordination between compliance divisions as well as human resources divisions and various other relevant divisions.
The employee awareness survey implemented in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, indicated that there were no pressing issues on a Groupwide basis. Group companies with scores that fell below the overall average were provided with feedback and corrective measures were requested. Meanwhile, meetings with line managers and other investigations were performed at divisions in which specific issues were identified. In this manner, the head office was also involved in follow-up measures.

■ Harassment Prevention Measures
The Company is establishing compliance consultation hotlines and spreading understanding regarding these hotlines and their use in order to foster comfortable workplace environ- ments and to heighten its in-house capacity to address issues.
REFERENCE Human Rights System https://www.ebara.co.jp/en/about/csr/social/human_rights/1209153_3116.html
In Japan, whistle-blowing hotlines have been installed at Group companies, and we are transitioning to a system in which reported incidents are addressed by the site at which the issue was reported (head office, Group company). At overseas Group companies, we continue to reinforce overseas EBARA Group hotlines, which are designed to contribute to increasing transparency across Group companies, to bolster the internal whistle-blowing hotlines of these companies, and to support healthy and autonomous operation.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, 42 reports were processed through compliance consultation hotlines, relatively unchanged from 39 in the previous fiscal period. Nine of these consultations involved suspicion of harassment, while 26, or more than 60% of all consultations, were related to workplace environment or other issues with the potential to lead to com- pliance risks.

■ Implementation of Anti-Corruption Program Across the Group The Anti-Corruption Program is moving beyond its previous stage, which was primarily focused on the establishment of regulations and compliance consultation hotlines, to a stage of deploying and implementing various measures across the Group. These mea- sures will include exhaustive anti-corruption training, improve- ment of employee compliance awareness, and enhancement of management of sales agents and other third-party entities.
1. Anti-Corruption Training Based on Anti-Corruption Risks
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, anti-corruption e-learning programs were implemented in a total of 21 coun- tries in Asia and South America, where anti-corruption aware- ness is low. These programs comprehensively targeted the members of management and employees of sales and other divisions to which corruption risk awareness was most perti- nent and offered education on risks, such as those associated with interactions with government officials.

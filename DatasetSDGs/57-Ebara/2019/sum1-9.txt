Commencement of Operations for Automated Pump Assembly Line
Operation of an automated assembly line for horizontal multi-stage pumps commenced at the Fujisawa District in September 2018. The installation of this line entailed replacing the production processes from assembly to inspection with four robots. The result is a production system that requires less human labor and is able to respond flexibly to changes in demand. In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, we plan to construct a new automated submerged pump assembly line and to com- mence mass production of these pumps thereafter. Addi- tionally, the number of models handled by the existing automated horizontal multi-stage pump assembly line will be expanded from one to four. Going forward, further improvements to productivity will be pursued through fully automated assembly lines as the Group endeavors
to establish systems for supplying products that are more acutely matched to customer needs.

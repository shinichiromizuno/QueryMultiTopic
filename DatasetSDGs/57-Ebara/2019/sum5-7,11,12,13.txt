Receipt of Order for Construction of Woody Biomass Power Generation Plant
EBARA has received an order for the construction of a woody biomass power generation plant from Soyano Wood Power Co., Ltd. The woody biomass power generation plant will be fueled using previously unutilized timber pro- duced through thinning, which was often abandoned in mountain forests, as well as wood scraps left over after construction of wood structures and will boast one of Nagano Prefectureâ€™s highest generation capacities of 14,500 kW. Going forward, EBARA will seek to construct high-quality woody biomass power generation plants that capitalize on the characteristics of internally circulating fluidized-bed boilers, namely the ability to realize stable combustion using diverse fuel sources, and to deliver impeccable services related to these facilities. We can thereby help to fight global warming through spreading the use of renewable energy.

Compressors and Turbines Business
Construction of New Factory in Bangalore, India
A new factory was constructed in February 2019 at a ser- vice center for large-scale compressors and steam tur- bines, established in Bangalore, India in 2015, with the goal of bolstering production of small and medium-sized steam turbines and enhancing after-sales services.
Small and medium-sized steam turbines are used as drivers and for power generation applications in a wide range of industries, including the petrochemical, food, general chemical, and biomass power industries. The new factory in India has made it possible to respond swiftly to the growing demand for these turbines in India and in East Asia.
Moreover, the facility is equipped with design, sales, and service divisions as well as a training center to be uti- lized in enhancing after-sales services in response to the diversification of energy supply systems and the growth of energy demand.

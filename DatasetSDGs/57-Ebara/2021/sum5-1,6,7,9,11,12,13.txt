We will utilize our technologies to passionately support the creation of a sustainable, environmentally friendly world with ample food and water, and safe and reliable social infrastructure.

Economic and social development will accelerate in line with population growth, espe- cially in developing countries, which will increase CO2 emissions and environmental impact at the global level and exacerbate climate change.

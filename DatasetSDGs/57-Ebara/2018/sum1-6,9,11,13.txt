Delivery of High-Efficiency Pumps to Water Purification Plants in Vietnam Provision of Social and Economic Value
The Fluid Machinery & Systems Business is a business that installs social infrastructure to provide stable supplies of water while helping prevent climate change.
We recently took part in a project that was primarily aimed at replacing existing pumps in water purification plants with higher efficiency models. This project was the first inter-city cooperation project conducted with Da Nang, Vietnam through Yokohama City’s Y-PORT (Yoko- hama Partnership of Resource and Technologies) Proj- ect.*1 In addition, this project was approved for receiving facility assistance in the FY2017 Joint Crediting Mecha- nism (JCM) financial support project operated by the Ministry of the Environment.*2 The pumps delivered through this project are expected to contribute to annual reductions in electricity consumption of 2 million kWh, which will equate to a reduction of 1,145 tons of CO2.

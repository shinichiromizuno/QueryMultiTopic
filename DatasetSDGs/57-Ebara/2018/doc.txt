 INTRODUCTION
EBARA Way
Creation of New Value
by Acting Based on the “EBARA Way”
The EBARA Group’s beginnings were in answer to the calls of society, and we have continued to provide value to society through our business in addition to fulfilling our social responsibilities. In conjunction
with the 100th anniversary of the Company’s founding in 2012, we reflected on the type of company
we are and want to be and reorganized those fundamental values and ethics into the
EBARA Group Business Ethics Framework, to support our ethical operation over the next 100 years.
As part of this undertaking, we redefined the Group’s founding spirit, corporate philosophy,
and CSR Policy as the “EBARA Way,” the transcendental value shared across the EBARA Group.
By acting based on the “EBARA Way,” the EBARA Group will create new value.
Editorial Policy
The EBARA Group has issued this integrated report to provide stakeholders with financial and non-financial information about its medium-to-long-term value creation activities. We have created the report with reference to the International Integrated Reporting Council’s International Integrated Reporting Framework; the Guidance for Integrated Corporate Disclosure and Company-Investor Dialogues for Collaborative Value Creation: ESG Integration, Non-Financial Information Disclosure, and Intangible Assets into Investment (Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation) released by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; and the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative. The relationship between information in this report and the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation is described in the table of contents.

EBARA CORPORATION conducted a consolidation of common shares at a rate of one share for every five shares with an effective date of October 1, 2016.
When the annual dividend of ¥36.00 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (including an interim dividend of ¥6.00) is converted after the consolidation of shares, it is equivalent to ¥60.00 per share, consisting of an interim dividend of ¥30.00 and a year-end dividend of ¥30.00. Accordingly, the dividend payout ratio is calculated based on an annual dividend of ¥60.00 per share.
Profit (loss) attributable to owners of parent per share is based on the average number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) during the fiscal year. Total net assets per share is calculated using the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) as of the end of the fiscal years.

 POINT
The Company has positioned return on invested capital (ROIC) as its most impor- tant key management indicator and has set the target of achieving ROIC of 8% or more in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. This target will be pursued by achiev- ing a debt/equity ratio of 0.40 times–0.60 times and return on equity (ROE) of 11.0%–13.0%.
POINT
Operating income levels have been down in recent years due to the persistence of sluggish conditions in the oil and gas market. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, operating income was significantly lower than it would have been in a full year. A recovery trend has emerged in the oil and gas market, and we therefore intend to continue working toward the target of 9.0% or more for the operating income to sales ratio set in E-Plan 2019 through the steady advancement of profit- ability improvement measures in all of our businesses.
POINT
Capital expenditures were up in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, due to the investments in augmenting the facilities of the Kumamoto Plant. We intend to con- tinue aggressively investing in growth throughout the period of E-Plan 2019.
POINT
EBARA has been issuing consistent divi- dends over the past several years sup- ported by improvements in its financial position. During the period of E-Plan 2019, we will target a total payout ratio of 30% or more to account for both dividends and share buybacks.
Note: EBARA CORPORATION conducted a consolidation of common shares at a rate of one share for every five shares with an effective date of October 1, 2016. Figures for dividends per share have been adjusted based on the assumption that this consoli- dation was conducted on April 1, 2007. Consoli- dated profit attributable to owners of parent in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, resulted from a change in settlement date, was lower than it would have been in a full year. Accordingly, the consolidated total payout ratio rose for this period. Consolidated dividend payout ratio figures for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and prior are figures for the consolidated total payout ratio.

INTRODUCTION
Performance Highlights
The number of employees at overseas Group companies is rising with the increases in the overseas sales ratio. Seek- ing to promote the optimal positioning of employees and efficient business operation on a global scale, the EBARA Group is pro- moting global-level personnel mobility, making it possible for employees to trans- fer from domestic companies to overseas companies, from overseas companies to domestic companies, and between over- seas companies.
POINT
One of the EBARA Group’s FY2020 Environ- mental Targets calls for ongoing reductions in CO2 emissions. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, CO2 emissions increased by 4.7% compared to the prior fiscal year, due to the commencement of operation at the new building of the Kuma- moto Plant. We will reduce CO2 emissions leading up to 2020 through the continued application of insulating paint coatings and upgrades to more energy-efficient lighting, boilers, and other equipment.
Note: The base year for emissions targets is the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001. The Company uses the emissions coefficient of 0.357 kg/kWh prescribed in the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures in 2000.
POINT
The EBARA Group’s FY2020 Environmental Targets stipulate that the Group is to maintain a material recycling rate of more than 95% and a landfill disposal rate of less than 3%. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, these targets were achieved with a material recycling rate of 98.0% and a landfill disposal rate of 1.6%. Moving forward, we will work to ensure that waste is properly sepa- rated while reducing packaging materials and implementing other initiatives for increasing the material recycling rate and reducing the landfill disposal rate.
Note: In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, unrecyclable sludge was produced as a result of construction .
POINT
The FY2020 Environmental Targets contain a target to reduce water usage by 30% from the level of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, a reduc- tion of 15.1% was achieved in comparison to this level. Water consumption reduction initiatives include reusing pump test water, reducing and reusing the water emitted from manufacturing equipment that uses pure water, and reusing water for cooling electric furnaces.

  EBARA Group is committed to “unlimited challenge toward growth”, with the aim of becoming a manufacturer of industrial machinery that grows and develops its business on a global basis.
Toichi Maeda
President and Representative Executive Officer
Words of Inspiration
—Courage Precedes Confidence
I base my stance toward management on compliance and risk management. I accept no compromise with regard to these two elements of operations, and I see my mission as growing the EBARA Group by developing structures and a corporate constitution that will enable the Group to gener- ate consistent earnings on a foundation forged of these elements. The Management Policy announced in Novem- ber 2015 lays out our vision for the EBARA Group by the mid-2020s and indicates directives for our business aimed at accomplishing that vision. Unfortunately, the previous medium-term management plan, covering the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 to 2017, the period immediately after the start of the management policy, ended with a failure to achieve its targets. This failure was a result of the overem- phasis of traditional ways of thinking and the work pro- cesses we have developed over our history of more than a century. While it is certainly important to cherish such tra- ditions, developing and growing our business on a global scale as a manufacturer of industrial machinery requires that we implement structural reforms in tune with the times and our growth stage. This realization is only made stron- ger by the fact that society is currently characterized by volatile changes in the operating environment. As we advance such reforms in the company, I draw strength from the words of Eizaburo Nishibori*—“Courage precedes confidence.” When one faces a new challenge, something they have never experienced before, they will evaluate the difficulty of that challenge and formulate plans for over- coming it. However, even the best laid plans cannot account for all risks, and there is no shortage of cases of individuals failing to take their first step due to being over- whelmed with concern. No one knows the outcome of such undertakings. That is why it is important to have the courage to take the first step, without which nothing can be accomplished. “Courage is the drive to do something.” These words are a constant source of inspiration for me. These words, of course, also encapsulate the courage to stop when preparations are clearly insufficient or to com- pletely pull out of an endeavor.
From the time I assumed the position of president up until last year, I have led the Company in various measures aimed at transforming the organization. For example, we sought to cultivate a sense of global and Groupwide unity based on the “EBARA Way” and established and reinforced frameworks for naturally incorporating compliance and risk management into our operations. We also implemented work style reforms as part of our efforts to promote diver- sity and introduced new human resources systems for fairly evaluating employees based on their roles and results.
Today, even local overseas hires speak of the concept of “passion and dedication,” and the results of these reforms
are gradually appearing, as seen by EBARA being recog-
nized as a leader in promoting diversity. Going forward,
I will continue to entrench compliance and risk management
within the Group as we pursue ongoing improvements to
company frameworks in order to ensure we always act with
high ethical standards.

Smooth Progress of Medium-Term Management Plan in Irregular First Year
In 2017, we instituted a change to the fiscal year of EBARA CORPORATION and its consolidated subsidiaries, transi- tioning from a March 31 fiscal year-end to a December 31 year-end. This move was meant to allow for more appro- priate and timely disclosure of performance and other management information in the midst of the globalization of our business. For this reason, the period under review covers an irregular period beginning with April 1, 2017, and ending with December 31, 2017. In the period under review, we continued to enjoy favorable operating conditions in the United States and economic recovery was seen in Asia. In Japan, strong public-sector investment was brisk while private-sector capital investment picked up, contributing to an overall modest recovery trend.
The current medium-term management plan, E-Plan 2019, commenced in 2017 against this backdrop. In the
first period of this plan, we made smooth progress in almost all structural reform and growth measures in our various businesses, and the results have begun to appear. As for performance, net sales in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, amounted to ¥381,993 million, an increase of 9.1% in comparison to the same irregular period of the previous year; operating income was ¥18,115 million, up 58.0%; ordinary income was ¥16,529 million, 73.8% higher; and profit attributable to owners of parent was ¥9,531 million, an increase of 29.9%. Return on invested capital (ROIC), a key Groupwide management indicator, was 2.5%, while the consolidated operating income to
sales ratio came to 4.7%. Due to the irregular nature of this period, income was lower than it would have been in a reg- ular year, leading to declines in ROIC and the consolidated operating income to sales ratio. Nonetheless, performance was almost exactly as projected.
Performance was particularly strong in the Precision Machinery Business, which benefited from robust capital investment in the semiconductor industry. In the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, meanwhile, operating income fell below our initial forecasts because of the per- sistence of a bearish oil and gas market. We are currently in a phase of conducting upfront growth investments in factory automation and other measures. Improvements

in earnings capacity will therefore not be seen until a little later.
In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, we are projecting higher orders, lower net sales, and relatively unchanged operating income. Profit attributable to owners of parent, however, will be impacted by expenses associ- ated with the reorganization of overseas operations. In businesses where improvements to profitability are proving slow, we will supplement the measures described in E-Plan 2019 with additional measures, such as reorganizing pro- duction systems or more optimally allocating personnel, to thoroughly boost profitability. In addition, we will seek to increase capital efficiency by improving working capital turnover rates and rigorously managing our balance sheet. In this manner, we will pursue our management target of ROIC of 8.0% or more through both business and capital measures (see pages 17 to 22 for more details).
Ongoing Growth-Oriented Reforms While Maintaining EBARA’s Distinctive Value
The EBARA Group’s history began with pumps. From this starting point, we have continued to hone our technologies based on our founding spirit of passion and dedication, building trust while steadily expanding the scope of our operations. Today, we are developing three very different businesses: the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business, the Environmental Plants Business, and the Precision Machin- ery Business. The Precision Machinery Business, for exam- ple, is characterized by an incredibly short capital investment cycle among customers, and it thus serves an industry in which new solutions are required on timetables measured in days, and sometimes even hours. For this reason, this business employs a simple structure, creating an environment that is conducive to action by frontline operations and facilitating swift decisions to ensure flexible responses to changes. The Precision Machinery Business also requires specialized skills. We therefore proactively appoint individuals from outside of the Group and foster a culture that draws strength from diversity in this business. In the pumps business and other businesses, meanwhile, human resources are cultivated in-house and we advance projects on timetables measured in months or years. Still, I do recognize that there is significant room for further evo- lution in the Group as it is possible that, for instance, a sim- pler structure in the pumps business might allow it to exercise greater speed, evolving it into a more efficient and profitable business.
I also believe that our business domain will continue to expand as we seek to help resolve social issues and address customer needs. We will therefore continue to seek out new means of creating social and environmental value together with our customers in today’s information society, characterized by the ever-faster development of Internet of
Things and artificial intelligence technologies. In this undertaking, we will maintain our focus on the interests of the public, namely supporting social infrastructure that is resilient to the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.
Another focus of our initiatives will be finding ways to create value that is distinctly EBARA for our future society. Data and reports indicate that if we continue to consume resources and energy at the current pace, the sustainability of not only companies but also the earth itself could be in danger. We hope to help society reach a sustainable future and avoid this tragic outcome. To this end, we will form a vision for the EBARA Group going forward and advance management with a clear view of how we can create value and keep an eye on the issues and needs that may emerge from 2020 and beyond. The issues identified in the Paris Agreement and in the United Nations Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) will be key to the growth strategies of EBARA, as our corporate philosophy states our areas of business as water, air, and the environment. 2020 is just a stone’s throw away and it is crucial that we formulate con- crete management policies for the decade ahead based on these issues and quickly communicate these policies inside and outside of the Company.
Creation of Social and Environmental Value While Achieving Growth for the EBARA Group
As the first step in formulating long-term management policies, we defined material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues for the EBARA Group in 2017. These issues were identified to guide us in boosting com- petitiveness by establishing targets from an ESG perspective and implementing a plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle to measure progress toward these targets.
Since its founding, the EBARA Group has proceeded to address social and environmental issues, growing by pro- viding products and services that resolve those issues. The Group’s products continue to help create and improve social value through partnerships with national and local governments and companies from a wide range of indus- tries. The specific values of these products include their ability to contribute to stable supplies of water, river man- agement, comfortable air-conditioning control, waste dis- posal and other hygiene areas, and the development of the information society. The ongoing provision of products and services that realize the social value sought by customers in turn drives the improvement of the EBARA Group’s corpo- rate value. This situation is congruent with the EBARA Group CSR Policy, which states “The EBARA Group takes pride in our role supporting society, industry, and life.” It is through such support that we provide value for society. Delivering even greater value will require that we help combat climate change by limiting society’s energy
consumption in the midst of rising energy demand stimu- lated by global population growth and economic develop- ment. It is therefore crucial that we reduce the energy required to operate our products to contribute to lower electricity consumption and subsequently CO2 emissions by customers. In addition, we must make our products smaller and lighter in order to conserve metals and other resources. Meanwhile, it will be important to enhance our service and support (S&S) operations to, for example, pre- vent water shortages resulted from the ceased operation of pumps or to ensure that river drainage pumps are able to function as required during heavy rains to protect commu- nities from flooding. Other areas in which EBARA products contribute to society include waste processing plants, which help maintain community hygiene through reliable and continuous operation while using electricity generated from waste combustion processes to power communities. Likewise, the reliable operation of semiconductor manu- facturing equipment can support the development of a comfortable and convenient information society in which everyone has equal access to information. In this manner, we can contribute to society while creating financial value for EBARA by ensuring the reliable and resilient operation of various types of social and industrial infrastructure.
The EBARA Group’s Move to the Next Growth Stage
We have recently been seeing a rise in the
expectations of international society with
regard to CSR activities. The EBARA
Group is a signatory to the United Nations
Global Compact, endorsing its Ten Princi-
ples, and has improved upon its CSR
management practices by exercising these principles. I am convinced that realizing our corporate philosophy will contribute to sustainable development of both society and industries. Looking ahead, I plan to emphasize in manage- ment an approach of creating social and environmental value while improving corporate value.
To elaborate on this approach, I would like to discuss a region with which EBARA has a relationship that dates back more than 70 years. This relationship began after the end of World War II. Suffering from a severe lack of supplies in the post-war turmoil, this region was struck by a massive earthquake that sank foundations and flooded cities. We supplied this region with pumps from our inventory to drain water from the flooded cities, resulting in the start of a years-long relationship built on trust and faith in our prod- ucts. This relationship is an example of EBARA products contributing to the realization of a sustainable community. To cite a more recent example, EBARA drainage pumps were employed in a project for protecting citizens and cities in an area where heavy rainfall often leads to flood- ing. The completion of this project has enabled residents of
this area to live in peace. Moreover, by successfully elimi- nating floods, this area has been able to attract more com- panies, creating employment and invigorating the local economy. These examples represent forms of social and environmental value that can only be provided through the EBARA Group’s unique businesses.
We have been creating such value for more than a cen- tury. Today, we are able to more concisely communicate the corporate value of the EBARA Group by using the lingua franca of ESG and the SDGs. By defining our value
in this manner and fulfilling our management promises by achieving our targets, I hope to make our various stake- holders recognize the meaningfulness of the EBARA Group to international society. Our first step toward gaining this recognition will be to share our targets with stakeholders and then create results through the diligent growth process leading to the accomplishment of these targets. Enhancing information disclosure activities, of which this integrated report is one, will be part of our approach toward this task. By fully integrating the CSR reports we have published up until last year into this report, we seek to provide informa- tion that paints a picture of our path to growth, the risks we face, and other aspects of the EBARA Group. Through this open disclosure, we hope to engage in deeper communi- cation with our valued stakeholders and to live up to their expectations.
I am committed to leading EBARA in implementing reforms to an extent that shocks onlookers. Courage pre- cedes confidence. Going forward, we will be exhaustive in our efforts to prepare and lay foundations as we exercise courage in advancing reforms to take the EBARA Group to the next growth stage.
I hope we can look forward to the ongoing support and understanding of our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders as we advance on this path.

Improvement of Overall Earnings Capacity
Return on invested capital (ROIC) has been positioned as the most important key management indicator under the E-Plan 2019 medium-term management plan. It is our goal to increase ROIC to above 8.0% by the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the final year of the plan. Raising the profitability of all businesses will be crucial to accomplish- ing this target, and we have set targets for the operating income to sales ratio by business based on this recognition.
Since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, we have sus- tained consolidated operating income growth of between 5% and 7%, which has translated to year-on-year increases of between ¥23.0 billion and ¥38.0 billion. Looking at indi- vidual businesses, although the Environmental Plants Busi- ness and Precision Machinery Business had suffered from inconsistent profits prior to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, these businesses have been reliably generating profits since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. As a result, the operating income to sales ratio rose above 8% in the
GRAPH 1 Operating Income to Sales Ratio (Consolidated)
Environmental Plants Business and exceeded 12% in the Precision Machinery Business during the period of the E-Plan 2016 medium-term management plan, both repre- senting massive improvements. Meanwhile, our mainstay Fluid Machinery & Systems Business has seen its operating income to sales ratio gradually decline after peaking at 8% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. This trend has been due in part to the curtailment of capital investment by cus- tomers in light of poor crude oil prices. In the irregular nine- month period ended December 31, 2017, the operating income to sales ratio was below 1% GRAPH 1 . Boosting the earnings capacity of the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business is therefore a pressing task, as indicated in E-Plan 2019.
An important element of our efforts to boost this busi- ness’ earnings capacity will be expanding service and sup- port (S&S) operations, which are generally higher-margin, in the custom pumps business. If we steadily implement mea- sures for improving performance on an individual base level in conjunction with the enhancement of our base network
currently underway, we should see increases in earnings capacity. At the same time, we will heighten earnings capacity in the compressors and turbines business by coordinating efforts between companies on a country and regional basis in our existing product and S&S operations, effectively treating the world as a single market.
In the Environmental Plants Business, we have recently been concentrating management resources on domestic operations. We therefore anticipate that this business will generate stable cash flows over the foreseeable future while maintaining minimal risk exposure. The Precision Machinery Business, meanwhile, is benefiting from robust demand for semiconductors, and we are augmenting our facilities and building new fully automated plants in this business accordingly. Fully automated plants can operate round-the-clock by automating processing and assembly procedures. Some of these plants are scheduled to go onstream in 2019, making for a robust production system capable of responding to demand fluctuations without depending on human labor. The advent of fully automated plants will reinforce the operating foundations of the Preci- sion Machinery Business. Additionally, we are in the midst of developing a product that will become the third pillar for the business, thereby achieving an even stronger and more stable operation.
Heightening of Asset Efficiency
The business portfolio of the EBARA Group has trans- formed over the past 10 years; since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, we have withdrawn from fuel cell, wind power, and overseas waste incineration plant businesses while also shifting our focus away from water treatment plant businesses.
In addition, we merged domestic subsidiaries in the
GRAPH 2 Working Capital (Consolidated)
pumps business while reorganizing factories, service, and sales divisions and otherwise reformed business structures centered on Japan, essentially completing the reconstruc- tion of our business portfolio as well as the establishment and reorganization of sales and service bases. However, we recognize that we must carefully but aggressively continue to conduct capital investments and M&A activities aimed
at growth.
Efforts to improve funding efficiency included introduc-
ing cash management systems*1 at principal domestic sub- sidiaries prior to 2016, a move that decreased funding requirements by more than ¥10.0 billion. We are currently moving ahead with the introduction of similar systems at overseas subsidiaries. These cash management systems have enabled us to effectively track 85% of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents.
We are also focused on shortening the turnover period for receivables. Certain businesses have turnover periods of more than 210 days. The first step will thus be to ensure that delivery dates are met and then to improve payment conditions based on payment histories. At the same time, we will reform production management systems, standard- ize components, and practice more rigorous supply chain management to downsize inventories GRAPH 2 .
Currently, the EBARA Group requires on-hand cash equivalent to two months’ worth of sales. If annual net sales are around ¥500.0 billion, we will need on-hand cash of about ¥80.0 billion. As of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents amounted to ¥139.1 billion, more than two months’ worth of sales. However, this amount included funds earmarked for the construction of fully automated plants and other investments. The reduction of receivable turnover periods and the resulting improvement in asset efficiency is expected to generate additional cash in the

range of a few hundred billion. We will therefore be finan- cially capable of conducting investments of a significant scale, even if we step up investments going forward.
Ongoing Reinforcement of the EBARA Group’s Financial Base
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, debt/equity ratio dropped below 1.00 times and the equity ratio exceeded 30.0%. The respective downward and upward trends of these ratios have continued since, with the debt/equity ratio standing at 0.41 times and the equity ratio climbing to 45.3% on December 31, 2017. Once again, cash and cash equivalents amounted to ¥139.1 billion on this date, making for net cash when deducting interest-bearing debt of ¥114.5 billion. This strong financial base has enabled EBARA to maintain a single A rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc., since 2002. In the past, interest-bearing debt in excess of ¥200.0 billion has resulted in our rating dropping to BBB-. Our current rating thus stands as proof that our financial base has steadily improved since 2010.
The reason behind this improvement is the business selection and concentration efforts I described previously. By concentrating management resources on high-margin businesses, we have been able to avoid investments that lack efficiency and to downsize underperforming busi- nesses, which has been instrumental in this improvement. Our financial strategies going forward will target an equity ratio of 45.0% and a debt/equity ratio of between 0.40 times and 0.60 times. Meanwhile, around ¥120.0 billion of our ¥600.0 billion worth of total assets is attributable to fixed assets, excluding investments and other assets, not a particularly high level for a manufacturer. We are working to cut back on unnecessary assets. However, it is possible that we will need to increase, rather than decrease, fixed
GRAPH 3 Financial Position (Consolidated)
assets going forward in order to achieve future growth. Funds for conducting M&A activities will be secured in part by setting aside surplus fund procurement capabilities to use as needed on such occasions. We will also examine various other funding schemes based on the scale and risks of given investments and our financial position at the time of investment GRAPH 3 .
Cash Flow Allocation Focused on Growth Investments
Moving forward, we will prioritize the allocation of operat- ing cash flows to growth investments while also dedicating some of this cash to shareholder returns and debt repay- ment. Free cash flow allocation will also prioritize growth investments, which may cause free cash flow to drop, tem- porarily, into the negative. Ordinary capital investments will, in principle, be contained within the scope of depreciation and amortization. Conversely, growth investments will be carefully considered but boldly executed. Regardless, we currently have no intention of delaying growth investments or suddenly curtailing shareholder returns, even if operating cash flows decline to a greater degree than expected. Should the reverse—a substantial increase in cash flows— occur, we will look first at growth investments. If no prom- ising investment candidates are found, the additional cash will be diverted to shareholder returns and then to the repayment of interest-bearing debt.
In the past, investment decisions have been based on projected investment recovery periods. Now, we make decisions by calculating an internal rate of return*2 and judging investments based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC).*3 The basis for future investment decisions will thus be whether or not they will generate returns that exceed capital costs. In addition, we will establish
country- and business-specific hurdle rates based on the estimated WACC for each country and business out of rec- ognition that the levels of risks and volatility vary based on country, region, and business characteristics.
As for shareholder returns, we will target a consolidated total payout ratio of 30% or more based on our goal of returning one-third of profit attributable to owners of parent to shareholders. We hope to ensure dividends are as continuous and consistent as possible while considering performance in a given fiscal year, our financial position, and performance forecasts. In the past, there was a period during which we could not issue dividends. Luckily, perfor- mance recovery has seen driven improvements to our financial base, and we were therefore able to adopt a policy of targeting a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 25% and issuing shareholder returns linked to performance beginning in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Our divi- dend policy was changed to target a consolidated total payout ratio of 30% or more in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, and we instituted a framework for conducting shareholder returns based on performance while also considering the possibility of shareholder buy- backs GRAPH 4 .
In this manner, we have changed our policy from focus- ing on consistent dividends to linking dividends to perfor- mance. Based on this policy, we will work to maximize shareholder value while striking a balance between growth investments and shareholder returns going forward.
Ideal Finances for Supporting the EBARA Group’s Growth
If we are to realize further improvements in the corporate value of the EBARA Group, we must exercise an increased awareness of capital costs. Based on this awareness,
GRAPH 4 Shareholder Returns
Dividends per share (left scale) Consolidated total payout ratio (right scale)
EBARA’s financial divisions will need to hone their strengths in terms of both accounting and finance functions and business management. The Group will be conducting more M&A activities going forward, and due diligence, post- merger integration,*4 and other specialized skills and insight will be all the more important as a result. I therefore want us to prepare codified training programs for accounting and finance staff and provide a wider range of opportuni- ties for such individuals to take part in M&A activities and other aspects of actual operations. I anticipate that such training and opportunities will help these individuals acquire the necessary skills and insight.
Previously, our management approach has mainly placed emphasis on profits and losses, but we plan to focus more on corporate value and capital costs going forward. For example, we designated operating receivables and inventory turnover periods as key performance indicators in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The goal of this move was to encourage frontline organizations to hold more respon- sibility for managing balance sheets. In addition, we have been convening meetings of the Overdue Debt Reduction Committee, which includes representatives from business and finance divisions, once every three months to confirm, analyze, and formulate measures for addressing debt col- lection delays from sales, production, procurement, and various other perspectives. Looking ahead, we will continue to revise our management practices while heightening awareness for capital efficiency across the Group in order to maximize corporate and shareholder value.

 EBARA GROUP’S VALUE CREATION PROCESS
Materiality
The EBARA Group’s Views on Materiality
To guide the EBARA Group in its quest to continue growing with society and improving corporate value, we have identified eight environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues material to our sustainable development and determined six action policies for ini- tiatives pertaining to these issues. In addition, we have defined an approach toward addressing these issues and set key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and confirm the progress of these poli- cies. Initiatives pertaining to these issues will be revised based on their progress as we endeavor to increase corporate value.
Process for Identifying Material ESG Issues
The EBARA Group has taken steps to clarify how it will create value for the environment and society through its business and the explicit and implicit risks present in its business activities. We decided to identify ESG issues material to our business in order to shape initia- tives addressing value creation and risk concerns that are of particu- lar importance. We identified these issues through the four-step process indicated below, with input from the CSR Committee.*
* Please refer to page 67 for more information on the CSR Committee.
STEP 1: Selection of candidate material ESG issues
More than 100 candidate issues were selected while considering ESG issues that represent growth opportunities or risks for the EBARA Group based on its business goals and values. In this process, we referenced a range of global guidelines, such as the standards put forth by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, as well as ISO 26000, the SDGs, and others.
STEP 2: Identification of eight material ESG issues
We then looked at each candidate issue identified in Step 1 and evaluated the relative level of importance to stakeholders, using the evaluation criteria of several external rating institutions as a reference point, and their degree of relevance to EBARA’s business. We thus identified eight material ESG issues with very high importance to stakeholders that are also highly relevant to
our businesses.
STEP 3: Establishment of material ESG issues, action policies, and KPIs
Six action policies were established to guide comprehensive Companywide efforts to address the eight identified material issues along with targets and KPIs* to confirm our progress in implementing these policies.
* Please refer to pages 29 and 30 for more information on KPIs.
STEP 4: Verification of material ESG issues, action policies, and KPIs
When identifying the material ESG issues, these issues were discussed at sev- eral CSR Committee meetings while incorporating the opinions of outside directors and external experts. As the final step in the identification process, the Board of Directors verified the appropriateness of the material ESG issues, action policies, and KPIs.

     Economic growth in developing countries is spurring increases in the construction of houses, commercial facilities, and office buildings. It can therefore be expected that demand for pumps and chillers will rise as these items are necessary for ensuring stable supplies of water and energy and creating comfortable spaces. The Fluid Machinery & Systems Business will seek to make these items more compact and energy efficient in order to help reduce CO2 emissions.
It is anticipated that national energy policies will call for increased usage of renewable energy going forward. The Environmental Plants Business will strive to expand adoption of waste incineration and biomass power generation systems against this backdrop.
The global development of the information society will contribute to higher demand for semiconductors. The Precision Machinery Business will endeavor to meet this demand by making its semiconductor manufacturing equipment smaller and more energy efficient.

The Environmental Plants Business will help maintain city hygiene and extend the lifespans of final disposal sites by operating and man- aging greater numbers of waste treatment facilities with its high technological prowess.
The Precision Machinery Business aims to contribute to stable supplies of semiconduc- tors through support for the smooth opera- tion of customer businesses achieved by performing disassembly, repair, and reassem- bly of large numbers of semiconductor man- ufacturing equipment over a short period.
KPIs for monitoring of CSR activities pertaining to suppliers
EBARA recognizes that its suppliers are important partners in the value creation process. For this reason, we request that suppliers adhere to the CSR Procurement Guidelines, which contain stipulations related to compliance, respect for human rights, occupational health and safety, and environmental preservation. We will also administer CSR procurement surveys to suppliers to raise awareness regarding the CSR Procurement Guidelines.

In order to address the material ESG issues, initiatives aimed at accomplishing KPI targets will be advanced by businesses and Company divisions and the progress of these initiatives will be reported to the CSR Committee. Based on these reports, we will periodically revise the action policies and KPIs and reflect these revisions in business activities in order to ensure the effectiveness of our initiatives. Going forward, we will continue to enact this cycle with ongoing initiatives for addressing ESG issues material to our business.
  KPIs for managing measurements of Groupwide energy and resource consumption
Minimizing the environmental impact of business activities is an important social responsibility for companies. The EBARA Group guarantees Groupwide and global compliance with all environmental regulations and seeks to reduce the environmental impact of its manufacturing pro- cesses. We will advance a concerted effort to improve productivity and reduce the environmental impact of our production activities by replac- ing production equipment with equipment boasting higher energy efficiency and constructing fully automated plants.

 EBARA GROUP’S VALUE CREATION PROCESS
Relationship between Action Policies and the SDGs
Verification of Level of Relevance between Business Activities and the 17 SDGs and Their 169 Targets
During the process of identifying the candidate material ESG issues, we referenced the United Nations SDGs, a set of shared global targets. We were therefore able to discuss just how the EBARA Group’s business will contribute to the accomplishment of the SDGs during the identification process. After establishing the six action policies for guiding initiatives to comprehensively address our material ESG issues, we then examined and judged the degree to which these policies were relevant to the 17 SDGs and their 169 targets.

Senior Managing Executive Officer,
Responsible for Technologies, R&D, and Intellectual Property
    The BRDIP strategy—which places a strong focus on coordi- nating businesses, research and development, and intellectual properties—reemphasizes that research and development and intellectual property operations are for businesses. By dovetail- ing research and development and intellectual property activities with business operations, we aim to maximize development investment efficiency and heighten product competitiveness, while striving to trigger new advances by integrating the Fluid Machinery & Systems, Environmental Plants, and Precision Machinery businesses.
In regard to research and development, each business seg- ment is responsible for product development while corporate divisions are responsible for research on core and fundamental technologies through the frameworks provided by EOI and EOL. Also, EIX activities target the creation of new businesses
Competitive Advantages
In research and development, EOL conducts research on upwards of 80 research themes focused on enhancing funda- mental technologies that bolster product competitiveness. Some of these themes arise from the research conducted
by EOI, in partnership with over 70 researchers at more than 30 universities.
Numerical evaluations show that the quality, volume, and contribution to business activities of our current research ven- tures have surpassed that of research in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, when we were still operating under the previ- ous R&D system. As illustrated by the graph on the following page, improvements are being seen in all relevant indicators. Research efficiency is also up. By entrenching the activities of EOI and EOL into our R&D ventures and managing them based on the defined KPIs, we can contribute to the maximization of development investment efficiency and the heightening of

In regard to intellectual properties, we will advance activities based on the pre-litigation strategy*7 and otherwise pursue the strategic acquisition of property rights in order to move beyond just securing quality patents to developing intellectual proper- ties that will underpin competitive advantages. In the reporting period, the number of patent applications submitted as a result of the pre-litigation strategy was more than six times higher*8 than in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, when this strategy was first implemented. By acquiring the intellectual property rights required in each business worldwide, we are bolstering the number of patents held in Japan and overseas.

The EBARA Group’s Research System
Shaping the Future through Engagement
in Both Research and Business
EBARA has developed a unique research system comprised of the Ebara Open Innovation (EOI) program and the Ebara Open Laboratory (EOL) through which it engages in ongoing research activities. The following pages chronicle a discussion with three representatives of EBARA’s R&D functions on the current state of this research system, which is supporting new undertakings, and their vision for the future of this system.
HIROKUNI HIYAMA × HIROSHI SOBUKAWA × AKIRA GOTO
of EBARA Research. Put simply, this program entails con- ducting joint research with universities and other external research institutions.
How did EBARA’s joint research activities begin?
Hiyama: I would like to explain the start of our joint research activities by using an example from the Precision Machinery Business. This business’ mainstay, CMP systems, must be able to perform processes that polish wafers mechanically as well as by using slurry that exerts chemical properties in order to ensure a flat surface for the semiconductor wafers that serve as substrates. Seeking to take part in CMP research projects, we proposed joint research to researchers in this field at universities across Japan. We placed particular emphasis on approaching younger researchers.
Sobukawa: It is possible for CMP slurry to corrode semi- conductor materials. To address this issue, we developed, through joint research, a technology that uses atomic force microscopes, which can measure very minute forces, to assess the electrical conditions on the surface of the wafer and gauge the possibility of corrosion. The technology has
proven to be incredibly useful to the development of CMP processes. This is just one success of our joint research. Goto: Opening up our research system made it easier to incorporate research from other fields. The number of institutions with which we conduct joint research through EOI grows with each year. Today, we are engaged in joint research on 50 themes with 56 research departments at 32 universities.
EOI is an exceptionally effective research program, but even it has its limitations. First of all, we cannot perform research pertaining to company secrets through this system. Also, if we have research conducted entirely out- side of the Company, we will not be able to cultivate new researchers within. Furthermore, there is some research that requires long-term commitments. In-house research- ers and effective research systems are crucial to continu- ously carrying out such long-term research. We therefore saw a need to develop a new research system to address these limitations.
Hiyama: This new system was the aforementioned EOL. We created EOL four years after the launch of EOI, when
  Unique Research System
What are some characteristics of EBARA’s research system?
Hiyama: EBARA’s three in-house companies oversee their respective businesses and the development of products for these businesses. Meanwhile, EOL was established in 2014 as a corporate research organization to undertake research on fundamental technologies for products. Many EOL research- ers concurrently perform duties related to the businesses of one of the three companies while also conducting their EOL research. In other words, they take part in product devel- opment in their business segment while also carrying out research on themes that relate to said development.
In the past there was a research and development style called the linear model, which EBARA utilized for its R&D activities. Under this model, all processes of the R&D pro- cess, from research on fundamental technologies, applied research, development, design, to manufacturing, com- mercialization, and sales would be handled by a single company. Today, it’s difficult to handle all those processes within one place due to the increasing complexity, speed of progress, and shortening lifespans of the products and technologies. In the United States, this situation has led to the advent of startup companies, making the utilization of such companies a crucial part of new technology develop- ment. The days of research being contained within a single research organization have come to an end.
In 2009, we closed EBARA Research Co., Ltd., as this company’s system was no longer in step with the times. Searching for a new method of research after this closure, we arrived at the EOL of today.
Sobukawa: After the closure of EBARA Research, the researchers became employees of the various business segments, and as a result the current EOL research system has a closer relationship to the business segments, a change that has had positive effects.
Goto: The greatest joy for a researcher is when their research becomes a part of society. However, if one does not step outside of the lab, they won’t know how to intro- duce their research into society. When researchers take part in product development at a business segment, they can tell how the insight gained through their research may be helpful to business. This change in perspective has proven to be most beneficial.
Examining the Reestablishment of
a Research Organization
Is it correct to assume that the closure of EBARA Research meant there was a time during which the Company did not have a research organization? Hiyama: Management, of course, did not assume that there was no need for us to have a research organization. Rather, they were examining potential means of reestablishing a research system. We kicked off EOI a year after the closure

the results of these activities were beginning to gain recog- nition within the Company. In shaping EOL, we realized that it would be important to ensure that this system was different from the prior EBARA Research system.
Internally and Externally Open Research System
How did you overcome this difficult challenge?
Hiyama: We approached this challenge by creating three over- arching frameworks. The first framework was to have research- ers come to EOL with a specific theme and to research this theme while also taking part in development activities at their business segment. This framework was aimed at facilitating researcher growth. The second framework was formed through the establishment of three research departments: the Fundamental Technologies Research Department, the Product Core Technologies Research Department, and the Advanced Analysis Department. The third framework was our mentor system. Under this system, technology and development staff at each business segment with practical and research experience become mentors to researchers of research divisions and provide them with instruction and guidance.
In developing these frameworks, we placed an even greater emphasis on creating quick results. For example, we selected priority themes from which results could be swiftly realized, devoting our efforts to these themes to drive improvements in product competitiveness. We also made a point of ensuring that EOL was a research organi- zation that was open, both to those inside of the Company and to those outside. These focuses led us to develop a framework in which in-house researchers could gather to research their given themes while collaborating with exter- nal researchers when necessary.
I hope our research organization will come to be seen as the brains behind management.
Hiroshi Sobukawa
Research Advanced Through Cross-Business Coordination
How has research changed under the new system? Sobukawa: The biggest change was the newfound sense of solidarity with each business segment. As individuals from various businesses gather together to perform research, business segments are able to tell who is researching what while research divisions can keep tabs on the development projects a given individual is engaged in at their respective business. This situation made researchers feel more
closely connected to one another. The result has been cross-business coordination and technology application.
What are some specific successes created under the new system?
Goto: In terms of open research, I would count engaging in joint research with institutions other than universities. One
example was a joint research project on vertical shaft pump vibration conducted with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. By adapting the form optimization technologies this agency developed for rocket turbo pumps for industrial applications, we were able to propose pumps with new forms that contribute to reduced vibrations.
Standard pump design processes prioritize efficiency, determining the shape and position of the turbine impellers and flow channels first and then hammering out the machinery design details. For this reason, it is difficult to rectify mechanical vibrations as the options that can be used at this late stage are few. We addressed this issue by departing from the conventional process, first prioritizing vibration stability in designs to create pumps with forms never seen before. This change in approach could not have succeeded without external insight.
Ongoing Evolution of Open Research System
Are there other new initiatives being advanced under the new system?
Hiyama: We introduced Ebara Open for Supplier (EOS), a framework for collaboration with the suppliers that support EBARA in its research activities.
Sobukawa: We are also advancing the Ebara Innovation for “X” (EIX) program. The “X” in this program’s title represents yet unseen futures for EBARA. Accordingly, this project is geared toward research and development for unlocking such new futures. Specific themes researched as part of the EIX program include production technology innovation, multilayered structure utilization (3D printers), design streamlining using ICT and artificial intelligence (AI) tech- nologies, and smart development factories for improving design efficiency.
Hiyama: “Open” is the core concept defining all aspects of our new research system. “Open” means to be both inter- nally and externally open. We therefore aim to foster an

atmosphere that is conducive to internal researchers, researchers from external research institutions, and suppli- ers gathering to engage in discussion and co-creation.
What are your plans for the future of EBARA’s research system?
Sobukawa: We are still discussing the type of research organization we will target in the future, but several ideas have begun to solidify.
Up until now, we have sought to generate visible results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our new research system. We have therefore focused on research themes that are directly linked to product competitiveness. However, there has been a push to leave such research to divisions that
are more closely associated with product development. Accordingly, our research system will be turning its atten- tion to fundamental research going forward.
The closure of EBARA Research has left us weak in some areas while other capabilities were lost completely. We will therefore need to identify these insufficiencies to recover these strengths.
We will also need to augment our marketing and research capabilities so that we will be able to engage in new research. It will be important to cultivate a proficiency at identifying technologies and changes in the operating environment that could have a large impact on existing businesses as well as moves to create new technologies. By fostering this proficiency, I hope our research organization will come to be seen as the brains behind management.
Research organizations are expected to fulfill many roles, including investigating technology trends, advancing new research projects from forward-looking perspectives, performing research for boosting fundamental technology capabilities and product competitiveness, and supporting business divisions in development activities and in com- plaint response. It will be crucial to evolve our research organization to better match the Company going forward to ensure that we can fulfill these roles while helping EBARA sustain a competitive edge and continue to grow.

 Basic Approach
EBARA is enhancing its human resource management practices to cultivate a corporate culture that encourages competition and embraces challenge. Specific measures with this regard include promoting diversity, implementing work style reforms, and facilitating career management.
We aim to implement drastic reforms that shatter pre- conceptions to place employees in the ideal positions based on their aptitudes, create organizational structures that allow for swift decisions, and enable employees to choose work styles that match their career plan or life
Promotion of Diversity and Work Style Reforms
Diversity management is crucial to enable all employees to fully exercise their talents. Accordingly, we hold training sessions for section and division managers with the aim
of raising awareness of this fact. In addition, we are proac- tively hiring women and non-Japanese fresh graduates
in order to further diversify our employee base. Work-life balance initiatives included introducing a telecommuting system in April 2017 for use by employees raising children or caring for family members and holding two seminars at Haneda headquarters and Fujisawa District on balancing the act of providing long-term care to a family member with one’s work.
Occupational Health and Safety
To enhance occupational health and safety management through the organization, EBARA has established regulatory documents such as its comprehensive occupational health and safety management regulations, which stipulate basic frameworks including regular management systems and emergency reporting routes. Enacting these regulations has enabled us to transition from management on the business site level to a clear, Companywide occupational health and safety management system headed by the Central Health and Safety Committee. Even sites with few employees are expected to construct comprehensive occupational health and safety management systems.

stage. As the first step in these reforms, we revised the human resources system pertaining to management-level employees to establish a system which balances an employ- ee’s role to their rank and took action to flatten our organi- zation in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017.

Human Resource Development—Career Manage- ment Program
The Career Management Program aims to stimulate the growth of both the Company and its employees by posi- tioning employees based on their ambitions and aptitudes. Through this program, applicable employees meet with representatives from human resource divisions, after which their desired career plans are communicated to the man- ager of their business division in order to support system- atic human resource development and help employees shape their careers through their work. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company introduced training programs tailored to different age groups that helped individuals in these groups learn the skills needed to chart their own career course. These programs provided an opportunity for employees to think about their careers, which in turn heightened their motivation.
Organizational and Human Resources System Reforms
EBARA replaced its prior seniority-based system, which placed emphasis on experience and skills, and replaced it with a system which compensates and promotes employ- ees based on their role and accomplishments in their workplace. This new system is designed to encourage talented and ambitious employees of all ages, genders, and nationalities to proactively take on more important roles and hone their skills.
Meanwhile, we took steps to improve organizational efficiency by merging redundant organizations and making them flatter, thus creating leaner, less segmented organiza- tions (reduced total number of organizations by 40%).

EBARA implemented the new role-rank human resources system this year. In developing this system, the union engaged in dozens of discussions with the Company over the course of roughly a year. Our focus was on making a system that allows anyone to reach higher job grades if they achieve results in their work. Such systems must be able to support the contributions of union members in terms of both infrastructure and atmosphere and must reward indi- viduals for their successes regardless of their age or gender.
As we rearrange work positions, it is anticipated that employees will find themselves responsible for tasks that they have not yet experienced and that are more difficult than their previous duties. We therefore requested that the Company provide various training opportunities for mindset

I Want to Help Create Workplace Environments Matched to Individuals
I have been taking part in R&D work since joining EBARA, and as such, my whole career I have been surrounded by men. Coming from a science background, however, I am used to environments where there aren’t many women, and this situation has not hindered my work. My being a woman apparently makes me more memorable among my colleagues. For this reason, I am often given the opportunity to participate in internal and external lectures as well as events for supporting female students studying sciences. I make a point of accepting these offers so that I can help promote EBARA’s technologies and raise recog- nition of the Company.
I learned of the Company’s systems pertaining to work- related ailments when I fell ill in the past. There are many

Utilization of Growth Support Systems to Realize Desired Career
After joining the Company, I was assigned to the Turbine Design Section of Elliott Ebara Turbomachinery Corpora- tion. There, I utilized design and analytical technologies
to promote improvements to existing facility designs.
The ability to make use of the analytical technologies I researched in university was a highly motivating prospect. At the same time, I was forced to admit my lack of knowl- edge, which in turn filled me with a desire to delve deeper into these technologies. More committed than ever to testing my abilities in a division where I would be able to focus primarily on analyses, I voiced this desire to a Career Management Program representative, resulting in a trans- fer to my current position.

  Basic Approach
Global climate change is advancing, and we are losing the stable global environment that underpins our lives and economies. EBARA’s Environmental Policy stipulates that we should seek to contribute to the preservation of the global environment by positioning as priority strategies the creation of eco-friendly products, minimization of
the environmental impact of our production activities, and
The EBARA Group reliably operates environmental man- agement systems at all of its production sites and takes comprehensive measures to promote strict compliance with environmental laws and to prevent environmental pol- lution. In addition, we continuously review production pro- cesses and work to reduce the environmental footprint of our business activities.
Standardization of EBARA’s Environmental Manage- ment Systems and Acquisition of Certification Under ISO 14001:2015
We have been operating our major production facilities and Haneda headquarters under ISO 14001 certification, so we took measures to update the certification at relevant sites after the release of ISO 14001:2015. These measures included revising the environmental management system procedures and standardizing work-related rules. All rele- vant sites were able to acquire 14001:2015 certification on October 11, 2017. Moreover, the standardization of our environmental management systems has enabled us to operate these systems with greater efficiency.
Tracking of Environmental Performance Data and Overhaul of IT Infrastructure
Over the two-year period spanning from April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017, we undertook a massive overhaul to the IT infrastructure used to track, manage, and aggregate the EBARA Group’s environmental performance data. Operation of the new system was commenced in April 2017. At the

same time, we began collecting and aggregating environ- mental performance data from overseas production bases with the aim of better managing and reducing the Group’s overall environmental impact over the long term. We will disclose collected data on our website starting from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
On-Site Environmental and Safety Surveys of Overseas Production Bases
EBARA began performing on-site environmental and safety surveys of overseas production bases under the control of the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, and we later commenced surveys of production bases operated by the Precision Machinery Business. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, an on-site survey on environmental and safety man- agement practices was performed at a base in Singapore that performs maintenance on dry vacuum pumps.
Sharing of Environmental Education Materials with Group Companies
EBARA has created environmental education materials designed primarily for employees engaged in environmen- tal management and environmental staff at EBARA Group companies. These materials are meant to help spread awareness about waste risks, the importance of managing chemical substances, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We share these materials with over- seas Group companies.
The EBARA Group is committed to contributing to society while achieving sustainable growth. We therefore strive to help resolve global issues through the provision of unrivaled products and services in the fields of water, air, and the environment. To accomplish these objectives, we are developing energy-saving products, conducting more rigorous environmental management with regard to our own business activities, and turning our attention to improvements in environmental performance at Group companies developing operations around the world.

 Message from Company President
Drastic Structural Reforms for Transforming the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business
As a mainstay business since our founding, the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business has led the development of the EBARA Group. The history of our business could be said to be a history of giving form to the Founding Spirit of “Netsu to Makoto” (Passion and Dedication). Throughout this history, we have proceeded to further hone our industry- leading technologies while approaching customers with passion and dedication. However, we have also found ourselves overly bound by past successes. Meanwhile, the expansion of our business has grown the vertical hierarchy of our organization, creating concern for the segmentation of our operations.
To address these issues, we have revised our human resources systems, placing particular focus on manager awareness reforms to encourage managers to maximize the skills of their subordinates and the performance of the divisions. In the standard pumps business, we have been working to improve operating efficiency through initiatives such as the consolidation of operating procedures con- ducted during the period of the previous medium-term management plan as well as the curtailing of our product lineup, which has been reduced from 70,000 items to 7,000 items. These initiatives have contributed to a noted increase in profitability.
The globalization of the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business is accelerating. When dealing in products that are intimately connected to local communities, like pumps, it is crucial to provide value that matches the culture and sensi- bilities of those communities. I therefore look to entrench a “glocal” perspective that integrates both global and
local viewpoints.
Importance of Minimization Initiatives Going Forward
We have been expanding our global base network in the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business. In the compressors and turbines business, we bolstered our S&S network cen- tered on regions in which we have already established sub- stantial delivery track records, thereby constructing systems that enable us to swiftly respond to customer requests after delivery. When looking at this business along with the
Significant Business Opportunities Presented by Demographic Trends and Energy Demand

pumps and chillers businesses, we will see that the overall growth rates of the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business has remained around the same level as the GDP growth rates of the regions it serves. However, population growth and strong energy demand in Asia and other regions hint at substantial business opportunities for the Fluid Machinery & Systems Business to capitalize on.
For example, the extension of product lifecycles presents the potential for growth in our S&S operations, an area we are currently focusing on. By minimizing product downtime resulted from malfunctions, we can support the stable operation of social and industrial infrastructure and thereby contribute to the realization of a safe, more secure, and resil- ient society. In Japan, we will grow our business opportuni- ties by offering integrated service proposals which are energy-saving, thereby creating added value and lowering the end user’s operation costs. Meanwhile, products and services that minimize energy and resource consumption will be of utmost importance to our future success in energy-conscious China and Europe. We therefore plan to move forward with research and development while also expanding our range of solutions.
Shift from Technology-Oriented to Market-Oriented Approach
It is important for us to broaden our perspective beyond products to look to the product value that they contribute in order to seek means of delivering value to society from the same perspective as customers. In light of this reality,
I believe that the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide hints to be gleaned with regard to a market-oriented approach. If the Fluid Machinery & Sys- tems Business is able to learn from trends seen around the world from a perspective framed in the SDGs and reflect
its findings in product development and marketing, I am confident that we will be able to provide even greater value to society. Our employees boast high levels of technical skill and are also ambitious and dedicated in their studies.
I hope to provide these employees with an environment that inspires them to tackle new challenges without fear
of failure.

Overview of the Environmental Plants Business
Waste production is decreasing as a result of popula- tion decline and rising recycling awareness. Mean- while, the waste treatment facilities constructed during prior periods of massive consumption are aging, and the inefficient operation of these facilities is placing pressure on the finances of local governments.
The Environmental Plants Business is tasked with supporting the efficient operation of waste treatment facilities in conjunction with changes in waste vol- umes and is also responsible for repairing and reform- ing aged facilities so that they can be operated over the long term with smaller environmental footprints. At the same time, this business transforms waste treatment facilities into regional power supplies by utilizing the heat from waste incineration to generate electricity. By providing such waste treatment facilities capable of coexisting in harmony with local commu- nities, the Environmental Plants Business helps realize cleaner and more comfortable communities.

Expansion of Scope of Services to Ensure Ongoing and Stable Earnings After Construction
The corporate philosophy of EBARA Environmental Plant Co., Ltd., the company responsible for the Environmental Plants Business, is to “contribute to the realization of a sus- tainable society through the provision of superior solid waste treatment technologies and services.” Based on this philosophy, we provide services that span from the design and construction of facilities which run safely and add value to the residents in the surrounding communities
to their safe and reliable operations.
Recently, we have seen a rise in the number of local
governments endeavoring to inform the community about their efforts to utilize heat produced during waste incin- eration processes, to recycle waste, and to contribute to the accomplishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in addition to other proactive initia- tives. These developments are directing an increasingly diverse range of expectations toward EBARA, and we are working to improve our proposal capabilities to meet these expectations.
We also plan to expand our efforts to provide value matched to the waste treatment facility lifecycle. In the past, it was common for waste treatment facilities to be disman- tled and rebuilt after 15 to 20 years. However, technological progress has recently given rise to technologies for incinera- tion furnaces that can continued to be operated over a period of more than 50 years, lengthening the timetable used for scheduling repairs and reconstruction. Also, while it was often the case in the past that an entire facility would be rebuilt when it aged, now customers are increasingly adopting maintenance approaches that allow for facilities to be used longer by replacing only the most heavily aged equipment or introducing cutting-edge equipment. We intend to uncover customer needs and expand the scope of our services so that we can incorporate such technological advancements and remain involved in the operation of facili- ties for longer periods after their construction. For example, should a local government find itself charged with the oper- ation and maintenance of a facility, we can be contracted to perform these duties on their behalf. Well versed in equip- ment and facilities, we are able to provide long-term value

through proposals that reduce running or maintenance costs or extend facility lifespans. As of December 31, 2017, we were contracted to conduct operation and maintenance of approximately 80 facilities, and we aim to raise this number to 100 in the near future. Furthermore, we can use the electricity generated using the heat produced during waste incineration to power the facility or sell said electricity to return profits to local governments. The act of recycling waste to make energy for invigorating communities is con- gruent with our mission.
Long-Term Contributions to Communities Driven by Ongoing Growth of EBARA
Raising cost awareness is a pressing task. Making long-term contributions to communities requires that EBARA also be able to achieve ongoing growth. For this reason, all employees must recognize that lowering costs and increasing earnings are fundamental to social contribu- tions. A truly beneficial technology is one that can realize both high quality and low costs. Quality is already deeply rooted in the EBARA psyche; the next step will be to entrench cost awareness.
However, if we focus too much on operation and main- tenance services promising stable profit margins, we run the risk of our facility construction capabilities diminishing. It is our facility construction capabilities that enable us to realize high-quality operation and maintenance services. Accordingly, we aim to strike a balance between facility construction and services while establishing frameworks that allow us to generate sufficient earnings through services alone.
Incorporating Internet of Things and artificial intelligence technologies is also an important task. We are therefore examining the possibility of utilizing these technologies
to develop frameworks and services for monitoring daily facility operations to prevent malfunctions and other occurrences with the potential to suddenly halt operations. Looking ahead, we hope to incorporate external insight and technologies and to engage in the development of state-of-the-art technologies through collaboration with external partners.

Waste Treatment Facility Contributing to a Low-Carbon Society and to the Lives of Community Members
  Construction of the Funabashi Hokubu Incineration Plant in Funabashi City, Chiba Prefecture was completed in April 2017, and one year has passed since it was turned over to the city. This plant is comprised of two facilities: the Funabashi Meguru Plant, a high-efficiency waste-to- energy facility, and Funabashi Meguru Spa, which will uti- lize the waste heat produced by the Funabashi Meguru Plant. A corporate group represented by EBARA Environ- mental Plant has been contracted to construct the facility and provide operation and maintenance management services over a 15-year period after its construction.
The Funabashi Meguru Plant can incinerate 3,810,000 tons of household waste (approximately 300,000 people’s worth) a day and use the heat produced in this process to generate 8,800 kW of electricity (enough to power roughly 18,000 homes), thereby contributing to society with renewable energy. This generation capacity represents a
high level of efficiency that is six times greater than that of the previous facility, and the facility itself uses approxi- mately 35% less electricity than its predecessor. Through this facility, we will contribute to the realization of a low- carbon society that uses less fossil fuel.
Funabashi Meguru Spa neighbors the Funabashi Meguru Plant and utilizes the heat produced through its high-efficiency waste-to-energy generation process in hot spring and other bathing facilities. These facilities provide a venue for health improvement and for exchanges among Funabashi citizens with around 100,000 individuals visiting each year.
In this manner, the Environmental Plants Business contributes to community-rooted waste treatment oper- ations and the realization of a recycling-oriented society through the construction and operation of waste inciner- ation plants.

Message from Company President
Commitment to Speed and Thorough Support
In the Precision Machinery Business, we see our mission as contributing to the development of advanced scientific and technology fields through the swift provision of unparal- leled products and services the semiconductor industry and other customers around the world require for their manufacturing infrastructure. It can be expected that Inter- net of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and automated driving technologies will continue to evolve going forward. Semiconductors are indispensable to these technologies, and we hope to contribute to a brighter future together with customers operating in such fields by aiding these customers.
Ongoing technological progress is the lifeblood of the semiconductor industry, and customers in this industry constantly face fierce competition at the forefront of tech- nological development. As the pace of development is swift, we are expected to make proposals with equal speed while addressing customer input. Through the process of work- ing together with our suppliers to respond to the demand- ing requirements of customers, we have honed our own capabilities and fostered a culture that prioritizes, above all else, a commitment to thoroughly supporting customers. This commitment, which gives form to our Founding Spirit of “Netsu to Makoto” (Passion and Dedication), has earned us a reputation as a reliable partner and has thus created a wider range of business opportunities for us. As the leader of the Precision Machinery Business, I will continue to communicate to employees our mission and commitments which include the newly determined materiality, KPIs, initiatives taken to achieve the targets of the KPIs, and their connection and importance to our day-to-day business. We also aim to strategically address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Based on these goals,
we will help improve the value of customers’ production lines while expanding the lineups of products we offer in the Precision Machinery Business. I anticipate that these efforts will naturally increase our industry presence and subsequently induce greater evaluations of EBARA Group’s corporate value.
Enhancement of Product Competitiveness and Business Foundations to Capture Business Opportunities
Masao Asami
President
Precision Machinery Company
Business Opportunities and Future Policies
The spread of IoT, AI, and automated driving technologies is expected to cause the scale of the semiconductor market to double from the ¥40 trillion seen in 2016 by 2030. Similarly, the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market has the potential to grow from its current scale of ¥4 trillion to ¥7 trillion. China is accountable for roughly half of semicon- ductor demand, and aggressive capital investment is being conducted in this country in response to the announcement of a government policy of realizing self-sufficiency for 70% of the semiconductors used in China by 2025. This situation presents a significant business opportunity for EBARA. Con- versely, we must be mindful of the risk of lagging technology development diminishing our competitiveness or resulting in our production capacity being insufficient for catering to demand, which could lead to a loss in our market share that would take time to recover. In securing a market share, it is crucial for us to develop products and technologies that boast high performance and that also contribute to cost reductions by using less energy or space. In addition, responding to the growing demand will require us to bolster EBARA’s production capacity while implementing initiatives across the supply chain. For example, we are stepping up overseas procurement activities to address the difficulty in securing certain components as one facet of our ongoing efforts to optimize procurement systems on a global scale.
The Precision Machinery Business has announced its goal of capturing the leading global share in the markets for its mainstay CMP systems and dry vacuum pumps. In addition, we aim to create new businesses and products with the potential to become a third pillar of operations in order to expand sales, improve profit margins, and thereby grow the earnings of the EBARA Group. We have no intention of focusing only on the robust demand seen in the present. Rather, we intend to conduct management with a view to three to five years in the future. It was for this reason that we began holding discussions among all members of the man- agement of the Precision Machinery Business, including the presidents of relevant subsidiaries, about the future of this business. Through these discussions, we will take a proactive approach toward charting our future course while identifying the issues expected to be faced by customers, markets, and society over the medium-to-long term.

Receipt of Award for “Excellent Performance” from TSMC
  The Precision Machinery Company develops cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing and peripheral equipment and supplies this equipment primarily to semiconductor manufacturers. We also support customers in developing new products and improving productivity, thereby helping customers achieve success in these areas.
Our contributions as a CMP system supplier have won high evaluations from world-leading semiconductor manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC), which is headquartered in Taiwan. TSMC recognized the Company with an award for “Excellent Performance” in December 2017 out of reflection of this high evaluation. From among TSMC’s more than 700 suppliers, twelve companies received awards in 2017. This marks the sixth consecutive year and the eighth time overall that EBARA has received the award.
Technologies are constantly progressing in the semi- conductor industry. Companies like TSMC that stand at the forefront of technological innovation are developing unprecedented technologies that have never been put to practical application before. One reason behind our
selection for this award was the strong, ongoing support we provide as a develop- ment partner that works closely with customers.
Semiconductors will be
instrumental to the new
technologies anticipated to
spread going forward, such
as IoT, AI, and automated
driving technologies. The Precision Machinery Company will continue to support TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers in its bid to help build a better future.

Directors to be able to discuss this matter effectively. The Audit Committee assesses the soundness of management based on information obtained from the Internal Control Department in addition to information it gathers by itself.
Environmental (E) and Social (S) Efforts
Even if the mechanism for corporate governance is func- tioning and the Company is engaged in business related
to the environment and society, it will not be able to con- tinuously operate its business in unison with contributions to the environment and society unless there is successive increase in corporate value, and in particular, improvements in financial aspects. Failure in increasing corporate value leads to unpleasant outcomes in terms of environmental and social contributions.
EBARA prides itself on its long-standing practice of activities involving contribution to the environment and society. However, it may be that each individual activity did not necessarily consider conformance with the business activities of the Company itself. An increase in business value must be in harmony with improvements in the foundations of its existence, namely, the environment and society. To put this into practice at EBARA, we looked carefully at the relationship between social and environmental issues and EBARA businesses, determined the ESG issues material to our businesses, and decided on action policies. We have also set key performance indicators (KPIs) for each action policy in order to see progress of the actions in a practical way. In addition, we are considering how we can contribute to the accomplishment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through the practice of these activities.
This report introduces the series of activities under the theme, “What kind of value can we give to society through our business?” and describes some of the results. Although these activities are still underway and are something that we cannot yet be satisfied with, I hope that steadily con- tinuing them will lead to results which will be fully recognized.
In Closing
EBARA is making efforts to change without being bound by the tradition and culture it has nurtured so far. I believe that our corporate value will faithfully reflect the changes we are making in regards to our corporate culture and improvements made in our ESG performance. I earnestly hope that through this report, readers will see how ESG factors at the Company are changing.
    The Governance System at EBARA
EBARA CORPORATION is often said to “have a strong culture and climate worthy of a company that has been
in business for over 100 years.” Although this very likely means that there are many good aspects of the Company that have been nurtured over its long history, I believe it also has an overtone of a company that is too tightly bound by tradition and “does not change readily.” Looking back over the last 30 years, I think the correct assessment of these three decades is that we have felt the pain of change while taking up the challenge of change. It was fine that
we had the intention to change, but I think we lacked the ability to foresee the risks entailed in executing it. In man- agement, it is the task of the top manager to bring an idea, have the organization that is to execute it get a good understanding of it, foresee the risks accompanying execu- tion, devise ways of avoiding those risks, and only then take action to achieve the idea. A governance system is a system that ensures, as an organization, a consistent process for achievement. Failing to overcome the challenge of change can undoubtedly be seen as being the result of such gover- nance systems not discharging its risk management function. Taking a look back over EBARA’s 100 years and the history of change in our governance system shows how important this system is. Let’s begin by dividing this history into the first 70 years from our founding, when the founding family exerted some overriding influence on management, and the subsequent 40 years, after management was separated from ownership. During the period when the founding family exercised such determinate influence on manage- ment, although governance by particular individuals was functional, it can be said to have been “age zero” for cor- porate governance as a system. This was particularly true when the founder was still alive and watched over the busi- ness based on his sense of mission. During this period, the organization was able to execute his ideas, and could rely on his individual capabilities for both foreseeing and

dealing with risks. Once the founding family no longer had an influence on management and EBARA shifted toward “modern management,” management was placed in the hands of first-rate employees. Because they were not members of the founding family, it brought fresh air to the Company, increasing opportunities to put into practice something different from before. However, being the “age zero” of corporate governance, a time in which corporate governance has yet to be established as a system, there was even a possibility of entering a “dangerous age” in which the Company is at risk of relying excessively on the capabilities of a single top manager. In this situation, if that one person loses his sense of mission, even great ideas could be executed incorrectly. In this age, when risks are actualized, the Company may be devastated by them as
it does not have the capabilities as an organization to handle those risks. This not only has a negative effect on financial aspects but also triggers a negative effect in terms of organizational and employee morale. The Company will not be overly influenced by the quality of a single top man- ager as long as corporate governance is functioning as a system. EBARA was no exception to the “age of chaos” marked by excessive reliance on individual capabilities and a non-functioning governance system, and subsequently began establishing corporate governance as a system.
This process started from the most basic of aspects: strict compliance with laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations leaves no margin for objection, and results will come if it is steadily practiced. Strict com- pliance is consequently not difficult to attain, provided that all have the will to accomplish the task. The next challenge was to establish a structure for fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities (CSR). This is the practice of management that goes beyond mere compliance with laws and regula- tions, and is management with an awareness of the inter- ests of all stakeholders making up society, as a member of that society. We can assess the EBARA of today as having
reached this level. After overcoming this challnge, EBARA will next take aim at enhancing ESG. Unlike CSR, ESG by itself as a word does not imply a complete meaning. It is easier to understand if we consider it to be a yardstick against which the soundness of a company is measured from environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) perspectives. The concept has spread as a measuring tool used mainly by institutional investors, but companies themselves can use it to gauge the degree of increase
in their corporate value. I would like to introduce and summarize EBARA’s efforts for strengthening ESG below.
Corporate Governance (G) Efforts
Corporate governance refers to a mechanism for monitor- ing management with transparency and objectivity in order to improve management quality and increase corporate value. The Board of Directors is positioned at the top of this structure. In other words, if the leadership of the Board of Directors does not function, neither will the mechanism for corporate governance. Fulfilling everything advocated for in Japan’s Corporate Governance Code means that we have, at least in appearance, established an effective system for corporate governance. Nevertheless, EBARA is looking for genuine change by creating corporate governance mecha- nisms which go beyond such requirements. Believing that change of form is a prerequisite for genuine change, it is EBARA’s intention to look ahead and change our system
of governance.
At EBARA, we heavily weigh diversity in the composition
of the Board of Directors in order to perceive the current state of management from various viewpoints and strive to improve the quality of business execution. In parallel with strengthening the functions of the Board of Directors as a whole in monitoring management, the Nomination, Audit, and Compensation Committees will discuss and make deci- sions concerning themes requiring high degrees of exper- tise by utilizing the advantages of a Company with Three Committees. Most recently, the Compensation Committee made changes to executive officers’ bonuses and stock options to strengthen performance improvement incen- tives. The Nomination Committee is engaged in establishing a mechanism to not only select but also continuously nur- ture the development of executives, in terms of succession plans deciding the next head of the Company. We are starting with an awareness that the change of the head of the Company is not something that is done when a prede- termined time comes, but something that is done without delay whenever needed. It goes without saying that trans- parent appointment and dismissal criteria are required to change managers when required, and the Nomination Committee is leading preparations for the Board of

 Initiatives for Strengthening Corporate Governance
 Around the turn of the century, the Company re-acknowledged the importance and necessity of corporate governance structures headed by the Board of Directors. Since then, we have been enhancing our governance structures in a phased manner to support the Company in achieving sustainable growth while fulfilling its social responsibilities as a global com- pany. Going forward, we will continue to improve our governance systems as necessary to achieve further improvements and move them toward the ideal state in which the Board of Directors can fully exercise its functions.

11/15: Establishment
          The Board of Directors is charged with three major respon- sibilities: indicating the directions for important corporate strategies, establishing frameworks to allow for appropriate risks to be taken in business execution, and providing highly effective oversight for business execution from an objective and independent standpoint. In addition, the Board of Directors is expected to exercise both leadership from the perspectives of defensive functions and growth-oriented functions. In terms of defensive functions, the Board will work to establish regulatory frameworks for preventing the occurrence of scandals and the materialization of other downside risks. From the perspective of growth-oriented functions, the Board will ensure that systems are in place to allow management to take bold action to prevent the loss of upside risk (such as business opportunities).
In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, sufficient time was devoted to engaging in deep discussion of medium-to-long-term issues based on the results of evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Specifically, we began monitoring the progress of E-Plan 2019 and engaged in more thorough discussion of con- crete measures for addressing identified issues. The Com- pensation Committee has designated return on invested capital (ROIC), the most important key management indi- cator under E-Plan 2019, as the indicator to be used for performance evaluations related to long-term incentives as part of directors’ and executive officers’ compensation. The use of this indicator is anticipated to contribute to higher motivation to achieve the targets of E-Plan 2019.
In addition, directors’ and executive officers’ compensation systems were revised to support the ongoing growth of the Company. The Nomination Committee engaged in more extensive discussion of succession plans for the President and Representative Executive Officer and on developing candidates for succession, specifically regarding the types of qualities that EBARA should seek in its President and Representative Executive Officer. Additionally, opinions were exchanged with the business executive team with the aim of realizing more consistent procedures for developing and promoting top executives. The Audit Committee per- formed the necessary audits and also defined important auditing items pertaining to the implementation status of measures described in E-Plan 2019. Based on these items, the Audit Committee supervised and verified operations to confirm that execution was fair, appropriate, efficient, and congruent with the provisions of E-Plan 2019.

Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ Effectiveness
The Company believes it is necessary to work toward the best possible corporate governance systems and strive for improvement at all times. Annual evaluations of the effec- tiveness of the Board of Directors are conducted to evalu- ate the contributions it makes and the results are disclosed. The Company then works to resolve any issues that come to light.
Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ Effectiveness in the Nine-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Analysis and Evaluation Process
With the cooperation of a third-party organization, the Com- pany had each Director complete a questionnaire and then held individual interviews with all of the Directors based on their responses to the questionnaire. The state of the Board of Directors was analyzed based on the results, and the Board of Directors discussed its effectiveness at meetings held in February and March 2018 and confirmed the evaluation of its effectiveness and the future actions to be taken.
Contents of Questionnaires
The Company formulates questions related to matters that are crucial for confirming the state of the Board of Direc- tors. Characteristics of the questionnaire issued in the nine- month period ended December 31, 2017 included its more in-depth questions. Specifically, questions were posed which confirmed what the Directors view are the most important management issues perceived for the period
of E-Plan 2019 and questioned each Director on their own effectiveness regarding their roles and responsibilities in the Board of Directors.

Summary of the Results of the Analysis and Evaluation
It was found that Directors’ evaluations of the composition and status of operation of the Board of Directors and com- mittees were generally high, indicating that they are being operated appropriately. In regard to issues recognized in evaluations performed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (enhancement of identification and discussion of long-term issues, periodic reviews of the size and compo- sition of the Board of Directors, enhancement of discussion on succession planning in the Nomination Committee, and ongoing monitoring of the state of progress of E-Plan 2019), it was found that, although these are issues that still need to be addressed, related efforts are progressing. Further- more, it was confirmed that Independent Directors make large contributions to discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors and to management. Based on these findings, the Board of Directors’ evaluation concluded that the over- sight functions of the Board of Directors are adequate and that greater effectiveness has been provided.
However, it was also found that it is necessary to contin- uously work toward the enhancement of identification and discussion of long-term issues (growth strategies, etc.) contributing to the improvement of corporate value while conducting ongoing monitoring of the state of progress of E-Plan 2019. It will also be necessary to periodically verify important elements pertaining to the effectiveness of over- sight functions of the Board of Directors to ensure the ideal size and composition of the Board of Directors for the Company in response to changes in the operating environment.
Action to Be Taken
The evaluation of the Board of Directors conducted in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2017, identified a need for ongoing initiatives in the following four areas to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
                Corporate Governance Systems

Revision of Compensation Systems
Measures for Sharing Greater Value
with Shareholders
  In March 2018, the Compensation Committee revised the compensation systems of EBARA’s directors and executive officers. Through this revision, it was resolved to introduce a restricted stock compensation plan and performance-linked stock compensation plan that are applicable to Directors, Executive Officers,
and certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
officers share greater value with shareholders. For this reason, the directors and executive officer retirement ben- efit system was abolished and share-based payment stock options were introduced to provide long-term incentives.
The voluntary Compensation Advisory Committee was replaced with the statutory Compensation Committee under the Board of Directors when EBARA transitioned to the Company with Three Committees system in 2015. The new committee has clearer authority and responsibilities. Later, in 2017, three Independent Directors were appointed as the members of the Compensation Committee to increase the objectivity and transparency of the committee.
Future of Compensation Systems
In 2018, long-term incentives were changed from the prior share-based payment stock options to a restricted stock compensation plan and a performance-linked stock com- pensation plan. These new plans make it possible to issue shares of the Company’s stock directly to officers so that they share greater value with shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to flexibly design and implement compensation systems to function as appropri- ate incentive for advancing management strategies and achieving targets.
Relationship Between Compensation and
Effective Management
It is important for compensation systems to encourage directors and officers to perform their duties in a manner that coincides with a company’s corporate philosophy and to provide motivation for directors and executive officers to implement medium-to-long-term management strategies and accomplish targets.
EBARA’s compensation systems provide frameworks for clearly linking performance to compensation in order to reward directors and executive officers for good perfor- mance and to cast a stern eye on poor performance. The management indicators that will be reflected in compensa- tion are to be selected based on the operating environment and the vision for EBARA at any given time. Under the Company with Three Committees system, responsibility for accomplishing the target of improving long-term corporate value is divided among directors and executive officers. In consideration of this fact, our compensation systems pro- vide for appropriate stock-based compensation to be paid to Independent Directors to account for the differences in their position and the importance of their supervision
function. This is a distinctive characteristic of EBARA’s com- pensation systems.
We also seek to establish appropriate evaluation and compensation frameworks for contributing to officer moti- vation by providing compensation based on the contribu- tions and performance of individual officers. From this perspective, we moved away from our previous approach to bonuses, which linked bonuses to Company performance, effectively tying one’s bonus to the efforts of others. The new system tailors bonuses to the performance of specific businesses or individuals.
Directors and Executive Officers’ Compensation Initiatives to Date
I became a member of EBARA’s voluntary Compensation Advisory Committee in the fiscal year ended March 2013. This committee was formed in the fiscal year ended March 2009. It was also at this time that the Company established its Basic Policy on Directors and Executive Officers’ Com- pensation and overhauled its compensation and related systems. This revision was aimed at preventing short- sighted management and having directors and executive
We will continue to flexibly design and implement compensation systems to function as appropriate incentive for advancing management strategies and achieving targets.

Corporate Governance
Cross-Shareholdings
As a basic principle, the EBARA Group seeks to minimize cross-shareholdings. The Group will only hold shares of other companies as cross-shareholdings when it is rea- sonably determined that such shareholdings will lead to development of business and/or financial relationships with investees and contribute to the enhancement of the Group’s corporate value. The rationale for such cross- shareholding relationships is subject to regular review by

Dialogue with Shareholders and Other Investors
The EBARA Group recognizes the development of a long- term trusting relationship with shareholders and other inves- tors as one of its most important management tasks. The EBARA Group appropriately discloses corporate information necessary for shareholders and other investors to make investment decisions and strives to further strengthen its trusting relationships with these stakeholders on a continuous basis by engaging in investor relations (IR) activities for enhancing its corporate value through constructive dialogue.
The Board of Directors practices appropriate oversight of the dialogue with shareholders and other investors, posi- tioning it as an important management issue. To facilitate
this oversight, the Board of Directors receives quarterly reports on IR activities by the division responsible for these activities, and directors offer advice as necessary.
In regards to the EBARA Group IR structure, in principle, the Executive Officer responsible for IR and the IR Depart- ment perform all IR activities overseen by the President and Representative Executive Officer, who serves as the Chief Executive. Furthermore, Directors (including Independent Directors), Executive Officers, and other members of top management arrange opportunities to speak directly with shareholders and investors as necessary.

Basic Approach
The EBARA Group continuously reinforces its Group gover- nance and risk management systems in order to support the global expansion of its business.
We have established the Risk Management Guidelines*1 and the Internal Control Guidelines*2 as shared risk management guidelines for the Group and utilize them to further support Group companies in developing their risk management and internal control systems. We additionally clearly communicate to all subsidiaries the requirements of the regulations for Group administration, which indicate the essential operating rules and systems for the Group. Based on these frameworks, subsidiaries are required to perform assessments prior to exposure to serious risks with the potential to impact the entire Group and to submit reports after risks have been assumed.

Receipt of Award for “Excellent Performance” from TSMC The Precision Machinery Company develops cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing and peripheral equipment and supplies this equipment primarily to semiconductor manufacturers. We also support customers in developing new products and improving productivity, thereby helping customers achieve success in these areas.
Our contributions as a CMP system supplier have won high evaluations from world-leading semiconductor manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC), which is headquartered in Taiwan. TSMC recognized the Company with an award for “Excellent Performance” in December 2017 out of reflection of this high evaluation. From among TSMC’s more than 700 suppliers, twelve companies received awards in 2017. This marks the sixth consecutive year and the eighth time overall that EBARA has received the award.
Technologies are constantly progressing in the semi- conductor industry. Companies like TSMC that stand at the forefront of technological innovation are developing unprecedented technologies that have never been put to practical application before. One reason behind our
selection for this award was the strong, ongoing support we provide as a develop- ment partner that works closely with customers.
Semiconductors will be
instrumental to the new
technologies anticipated to
spread going forward, such
as IoT, AI, and automated
driving technologies. The Precision Machinery Company will continue to support TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers in its bid to help build a better future.

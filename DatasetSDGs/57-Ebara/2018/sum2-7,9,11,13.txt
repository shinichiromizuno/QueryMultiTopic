Waste Treatment Facility Contributing to a Low-Carbon Society and to the Lives of Community Members
  Construction of the Funabashi Hokubu Incineration Plant in Funabashi City, Chiba Prefecture was completed in April 2017, and one year has passed since it was turned over to the city. This plant is comprised of two facilities: the Funabashi Meguru Plant, a high-efficiency waste-to- energy facility, and Funabashi Meguru Spa, which will uti- lize the waste heat produced by the Funabashi Meguru Plant. A corporate group represented by EBARA Environ- mental Plant has been contracted to construct the facility and provide operation and maintenance management services over a 15-year period after its construction.
The Funabashi Meguru Plant can incinerate 3,810,000 tons of household waste (approximately 300,000 peopleâ€™s worth) a day and use the heat produced in this process to generate 8,800 kW of electricity (enough to power roughly 18,000 homes), thereby contributing to society with renewable energy. This generation capacity represents a
high level of efficiency that is six times greater than that of the previous facility, and the facility itself uses approxi- mately 35% less electricity than its predecessor. Through this facility, we will contribute to the realization of a low- carbon society that uses less fossil fuel.
Funabashi Meguru Spa neighbors the Funabashi Meguru Plant and utilizes the heat produced through its high-efficiency waste-to-energy generation process in hot spring and other bathing facilities. These facilities provide a venue for health improvement and for exchanges among Funabashi citizens with around 100,000 individuals visiting each year.
In this manner, the Environmental Plants Business contributes to community-rooted waste treatment oper- ations and the realization of a recycling-oriented society through the construction and operation of waste inciner- ation plants.

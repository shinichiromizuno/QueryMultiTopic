EBARA REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT & SYSTEMS Co., LTD. (ERS), has developed an eco-friendly high-efficiency Model RTBA centrifugal chiller designed for non-fluorinated gases that uses the eco-friendly AMOLEATM 1224yd refrigerant produced by AGC Inc. This chiller has been delivered to a variety of facilities, including commercial and lodging facilities as well as chemical plants. Recognized for its excellent performance and undeniable track record, this chiller received a special judges committee award in the 21st Ozone Protection and Global Warming Prevention Awards, and has been adopted for use in the Japan National Stadium. In addition, we provide partial upgrade services to renovate prior chiller models to be compatible with the AMOLEATM 1224yd refrigerant. These services enable customers to introduce eco-friendly products that help combat global warming without making substantial upfront investments.
 Initially established as the chillers business division of the Company, ERS is a pioneer in the manufacture and sale of large-scale cold source equipment, having delivered the first domestically produced turbo chiller 90 years ago in 1930. This division was spun off as its own company in 2002, and has been developing the Groupâ€™s chillers business in Japan and overseas since. ERS delivers comprehensive solutions in the heat energy field through its chillers, cooling towers, and accompanying S&S operations. Going forward, ERS will continue to supply its products to various facilities and further its efforts to contribute to the prevention of global warming.

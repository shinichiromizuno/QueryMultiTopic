At Ebara Environmental Plant, we regularly measure the pipes of fuel gas heat recovery boilers in waste treatment plants to assess the amount of corrosive and other wear in order to promote longer lifespans of our plants.
 Conventional methods for measuring the thickness of pipes from inside entailed inserting small sensors into the narrow pipes. However, this method required a portion of the pipes to be severed, in addition to other cumbersome preparations.
 To address this issue, we began joint development of small traveling robots that can move through small spaces, such as narrow pipes, with HiBot Corporation, a company that boasts cutting-edge development technologies. Working together, we were able to complete a successful field test of the automatic and continuous measure of boiler pipe thickness using these robots.

We have successfully developed small traveling robots that can move through narrow pipes and other small spaces. However, Ebara Environmental Plant is committed to always striving for better and will be undertaking new development projects for technologies and other breakthroughs to make ongoing contribu- tions to the creation of sustainable recycling-oriented cities.

The EBARA Group has a robust global track record of custom pump deliveries to oil, gas, and water infrastructure and to power markets in the Middle East, South- east Asia, and other parts of the world. This track record is particularly strong in Saudi Arabia, where we have delivered more than 5,000 custom pumps to date. To ensure that these products can continue to be operated reliably after delivery, we are developing customer-rooted service systems at overseas service bases.  To this end, we have sales representatives and engineers perform proposal- based sales activities while on-site field service engineers supply parts and over- haul services. Going forward, we will continue to respond to customer needs
by delivering components as well as repair and maintenance services as we seek to offer S&S that spans the entirety of product life cycles.

Through the provision of S&S tailored to customers, we support the stable operation of infrastructure by extending the lifespans of delivered products and thereby contribut- ing to the reduction of waste. Moreover, maintenance proposals that realize energy- efficient operations contribute to the reduction of environmental impact.

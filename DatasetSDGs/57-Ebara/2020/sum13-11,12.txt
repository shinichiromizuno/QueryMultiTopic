In July 2019, Ebara Environmental Plant Co., Ltd., concluded a confi- dentiality agreement with JGC Corporation (currently JGC CORPORATION), Ube Industries, Ltd., and Showa Denko K.K., with regard to the promo- tion of plastic waste chemical recycling using the Ebara Ube Process (EUP). We also began examining possibilities for collaboration at this time, and are currently looking at introducing the EUP to the market.  The goal of this project is to promote plastic waste chemical recycling as a solution for helping address climate change and oceanic pollution issues stemming from plastic waste, which have recently been garnering attention on a global scale.
 EUP is a two-phase gasification system developed jointly by Ube Industries and EBARA Environmental Plant. This system can be used to convert plastic waste into a syngas (H2+CO) through thermal decomposition and ultimately enable this gas to be reused as a material for producing ammonia or other chemical products.

Plastic Waste Recycling Process
Gasification chemical recycling of plastic waste is capable of decomposing a mixture of various kinds of plastics and impurities, which presents difficulties for other recycling methods, at the molecular level, to be recycled as various chemical materials. This process is anticipated to contribute to substantial improvements in recycling ratios.

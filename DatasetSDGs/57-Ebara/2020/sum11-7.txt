Primarily used in the LNG industry, cryogenic pumps are indispensable to the transportation and storage of LNG. Harvested in forms such as shale gas, natural gas takes a gaseous form under normal temperatures and pressures. Efficient transportation of natural gas is achieved by cooling it to –162°C to shrink it to approximately 1/600th of its normal volume, and cryogenic pumps are used in this process. These pumps have high techno- logical requirements to ensure that their structure can prevent leaks of vaporized flammable gas from LNG and that they are able to operate under temperatures ranging from normal to ultralow. Looking ahead, it can be expected that natural gas demand will increase in conjunction with the economic growth to be seen largely in China, India, and other parts of Asia. In light of this demand, Elliott Group Holdings, Inc., will contribute to the stable supply of energy through the safe and secure transportation of natural gas using cryogenic pumps.

Supplier of the Cryogenic Pumps Supporting the LNG Industry
Elliott Group Holdings designs and manufactures the compressors and turbines that form the hearts of petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants while also supply- ing related after-sales services. Over a history spanning more than a century, this company has pursued engineering innovations, produced highly reliable products, and thereby won customer satisfaction. The compressors and turbines business of EBARA CORPORATION, the parent company of Elliott Group Holdings, was trans- ferred to this company in 2000 followed by its cryogenic pumps business in 2019.

        In December 2019, we commenced sales of 10 different models of the new FRESHER 3100 NEO (BN-MG-Type) feed water pump in Japan. Such water supply units are crucial to realizing stable water supplies in buildings, condominiums, and other structures and in factory equip- ment. The FRESHER 3100 NEO (BN-MG-Type) is equipped with an inverter-integrated permanent magnet motor that combines an EBARA inverter with a permanent magnet motor boasting Ultra Premium Efficiency (IE5), the highest class for motor efficiency, making this offering one of the smallest in the industry, weighing roughly 44 kg less than prior models and requiring approximately 32% less space. Furthermore, the direction of water outputs and the location of control panels can be chosen on-site, making it possible to freely arrange the layout for easier maintenance. These features help realize optimal water supply facilities that contribute to effective space utilization and shorter installation and maintenance times for buildings, condomini- ums, and other structures.

FRESHER 3100 NEO (BN-MG-Type)
Standard pumps have a wide range of uses ranging from water supply in buildings, condominiums, and other structures to conveying fluids in industrial plants. The FRESHER 3100 NEO (BN-MG-Type) is an energy- efficient, resource-saving product that can be used for realizing efficient manufacturing processes to deliver optimal levels of convenience.

A Board of Directors Containing Open and
Free Discussions
Daito Trust’s Board of Directors features a well-rooted style of decision-making built upon a free-flowing exchange of views that has no barriers between the standing directors and the outside directors. Having a Board of Directors be a place for open and free discussion is crucial to ensuring a company is being steered in the right direction. The Company’s Board of Directors is said to be highly regarded when it comes to effectiveness. Arguments regarding each proposal are thoroughly discussed by the Board, and even if the proposal was passed by a resolution at the Executive Management Meeting, it may be set aside for further review and re- examination following discussions by the Board.
Furthermore, the outside directors have a diverse set of backgrounds, so they can provide effective advice for the executive organization from perspectives based on their various careers combined with their individual insight and wisdom. In my opinion, this is a strength of Daito Trust’s governance system. In my own case, capitalizing on my experience of having been engaged in the financial industry for a long time, I probe into whether risks that are generally overlooked are pointed out and looked into further, especially in the area of investment proposals. I also try to ask in-depth questions such as, is the investment well-aligned with Company profits? Does it earn a return commensurate with the risks involved? And, what is our judgment of the valuation of a proposal or a marketable security? The most recent
project was the acquisition of the real estate developer INVALANCE Ltd. in 2020, which was put forth as a measure to strengthen our core businesses while also backing Tokyo metropolitan area strategy. I think this was a good use of M&A. When it comes to investment projects, the post- investment follow-up is also important, including the case of the INVALANCE acquisition. The Company will exercise its oversight responsibility, as it has before for the domestic and overseas investment projects handled up through the present.
Promoting Sustainability through
Our Business Activities
Daito Group businesses that are directly connected to the social foundation, such as housing and living, including rental housing, have high affinity with the sustainability approach and provide higher earnings. In my view, a business model can exist whereby making profits leads straight to social contribution. Taking advantage of this type of business environment, in FY2020 the Company designated the Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues, directed at promoting sustainability management. The work being done on these material issues is currently staged at examining KPIs in ongoing discussions at the Board of Directors. In order that the designated material issues be placed under management, the Board must continue discussion and follow up on the essential tasks of specifying
the appropriate KPIs and incorporating them into management plans, as well as constructing a framework in
which their advancement is highly effective.
In the times ahead, we need each and every employee, from the management team to those at local work sites, to not only pick up knowledge of sustainability, but also ensure that a culture of ownership will be fostered through actions and implementation. Our future goal is that the tenants living in the 1.16 million rental housing units in Japan managed by Daito Trust, and possibly members of the broader society as well, will see themselves as "contributing to achieving SDGs by living in rental housing from Daito Trust Construction." The Daito Group has a culture of hope where each time targets are set, everyone presses ahead in unity. Now that the medium- to long-term material issues have been clearly stated, I look hopefully at the ability of the Group to move forward as one.
Toward Achieving the New Five-Year Plan
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some business segments could not make progress in line with their initial plans stipulated in the New Five-Year Plan. However, we have been actively taking on the challenge of coming up with new initiatives, such as promoting online activity as well as
developing and selling new products that address environmental issues. Although we are still in an era of uncertainty, I would like to see us move forward and utilize change as a business opportunity. In addition, new challenges make a robust governance system that supports these efforts necessary. In FY2020, in order to preserve a place where outside directors can exchange views during the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a board of outside directors. The outside directors share their sense of the issues among each other, and when there are opinions and advice that should be discussed, they share them with the full Board of Directors. By squarely performing these roles and others, they seek to raise the Board’s effectiveness.
Toward achieving the New Five-Year Plan, one of the major roles the Board of Directors should assume is to exercise solid oversight of the business segments’ portfolio strategies. From the beginning, the existing businesses have conducted appropriate analysis and monitoring of new investments and businesses, and through exhaustive discussions they have sought to strengthen their business portfolios and, as a result, improve profitability.

Insights from a Newly Appointed Outside Director
Supporting Innovation at the Daito Group from the Dual Viewpoints of “Offense” and “Defense” Currently, as a lawyer, I support risk management work such as corporate financial law and compliance. Meanwhile, as a certified public accountant, I have also been engaged in auditing and consulting work at publicly traded companies. I believe that my strengths come from the ability to judge a matter using the dual viewpoints of a lawyer’s "defense" point of view and "offense" point of view that considers business from a finance and accounting perspective. Through its New Five-Year Plan, the Company is now engaged in strengthening its framework for expanding its business domains and enhancing governance from an “offense” point of view. If advice only came from a “defense” point of view that considers legal risk, then it would not be able to achieve these goals. Because of this, I believe my expected role is to evaluate the things that the Company wishes to realize from a financial perspective and provide proactive support for things that can be judged as not being a problem, while considering legal risks. Since my appointment in June 2021, I have been participating in the Company’s Board of Directors’ meetings. My impression
has been that it is easy to speak out at these meetings. In general, outside directors are expected to have specialized
views and advice based on both their academic training and work experience. In the case of the Daito Group, however, this goes beyond the views of a specialist, and advice is expected from a broad perspective of someone outside the Company. It is a well-established atmosphere where directors find it easy to share their thoughts. For this reason, the outside directors communicate without reservation, and if necessary, issue forth proposals. This makes Board of Directors’ meetings quite lively.
We are now in the middle of major changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes cover people’s perspectives on value and behavior patterns as well as changes in the market environment, including the current restructuring of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I believe these types of changes should be grasped by companies as opportunities for innovation. To begin, regarding the recently issued New Five-Year Plan, I will also evaluate innovations advanced by the Company from my dual viewpoints, which I believe is necessary for the sake of the Company’s sustainable growth. This is a role which I plan to fulfill and will actively support. To all stakeholders, I would be grateful if you could watch attentively and look forward to the upcoming innovations by the Daito Group.

Management Material Issue 4: Corporate Governance
 Corporate Governance Basic Policy
Our basic policies on corporate governance are maximizing the corporate value of the Daito Group for our shareholders and all other stakeholders, and making our management more efficient and transparent. To do so, we have separated management’s decision-making and supervisory framework from the work execution and established a framework that
enables rapid and efficient management and business execution.
We also work to achieve highly transparent management through the participation of outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members.

 Director Compensation System
Regarding the compensation system for directors, for the purpose of having shared interests with shareholders and enhancing sustainable corporate value, we have set a basic policy founded on a performance-linked model with sound incentives in effect. Built on top of this basic policy, directors’ compensation is made up of basic compensation, which is a fixed amount, and bonus and stock compensation, which tracks business performance. Over the medium- to long-term, if the Company meets 100% of its business performance targets, then compensation is set in the proportion of 1:2–3:2–3 for basic compensation, bonuses, and stock
compensation, respectively.
Furthermore, with the goal of strengthening our shared interests with shareholders, we have introduced a stock compensation system, which started in June 2019, that features a clearly defined linkage between directors’ compensation, Company performance, and shareholder value. At the same time, we have been raising awareness of the system’s contribution to improving business performance and enhancing corporate value over the medium- to long-term. (The system does not apply to outside directors.)

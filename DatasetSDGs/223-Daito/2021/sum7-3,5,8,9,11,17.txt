As a Local Company, We Help Make Neighborhoods Better Places to Live
The Group has, to date, provided various lifestyle services to landowners and tenants to achieve reliable, secure, and stable rental management. We will also, in future, take on new business challenges that will enhance the value of neighborhoods and the assets of our landowners by focusing on revitalization of the neighborhoods in which we operate as a community-based total lifestyle support company. Under our New Five-Year Plan, we will actively participate in projects such as PFI* and private tendering projects to repair and
provide facilities needed by neighborhoods, and will improve working conditions by promoting our shared space business launched in 2019. The Group will also contribute to creating neighborhoods where people want to keep living by serving as a hub for connecting information and services with the neighborhoods and people that need them. Specifically, we will improve the value, convenience, and livability of neighborhoods such as by building platforms that can be used by non-tenants, providing various lifestyle services, and utilization of renewable energy. Moreover, we will accelerate Group-wide DX to ensure we can stably and rapidly deliver these initiatives and services.

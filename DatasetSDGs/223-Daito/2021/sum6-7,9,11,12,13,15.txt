Providing Quality and Socially Sustainable Buildings
The Group is developing products and technologies that can contribute to solving various issues such as risks in the rental housing business, social issues, and environmental issues. Some of the technologies we have developed are as a result of our former specialization in rental housing. These include development of highly secure memory keys that do not require the key cylinder to be exchanged each time there is a change in tenants, and highly durable and self-cleaning siding panels that are cleaned by rain. Our Group will continue to develop technologies to maintain the asset values of buildings. We are also focusing on responding to rapidly changing needs, such as developing and selling rental housing suited for teleworking, where demand has significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our goal, in our New Five-Year Plan, is to make an even greater contribution to various social issues, including issues faced by our landowners, and provide buildings that are needed for the long term. To this end, we are undertaking various initiatives to solve environmental and social issues through our rental housing products and through the renewal and value enhancement of old and underused buildings by strengthening our rebuilding, remodeling, and renovation businesses.

Daito Group
  
 The Daito Group is determined to manage
its business in a sustainable manner as
a company responsible for the social infrastructure of rental housing. This is our promise to society.
Amid the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing uncertainty for the future, it is even more important that companies fulfill their responsibility to outlining a clear vision toward sustainable growth and to responding to ever-changing external environmental conditions.
In this integrated report, I would like to discuss the following themes:
“The Daito Group—Transforming Change into Opportunities for Growth,” which is the basis of our vision; “New Five-Year Plan and My Mission” toward sustainable growth; and finally, “My Future Vision for the Daito Group and Society.”
The Daito Group—
Transforming Change into Opportunities for Growth
 My 35-Year Journey of Change Together with the Daito Group
When I joined the Company around 1986, it was a time when we had our sights set on being listed on the stock market, and when landowners were highly motivated to grow and be recognized nationwide by supporting land utilization. After joining the Company, I was assigned to the sales planning section of the head office and oversaw tasks including being the only person on advertising. Since then, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to take on many new challenges and issues of significance, including during major Company transition periods. Looking back, I think I was very fortunate to be in a position where I could grow together with our Company. Looking back on my 35 years at a Daito Group that started in this way, I am again reminded of how our Group has grown by creating unique value through repeated trial and error in response to changes in the times and society.
The Group started as a building leasing business centered on warehouses and factories. However, the market went through a major transition to rental housing in 1992, immediately after the burst of the bubble economy, with the amendment of the Productive Green Land Act. As a result, our business also shifted from commercial buildings and properties to rental housing. At the beginning of this turning point, the Daito Group, still widely known for leasing warehouses, was highly regarded for its system that could guarantee rent during times of vacancy called Daito Kyosaikai, the
forerunner of the current Lease Management Trust System. Therefore, both the sales and technical departments thought we would be able to compete well with our competitors if we could combine the competitive advantage of our Daito Kyosaikai with rental housing products of the same level as other companies. However, it proved difficult to beat the products of other companies that had already gained trust in the market despite the strengths of our Daito Kyosaikai system. So, we were faced with a major issue of coming up with products that could beat other companies. After this, there was a boom in imported housing in Japan. Thus, we decided, in line with the intent of our founder, to seize this boom as an opportunity to develop products designed in the style of the imported housing trends. At that time, I was the manager of the Product Development Department. Our technical staff came up with excellent designs in new rental housing proposals with a terraced housing concept that incorporated imported housing styling. The result was the acclaimed low-rise rental housing product using a 2x4 construction method, the New Crestall 24, launched in February 1995. The key features of this style are still used in our products, which are terraced units with entrances along the first floor. The Western-inspired exterior design that sets us apart from our competitors proved so popular it propelled this product to become one of our mainstay products that at times had a waitlist for tenants wanting to move in. This experience taught me an important
Integrated Report 2021

CEO Message
lesson. I learned firsthand that a key condition for coming out on top in a competitive market is by producing impactful and highly differentiated products.
Another event that has left a lasting impression on the Daito Group and me is the launch of the Lease Management Trust System, the foundation of our current core businesses. In 2006, with the revision and enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, we decided that continuing with Daito Kyosaikai, which had played an important role for our Company, would reduce benefits to our landowners. As a result, we chose to switch to the whole-building lease system. At that time, as the General Manager of the Sales Planning Department, I was serving as secretariat of the project to develop the current Lease Management Trust System. At the beginning of my investigations, I thought we could make the system work by using our Group’s sales and marketing capabilities—based on our track record of providing rental income guarantees through our Daito Kyosaikai system—even if we had a whole-building lease service of the same standard as forerunners in the whole- building lease market. However, our thinking changed, believing we would not be able to beat our competitors this way, much like during our transition from commercial buildings to rental housing. Thus, through the project, I had in-depth discussions with management about how we could best differentiate and develop a system that would most likely beat our competitors who had entered the whole-building lease market ahead of us. The end result led us to our current position of leading the rental housing industry in Japan. We thoroughly differentiated our product and focused on our landowners by covering everything from a very long lease term of 30 years (at the time) to the costs of repairs and maintenance because of both aging buildings and of restoring properties to their
original states after tenants leave.
My legacy at the Daito Group lies in the privilege of getting to work in creating brand new value by seizing the opportunities presented by changes in the external environment. The senior managers at the time defined and led the Company in the direction of their vision. This experience of seeing and feeling the importance of senior leaders defining a clear direction, I believe, has bolstered my current conviction in strongly valuing our vision.
Thoughts on Management
As a corporate manager, I have three key areas of thinking behind how I manage and lead in business.
First, I think it is vital that management has a vision and takes the lead in achieving it in order for our Group to continue to grow in these times of significant change in society and our operating environment. As I mentioned earlier, I am grateful for the business environment in which I could grow together with the Company. Now, when I think are we successfully providing this same kind of environment to our employees, I think, with the backdrop of an increasingly difficult operating environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our employees have a vague sense of uncertainty about our Company’s direction. That is why I want to create an environment where we, both as a Group and individually, can find our way into the future by clearly defining our vision. I am strongly convinced, as a leader of this Company, of the importance of defining and disseminating our vision for the future, not only within our Company, but also outside our Group.
Second, I believe a genuine desire to improve the company we work for lies at the heart of our concept of work. In the New Five-Year Plan, our medium-term plan which started in FY2019, the reason behind setting our goal of becoming “a company that can grow sustainably,
Daito Group creates unique value. We will clearly make known
our vision both within and outside our Group.
   07
Daito Group

entrusted with dreams and the future,” is a strong desire to improve our Company in ways that our employees can feel proud to work for us and can admit to their families and society.
Finally, is my belief in managing in a way that makes progress regardless of the odds in a fair and just manner. I believe these are the ways of thinking that underpin how I manage and run a business.
When it comes to my style of management—based on my background in taking on new challenges in an ongoing process of trial and error—I believe I am the type to act
while I think and think while I act. This kind of style, of doing two things at once, was considered a bad habit by some in the past, but I think going forward this kind of multitasking will be vital. Meanwhile, my aim is to balance both perseverance, or never giving up when pursuing a challenge, with being able to give up graciously when that is the best option. I believe it is a management style where, rather than acting arbitrarily on my own authority, I think and act while listening to the opinions of those around me, before making the final decision myself.
 New Five-Year Plan and My Mission
Current State of the New Five-Year Plan
Over the 30 years up to 2019, we grew by expanding our rental housing stock through our Construction business and developing a series of business models nationwide that extended to real estate services such as brokering and managing these properties. We were able to achieve this because a business model where increasing branches and sales personnel directly results in a greater revenue and rental housing stock is possible within a society where the population and household numbers are increasing.
What then, if we look at Japanese society in 30 or 50 years from now? Population and household numbers are not expected to increase. Therefore, we must consider growth strategies suited to our potential operating environments that are not limited to what we have done until now; that is, increasing the number of new housing starts. The New Five-Year Plan we launched in FY2019, when I became President, is our answer to this issue. Under the New Five-Year Plan, we will transform the Daito Group from an exclusive focus on rental housing to a total lifestyle support company. To this end, we will expand our Comprehensive Leasing and Lifestyle Support Services businesses concentrically around our core rental housing business, which has been a mainstay of the Group’s growth.
Our actual results for the Construction business centered on the rental housing business are, however, below those stated in the New Five-Year Plan due to the impact of changes in our operating environment, such as stricter lending and the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we believe our highest priority is to rebuild the Construction business and regain our mainstay core business. The Real Estate business, including the occupancy rate, on the other hand, has been performing very well due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic is not over yet, and, therefore, we will continue to pay close attention to the situation and further bolster the stable strengths of the Real Estate business that have become apparent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
Other businesses segment, besides the hotel business, is performing steadily. In Other businesses, we aim to aggressively advance into new business domains, such as through the integration of INVALANCE Ltd., a provider of condominiums for asset management purposes, into our Group in November 2020. We will continue investigating opportunities to collaborate with companies and services with high potential for synergy.
While there is a market trend of declining new housing starts, the Group’s rental housing stock is increasing. Therefore, I think we should pay particular attention to businesses that utilize our housing stock. In these circumstances, the renovation business is an area we are focusing on in the New Five-Year Plan.
The renovation business, which can utilize our Group resources, can not only expand our Group business domains, but can also lead to strengthening our core business by acquiring stock based on opportunities presented by renovating, such as taking on the management of properties owned by other companies, and opportunities for resale from rebuilding and renovation.
In the Real Estate business, in October 2020, we started developing a business platform aimed at providing services related to rental housing and living. As a first step, we plan to start providing services to the more than 2 million tenants of our managed buildings, in Autumn 2021. Although we still face the issue of recovering the business performance of our core businesses, especially the Construction business, we are steadily progressing our efforts toward our goal of becoming a total lifestyle support company.
New Five-Year Plan and My Mission
The Lease Management Trust System is a comprehensive package for supporting landowners with lease management. This system ranges from construction and planning of rental housing management by Daito Trust Construction, Co., Ltd.; recruitment of tenants by Daito

Daito Group
CEO Message
Kentaku Leasing Co., Ltd.; and property management, operation, and whole-building leasing by Daito Kentaku Partners Co., Ltd. In other words, the growth of the Daito Group is a business model that naturally leads to the growth of subsidiaries such as Daito Kentaku Leasing and Daito Kentaku Partners. However, in a situation such as this, where Daito Trust Construction is the only engine of the business, if the engine stagnates such as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, the growth rate of the entire Group will also suddenly slow down. While this system has until now been a source of the Group’s competitive advantage, in the future, we will need each subsidiary to find and operate an engine that can grow independently. As an example, Daito Kentaku Partners being entrusted with the management of buildings constructed by other companies and independently expanding their portfolio builds their own unique growth engine. This can also be expected to create a virtuous cycle within the Group—with the introduction of rebuilding and renovation work to Daito Trust Construction. This will enable each Group company to have its own growth engine, and if the various Group companies can create a synergistic ecosystem, this can also be expected to fuel sustainable growth.
I believe one goal of the New Five-Year Plan is to develop
growth engines in each Group company and to create this kind of self-sustaining ecosystem. If we can fully share the ways of thinking and mechanisms related to this ecosystem, we will be able to continue to create new engines in the future and to strengthen the ecosystem. The first and most important role I should play in achieving the ecosystem is developing the necessary organizations, talent, and systems.
In 2019, the first year of the New Five-Year Plan, we began building a culture and programs to create new engines both inside and outside the Company. One such program is the internal venture system, “Mirai-novator.” Employees who want to take on challenges that utilize their specialist fields or that utilize Group management resources can apply to become Mirai-novators, or “innovators of the future.” We heard from quite a few applicants who have said things like, “I can’t see what kind of position I’ll end up in by just continuing to work as I am” and “I feel the limits of my career in my current abilities.” I certainly want to achieve the development of an ecosystem and growth engines to establish an environment and give our employees similar opportunities to the ones I had as an employee within a growing company, where they can actively take on challenges and feel they are growing along with the Company.
 My Future Vision for the Daito Group and Society
Responsibility and Mission of the Daito Group
As of the end of March 2021, the Group manages 1.16 million rental housing units under 88,000 landowners, with an estimated 2.08 million tenants. Just in terms of scale, you can see we have enough tenants spread throughout Japan to fill a city of significant size. If we can make the most of this as one network, I believe we can contribute to solving social issues on an administrative scale through our business activities. At the same time, we also recognize we have an enormous social responsibility based on the scale and size of this network. Taking on the challenge of solving social issues through our business activities and management resources is the key to unlocking the potential of this network and the future growth of our Group. Therefore, it is vital that both as a Group and as individual employees, we must take social issues onboard as if they are our own.
In terms of the urgent and global issue of climate change, we have, for example, been caring for our environment proactively by reducing our environmental impact in our construction sites and by developing environmentally friendly rental housing, starting with net zero energy house (ZEH) rental properties. Even so, in recent years, whenever a climate change-induced disaster occurs, such as severe storms that are occurring
every year and are impacting both our landowners and tenants, we are deploying all our employees, who are affiliated with the affected sales area, to help in recovery and rehabilitation activities. In other words, our business, our employees, and our stakeholders are already being impacted by climate change. This is why we must find ways of solving and contributing to issues facing society by taking ownership of the issues across our entire Group. I believe this is truly how our Group can create greater social and economic value going forward.
Sustainability of the Daito Group
Sustainability has become a concept that has grown in familiarity and many people are showing an interest in it. Looking back on my own purchasing behavior, I feel as if my criteria for choosing a product has expanded from price, performance, and design, to include whether or not it is environmentally friendly. Looking at social trends as well, I feel we are now in a time where companies and products that are environmentally and socially friendly are being chosen and evaluated. That is why there is a growing sense of urgency that if we do not sufficiently act on our sustainability responsibilities, we will not survive, regardless of our competition within the market.

  We will develop a corporate culture
and systems that will continue to
create new growth engines.
My mission is to create an environment where both the Company and employees can continue taking on challenges.
 I believe our main product, rental housing, plays a more significant role as social infrastructure for the public good than private houses, from the perspective of a range of people being able to easily choose and shift rental houses depending on their family makeup or lifestyle needs at the time. Furthermore, as our business creates new housing and impacts people’s lives on land owned by our property owners, our business would not function without the cooperation and understanding of local communities and stakeholders. It is with this kind of background that we have now included concepts such as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and creating shared value (CSV) into our corporate management. Going forward, we aim to become a company chosen from the perspective of sustainability by proactively taking on our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities.
When developing rental housing products, for example, we focus on three key concepts: the environment, disaster prevention, and lifestyles. Caring for our environment is a natural responsibility for our Group that supplies more than 50,000 homes a year (average for the last five years). Regarding disaster prevention, we believe management from a sustainability perspective is an opportunity to provide new value. For example, in this time of 100-year life expectancies, we propose a new lifestyle that rental housing can only provide in order to fulfill our responsibility to protecting landowners’ assets and tenants’ lives. I think you, as a reader, will be able to better understand our purpose and intentions if you keep these concepts in mind when reading the materiality (material issues) announced in this integrated report.
Our materiality announced here has been identified mainly
by leaders who will lead the Daito Group into the future, which include all executive officers, and managers of the corporate planning and business strategy departments of the three main Group companies. While we will start undertaking measures toward our material issues soon, the current materiality is by no means a finished product. Our challenge will be to make our materiality into a living concept that we will continue revising and nurturing. We must also advance materiality initiatives as a means of accelerating progress on the New Five-Year Plan. We believe our ideal form of sustainability management is to consolidate both perspectives of our management strategy and materiality into informing the ideal direction and path of action for our Group.
Our Promise to Society
As I mentioned at the beginning, our Group has grown by creating unique value in line with the changing times and society. And now, in these times of great change, we are declaring our resolve to transform the Daito Group from an exclusive focus on rental housing to a total lifestyle support company. Therefore, our Group must grow into a company that can contribute to society more broadly, founded on our management resources including good relationships with all our stakeholders such as landowners, tenants, and business partners. Now, the promise to society I want to achieve is to become a company that can grow sustainably, entrusted by our stakeholders with their dreams and the future, and that we will aim to solve social issues through our business. We will continue taking on various initiatives to achieve this promise without being defeated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope you will keep looking forward to the new value we will create as a Group.

 TOPICS Responding to the External Environment
The strength of the Daito Group lies in its ability to respond flexibly and rapidly to social changes. Taking the external environment, which is changing significantly on a daily basis, as an opportunity for further growth, we advanced a variety of responses in FY2020.

DX Defined
According to the DX promotion guidelines established by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the term “DX” is defined as a situation whereby “a company deals with dramatic changes in business environments, changes its products, services and business models so as to meet the demands of customers and society by taking advantage of data and digital technologies and changes its services per se, organizations, processes, corporate and business culture so that it can establish competitive advantages.”
Impact on the Daito Group
It is assumed that the promotion of DX by industry-leading companies will stimulate the transformation of old-style businesses, that innovative services providing new customer experiences and value will be created in various industries and, as a result, bring about intensified corporate competition that transcends industries. Nowadays, various markets are being dominated by Big Tech (a group of IT companies that exert a dominant global influence), and it is clear that Daito Trust’s businesses,

Recognition and Strategies
The Group recognizes that DX is an indispensable and important factor in evolving to become a total lifestyle support company. In FY2020, we formulated DX strategies to realize business transformation by means of utilizing
Against the backdrop of an increase in the number of companies utilizing innovative digital technologies and developing unprecedented business models, many companies feel required to promote DX to maintain and strengthen their competitiveness. In Japan, although many company managers are aware of the need for and have made some investment in DX, the situation is that this awareness has not led to actual business transformation, and the country is said to be lagging behind globally.
which include construction and real estate businesses, are no exception.
For the Group to maintain and strengthen its competitive advantage under such social conditions, we believe that it is necessary for us to promote digital technology-based business transformation and to reshape our own business models while drawing on the experience and expertise we have built over many years in the construction and real estate fields.

Insights
Indispensable methods to becoming a total lifestyle support company are the promotion of capital and business alliances, the encouragement of sustainability management, and work-style reforms, such as working remotely from home and our flextime system. These methods are also the revitalization of talent and organizations that can continuously produce results while working with great enthusiasm. One of the most important means in achieving these is DX promotion.
By steadily implementing our DX strategies, we will expand our share in the rental housing market and successfully expand our business, while further accelerating the evolution from our exclusive focus on rental housing to a becoming a total lifestyle support company centered on our Comprehensive Leasing business.

suspension of construction work. Alternatively, if the supply chain is reviewed and the focus on and expansion of the remodeling business progresses, the situation could be an opportunity for growth.
Opportunities
• Review and strengthening of supply chain
• Expansion of demand for remodeling due to avoidance of
new construction and rebuilding projects
although futures prices are on a downward trend, local prices, which form the basis for purchase prices, have remained high, and it is unclear what impact on the business that the purchasing starting in September 2021 will have on FY2021. We will take measures with a view to, for example, expand the use of domestic timber.

Insights
As of September 2021, the Group has not suffered any major impact from the wood shock as we procure our lumber outside from North America and also utilize domestic timber. However, due to the multiple factors behind the occurrence of the wood shock, we anticipate the outlook remaining uncertain. Assuming there will be a long-term impact, we will enact countermeasures that take into account timber prices and the exchange rate situation.

Our Response to New Subleasing Regulation Law
Law on the Normalization of Rental Housing Management Services (New Subleasing Regulation Law)
   Against the backdrop of factors that include the advancing years of rental housing owners and the rental management business associated with inheritance, the number of owners who outsource rental management to management and subleasing business operators is increasing. Rental management using such subleasing methods has potential risks, including the risk of rent fluctuations and contract cancellation conditions, and problems caused by a lack of explanation at the time of contract negotiations have increased in recent years. Accordingly, the Law on the Normalization of Rental Housing Management Services came into force in December 2020 with the aim of protecting owners and ensuring sound and proper rental housing
Impact on Business
management operations under the subleasing method.
Main rules of conduct
(1) Ban on misleading advertising
(2) Ban on unfair solicitation, etc.
(3) Explanations of contract details and delivery of documents
prior to signing of agreement
(4) Delivery of documents at time of signing of agreement (5) Document inspection
Parties targeted by regulations
Subleasing business operators/solicitors (including construction companies, house manufacturers, etc.)
 We believe that the impact will be significant for the Group because the core business is land utilization and leasing management using the subleasing method. We also believe that it will be necessary for us to contribute to the optimization of the industry as a whole.
  Risks
• Suspension of business activities, administrative measures due to violation of law
• Deterioration in image of subleasing industry due to frequency of business disposals
The Daito Group’s Response
Improvement of contract explanation quality, employee education, establishment of external point of contact
The Group is working to improve the quality of its explanations for contracts, such as reviewing and revising the content of past advertisements, and is creating new materials that better explain the risks associated with signing agreements. The Group is also—for example by opening a special site on the Company’s Intranet, formulating guidelines that summarize the timing and main points of explaining risks at the time of solicitation, and conducting training for sales staff—focusing on educating employees and sharing information to promote understanding of the New Subleasing Regulation Law. In addition, we have set up an external point of contact to facilitate reporting and consultation regarding acts that contravene or may contravene
Opportunities
• Expanding needs for inheritance measures in accordance with risk reduction
• Increased demand for specialist rental companies • Improved contract explanation quality
the New Subleasing Regulation Law, such as misleading advertising and unfair solicitation, and are striving to detect problems early and prevent any recurrence.
Providing information for customers
Our website for owners includes an information dissemination page that is useful for land utilization, and on it we explain in an easy-to-understand manner the New Subleasing Regulation Law, which is a law designed to protect owners. By striving to provide accurate information that includes not only the advantages, but also the disadvantages of rental management by the sublease method, we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that owners fully understand their subleases and conclude contracts with peace of mind.
        Leader
Insights
For some time, double-checking has been conducted by business units after the signing of agreements, and the clear stipulation of fixed rent periods in marketing documents and briefings has been provided by our Group company, Daito Kentaku Partners Co., Ltd. Thus, the impact of the enforcement of the New Subleasing Regulation Law will be minor. However, I believe there is a risk during the marketing process that we will give explanations to owners that might be misunderstood. Because of this, we will continue to take steps to thoroughly train our employees and ensure consistent compliance with the law while promoting sound and appropriate business activities.

Path to Earning Trust and Growth
The Daito Group is not merely a construction company. We support our owner’s varied concerns related to the use of valuable land and asset succession through reliable, secure, and stable management support of the rental housing business that suits the changing times. By deepening trust with owners and families, as well as tenants, we have driven growth over the years.

Forerunner to the Lease
Management Trust System
Founded in 1974 as Daito Sangyo Co., Ltd. (currently Daito Trust Construction Co., Ltd.), we gained our start by building commercial rental properties and proposing solutions for self-utilization of land to produce rental income. In 1980, we established Daito Kyosaikai to guarantee rent during times of vacancy—the first step on our path to establishing a comprehensive Lease Management Support Service.

Shift to Rental Housing
With significant declines in demand for commercial rental properties as a result of Japan’s economic bubble bursting, we decided on a shift to the rental housing market, which was expanding due to the amendment and enforcement of the production green land law in 1992. We also established a solid position in the rental housing market through the popularity of our low-rise apartment building launched in February 1995, New Crestall 24 (two-by-four method).

The Building Blocks of Our Value Creation Cycle
S0ocia1l Issues the Daito Group
0Busin2ess Model Making Social
Shou
The founding purpose of the Group was to come alongside property owners to help solve their issues, in keeping with their desire “to hand over land to the next generation that has been passed down through many generations.” Our highest priority—since our founding, as we have expanded our business—has been to solve the issues of property owners. Their concerns about land and assets, however, change significantly in step with social changes. In Japan, where there is a long-term trend of a declining population,
it is expected that population aging will increase further, and the number of singles and nuclear family households will also increase. In terms of our Group operating environment also, there is expected to be increases in demand for rental housing and in the number of older rental houses. As a result, landowners are now facing more diversified issues— including diversification of rental housing management and a decrease in real estate competitiveness as the buildings age—in addition to traditional issues such as stable management of inherited assets and land. While these changes can conceivably pose risks to the Daito Group, they can also be significant opportunities for us to expand our business domains and enhance our competitive advantage.

The Lease Management Trust System is a unique system created to maximize the asset value of landowners while protecting their precious land by duly considering such social changes and issues of landowners. The Lease Management Trust System—which encompasses all aspects of lease management, from planning, design, and construction to tenant recruitment services and property management—not only supports landowners in lease management, but also reassures them about the various risks they face by flexibly adapting the support offered in line with social changes. Additionally, the value provided to tenants, business partners, and local communities by this system contributes to further solidifying the lease management of landowners. This in turn leads to the ongoing ability of the Group to secure and increase value. We believe this is what makes our business model unique.

   An estimated 4.63 million (approx. 308 thousand annually) rental housing units were lost from the housing stock in Japan in the 15 years from 2003 to 2018. Because of this, there is expected to be continued demand for supply of new rental housing units.
By 2019, the number of people subject to inheritance tax had almost doubled (compared to pre-tax reform in 2015) to 115,000 people. Revenue from the inheritance tax had risen by approximately 1.5 times the pre-tax reform amount to ¥1.9 trillion.

  The current rate of adoption of renewable energies in Japan is 17%, as of FY2018. The government has set a target of raising this to 22–24% by 2030.
In the case whereby issues—such as the low level of familiarity and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19—are overcome, the scale of the sharing economy is expected to grow to ¥14,152.6 billion by FY2030, which is roughly equal to the real estate sector in Japan.

 Daito Group’s
Seven Material Issues
Toward Management Revolving around Sustainability
Up to now, the Group has been able to grow by providing a flexible response to social changes and issues of the times and creating added value not found at other companies. The effect of social change and issues upon the Group are analyzed from the perspective of both risks and opportunities. This action enables changes in the external environment to be exploited as opportunities to create value for society. To this end, the Group has designated the major issues that most need to be addressed as the Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues.
Process for Identifying Material Issues
The Six Steps for Identifying Material Issues
    Extract and categorize
the current Group situation
Extract and categorize the Group’s ideals
Identify the gap between the current and the ideal situation
Extract and categorize
the components of the material issues
Evaluate the material issue components (1) Evaluate the cash flow impact
Evaluate the material issue components (2) Evaluate the impact on the environment and society
Framework for Identifying Material Issues
Assembling a Project Team Led by Executive Officers
STEP 2
The Group’s business activities are classified into 10 categories including market environment, social background, level of importance, and strengths and weaknesses. The current internal and external situations are extracted and arranged into those categories.
Extract and categorize “what the Group should do” and “what the Group aims for,” using: (Step 1 results x social change/megatrends) and (business/resources x social change/megatrends).
Extract and categorize the gap between the current situation in Step 1 and the ideals in Step 2.
As a component of the material issues, extract and categorize “what should be done” to eliminate any gap between situation and ideals, and “what should be done” to enlarge the Group’s strengths when there is no gap.
Assess the material issue components with an evaluation centered on a business strategy model that gives greater weight to components that have their implementation declared in the New Five-Year Plan or that tie directly to value creation.
After taking into account outside initiatives, outside evaluations, and evaluations of various index items, extract the major ESG issues for the Group and evaluate the level of contribution toward these issues from material issue components.
    STEP 3
  STEP 4
  STEP 5
  STEP 6
 For the purposes of identifying more effective material issues and those that foster an awareness of sustainability management, we have put together a project team made up of members who will carry the responsibilities of the next generation. The team, which is concerned with the identification of material issues, is centered on all executive officers, who guide the execution of work laid out in the New Five-Year Plan, and the persons in charge of the Corporate Planning Department and Business Strategy Department of the Group’s three main companies.

Raising Effectiveness through Mutual Effects between the New Five-Year Plan and the
Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues
The incorporation of material issues in the New Five-Year Plan can accelerate the plan, and furthermore provide backing to the sustainable possibilities created by the plan. Moreover, the implementation of the New Five-Year Plan with the material issues incorporated will naturally lead to the creation of value
that plays a part in the achievement of the material issues. In this way, the New Five-Year Plan and the Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues will contribute to each other’s success and is related to the maximization of value creation. The management strategy of blending together the plan and the material issues, by concentrating what the Group should do from both vantage points, allows us to aim for the realization of highly effective sustainability management.

        Target Secured Value
The Group has been able to achieve business growth up to now using the Construction business engine as its source of power to propel the Company’s growth in the Real Estate business and in its Other businesses. Nevertheless, when the external environment exerts an adverse influence, a business model that relies on a single source for its engine can lead to a slowdown across the entire Group, as in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce future risk of such a slowdown, we have incorporated material issues encompassing a medium- to long-term perspective in the New Five-Year Plan. This will allow each Group company to discover its own growth engine and build a framework that enables greater business activity. Building upon this, each Group company, having its own unique engine, will build an ecosystem that has mutual effects with the other companies and, as a result, enhance the changes in the external environment. Our aim is to acquire a business model like this that fosters sustainable growth.
 Coexistence
 Target Social Value
For the over 1.16 million rental housing units managed by the Group, if the estimated 2.08 million tenants of those units could be activated as a single network, it could make the Group, through its businesses, able to contribute to the resolution of social issues on an administrative scale. On the other hand, at that scale, we recognize that the social responsibility imposed on the Group is extremely significant. To fulfill our responsibility as a company that conducts business related to homes and living, we adopt a sustainability perspective over the medium- to long-term revolving around material issues in the New Five-Year Plan and corporate activities. This will enable us to offer new value through our business activity and contribute to the resolution of social issues by measures to address environmental considerations, natural disasters, and diverse lifestyles.

First, in FY2021, we built a sustainability
promotion framework that ensures both management and execution, formulated a basic sustainability policy, and, for each material issue component, selected a supervisor as well as KPIs and target indicators. In addition, through company-wide immersion on the necessity and application methods for the material issues, all officers and employees will build an environment that can make use of the material issues in their respective fields.

 Comments and Issues on FY2020
Leasing business. In addition, we are creating a business platform in the Lifestyle Support Services business and expanding renovation sales. On top of this are the promotion of sustainability management and DX in addition to work-style reform, which are new opportunities as a result of COVID-19.
In FY2021, we intend to make a recovery in the Construction business, which is the driving force behind the rental housing business. As part of this focus on reinforcing the strong foundation of the core business, we will also be extending our advantages in the robust Real Estate business. This will accompany the steady progress made in the new businesses started in FY2020, and we will continue to carry out verification and improvements to them.
The New Five-Year Plan seeks to expand concentrically around the strong foundation of its core rental housing business. However, financial results in the Construction business fell short of the plan, which we attribute to self-imposed restrictions on business activity and face-to-face sales in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to the effects of tighter controls in the lending environment. Meanwhile, we are off to a steady start and making consistent progress on initiatives toward our goal of transforming into a total lifestyle support company. These include participation in PFI and private tendering in the rental housing business, our sales brokerage business, and the business and capital alliance with INVALANCE Ltd. in the Comprehensive

 1. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as an 2. Updating initiatives as a step
opportunity for innovation and growth, FY2021 is the starting point for the New Five-Year Plan
In FY2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had greatly different outcomes for different business domains and each Group company. On the one hand, vulnerabilities including face-to-face sales in construction operations were exposed, while on the other hand the steadiness of the stock business in our Real Estate business was recognized once again as an opportunity. Nevertheless, the pandemic presented opportunities such as the start of full-scale operations in digital marketing and facilitation of remote work and working from home. In fact, the Group took advantage of this to make major revisions to its business framework. Viewing the pandemic as an opportunity for business innovation and growth, we strive first for an early recovery of the Construction business, the driving force of the New Five-Year Plan.
3. Promoting highly effective sustainability management from operations focused on material issues
In FY2020, in order to conduct operations concerning the Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues more effectively, we moved ahead with building a sustainability promotion framework that ensures both management and execution viewpoints and selected the managers having supervisory responsibility for material issues as well as KPIs and target indicators. In addition, through company-wide immersion on the necessity and application methods regarding the material issues, all officers and employees will build an environment that capitalizes on the material issues in their respective fields.
toward achievement of the New Five-Year Plan
Although issues have arisen concerning earnings recovery in the core business, we are proceeding steadily with initiatives toward our goal of transforming into a total lifestyle support company. These initiatives include expansion of the renovation business, the start to building a business platform, a business and capital alliance with INVALANCE Ltd., an accelerator program, and continuation of the in-house venture system.
In FY2020, each Group company executed its unique growth strategy, and in addition we advanced and updated new business initiatives directed at expanding our business domains and capital alliances with other companies with high synergies, all in pursuit of achieving the New Five-Year Plan with certainty.
4. Addressing the Corporate Governance Code at a high level through
governance reform
In order to steadily realize the diverse-rich New Five-Year Plan and Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues, we will strengthen the division of roles and responsibilities between “offense and defense” and “execution and supervision” within our corporate governance. This entails redefining the abilities, skills, and functions required of directors and executive officers, respectively, in a way tied directly to the strengthening of the framework. We will also continue initiatives for improving effectiveness in governance, including self-assessments of Board of Directors’ effectiveness and the effectiveness of the Board, the Executive Management Meeting, and the Executive Planning Meeting. Furthermore, by creating a framework directed at enhancing Group governance, we are advancing reform of the Group’s overall governance.

 Construction Business
We aim to achieve a recovery in the rental housing business under the flexible sales structure that we developed in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Business Overview
TAKEUCHI Kei
Managing Director
In charge of Construction Business Headquarters
We propose optimal lease business plans tailored to landowners’ needs after research and analysis of the location, the surrounding environment, and tenant needs. We provide high quality, highly durable rental buildings using our integrated system to practice thorough and consistent quality management ranging from purchasing construction materials to design, construction, and inspection at completion.
  Risks
• Housing surplus brought about by a decrease in population and number of households
• The decreasing and aging of construction
industry workforce
• Restrictions on face-to-face business during
the COVID-19 era
• Stricter standards for apartment loans
• Increase in interest rates

Opportunities
• An increased need for inheritance measures from an aging society
• Growth in rebuilding and renovation demand as a result of homes with longer lifespans
• More people moving to rural areas as lifestyles become more diverse
• Changes to tax laws (if taxes increase or tax target base expands) • Greater demand for companies specializing in rental housing due
         to the strengthening of sublease restrictions

lower, falling by 30.9% year on year to ¥358.8 billion. Reasons for this downturn included the suspension of marketing activities and voluntary curbs on sales visits to customers after the lifting of the state of emergency. Orders in hand as of March 31, 2021 were 8.8% below the previous year’s level at ¥756.8 billion.
Starting in April 2020, the government issued state of emergency declarations nationwide. This had an impact on the Construction business, including the suspension of work on construction sites, with the result that net sales of completed construction contracts declined by 27.1% to ¥401.7 billion.

We will continue to approach changes in the business environment as opportunities, while using innovations in work styles, sales methods, and other areas to drive a recovery in the performance of our Construction business from FY2021 onward.
We will further enhance new marketing channels for the Construction business, including digital marketing activities by the newly created Digital Marketing Promotion Department, and the expansion of our corporate marketing systems. We also aim to maintain and expand orders through continuing initiatives to improve customer convenience and create opportunities for communication through the use of online technology to diversify sales
promotion and negotiating formats, including meetings, consultation sessions, seminars, and meetings with tax accountants. In addition, we will further reform our internal structures to create a better working environment that also enhances operating efficiency, including consolidation of the flextime system, and expansion of the team system.
Our priorities in engineering areas are to expand our share of new construction starts and enhance our competitiveness as a Group. We will achieve these goals by training sales engineers, enhancing sales promotion activities, developing environmentally responsible housing and construction methods and disaster-resistant housing products, as well as enhancing our design, estimation, and construction capabilities in relation to custom orders. Through initiatives in these areas, we will further strengthen our ability to supply buildings with high social and asset value.
   Contribution to Achieving the New Five-Year Plan in FY2020
Development of Japan’s First LCCM Rental Housing
In March 2021, Daito Trust completed development of Japan’s first LCCM rental apartment housing, featuring a solar power generation system developed by Kyocera Corporation.
LCCM apartment housing is designed to minimize CO2 emissions at the construction, occupancy, and disposal stages. Because these buildings produce renewable energy, including solar power, they have negative total CO2 emissions over their life cycles from construction through to demolition. By promoting the use of environmentally responsible rental housing, such as LCCM buildings, we aim to achieve a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions during the occupancy of rental housing managed by the Group by 2030*.
*Target for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (Scope 3, certified by the Science Based Targets [SBT] initiative). Please refer to “Management Material Issue 1: Environment” on page 55 for information about SBT certification.
The first LCCM building was completed in June 2021.

SATO Koji
Managing Director
In charge of Real Estate Business Headquarters
Business Overview
We maintain high occupancy rates by providing services such as tenant recruitment utilizing diverse media and channels and by providing unique tenant services. We not only manage and operate our rental housing businesses by collecting rent, managing buildings and contracts, etc., we also deliver long-term peace of mind and secure, stable management by handling all aspects of rental management on behalf of owners, such as by dealing with balance fluctuation risks accompanying business.

Net sales increased by 4.2% over the previous year’s level to ¥1,014.2 billion and operating income by 12.0% to ¥63.2 billion. Contributing factors included an increase in whole-building leases, higher rental income from Daito Kentaku Partners Co., Ltd., and the expansion of revenues earned by House Leave Co., Ltd., which provides services
that do not require a guarantor. Despite the temporary closure of branches following the state of emergency declaration, the number of tenants arranged rose by 0.8% year on year to 337,000, resulting in a 97.8% occupancy rate for residential properties.

   In the Real Estate business, we have come to recognize the stability of the stock business once again after the business in the wake of COVID-19. In FY2021, we will continue our efforts to maintain and improve rents and occupancy rates, while also continuing to take up new challenges as we evolve into a total lifestyle support company.
In the real estate brokerage field, we will continue to promote the sales brokerage business that we launched in April 2020. Our goal is to expand the business domain of the Group while responding to owners’ diverse needs. We also aim to develop the brokerage franchise business that we introduced in January 2021 by using results from existing franchise offices to develop business models that
can make substantial contributions to both financial and non-financial performance.
In the management field, we will further enhance our lifestyle-related services and diversify the scope of those services through the launch of a business platform in the Autumn of 2021. We also aim to achieve Renewable Energy 100% (RE100) for our Group businesses and buildings under management and improve the ratio for all buildings under management, by expanding our solar power business, including the promotion of orders for EV solar power rental properties with Daito Kentaku Partners offices, and the installation of more solar panels, in order to increase generation capacity.
   Contribution to Achieving the New Five-Year Plan in FY2020
Launch of Real Estate Sales Brokerage Business by Daito Kentaku Leasing Co., Ltd.
Customers who seek advice about real estate sometimes express a wish to sell property managed by the Group following inheritance or other changes. In April 2020, Daito Kentaku Leasing addressed those needs by introducing real estate sales brokerage services at 20 of its branches throughout Japan.
In most ordinary sale and purchase transactions, the buyer acquires only the land and building. When purchasing a property managed by the Group, the buyer also has the option to take over the management structure employed by the previous owner, thereby acquiring a whole-building lease business covered by our
Lease Management Trust System. This means the new owner can benefit from our services, including precautions against risks relating to income and expenditure fluctuations associated with rental management and operation from the moment of acquisition. We will continue to expand the business by adding these services at more branches.
Note: If buildings managed by a Group company other than Daito Kentaku Leasing are sold, the contract format used by the present owner (vendor) cannot be taken over. An inspection is required if the buyer decides to take over the contract format.

 In Other businesses, net sales increased 18.6% year on year to ¥72.9 billion and operating income increased 5.0% year on year to ¥13.3 billion. The contributing factors were increased gas consumption due to expanded demand from people staying at home caused by COVID-19, and INVALANCE Ltd., which supplies condominiums for asset investment purposes, becoming a consolidated subsidiary. This positive result was achieved despite occupancy rates in the hotel business declining due to COVID-19.
In terms of our specialized Group companies, Gaspal
Corporation’s units with gas supply increased 7.7% year on year to 361,000 units with LP gas and 77.6% year on year to 40,000 units with municipal gas, while Care Partner Co., Ltd. expanded steadily by opening three home care facilities and five nursery schools. In FY2021, we will continue to expand our business domains, which have high synergies with our core businesses and tied to the growth of our Comprehensive Leasing business and Lifestyle Support Services business in line with our New Five-Year Plan.

100% Renewable Energy in Business Activities (Contribute to Achieving RE100)
 RE100 Membership
Renewable Energy 100 (RE100) is an international environmental initiative uniting businesses that have set themselves the target of sourcing 100% renewable energy to meet the energy requirements of their business activities. The Daito Group joined RE100 in January 2019 with a view to ensuring 100% of the electricity consumed by our business activities will come from renewable sources by 2040. We are moving toward 100% renewable energy as our contribution to the proliferation and promotion of renewable energy throughout society, which is the RE100 philosophy.
RE100 Targets
 Source 100% of electricity used for our business activities from renewable sources by 2040
 Contribute to the increased use of renewable energy by increasing solar power generation equipment in rental housing
  
Issuing Green Bonds and
Installing 10,000 New Solar Panels
The Daito Group will install 10,000 new solar panels, owned by the Group, on the roofs of rental buildings we manage nationwide as part of our efforts to contribute to the proliferation of renewable energy. By utilizing the electricity we generate in the common areas of the rental buildings we manage and our offices as well as by selling surplus electricity, we will contribute to the proliferation of renewable energy and further reduction in CO2 emissions throughout society.
Additionally, in conjunction with the installation of these new solar panels, we established the Daito Group Green Bond Framework in October 2021, and, from November 2021, we plan to raise funds by issuing green bonds (unsecured straight corporate bonds) under this framework.
Shifting to Renewable Energy in
Our Head Office
From November 2021, our Group’s head office, the Shinagawa East One Tower building, has started shifting to renewable energy sources. The electricity used is renewable biomass energy generated by burning domestically produced wood such as unused wood from forests, sawmill offcuts, and waste wood. This is expected to reduce annual CO2 emissions from the use of electricity by approximately 1,600 tons for the Group and approximately 5,400 tons for tenant companies. We will help to decarbonize the business activities of our Group and tenant companies by continuing and expanding this initiative.

 Reducing Greenhouse Gas and Improving Energy Efficiency
 EP100 Membership
Energy Productivity 100 (EP100) is an international environmental initiative that promotes energy efficiency through energy conservation initiatives. The Group joined EP100 in September 2020 with the goal of doubling energy efficiency (net sales/energy consumption) by 2030 compared to FY2017. Our EP100 commitments are positioned as an extension of the SBT greenhouse gas reduction and RE100 renewable energy promotion initiatives. We will contribute to realizing a decarbonized society through a combination of these three initiatives.
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Get SBT Approval
Our Group has set Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets in our medium- to long-term environmental targets. In January 2019, our targets received approval from the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative, meaning they were considered scientifically grounded for limiting global warming to below 2°C, the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, in March 2020, after updating our reduction targets to achieve the new 1.5°C SBT target—which goes beyond the previous target of well below 2°C—our new targets were verified 1.5°C-aligned. To realize these verified greenhouse gas reduction targets, we will actively utilize renewable energy, while also continuing our initiatives to grasp and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from our business activities including procurement of raw materials, production processes, logistics, and our supply chain.

Management Material Issue 1: Environment
 Procuring and Using Wood in a Sustainable Manner
Promotion of Supply Chain Management
The Group has established an Eco-Friendly Supply Chain Management Policy and aims to build a sustainable supply chain. We have also formulated our own unique Wood Procurement Guidelines and keep our business partners informed about these guidelines. These guidelines stipulate our policy to source legitimate, sustainable wood and forest resources in favor of wood that could adversely affect biodiversity.
Moreover, we purchase all our wood from timber manufacturing companies who procure their raw materials from CAS-, ISO- and FSC-certified forests. We will continue monitoring the wood supply chain, and aim to eliminate the destruction of forests caused by wood procurement.
Promoting the Proliferation of CLT
In October 2019, the Group started selling Forterb, Japan’s first building product constructed using a standardized and industrialized CLT-based process, which utilizes our independently developed cross-laminated timber (CLT) construction method.
CLT-based construction methods emit significantly less greenhouse gas emissions at the time of construction when compared with using reinforced concrete, and also has a considerable energy-saving effect on the buildings themselves. It also promotes forest recirculation through responsible use of wood, which helps lead to a further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, CLT allows us to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during demolition when compared with reinforced concrete, thereby reducing environmental impact across the entire life cycle of the building. We will continue striving to reduce environmental impacts by looking for ways to use CLT in even more types of buildings.
 Risks and Opportunities Relating to Climate Change (TCFD Disclosure)
In May 2019, Daito Trust declared its support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. We strive to ascertain the risks and opportunities that climate change presents for our business, and to disclose information in accordance with TCFD guidelines. Accordingly, the Group has evaluated the impact on the business over the short-, medium-, and long-term in future climate change scenarios (the “less than 2°C scenario” and the “4°C scenario”).

Climate Change Risks in the Construction and Real Estate Industries
We analyzed the impact on operating costs based on the scenario of a carbon tax being adopted in future by projecting the cost of the tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Company business activities. This analysis found the impact to be minimal due to reductions made in line with the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative.
We analyzed the impact on costs being passed on to products based on the projected tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Company raw material procurement (Scope 3 Category 1). Moreover, we projected the carbon tax on GHG emissions from our activities at local sites and analyzed operational (construction) costs and the resulting costs that would be passed on to our products.
Based on this analysis, we then analyzed the impact on demand due to the increased cost per building constructed. This analysis found the impact to be minimal due to reductions made in line with the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative.
We analyzed the potential for increases in unit prices of electricity under the case of a carbon tax being adopted in future. We also analyzed the resulting potential for increases in tenancy rates at housing featuring energy conservation and renewable energy, and for decreases in tenancy rates at housing without such measures. (Quantitative assessment is deferred until later.)

The Group will provide housing and employment opportunities where everyone can have peace of mind regardless of gender, nationality, race, age, and so on. We are providing agency guarantee services specialized for foreign and elderly tenants so that all our rental housing tenants can live with peace of mind. In terms of employment, we are actively supporting the intake of foreign technical interns and have accepted a total of 955 interns to date (as of the end of September 2021). In the future, when the number of foreign residents is expected to increase, we will continue strengthening our support for foreigners, such as expanding services for foreign residents and supporting the transition from foreign technical interns to specified skilled workers. Our
aim is to help create a prosperous society where everyone can thrive and live with peace of mind.

 3-1. Providing Opportunities for Taking on Challenges
Enhancing Our Systems and Environments to Foster an Entrepreneurial Spirit in Our Employees
In our current, drastically changing operating environment, new perspectives and new challenges are indispensable for the sustainable growth of the Group. To this end, the Group will foster an entrepreneurial spirit in our employees and will promote initiatives to encourage them to take on challenges.
One such initiative is our in-house venture system, Mirai-novator. Launched in April 2020, this is an initiative where employees develop and propose new business concepts with the aim of commercializing them. We have already had more than 800 business proposals including some which have moved to the stage of trialing sales and services, such as the private room rental business, E-Heya Space, and the tailor-made DIY service for rental housing, CODD.
Moving forward, we will continue nurturing sustainable talent, such as providing opportunities to take on planning challenges that take into account material issues.
3-2. Fostering and Securing Highly Specialized Talent
Fostering IT Talent Indispensable for Our DX Strategy and Focusing on Strengthening Skills in Each Area of Expertise
We are focusing on developing and securing highly specialized talent to achieve our New Five-Year Plan. We are working to secure outside specialists by introducing and utilizing a job-based employment system in departments specializing in IT to accelerate the
promotion of DX. We are also accelerating our efforts to develop our organization as well as our talent to enhance inside sales and digital marketing toward capturing increased non-face-to-face sales demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post- pandemic market.
We will strengthen our competitiveness by securing specialized talent through the expansion of the job- based employment system beyond our IT departments in the future. We will also continue supporting our employees in obtaining professional qualifications such as first-class architectural and first-class construction management engineering qualifications, which are indispensable for maintaining the competitive advantage of our core business.
Innovation Is Born in Workplaces Where There Is Mutual Respect for Diverse Personalities
and Values
Daito Trust has, for example, since July 2021, started implementing internal systems that take sexual orientation into consideration such as a “Family-ship System” that regards relationships of same-sex partners as being equivalent to marriage and allowing the use of a “chosen name” in place of one’s actual name for work purposes. We are continuing to promote measures to support employees in self-development and in taking on challenges under our New Five-Year Plan, such as by developing new businesses that can utilize acquired qualifications and expanding personnel evaluations related to sustainability (non-sales performance evaluations).

A Board of Directors Containing Open and
Free Discussions
Daito Trust’s Board of Directors features a well-rooted style of decision-making built upon a free-flowing exchange of views that has no barriers between the standing directors and the outside directors. Having a Board of Directors be a place for open and free discussion is crucial to ensuring a company is being steered in the right direction. The Company’s Board of Directors is said to be highly regarded when it comes to effectiveness. Arguments regarding each proposal are thoroughly discussed by the Board, and even if the proposal was passed by a resolution at the Executive Management Meeting, it may be set aside for further review and re- examination following discussions by the Board.
Furthermore, the outside directors have a diverse set of backgrounds, so they can provide effective advice for the executive organization from perspectives based on their various careers combined with their individual insight and wisdom. In my opinion, this is a strength of Daito Trust’s governance system. In my own case, capitalizing on my experience of having been engaged in the financial industry for a long time, I probe into whether risks that are generally overlooked are pointed out and looked into further, especially in the area of investment proposals. I also try to ask in-depth questions such as, is the investment well-aligned with Company profits? Does it earn a return commensurate with the risks involved? And, what is our judgment of the valuation of a proposal or a marketable security? The most recent
project was the acquisition of the real estate developer INVALANCE Ltd. in 2020, which was put forth as a measure to strengthen our core businesses while also backing Tokyo metropolitan area strategy. I think this was a good use of M&A. When it comes to investment projects, the post- investment follow-up is also important, including the case of the INVALANCE acquisition. The Company will exercise its oversight responsibility, as it has before for the domestic and overseas investment projects handled up through the present.
Promoting Sustainability through
Our Business Activities
Daito Group businesses that are directly connected to the social foundation, such as housing and living, including rental housing, have high affinity with the sustainability approach and provide higher earnings. In my view, a business model can exist whereby making profits leads straight to social contribution. Taking advantage of this type of business environment, in FY2020 the Company designated the Daito Group’s Seven Material Issues, directed at promoting sustainability management. The work being done on these material issues is currently staged at examining KPIs in ongoing discussions at the Board of Directors. In order that the designated material issues be placed under management, the Board must continue discussion and follow up on the essential tasks of specifying
the appropriate KPIs and incorporating them into management plans, as well as constructing a framework in

which their advancement is highly effective.
In the times ahead, we need each and every employee, from the management team to those at local work sites, to not only pick up knowledge of sustainability, but also ensure that a culture of ownership will be fostered through actions and implementation. Our future goal is that the tenants living in the 1.16 million rental housing units in Japan managed by Daito Trust, and possibly members of the broader society as well, will see themselves as "contributing to achieving SDGs by living in rental housing from Daito Trust Construction." The Daito Group has a culture of hope where each time targets are set, everyone presses ahead in unity. Now that the medium- to long-term material issues have been clearly stated, I look hopefully at the ability of the Group to move forward as one.
Toward Achieving the New Five-Year Plan
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some business segments could not make progress in line with their initial plans stipulated in the New Five-Year Plan. However, we have been actively taking on the challenge of coming up with new initiatives, such as promoting online activity as well as
developing and selling new products that address environmental issues. Although we are still in an era of uncertainty, I would like to see us move forward and utilize change as a business opportunity. In addition, new challenges make a robust governance system that supports these efforts necessary. In FY2020, in order to preserve a place where outside directors can exchange views during the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a board of outside directors. The outside directors share their sense of the issues among each other, and when there are opinions and advice that should be discussed, they share them with the full Board of Directors. By squarely performing these roles and others, they seek to raise the Board’s effectiveness.
Toward achieving the New Five-Year Plan, one of the major roles the Board of Directors should assume is to exercise solid oversight of the business segments’ portfolio strategies. From the beginning, the existing businesses have conducted appropriate analysis and monitoring of new investments and businesses, and through exhaustive discussions they have sought to strengthen their business portfolios and, as a result, improve profitability.

Insights from a Newly Appointed Outside Director
Supporting Innovation at the Daito Group from the Dual Viewpoints of “Offense” and “Defense” Currently, as a lawyer, I support risk management work such as corporate financial law and compliance. Meanwhile, as a certified public accountant, I have also been engaged in auditing and consulting work at publicly traded companies. I believe that my strengths come from the ability to judge a matter using the dual viewpoints of a lawyer’s "defense" point of view and "offense" point of view that considers business from a finance and accounting perspective. Through its New Five-Year Plan, the Company is now engaged in strengthening its framework for expanding its business domains and enhancing governance from an “offense” point of view. If advice only came from a “defense” point of view that considers legal risk, then it would not be able to achieve these goals. Because of this, I believe my expected role is to evaluate the things that the Company wishes to realize from a financial perspective and provide proactive support for things that can be judged as not being a problem, while considering legal risks. Since my appointment in June 2021, I have been participating in the Company’s Board of Directors’ meetings. My impression
has been that it is easy to speak out at these meetings. In general, outside directors are expected to have specialized
views and advice based on both their academic training and work experience. In the case of the Daito Group, however, this goes beyond the views of a specialist, and advice is expected from a broad perspective of someone outside the Company. It is a well-established atmosphere where directors find it easy to share their thoughts. For this reason, the outside directors communicate without reservation, and if necessary, issue forth proposals. This makes Board of Directors’ meetings quite lively.
We are now in the middle of major changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes cover people’s perspectives on value and behavior patterns as well as changes in the market environment, including the current restructuring of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I believe these types of changes should be grasped by companies as opportunities for innovation. To begin, regarding the recently issued New Five-Year Plan, I will also evaluate innovations advanced by the Company from my dual viewpoints, which I believe is necessary for the sake of the Company’s sustainable growth. This is a role which I plan to fulfill and will actively support. To all stakeholders, I would be grateful if you could watch attentively and look forward to the upcoming innovations by the Daito Group.

Management Material Issue 4: Corporate Governance
 Corporate Governance Basic Policy
Our basic policies on corporate governance are maximizing the corporate value of the Daito Group for our shareholders and all other stakeholders, and making our management more efficient and transparent. To do so, we have separated management’s decision-making and supervisory framework from the work execution and established a framework that
enables rapid and efficient management and business execution.
We also work to achieve highly transparent management through the participation of outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members.

 Director Compensation System
Regarding the compensation system for directors, for the purpose of having shared interests with shareholders and enhancing sustainable corporate value, we have set a basic policy founded on a performance-linked model with sound incentives in effect. Built on top of this basic policy, directors’ compensation is made up of basic compensation, which is a fixed amount, and bonus and stock compensation, which tracks business performance. Over the medium- to long-term, if the Company meets 100% of its business performance targets, then compensation is set in the proportion of 1:2–3:2–3 for basic compensation, bonuses, and stock
compensation, respectively.
Furthermore, with the goal of strengthening our shared interests with shareholders, we have introduced a stock compensation system, which started in June 2019, that features a clearly defined linkage between directors’ compensation, Company performance, and shareholder value. At the same time, we have been raising awareness of the system’s contribution to improving business performance and enhancing corporate value over the medium- to long-term. (The system does not apply to outside directors.)

We ensure fair rental supply planning and rent setting at the Group through our nationwide network of 1,037 rental marketing professionals (as of June 2021) at 155 sites across the country, who collate trends in rental housing supply and demand and rents. These trends are then managed and analyzed using our unique centralized land and rental property information management system, DK MAP. We also ensure this fairness by thoroughly revising areas where supply is suspended on an annual basis. The mission of our Group is to supply buildings that maximize the value of the land they are on. Recently, with a backdrop of concern about oversupply of rental housing, our aim is for a system in which we supply the necessary buildings where they are needed by investigating and analyzing the land of each landowner from all angles. Our New Five-Year Plan aims at more objective and appropriate local area marketing by further enhancing our existing initiatives while also using a rent appraisal system that utilizes artificial intelligence.

In line with our Corporate Philosophy of realizing extensive and effective use of limited land, we will continue working to expand the scope of utilizing our expertise that we have accumulated through our specialization in rental housing. We are, for example, progressing with new product development that addresses the changing needs of each plot of land, such as with the September 2020 launch of our first wooden warehouse flagship product, DK HUT, and November 2020 launch of the first one-story detached rental house in the cocoDaTe series, “cocoDaTe One’s.” Also, in July 2021, INVALANCE Ltd., which became a member of the Group in FY2020, launched a crowdfunding-style real estate investment vehicle, 72CROWD., where investors can start investing from ¥10,000. Our policy, under our New Five-Year Plan, is to expand and enhance services that have high synergies with our core business, such as promoting small-lot real estate securitization.

The Group has endeavored to provide services that utilize the Group’s technologies, resources, and economies of scale. For example, since October 2015, the credit card payment service that specializes in rental housing, provided by House Payment Co., Ltd., has been available not only for buildings under Group whole-building leases, but also for buildings handled by real estate companies nationwide. This is contributing to the proliferation of credit card settlement in the real estate sector. Moreover, in October 2021, we started a business that introduces customers considering building a custom-built home to local builders and design offices, taking advantage of our strong relationships with these partners.
Provision of value to our stakeholders and the construction and real estate industries enhances the value of our Group and helps to revitalize these industries as a whole. Going forward, we will continue aiming to expand our business domains and provide value to society by utilizing the Group’s technologies and expertise, such as external sales of call centers for real estate companies and inspection business utilizing our design and construction expertise.

Providing Quality and Socially Sustainable Buildings
The Group is developing products and technologies that can contribute to solving various issues such as risks in the rental housing business, social issues, and environmental issues. Some of the technologies we have developed are as a result of our former specialization in rental housing. These include development of highly secure memory keys that do not require the key cylinder to be exchanged each time there is a change in tenants, and highly durable and self-cleaning siding panels that are cleaned by rain. Our Group will continue to develop technologies to maintain the asset values of buildings. We are also focusing on responding to rapidly changing needs, such as developing and selling rental housing suited for teleworking, where demand has significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our goal, in our New Five-Year Plan, is to make an even greater contribution to various social issues, including issues faced by our landowners, and provide buildings that are needed for the long term. To this end, we are undertaking various initiatives to solve environmental and social issues through our rental housing products and through the renewal and value enhancement of old and underused buildings by strengthening our rebuilding, remodeling, and renovation businesses.

As a Local Company, We Help Make Neighborhoods Better Places to Live
The Group has, to date, provided various lifestyle services to landowners and tenants to achieve reliable, secure, and stable rental management. We will also, in future, take on new business challenges that will enhance the value of neighborhoods and the assets of our landowners by focusing on revitalization of the neighborhoods in which we operate as a community-based total lifestyle support company. Under our New Five-Year Plan, we will actively participate in projects such as PFI* and private tendering projects to repair and
provide facilities needed by neighborhoods, and will improve working conditions by promoting our shared space business launched in 2019. The Group will also contribute to creating neighborhoods where people want to keep living by serving as a hub for connecting information and services with the neighborhoods and people that need them. Specifically, we will improve the value, convenience, and livability of neighborhoods such as by building platforms that can be used by non-tenants, providing various lifestyle services, and utilization of renewable energy. Moreover, we will accelerate Group-wide DX to ensure we can stably and rapidly deliver these initiatives and services.

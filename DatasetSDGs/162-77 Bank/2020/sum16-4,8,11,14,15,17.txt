As a member of the local community, we actively participate in community events to deepen our interaction with regional society.
The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum
The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum was opened in celebration of the 120th anniversary of our founding and in gratitude for the many years of support we have received from people in the region. The museum introduces topics, including the history and roles of money, the birth and development of banks, and the industry and economy in Miyagi Prefecture and Japan in a manner that is fun and easy to understand.
 The museum was partly renewed in March 2019 as part of the 140th Anniversary Project, and new features, including a projection mapping and a children’s area, have been added to introduce the relationship between The 77 Bank and the community, the relationship between money and daily life, and The three major business operations of banks. In FY2020, approximately 2,960 people, including students from a total of 72 elementary and junior high schools, visited the museum.
  Participation in regional events
During the Sendai Aoba Festival held every May, we participate in the Yamaboko Parade, which is the highlight of the festival. At the traditional Dontosai Festival that marks koshogatsu every January, we make the traditional hadakamairi (naked shrine visit) to Osaki Hachimangu Shrine wearing only light clothing.
One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign
The One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign is in an effort to deepen interactions with the region as a member of the local community and raise the awareness of the Bank employees regarding social contribution. These activities were conducted at all of the Bank’s 142 branches (excluding branches that only offer transfers) after selecting social contribution activities in accordance with the Bank’s six themes.

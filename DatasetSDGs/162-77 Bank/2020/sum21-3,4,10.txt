■ Contribution to Social Welfare
We contribute to social welfare by cooperating with fundraising activities and blood donation projects.
77 Caring Fund Raising Committee
The 77 Caring Fund Raising Committee was established in 1994 by the executives and employees of the Bank for the purpose of donating to social welfare projects and facilities in appreciation of the support received from the local community to that time.
 During FY2020, a total of ¥3.33 million was donated to 10 social welfare facilities recommended by the Miyagi Prefecture Social Welfare Council and 14 volunteer groups. The donated funds are used to cover facility repair costs, running costs for volunteer activities, and other expenses. In addition, a total of ¥1.71 million was donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society in response to Typhoon No. 19 in 2019.
Small Kindness Movement
Since the establishment of the Miyagi Prefecture Headquarters of the Small Kindness Movement, the Bank has been involved in the planning and operation of these activities, while serving as the secretariat for 44 years.
 The Summer Sendai Cleaning Campaign is conducted each year prior to opening of the Sendai Tanabata Festival. Each year, we donate wheelchairs to social welfare facilities in the prefecture, and make visits to welfare facilities for the elderly and hold entertainment performances. In addition, we donate flower seeds to elementary schools in the prefecture, and gather used stamps and donate them to stamp collection organizations.

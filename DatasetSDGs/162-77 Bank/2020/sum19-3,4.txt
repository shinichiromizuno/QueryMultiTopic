“The best part of playing badminton is that you don't have to use all your strength, but use your brain to play. I enjoy working on tactics observing the opponent’s moves,” says Ayako Suzuki, who is a member of our badminton club. She won the 2017 Para-Badminton World Championships’ upper limb impairment SU5 class, in addition to winning many other international competitions, and she has been ranked high in the world for several years. She is expected to be one of the leading para-sport athletes in Japan.
   Although she once retired, she returned after a five-year absence when para-badminton was adopted as an official sporting event in the global para-sport competition. After winning her first domestic tournament following her return, she became a member of the Bank's badminton club, as her high school coach was coaching at the Bank at the time.
 She usually works at the head office in the morning and practices at our Nakayama Gymnasium in the afternoon. “This is the first time for me to belong to a company's sports club, but I am grateful for the environment that allows me to concentrate on competition. I hope to live up to the expectations of those around me," says Suzuki. On the team, she sometimes plays together with local junior high school students and ladies' teams. Turning such experience she had never had in her career as an athlete into energy, she strives everyday.  Suzuki’s goal is to be selected for Japan’s national team and to win the gold medal by defeating the Chinese rival. “I'm confident that I can win the gold medal," Suzuki expresses her confidence.

We are actively offering technical trainings, etc., with the hope of helping with the recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake through the promotion of sports.
In September 2019, the Bank’s three sport clubs held joint workshops for first- and second-grade elementary school children and their parents. Approximately 300 participants enjoyed trying baseball, track and field, and badminton.

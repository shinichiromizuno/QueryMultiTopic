Collaboration with 77 Securities
 Interview 05
most suitable proposals, we strive to share information closely between bank and securities companies within the group, such as by having the 77 Bank provide us with information based on its long relationship with customers and by sharing customer needs identified by 77 Securities.
experience, the salespersons make proposals from a new perspective, which draws out the needs of customers and often leads to contracts.
Kobayashi: I also visit the branches I am in charge of and hold study sessions on a regular basis, and I have the impression that the number of motivated employees is increasing. We also hold a newspaper reading session every morning, and I have heard that some employees who went through the Trainees Program from the 77 Bank have been gathering their staff members to read the newspaper after returning to their own branches. I hope that this kind of movement will spread more widely.
Deepening cooperation to even better meet customers’ needs
Hoshi: Originally, as a bank, we made comprehensive proposals based on the asset status of our customers, including life plans for not only them but also their families. In particular, the Minamimachi-dori branch is surrounded by many other banks and securities companies and has many customers with strong interest in investments, so we will continue to deepen our cooperation with 77 Securities to meet a variety of needs.
Kobayashi: In general, I feel that we are cooperating well with the 77 Bank, but the degree of cooperation varies from branch to branch, so I think there is room for the 77 Bank Group as a whole to further deepen cooperation. Through our study sessions, daily sales activities, and other communication with our employees, we will continue to educate them on the importance of cooperation between the Bank and the securities company, and we will do our best to be of further assistance to our customers.

Hoshi: With the establishment of 77 Securities, I now have many opportunities to propose asset management to customers who have not been active in asset management. Since there are many customers who have no experience in securities investment, I try to explain the difference between deposits and investments and the risks involved in investment in simple terms, avoiding too much technicality, and try to provide more understandable and careful explanations, thereby practicing the philosophy of “customer-oriented business management” set forth by the 77 Bank Group.
makes investment proposals to the customer, if necessary. In the event of a major change in the market, we will promptly provide the necessary information in cooperation with our staff at 77 Securities.
Kobayashi: In the three years since 77 Securities opened, we have been making investment proposals to customers and providing after-sales services under the motto “Customer First.” Against the backdrop of social trends such as the “shift from savings to asset formation” and the government’s encouragement of asset formation through stock investment, we have seen an increase in customer interest in asset management, and we have also seen an increase in requests for products with highly specialized themes, such as investment trusts related to the next-generation 5G communication standard. In order to meet the diverse needs of our customers and provide them with the
Focus on training employees to improve the quality of proposals.
Hoshi: At our bank, there are more and more opportunities for education, such as training sessions within the bank to improve the quality of proposals to customers. At the Minamimachi-dori branch, where I work, we hold study sessions twice a month, inviting speakers from 77 Securities, to learn about the market and share information about our customers. In addition, the Bank encourages employees to obtain qualifications related to the sale of financial products, such as FP and CFP, and many employees participate in in-house study sessions to raise their awareness of the need to acquire specialized knowledge. Most of the employees at the branch are also studying hard for the next exam.
 In addition, there is a training program called the Trainee Program from the Bank to 77 Securities, in which trainees attend the on-site proposal sessions of 77 Securities sales staff to acquire skills in proposing and explaining products to customers. Based on the knowledge gained through the traineeProvision of services that are appropriate for customers

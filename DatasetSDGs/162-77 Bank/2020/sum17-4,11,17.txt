■ Supporting Cultural Activities
To contribute to the promotion of region culture, we sponsor many cultural activities, festivals, and events.
77 Starlight Symphony
The Bank has held a charity concert named the 77 Starlight Symphony since 1991 in order to enhance the experience of the Sendai Pageant of Starlight, which is becoming established as a winter tradition, as a member of the city.
 In December 2019, Kohmi Hirose was invited as a guest, and performed various hit songs with the backing of the Sendai Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, fundraising activities were conducted to support earthquake reconstruction and operation of the Sendai Pageant of Starlight.
77 Fureai Concert
The 77 Fureai Concert has been held continuously since FY1993 in cooperation with the Sendai Philharmonic Orchestra, in order to give students from regional elementary schools and junior high schools the opportunity to experience a live orchestra.
 Concerts were held at Wakuya Junior High School (Wakuya Town) and Kakuda Citizen’s Center (Kakuda City) in FY2020, where approximately 970 people including children, students, and family members viewed a powerful musical performance and enjoyed introductions of the orchestral instruments and conductor experiences.

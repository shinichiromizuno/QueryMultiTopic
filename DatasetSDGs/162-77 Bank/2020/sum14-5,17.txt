Corporate Governance Initiatives
■ Basic stance toward corporate governance
We will work to strengthen and enhance corporate governance in accordance with the following basic stance.
• In accordance with the Bank Creed, which is our basic principle of management, we will operate business that give constant consideration to the public mission of a regional bank — contributing to the development of the regional economy and society — through banking operations.
• We will improve the transparency of management and the appropriateness of processes and work together appropriately with stakeholders including the regional society, clients, and shareholders for the Bank’s sustained growth and improvements in corporate value over the medium- to long-term.
■ Improvements in governance
The Bank transitioned in June 2017 from a company with the Board of Corporate Auditors to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee to improve corporate value through further enhancement of corporate governance, which was followed by initiatives for developing further effective corporate governance structure through appointing Outside Directors and female Directors.Director

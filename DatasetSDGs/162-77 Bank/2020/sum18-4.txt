■ Supporting Financial Education
We support financial education by utilizing the The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum in the head office and experiential programs.

A course provided by The 77 Bank has been held at the Faculty of Business Administration at Tohoku Gakuin University since FY2012 for the purpose of promoting social contributions to the region through education and research contributing to the development of the regional economy and human resources.
   This course is taught by an employee of the Bank, and covers topics such as specific details of bank operations, recent financial trends, and the role of regional financial institutions. The course was held for the 9th time in FY2020, and the course in September 2019 was participated by approximately 290 students.

The roots of the 77 Bank,s uniqueness 1. Deep connection with Eiichi Shibusawa
Eiichi Shibusawa, a businessman who was known as “the father of Japanese capitalism,” had a strong interest in the Tohoku region through Munenari Date, who provided him with the opportunity to enter the Ministry of Finance. At the time, there was no bank based in Miyagi Prefecture and for this reason, when The 77th National Bank was established, Shibusawa not only provided investment and various advice regarding such matters as the nature of the banking business and basic management concepts, he also seconded exceptional talent including Keishi Endo (the second and fourth President) and Seikei Ono from The Dai-Ichi Bank Limited. Furthermore, Shibusawa provided both mental and practical support to the Bank over many years, including his transfer of The Dai-Ichi Bank Limited’s banking business in Miyagi Prefecture to The 77th National Bank and his appointment as Advisor in 1908. Eiichi Shibusawa’s spirit of “harmony of morality and the economy” lives on today in the line from the Bank Creed, which describes the Bank’s management philosophy, that states “the Bank’s progress goes hand in hand with prosperity in the local community.”
2. Trust relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (currently Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.), which was established in May 1878, along with an increase in trading volume, in 1894 designated The 77th National Bank as the only bank among many banks to handle receipts and disbursements operations (*) for all trades of shares cleared. The reasons for this designation include a recommendation from Eiichi Shibusawa and the provision of relief financing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange during a stock market crash caused by a recession when Seikei Ono, who became the fifth president, was manager of the Tokyo Branch, which rescued the exchange. Over the next 120 years and to the present,
The 77 Bank, Ltd. remains the only regional bank designated as a funds settlement bank, alongside the mega banks.
* Receipts and disbursements operations refers to account processing for the trading floor of a stock exchange

 The Economy and Potential of Miyagi Prefecture
   Miyagi Prefecture, where further potential lies unnoticed
Although Miyagi Prefecture experienced significant damage due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, particularly in coastal areas, reconstruction projects have now reached the final phase thanks
to joint efforts by the public and private sectors.
 In addition, with the expansion of major automotive and electronics companies,
the manufacturing industry is expected to become a driver for post-recovery economic growth while economic concentration is advancing owing to active construction investment related to redevelopment projects in Sendai.

Introduction
We would like to express our deepest sympathy to all those who have been affected by the spread of COVID-19 infection.
 In addition to setting up a loan consultation desk and providing information on government and prefectural systematic loans, the Bank has made it a priority from early on to hear directly from customers about their circumstances and requests. Moreover, we have set up support teams and dispatched specialized personnel to branches to enable speedy decision-making on loans.  The contents of our consultations have become more complex as time goes by. We are now entering a phase where we need to provide multifaceted advice not only on
cash flow but also on how to continue our clients’ businesses.
 We will continue to work hand in hand with our customers to solve their problems by providing as much support as possible, including by improving BS and PL.
 In the midst of these activities, we have reaffirmed our role as a bank. Each and every one of us feels strongly that our mission is to support the development of all people, including local businesses, individuals, and local governments, in a way that can only be done by a regional financial institution that deeply understands the characteristics and background of this community.
A bank’s mission is to serve its customers. We Aiming aim to further improve

This means providing services not only in the traditional areas of deposits, loans, and foreign exchange but also in nonfinancial areas, including consulting services, which is also the aim of our medium-term management plan, concluding this year “‘For The Customer & For The Future’: The Best Consulting Bank Project.”
   In addition to the impact of the novel coronavirus, the environment surrounding banks is becoming more severe every year. Regional financial institutions are faced with the challenge of coping with new threats, such as declining profitability due to negative interest rate policies and other factors, a shrinking market over the medium to long term due to the declining birth rate and aging population, and reduced profit opportunities due to competition with other banks and industries.
 In Miyagi Prefecture, which is our main business base, the recovery is slowing down, as production and housing investment are weakening in a rebound to the demand for

 Of these, the major theme of regional revitalization included in the regional economy vitalization strategy contains many issues that must be addressed continuously in the future.  The main objective of regional revitalization is to disperse the population from the Tokyo metropolitan area to other regions of Japan. The four pillars of regional revitalization are efforts to halt the current situation of the increasing concentration of people in Tokyo. In order to make the most of these four pillars, two major points are continuity over the medium to long term and cooperation with local governments.
 The other key point, cooperation with local governments, can be realized by resolving issues such as differences in the systems and equipment environment of each local government. Currently, we are at the stage of creating a platform for cooperation, with the 77 Bank acting as a secretariat, holding study sessions, supporting matching with private companies, and offering our videoconference system.  We would like to overcome these issues while looking at both the short term and the long term to realize regional revitalization.

Message from the President
Digitalization and human resource development to create ideal services for the future of banking
About Corporate Slogan and Logo
  Due in part to the impact of COVID-19, the need for internet banking and cashless payment has increased, and digitalization is accelerating. For example, the 77 Bank application for smartphones has become dramatically more convenient, as all customers can now use it without having to fill out an application form. I believe that not only individual but also corporate customers will be able to make more use of digitalization as a way to solve a shortage of manpower and eliminate waste in business operations.
useful to our customers and that we can improve our services by providing both human and digital services.
 In order to further enhance the expertise of our consulting sales staff, we have created an environment where many of them can take advantage of training programs and online courses. The “President’s School,” which will be launched this year for mid-career employees in their 30s, is one of the initiatives.
Slogan
Logo
More than ever, and forever, with our region.
Concept
Our slogan expresses our commitment to our customers. We are committed to moving forward with our region, growing with our region, and creating the future with our region. We will do this by providing highly specialized solutions that harness the collective strengths of the Group while valuing the traditions, trust, and regional foundations that we have established over the years.
A simple design that can be recognized at a glance as representing the 77 Bank Group, with a ring symbolizing our connections with our region and our strong group ties and sense of unity. The logo also promotes the Group’s proactive work on SDG-related initiatives.
Underlying meaning
“More than ever” expresses the mission and shared values of the 77 Bank Group to always seek to deliver better solutions for customers and make greater contributions to the prosperity of local communities than we have made before, by providing the highly specialized solutions that customers have come to expect from us.
 “And forever” includes the dual meaning of “from now on” and “up till now” and expresses the 77 Bank Group’s commitment to building everlasting relations with local communities and customers.
 “With our region” expresses the Group’s commitments to contribute to regional development and always put customers first in corporated in the principle “Elevation ofthe Spirit of Service” stated in our Bank Creed.
The colorful ring, which expands as it turns, is composed of the 17 colors used to represent the SDGs and symbolizes the comprehensive capabilities and solutions customers have come to expect from the 77 Bank Group as well as the Group’s constant tackling of new challenges to create a bright future for the region, in line with the principle in our Bank Creed of “Elevation of the Spirit of Service”. The ideal is to be able to choose between face-to-face and digital services at any given time, taking advantage of the security, adjustability, and flexibility of human services and the convenience and efficiency of digital services. We are working to achieve this ideal model.
 We are also working to create an organization where all generations can play an active role, regardless of gender or environment. I believe that if we can provide a workplace where people can work even when they have limited working hours, such as while raising a child or caring for a family member, we will be able to understand the feelings of our customers more, which will eventually lead to higher productivity.
 In this sense, human resource development is an indispensable backbone for us to approach the best consulting bank. We believe that we need people in order to be most77 Bank Group SDG Declaration to achieve goals together with local communities
 In the future, we would like to restructure our social contributions from the perspective of this declaration and work together with local communities toward the realization of a sustainable society without turning a blind eye to our societal role.
In July 2020, we announced the 77 Bank Group SDG Declaration. This is in support of the purpose of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), which are in line with our philosophy of desiring communal prosperity and serving local communities.
   I believe this declaration will help unify the consciousness of the entire organization and our group as well as help us discipline ourselves. From the perspective of the SDGs, banks have the potential to influence the direction of society through their investments and loans. Therefore, we are also disclosing our lending policy, which states that we will not take any action that would have a negative impact on society.77 Bank Group SDG Declaration~More than ever, and forever, with our region.~
The 77 Bank Group, in keeping with the philosophy of the Bank Creed passed down from our founders—“The Bank’s progress goes hand in hand with prosperity in the local community”—aims to contribute to the future of the region and the realization of a sustainable society by working toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) on a Group-wide basis.1. Revitalization of the regional economy
We aim to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society through consulting with, and building partnerships with, local public organizations and corporate and individual customers.
2. Responding to global warming and climate change
Through our responses to climate change, we will contribute to the protection of Earth from destruction and contribute to urban development that is more in harmony with nature.
3. Encouraging and supporting the activities of our employees
We are creating an organization where each and every employee and director can engage in diverse range of activities.
4. Advancing corporate governance
We will collaborate appropriately with our stakeholders to strengthen and enhance corporate governance.

THE 77 BANK INTEGRATED REPORT 16
Connecting “change at the Bank” to trust, security, and regional development
Exploring ways to provide support beyond the framework of finance
Going forward, we will continue to go back to the basics of “the role of a bank” and pursue how we can meet customer needs, generate sustainable profits, and be useful to our customers while maintaining soundness. We believe that by responding quickly to the changing times and upgrading our organization, individuals, and initiatives, we will be able to contribute to our local communities.
 The recent response to COVID-19 has made me keenly aware of the importance of corporate financial strength. I also feel that it is important to continue to devise and make efforts to increase profits even in a difficult environment, and to work on improving productivity through efficiency.
 The Bank’s role is to provide the local community with management resources in the form of people, goods, money, information, and time. In September 2020, we plan to enter the recruitment business, and we hope to develop together with the local community while exploring ways to provide support beyond the framework of finance.
 We will continue to deepen our relationship with the local community, and as a local financial institution, we will contribute to the development of the local economy by providing created value to the local community, customers, employees, and shareholders. Your continued support will be most appreciated.

Striving to solve the issues of quality assurance and manpower shortage on the front line of manufacturing.
I was assigned to Tohoku Electronics Industry Co., Ltd. with headquarters in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture for one year under the Local Company Trainee program that started in 2018. I was assigned to the Quality Assurance Department, where I dealt with automobile manufacturers and interacted with manu- facturing sites to ensure the quality of automobile-related parts. I was interested in the manufacturing industry, including automobiles and machinery, and I thought I had acquired some prior knowledge before I was transferred to the company, but I had to make a series of discoveries in the field and gained a lot of insights.
One of the things that left a deep impression on me was the strictness of quality control. The automobile manufacturer required us to improve quality down to the smallest invisible details and to thoroughly eliminate unnecessary costs. In order to meet these demands, we repeatedly reviewed and improved our processes and other aspects of our operations while listening to feedback from the front line. In addition, although Tohoku Electronics Industry has about 1,000 employees in the entire group, I was forced to be keenly aware of the issue of the shortage of manpower at the manufacturing front line. I believe that these valuable experiences as a trainee at a local company can be utilized in my current work. I am currently working in the Corporate Support Office, providing support mainly to custom- ers in the fishery processing industry in the coastal areas of the prefecture that are still on the road to recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Although the fields and products we handle are different from those of the company to which I was assigned, I believe that the fundamentals of manufacturing are the same. In addition, there are many customers who are facing issues such as quality assurance and labor shortage in the field of fishery processing. My future goal is to contribute to such customers with the specialized knowledge I have acquired on the program and to solve their problems by making proposals that take into account their front line of manufacturing behind the numbers.

Service development from the user’s point of view, learned in the cutting-edge field.
From December 2017 to December 2019, I was assigned for two years to Japan Digital Design ,Inc., a FinTech company that provides services that integrate finance and IT, where I worked on two major tasks. The first was system development. I oversaw the programming of the business automation system RPA, which is also being introduced at our bank, and designed the process for managing it.
The other task was the service planning for digital currency. We worked together with external organizations to design products, procedures for payment, user screen transitions, and legal and regulatory checks. In particular, 2019 is the first year of the “cashless era” in Japan, a time of large-scale initiatives, and it was a great learning experience for me to be able to experience this major turning point firsthand. Cashless is one of the major themes at our bank, and I hope to make use of my experience.
 I learned a lot about digital technology by working in the field of FinTech, but the most important thing I realized was to think from the user’s perspective first. For example, if the system is for internal use, it must be easy for employees to use, and if it is for digital currency, it must be easy for customers to use otherwise, the equipment alone is meaningless. In particular, I feel that until now, some systems have been designed primarily for the convenience of the bank, and I would like to review them once again and change them to systems that focus on the convenience of customers. I also believe that more open discussions involving other departments and more flexible ideas will lead to better services for our customers.

 Sendai Haranomachi Branch CEO, MAKABE GIKEN Co., Ltd. Kosuke Takeo Masahiro Makabe
The company’s technology is attracting attention both domestically and internationally. Recently, the company’s excellent powder manufacturing technology has been highly evaluated, and the company has been conducting R&D and developing new businesses in cooperation with major private companies.
  Equipment for manufacturing gas atomized powder, which is the material for metal 3D printers. The demand for this material has been increasing in recent years, and MAKABE GIKEN has been developing and manufacturing it for over 30 years.
We conduct appropriate business evaluations of the business content and growth potential of clients in various life stages, while appropriately grasping and analyzing the current state and issues of the regional economy and industry as we actively engage in business evaluations that provide funds smoothly and proposals for solutions to resolve issues.
We interviewed Mr. Makabe, CEO of MAKABE GIKEN Co., Ltd. which manufactures equipment for developing new materials using Japan’s leading technology, about his impressions and results of our consulting services.
Makabe: MAKABE GIKEN is mainly engaged in the develop- ment and manufacture of equipment for researching metal materials and the materials themselves. One of our main products in recent years has been gas atomized powder production equipment for use in 3D printers for metals. We have been manufacturing these products for more than 30 years and provide high-quality powder production equipment. This is a very niche field, but Mr. Takeo has been visiting our company since before I became the CEO in 2019 to deepen his understanding.
Takeo: Even though I was young and not knowledgeable, you took a lot of time to teach me in detail. It helped me understand the value of your company, which I could not understand just

 by looking at numbers on a desk. I feel that I was able to provide funding and other support thanks to that. In particular, I was convinced that the development and technological capabilities that you have cultivated over your long history are unrivaled and will be required in a variety of fields in the coming digital age. I have been working with Mr. Makabe for about a year and a half on the succession of the business, and we are only in the final stages of transferring assets and developing the internal management system, but the first thing we did was to develop the financial foundation of the company.
Makabe: That was one of the issues that I felt we needed to address. Since the company’s founding, we have been very much a manufacturing-driven company, and we have never had a solid business strategy in place. In addition, the company is currently going through a transition period. For a long time, our company has been receiving most of its orders from universities and other research institutions, but with the reduction of research expenses, we must now accelerate our expansion into the private sector. Thus, we asked the 77 Bank to help us develop a strategy for financial management and sales channel development necessary for this initiative. You even went so far as to suggest cost setting.
Takeo: As we started working with Mr. Makabe on formulating the business strategy, we felt his enthusiasm for the kind of company he wanted MAKABE GIKEN to be in the future, and this strengthened our desire to respond as the main bank to his expectations. As for the cost setting, I think it has been difficult to determine the appropriate price in the absence of competing products, but after we estimated the value from various perspectives, we suggested that it would be possible to set a higher price for such an excellent and rare technology.
Makabe: In the past, we often took on projects based on the price offered by research institutes, but now that we have an objective evaluation from the outside, we have one standard. In addition, the visualization of our finances has helped us to clarify the path to our sales targets, which has motivated our employees and made them more cost-conscious. Recently, we received an order for manufacturing equipment from France, and we hope to increase our business with Europe, the U.S.,
and other foreign countries in the future, and to receive help in the areas of compliance and legal affairs overseas.
Takeo: Our bank has an extensive platform for overseas business, from credit inquiries to legal risk management, so we can provide a one-stop service. We are no longer in an era when banks only deal with funds. We will continue to meet our clients’ expectations based on our day-to-day relationship with them.
 Supporting the company’s development by encouraging expansion to the private sector, backed up by business strategies.

■ M&A Cases
In order to meet the needs of our customers, we utilize our extensive network to provide support from consultation to the closing of M&A transactions.
 At Branch A, the M&A specialist took the lead in proposing to Company A, a fishery processor that was considering closing down its business due to the absence of a successor, that the company hand over its business through M&A with a view to utilizing outside specialized organizations. However, there was no progress on selecting a candidate, and the decision to close the business was being made.
 At that point, Branch B identified the needs of Company B, another fishery processor, to expand sales channels and secure human resources through M&A with a business feasibility assessment, and information coordination (needs matching) between the two branches and the head office was speedily carried out to realize the M&A.
 As a result of this M&A, Company B was able to expand its seafood processing business by acquiring Company A’s raw material suppliers and sales routes, and Company A was able to maintain its business and employment rather than simply closing down.  Company B is currently preparing to further expand its overseas business of Tohoku’s food culture (processed marine products, etc.).

We have arranged syndicated loan project finance for the largest wind power generation project in Miyagi Prefecture.
 JRE Miyagi Kami, a limited liability company in which Japan Renewable Energy Corporation has an equity stake, will be the main contractor for the project, which will construct 10 large wind turbines in Kami, Kami District, Miyagi Prefecture. After the start of commercial operation, all electricity will be sold to Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc.
We believe that this project will contribute to the “Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Plan” formulated by Miyagi Prefecture with the aim of increasing the introduction of renewable energy and improving the self-sufficiency ratio of electricity. In order to support the promotion of renewable energy projects and the revitalization of the local economy, a syndicated loan will be formed by regional banks in Tohoku to provide project finance for this 42.0 MW-class wind power generation project—one of the largest in scale in Miyagi Prefecture.
Banks in the six prefectures of Tohoku (Aomori Bank, Akita Bank, Bank of Iwate , Toho Bank, and Yamagata Bank, in addition to The 77 Bank) will participate in the project and work toward the scheduled start of commercial operations in April 2023.

The 77 Bank Group members join forces to help customers realize their wishes.
We interviewed Mr. Sato, CEO of Arces Inc., which is working to establish its corporate philosophy and improve its personnel system through consulting by 77 Research and Consulting (77 R&C), a 77 Bank Group company. 
We interviewed Mr. Sato, CEO of Arces Inc., which is working to establish its corporate philosophy and improve its personnel system through consulting by 77 Research and Consulting (77 R&C),
a 77 Bank Group company.
Arces Inc., is a company that develops systems such as weather-related ones. The data provided by our client, the Japan Weather Association, is used in a wide range of fields, including ministries, local governments, media, railroad companies, and road management companies. Recently, we have also developed a system for rockets.
Our company was established in 2010 by becoming independent from a system company headquartered in Tokyo, and we inherited the personnel system as it was. However, as we signed a partnership agreement with a company that was leading the way in Working Style Reform initiatives, and as the number of employees increased, changing the working environment, we began to feel the need to improve our HR system. It was right around this time that Mr. Yamazaki, deputy branch manager of 77 Bank’s Nakakecho branch (currently deputy manager of the Higashi-Sendai branch), introduced us to 77 R&C. So we decided to ask their support.
At first, what we wanted to consult on was the HR system, but 77 R&C suggested that we go beyond that area and first create a corporate philosophy, establish a business strategy, and then develop the HR system accordingly. I was quite convinced by that proposal.
I think the reason we were able to create a corporate philosophy based on the thoughts of our employees was that we were provided with tailor-made solutions to meet the challenges of our organization. Through the process of consulting, including employee surveys and hearings, we were able to deepen communication with our employees and realize that our company was chosen because of the emotional connection between our employees and customers. In the future, we will work with customers to solve various issues on the basis of our corporate philosophy, striving to gain trust by focusing on proposal-based system development while valuing the strong relationship of trust that we have built through our business activities.
We were introduced to Arces Inc., by the Nakakecho branch and had several meetings with the CEO, Mr. Sato. After it had been about 10 years since the transfer of the business, he wanted to improve the personnel system and working environment for further growth. Thus, we proposed the creation of a plan to promote Working Style Reform and a Revision of the Personnel System.
As we interacted with the employees through questionnaires and interviews, we were convinced that we could promote their growth and enhance their sense of fulfillment by facilitating communication between them, which would lead to growth as a company. We discussed various measures with Mr. Sato, and we have supported the presentation of the Working Style Reform Promotion Plan to employees and the Revision of the Personnel System as the next step.
As one of the members of the 77 Bank Group, we will continue to support our customers with solving their business issues in order to live up to their trust.

 Overseas Business Support
The Bank provides overseas business support, including support for overseas expansion, development of overseas marketing channels, and various trade transactions of clients using a broad network led by the Asia Business Support Department, and in coordination with our two representative offices (Shanghai and Singapore), employees deployed abroad in nine cities located in seven countries (regions), and partner overseas financial institutions.

 The spread of the novel coronavirus has become a major issue in considering future overseas business development. When facing a situation such as this, especially in overseas markets, it is important to respond flexibly according to the situation at the time, rather than sticking to one particular approach. We are also working on such response, making efforts to utilize more non-face-to-face approaches in overseas business development, which was based on traffic of people. For example, in the area of sales channel development, we are actively creating overseas contact points using online channels. In cooperation with major cross-border EC management companies and specialized organizations such as the Japan External Trade Organization and SME Support, Japan, we are supporting our customers in introducing non-face-to-face channels and building systems for overseas business development.
Shanghai Representative Office
One of the strengths of our overseas business support is that we are able to provide a one-stop service from start to finish for consultations with customers whose needs vary greatly depending on the type of business and the target country. Our goal is to be a “one-stop shop for all your overseas needs” in our consulting business. In addition to overseas expansion and development of sales channels, we also receive many consultations on the acquisition of overseas human resources due to the declining birth rate and aging population in the Tohoku region.

 In recent years, some of the contents that have been attracting attention from overseas are the high-quality food products of Tohoku. This has been driven by the registration of washoku (Japanese food) as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2013. However, many customers of Tohoku’s primary industry said that it was difficult for them to move forward on a single-company basis when they were aiming to expand overseas. In response to this, we have organized the “Tohoku Food Sola Michi Council” in cooperation with specialized organizations in various fields, such as logistics and insurance, to support the promotion of exports of high-quality and safe food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries products from Tohoku. From a long-term perspective, we believe that by connecting the dots that are products of Tohoku companies and expanding them into a plane of the Tohoku brand as well as by promoting Tohoku’s food culture to the world, we can help businesses increase their sales.

 Despite the constant need for change in overseas business support, our fundamental stance remains unchanged. Unlike megabanks, we have a long history of working with customers who operate businesses in the Miyagi and Tohoku regions. For this reason, we are able not only to track numerical information but also to act on the basis of our firsthand understanding of what our customers are struggling with and what they want to do about it. We will continue to provide the necessary services while keeping pace with each of our customers.

We provide support for asset succession and asset formation from the perspective of our clients, especially senior citizens.
Deputy Manager,
Consulting Promotion Department
Takayuki Endo
As the role of banks shifts from saving to supporting asset building, we provide services that are necessary for customers at various stages of their lives, from cradle to grave. In the Tohoku region, where the population is aging, we are receiving an increasing number of consultations from senior customers, so we use balance sheets to visualize their assets, such as insurance and deposits, as well as consider the life events expected for their families, and we make proposals to help them spend their lives in a more fulfilling manner. In addition, we are also working on inheritance measures. Many customers used to be reluctant to even talk about inheritance planning, but the Great East Japan Earthquake made them to reconsider their ways of life, and I have the impression that the number of customers asking for advice has been increasing for about 10 years. As an agent, we offer “testamentary trust” services, which include the preparation and storage of wills and
the execution of wills prior to the occurrence of inheritance, and “estate liquidation services,” which include the preparation of an inventory of assets after the occurrence of inheritance, to help ensure an amicable and smooth inheritance.
daily basis and visit customers
with our staff members in order
to develop human resources. At
this time, we repeatedly tell our
employees to always think about
whether the proposals from the
bank side are really beneficial to
the customers and whether they
would recommend them to their
parents or family members.
Customers are well aware that
they cannot grow their funds
only by making deposits, but in
Japan, where there are few opportunities for investment education, there is still a lack of understanding about asset management. That’s why we try to provide them with detailed and easy-to-understand explanations. Our bank also holds investment seminars and study groups for customers, to which we invite them to stimulate their interest in and understanding of asset management.
 My mission as a banker is to give back to my hometown. In particular, I believe that providing support for fulfilling lifestyles in old age and smooth succession of property to the next generation are important missions, and I would like to continue to provide honest assistance from the perspective of a customers.

A civil trust is a method that allows an aging trustee to entrust the management of assets (real estate, deposits, etc.) to a trusted family member (trustee) in case the trustee loses the ability to make decisions due to dementia, etc. It is also commonly referred to as a “family trust.” In 2018, we started handling deposit accounts based on civil trust agreements, and in 2019, we started handling “77 Apartment Loans (Civil Trust Account).”

Five Steps from consideration to execution of a civil trust
 In the midst of these developments, two specific needs are growing: inheritance tax countermeasures and asset management for the age of the 100-year life cycle.
 With the inheritance tax revision in 2015, we are receiving many requests for inheritance tax planning, especially from customers who are newly subject to the tax. We provide detailed support for everything from the basic concept of inheritance to succession measures such as the allocation of assets.
 As for “asset management in the age of the 100-year life cycle,” more and more clients are becoming aware of their health expectancy and asking for advice on how to manage their assets while they are still healthy. One of the services that has recently become popular with these customers is the “civil trust” system, which allows them to set up a successor administrator for their real estate in advance in case something happens to them. The number of people using this service is increasing because it is a smooth procedure.
 One of our major themes is to develop human resources within the bank so that we can offer the best solutions to our customers. At our bank, we try to acquire the necessary knowledge and experience through training sessions, role-playing based on case studies, and discussions in which a wide range of people, from branch managers to young employees, participate. In addition, we visit our branches on a

most suitable proposals, we strive to share information closely between bank and securities companies within the group, such as by having the 77 Bank provide us with information based on its long relationship with customers and by sharing customer needs identified by 77 Securities.
experience, the salespersons make proposals from a new perspective, which draws out the needs of customers and often leads to contracts.
Kobayashi: I also visit the branches I am in charge of and hold study sessions on a regular basis, and I have the impression that the number of motivated employees is increasing. We also hold a newspaper reading session every morning, and I have heard that some employees who went through the Trainees Program from the 77 Bank have been gathering their staff members to read the newspaper after returning to their own branches. I hope that this kind of movement will spread more widely.
Deepening cooperation to even better meet customers’ needs
Hoshi: Originally, as a bank, we made comprehensive proposals based on the asset status of our customers, including life plans for not only them but also their families. In particular, the Minamimachi-dori branch is surrounded by many other banks and securities companies and has many customers with strong interest in investments, so we will continue to deepen our cooperation with 77 Securities to meet a variety of needs.
Kobayashi: In general, I feel that we are cooperating well with the 77 Bank, but the degree of cooperation varies from branch to branch, so I think there is room for the 77 Bank Group as a whole to further deepen cooperation. Through our study sessions, daily sales activities, and other communication with our employees, we will continue to educate them on the importance of cooperation between the Bank and the securities company, and we will do our best to be of further assistance to our customers.

Hoshi: With the establishment of 77 Securities, I now have many opportunities to propose asset management to customers who have not been active in asset management. Since there are many customers who have no experience in securities investment, I try to explain the difference between deposits and investments and the risks involved in investment in simple terms, avoiding too much technicality, and try to provide more understandable and careful explanations, thereby practicing the philosophy of “customer-oriented business management” set forth by the 77 Bank Group.
makes investment proposals to the customer, if necessary. In the event of a major change in the market, we will promptly provide the necessary information in cooperation with our staff at 77 Securities.
Kobayashi: In the three years since 77 Securities opened, we have been making investment proposals to customers and providing after-sales services under the motto “Customer First.” Against the backdrop of social trends such as the “shift from savings to asset formation” and the government’s encouragement of asset formation through stock investment, we have seen an increase in customer interest in asset management, and we have also seen an increase in requests for products with highly specialized themes, such as investment trusts related to the next-generation 5G communication standard. In order to meet the diverse needs of our customers and provide them with the
Focus on training employees to improve the quality of proposals.
Hoshi: At our bank, there are more and more opportunities for education, such as training sessions within the bank to improve the quality of proposals to customers. At the Minamimachi-dori branch, where I work, we hold study sessions twice a month, inviting speakers from 77 Securities, to learn about the market and share information about our customers. In addition, the Bank encourages employees to obtain qualifications related to the sale of financial products, such as FP and CFP, and many employees participate in in-house study sessions to raise their awareness of the need to acquire specialized knowledge. Most of the employees at the branch are also studying hard for the next exam.
 In addition, there is a training program called the Trainee Program from the Bank to 77 Securities, in which trainees attend the on-site proposal sessions of 77 Securities sales staff to acquire skills in proposing and explaining products to customers. Based on the knowledge gained through the trainee

financial intermediary services but also consulting services to help our customers solve their various problems. We will continue to make initiatives to promote these initiatives widely so that our customers can make effective use of us.
Mohri: In our initiatives to support the recovery from the earthquake and tsunami, we often said that we wanted to “build back better, not just restore.” This means not just restoring
companies and stores to the state they were in before the disaster, but revitalizing them into a better state with an eye to the future. In response to the current situation, I would like to work with customers to create business revitalization and improvement plans that take into account the next few years and work together with them toward building back better.

■ Reconstruction Support Policy
In view of the massive damage inflicted by the Great East Japan Earthquake, The 77 Bank formulated its “Reconstruction Support Policy” to contribute to the reconstruction and development of the regional economy. The objective of this policy is to fulfill the Bank’s responsibility as a regional financial institution that should work hand-in-hand with the local region, through the provision of financial services and financial intermediary functions aimed at supporting reconstruction efforts of the region and customers.

Responding to the changing needs after COVID-19
Kyono: Six months have passed since the COVID-19 Emergency Support Team was established, and I have the impression that the number of consultations about immediate cash flow—which were overwhelmingly common when the team was first established—have peaked out. Since May, there has been an increase in needs related to post-pandemic services, such as employment-related consultations and the search for ways to change existing business models.
 In the Consulting Sales Department, to which I belong, liaison officers from the headquarters are stationed at core branches in the region, and we try to respond quickly and proactively while strengthening cooperation with the field.
Speedy decision-making and provision of information are essential for responding to emergencies
Mohri: It has been about eight years since I started working on reconstruction support, and we have developed a variety of measures. We have been able to make full use of these experiences in our countermeasures against the spread of the novel coronavirus. For example, the “on-site evaluation” system that we have developed to conduct evaluation close to customers in the affected areas has been reappropriated for us to make quick decisions on the spot. In the future, as in the process of reconstruction support, it is expected that there will be many aspects of making business plans and management improvement plans. In such cases, we will utilize the know-how we have accumulated so far and respond quickly in cooperation with external experts and organizations.
 In addition, it is important to not only wait for consultations from customers but also proactively approach them and provide information. This time, the unforeseen outbreak of COVID-19 caused even latent needs to erupt at once. We will continue to build close relationships with our customers so that we can respond flexibly to their needs even in such an emergency situation.
The true value of our bank is being tested. This is where our support activities really begin.
Kyono: As a member of the Consulting Sales Department, I am determined to do everything I can to help our customers. I believe that this is a phase in which the true value of regional banks will be at stake, with regard to what kind of companionship and support we can provide from a long-term perspective, even when the future is uncertain.
Mohri: I feel that this incident has broadened our customer base by, for example, allowing us to support sole proprietorship customers with whom we had no previous relationship. From this point on, we will be even closer to the people in the community, and we will become a bank that people can consult about anything.
Together with our customers, we aim not at recovery but at reconstruction.
Kyono: In the activities of the COVID-19 Emergency Support Team, I believe that what we should do is essentially the same as what we do on a daily basis, which is to contribute to the growth and development of local economies by providing optimal solutions that meet the needs of our customers. In recent years, the business model of banks has changed dramatically, and we are striving to provide not only traditional

       Interview 07
Reducing administrative work at branch offices and increasing the time spent with customers
 In order to improve the Bank’s profitability, we must increase the amount of time we spend on customer-facing consulting. To achieve this goal, we have started full-scale “Paperwork-free” initiatives to reduce inefficient work and inefficient desk-bound hours.  One initiative with which we are currently experimenting is Centralization to Headquarters. This work can be broadly divided into that of the Operations Group and that of the Loan Group. In the Operations Group, much of the administrative work and time-consuming tasks generated at the branches are transferred to a specialized department at the headquarters for centralized administrative processing. In addition, the Loan Group at headquarters handles the examination and storage of approval documents and contracts related to transactions with customers, execution operations, foreign exchange operations, and other tasks that used to be handled by staff at branches. Centralizing these operations will allow branch employees to spend more time with customers, which will lead to proposals that are more highly specialized as well as tailored support. We are gradually expanding this initiative to cover all parts of the Bank while checking for improvements and problems. So far, the feedback has been positive, and I am confident about the success of this initiative.
 Eliminating paperwork will also have a significant impact on the digital strategy we are pursuing. We can maximize our digital strategy’s effectiveness by thoroughly reducing inefficient operations and then identifying operations that can be replaced by digital ones. In order to go seal-less, passbook-less, paperless, and so forth, we must form a new framework through the power of digital technology. To this end, we are working closely with the Digital Strategy Division on each initiative.
 There is no end to reducing administrative work. In each era, technology evolves, and customers’ needs change. We must constantly review our style and adapt to changes. In the past, we have been too busy to address many issues in day-to-day operations, even if we found them to be wasteful or inefficient. With this initiative, we have received many opinions and ideas from branches toward the realization of Paperwork-free.  In order to accurately respond to societal changes, we will continue to foster a culture within the Bank in which each employee is always conscious about the efficiency of office work and proactively seeks to improve it.
Seeking to strengthen consulting sales
by promoting digitalization within the organization
 Society is changing toward digitalization, so our bank also must change its business model. In order to achieve this, we must first eliminate inefficient administrative work, which will lead to our digital transformation. This will strengthen consulting sales, which are close to customers and unique to regional banks.
 One of the things we are currently focusing on in our digitalization efforts is expanding our non-face-to-face channels. By using non-face-to-face channels, we can collect data that cannot be obtained through face-to-face conversations, which can be used for analysis and research to uncover needs that even customers are unaware of and to propose optimal services. In particular, the penetration rate of Internet banking using smartphones and PCs is increasing rapidly, and we are making ground-up efforts to upgrade and enhance the functions of our Web services and applications.
 On the other hand, RPA has been introduced at the headquarters to automate routine tasks. We also plan to greatly promote the use of AI in the future. For example, in the past, when we proposed services to customers, we contacted them based on their balance sheet at the end of the month. Ideally, it would be more effective to check the trends on a daily basis, but this was not possible, considering the time and workload involved. However, with the use of AI, we can acquire customer data automatically and cross-analyze the data with other information, making it possible to propose the necessary services at more precise times.
 We would also like to enhance our equipment. For example, by having our employees use tablets, we can provide our customers with timely information on industry trends and highly specialized content. This will be a great help, especially for young employees who are still inexperienced.
 While promoting these initiatives, we must be aware that digital technology is not a panacea. In particular, unlike megabanks and Internet banks, our bank is rooted in this region and has a mission to work together with the community. In this sense, we must take advantage of digital technology to enhance our convenience as a bank; at the same time, we must value our unique qualities, such as the fact that our employees will continue to visit our customers and provide face-to-face support. I believe that our mission going forward will be to transform our business model by skillfully integrating digital with non-digital and face-to-face with non-face-to-face.

     Interview 08
As an outside director, she makes proposals for the further promotion of Working Style Reform from an objective standpoint.
Vision aimed for by the Bank through working style reform
Become the bank chosen
by customers
through improvements in productivity and service
I believe that the role of outside directors is to confirm various initiatives and make recommendations from an objective perspective to allow The 77 Bank to contribute to the development of the regional economy in Tohoku and become customers’ preferred bank. There is a wide range of issues I can confirm, including those that are difficult to notice from within the bank and determining the balance between risk and safety. One of the things I am focusing on is Working Style Reform through promoting diversity. 
another, banks are playing an extremely important role in society and the economy. Being involved in a job that supports the social economy is highly rewarding and helps employees grow as people.
 To address the issues of female managers and career advancement, I think it is important “to deepen the perspective of employees” and “to share information within the bank.” In FY2020, we will continue to hold a number of career seminars and round-table talks for childcare leave participants, and I hope that employees will take advantage of these opportunities to learn management skills based on accepting diversity and communication skills for improving the work environment.  Also, to motivate young employees, it is necessary for management to present a clear vision of their policies and what they are thinking. For example, to make young employees feel that there is a connection between the headquarters and the front line in the field, it is necessary not only to disclose information formally, but also to devise ways to disseminate information that is easy for young employees to understand.  Through the Board of Directors and various events, I feel that President Kobayashi is also focusing on Working Style Reform, and our efforts are making steady progress, such as receiving awards from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and Miyagi Prefecture as a model company for promoting diversity. I will continue to support the company in its efforts to make further progress.
Promote Health and Productivity Management 
IIn December 2018, the Bank issued the Health and
Productivity Management Declaration and has been
strengthening its efforts accordingly. As for specific initiatives for
Health and Productivity Management, based on the results of the previous fiscal year, we have established a system in which the Personnel Division plays a central role in the management of the program and implements it in cooperation with the health insurance association, industrial physicians and public health nurses.

Emiko Okuyama
In 1975, she was hired as a Sendai City official. After working on the Citizens’ Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau, she ran for Sendai mayor in 2009 and first elected. Served two terms as mayor, which ended in 2017.
    I believe that if each of our diverse employees can perform their duties with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, it will lead to the improvment of productivity and services.
 In 2015, while serving as the mayor of Sendai, I gave a speech at a symposium on the promotion of women’s advancement hosted by the Bank, and I got the impression that the Bank is enthusiastic about promoting diversity. In fact, it has been proactive in its efforts to date, including the establishment of the Working Group for the Promotion of Women’s Participation in 2013 and the Diversity Promotion Office in 2016. When I met female employees at symposiums and seminars, I found that many of them were active and talented, and I felt the need to create an organization that would put them in positions that prompt them to demonstrate their abilities. Compared to 10 years ago, the percentage of women in management positions has increased significantly, but I believe we can increase it further.

 One of the themes I am focusing on as an inseparable part of this issue is young employees’ visualization of their career plans, including female employees. If too many employees leave the bank within a few years, the investment in human resources will not be worthwhile, and the transfer of business know-how may be hindered. To prevent such a situation, we need to communicate the job’s attractiveness to employees and evolve into a workplace that appeals to long-term employees; the job of a banker is enticing and significant. With the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Great East Japan Earthquake, COVID-19, and other unimaginable events happening one after

Corporate Governance Initiatives
■ Basic stance toward corporate governance
We will work to strengthen and enhance corporate governance in accordance with the following basic stance.

• We will improve the transparency of management and the appropriateness of processes and work together appropriately with stakeholders including the regional society, clients, and shareholders for the Bank’s sustained growth and improvements in corporate value over the medium- to long-term.

THE 77 BANK INTEGRATED REPORT 44

Social Responsibility
■ Compliance structure
The Bank formulated the Compliance Policies in order to clarify its stance on compliance and to ensure the effectiveness thereof. Further, the Bank established the Compliance Guidelines (Compliance Standards) to articulate specific guidelines and a code of conduct so that the executives and employees place importance on compliance, thereby ensuring the lawful conduct of business.
Risk Management
■ Strengthening of comprehensive risk management
The operating environment surrounding financial institutions has significantly changed in recent years, exposing them to an unprecedented variety of risks. In this environment, financial institutions are required more than ever before to accurately identify, analyze and appropriately control risks.
 From the viewpoint of increasing the soundness of management, the risks the Bank faces are assessed by category, and comprehensive risk management systems are established for self-control type risk management through comprehensive assessment, and by comparison and contrast with the Bank’s capital. At the same time, efforts are being made to improve risk management methods through means such as the enhancement of risk measurement techniques.Compliance Guidelines(Compliance Standards) 【Basic Direction】
1. Ensure sound management and pay the utmost attention to sustaining the Bank’s credibility and its   ability to maintain smooth financing.
 2. Comply with laws and the code of corporate ethics and maintain fair and honest practices.
3. Take a principled stand with regard to issues that threaten social order or public peace.
4. Provide financial services that the region, customers, and society broadly trust and endeavor to achieve
  sustainable development together with them as a good corporate citizen.
5. Foster a flexible and constructive working environment conducive to the well-being of all employees.
【Code of Conduct】
1. We will comply with laws, ordinances, the Articles of Incorporation, the Rules of Employment, and   internal rules of the Bank.
2. We will not force unfair transaction on our customers.
3. We will not divulge confidential information of our customers or the Bank, or material information that   has not been made public.
4. We will not neglect to provide reports required by laws, ordinances, and internal rules of the Bank,   or provide false reports.
5. We recognize the public nature and the large social responsibility of the Bank and will devote ourselves   to our duties.
6. We will not follow instructions or orders given by an individual that go beyond or deviate from the   authorities given to said individual.
7. We will not engage in such conduct as will undermine the credibility or honor of the Bank.
8. We will not do favors for our customers in violation of law, ordinances, or internal rules of the Bank. 9. We will not seek to make unfair profits by taking advantage of our duties or position.

11. We will not engage in socially unacceptable entertaining or gift giving.
12. We will make efforts to maintain order in the workplace.
 We have implemented risk capital management as a specific framework for comprehensive risk management. Risk capital management is a management method where a risk capital budget, which represent risk tolerance, is allocated by risk category to each unit (domestic business units, funds and securities units, and other units), and the risks measured for each unit are monitored to ensure that they do not exceed their respective budgets. Risk capital management is also utilized to monitor whether the expected profits that are suitable for the risks taken are being secured.

  Development of business continuity systems in response to the occurrence of large-scale disasters
The Bank has developed a Disaster Emergency Response Plan that clarifies the basic principles of action for times of emergency, such as earthquakes or other disasters and systems failures.
 Under the Disaster Emergency Response Plan, we have worked
to develop systems to ensure business continuity through the establishment of business continuity plans for continuing the minimum operations required to maintain the finance function, and to achieve the prompt resumption or recovery of this function, in the event that the Bank incurs sufficient damage that it becomes impossible to fulfill normal bank operations, due to an unforeseen disaster. In addition, in order to confirm the effectiveness of the Disaster Emergency Response Plan, we conduct regular disaster drills and business continuity drills and conduct revisions to make our preparations for disaster more robust in consideration of the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in an effort to strengthen the Bank’s crisis response capabilities.
 Responding to increasing cyberattacks
In order to respond to cyberattacks, which are becoming increasingly advanced and sophisticated on a daily basis, the Bank has established Cyber Security Management Regulations, and has implemented multi-layer technical measures, including the prevention of unauthorized intrusions and blocking of information leakage, as well as detection of malicious viruses.
 In addition, the Bank has undertaken organizational measures such as drills and exercises that assume the occurrence of a cyberattack, and is continuously working to strengthen systems for swiftly responding to cyberattacks.

THE 77 BANK INTEGRATED REPORT 46

As a member of the local community, we actively participate in community events to deepen our interaction with regional society.
The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum
The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum was opened in celebration of the 120th anniversary of our founding and in gratitude for the many years of support we have received from people in the region. The museum introduces topics, including the history and roles of money, the birth and development of banks, and the industry and economy in Miyagi Prefecture and Japan in a manner that is fun and easy to understand.
 The museum was partly renewed in March 2019 as part of the 140th Anniversary Project, and new features, including a projection mapping and a children’s area, have been added to introduce the relationship between The 77 Bank and the community, the relationship between money and daily life, and The three major business operations of banks. In FY2020, approximately 2,960 people, including students from a total of 72 elementary and junior high schools, visited the museum.
  Participation in regional events
During the Sendai Aoba Festival held every May, we participate in the Yamaboko Parade, which is the highlight of the festival. At the traditional Dontosai Festival that marks koshogatsu every January, we make the traditional hadakamairi (naked shrine visit) to Osaki Hachimangu Shrine wearing only light clothing.
One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign
The One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign is in an effort to deepen interactions with the region as a member of the local community and raise the awareness of the Bank employees regarding social contribution. These activities were conducted at all of the Bank’s 142 branches (excluding branches that only offer transfers) after selecting social contribution activities in accordance with the Bank’s six themes.

■ Supporting Cultural Activities
To contribute to the promotion of region culture, we sponsor many cultural activities, festivals, and events.
77 Starlight Symphony
The Bank has held a charity concert named the 77 Starlight Symphony since 1991 in order to enhance the experience of the Sendai Pageant of Starlight, which is becoming established as a winter tradition, as a member of the city.
 In December 2019, Kohmi Hirose was invited as a guest, and performed various hit songs with the backing of the Sendai Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, fundraising activities were conducted to support earthquake reconstruction and operation of the Sendai Pageant of Starlight.
77 Fureai Concert
The 77 Fureai Concert has been held continuously since FY1993 in cooperation with the Sendai Philharmonic Orchestra, in order to give students from regional elementary schools and junior high schools the opportunity to experience a live orchestra.
 Concerts were held at Wakuya Junior High School (Wakuya Town) and Kakuda Citizen’s Center (Kakuda City) in FY2020, where approximately 970 people including children, students, and family members viewed a powerful musical performance and enjoyed introductions of the orchestral instruments and conductor experiences.

■ Supporting Financial Education
We support financial education by utilizing the The 77 Bank Currency and Banking Museum in the head office and experiential programs.

A course provided by The 77 Bank has been held at the Faculty of Business Administration at Tohoku Gakuin University since FY2012 for the purpose of promoting social contributions to the region through education and research contributing to the development of the regional economy and human resources.
   This course is taught by an employee of the Bank, and covers topics such as specific details of bank operations, recent financial trends, and the role of regional financial institutions. The course was held for the 9th time in FY2020, and the course in September 2019 was participated by approximately 290 students.
  National High School Student Finance and Economics Quiz Championship “Economics Koshien” Miyagi Tournament
The Miyagi Tournament of the National High School Student Finance and Economics Quiz Championship “Economics Koshien” has been held since FY2010 through joint sponsorship with the Association for the Promotion of Financial Literacy, in an effort to make social
contributions to the region through an educational project for acquiring the financial and economics knowledge that is essential for life planning and safeguarding one’s lifestyle. In December 2019, the 11th Miyagi Tournament was held at the Head Office of the Bank.

“The best part of playing badminton is that you don't have to use all your strength, but use your brain to play. I enjoy working on tactics observing the opponent’s moves,” says Ayako Suzuki, who is a member of our badminton club. She won the 2017 Para-Badminton World Championships’ upper limb impairment SU5 class, in addition to winning many other international competitions, and she has been ranked high in the world for several years. She is expected to be one of the leading para-sport athletes in Japan.
   Although she once retired, she returned after a five-year absence when para-badminton was adopted as an official sporting event in the global para-sport competition. After winning her first domestic tournament following her return, she became a member of the Bank's badminton club, as her high school coach was coaching at the Bank at the time.
 She usually works at the head office in the morning and practices at our Nakayama Gymnasium in the afternoon. “This is the first time for me to belong to a company's sports club, but I am grateful for the environment that allows me to concentrate on competition. I hope to live up to the expectations of those around me," says Suzuki. On the team, she sometimes plays together with local junior high school students and ladies' teams. Turning such experience she had never had in her career as an athlete into energy, she strives everyday.  Suzuki’s goal is to be selected for Japan’s national team and to win the gold medal by defeating the Chinese rival. “I'm confident that I can win the gold medal," Suzuki expresses her confidence.

We are actively offering technical trainings, etc., with the hope of helping with the recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake through the promotion of sports.
In September 2019, the Bank’s three sport clubs held joint workshops for first- and second-grade elementary school children and their parents. Approximately 300 participants enjoyed trying baseball, track and field, and badminton.

■ Responding to Environmental Issues
The 77 Bank is actively participating in activities to tackle environmental issues, such as forest conservation and installation of energy-efficient facilities.

Forest conservation activities
The Bank’s executives and new employees from FY2019 planted 1,000 black pine seedlings in the Arahama District of Sendai City, based on the “Citizens’ Reforestation Activities to Restore the Miyagi Coastal Forests” agreement that was entered into with Miyagi Prefecture, etc. in September 2018 as part of the 140th Anniversary Project. The tree planting area has been named the “77 Forest for the Future,” and will be managed as a coastal disaster prevention forest to protect the region from disaster.

Environmental conservation activities through financial products and services
The Bank supports companies and individual customers actively involved in social contribution activities, such as those for environmental conservation through the provision of environmentally friendly financial products and services.
・Products for Businesses
We offer the 77 Social Contribution Activities Support Loan and the77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bond for companies engaged in efforts such as the prevention of global warming and the introduction of recycling-related equipment.

We started offering the 77 ESG Japanese Equities Open (Alias:Miyagi no Kizuna) to commemorate the 140th Anniversary of our foundation. The fund donates a portion of the trust fees that the Bank has received to restore the coastal disaster prevention forest, which suffered catastrophic damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake.

Conducting Material Recycling
We participated in the BRING project that the JEPLAN, INC. organized to recycle the used office uniforms of female employees, which were disposed of as industrial waste, into materials that can be reused as new resources.
Material recycling is a system of collecting used clothing and reusing them as materials or raw materials for new products. It is considered to be effective in combating global warming because it can reduce CO2 emissions by about 55% when one uses recycled materials to manufacture clothing.

■ Contribution to Social Welfare
We contribute to social welfare by cooperating with fundraising activities and blood donation projects.
77 Caring Fund Raising Committee
The 77 Caring Fund Raising Committee was established in 1994 by the executives and employees of the Bank for the purpose of donating to social welfare projects and facilities in appreciation of the support received from the local community to that time.
 During FY2020, a total of ¥3.33 million was donated to 10 social welfare facilities recommended by the Miyagi Prefecture Social Welfare Council and 14 volunteer groups. The donated funds are used to cover facility repair costs, running costs for volunteer activities, and other expenses. In addition, a total of ¥1.71 million was donated to the Japanese Red Cross Society in response to Typhoon No. 19 in 2019.
Small Kindness Movement
Since the establishment of the Miyagi Prefecture Headquarters of the Small Kindness Movement, the Bank has been involved in the planning and operation of these activities, while serving as the secretariat for 44 years.
 The Summer Sendai Cleaning Campaign is conducted each year prior to opening of the Sendai Tanabata Festival. Each year, we donate wheelchairs to social welfare facilities in the prefecture, and make visits to welfare facilities for the elderly and hold entertainment performances. In addition, we donate flower seeds to elementary schools in the prefecture, and gather used stamps and donate them to stamp collection organizations.

THE 77 BANK, LTD. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES Year Ended March 31, 2020
1. BASIS OF PRESENTING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and the Enforcement Regulation for the Banking Law of Japan (the “Banking Law”), and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to the 2019 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2020.
In accordance with the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and other relevant regulations, all Japanese yen figures in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen, except for per share data. Accordingly, the total of each account may not be equal to the combined total of individual items. Also, U.S. dollar amounts have been rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which The 77 Bank, Ltd. (the “Bank”) is incorporated and operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥108.83 to U.S.$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2020. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Bank and its significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”). There were five consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020 and 2019.
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Bank, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profits included in assets resulting from transactions within the Companies are eliminated in consolidation.
(1) Scope of consolidation
Consolidated Subsidiaries
There was no change in the scope of consolidation during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
77 Capital Co., Ltd.
77 New Business Investment Limited Partnership
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership Unconsolidated subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of
consolidation because they are not material to the consolidated financial statements in terms of total assets, income, net income (corresponding to the Bank’s share), retained earnings (corresponding to the Bank’s share) and accumulated other comprehensive income (corresponding to the Bank’s share).
(2) Equity method
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Not Accounted for by the Equity Method
77 Capital Co., Ltd.
77 New Business Investment Limited Partnership
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership
These companies are excluded from the scope of equity
method accounting because they are not material to the consolidated financial statements in terms of net income (corresponding to the Bank’s share), retained earnings (corresponding to the Bank’s share) and accumulated other comprehensive income (corresponding to the Bank’s share).
b. Business Combinations—Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Acquisition-related costs, such as advisory fees or professional fees, are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, an acquirer shall report in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Such adjustments shall be recognized as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed at the acquisition date. A parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary might change if the parent purchases or sells ownership interests in its subsidiary. The carrying amount of noncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in the parent’s ownership interest in its subsidiary while the parent retains its controlling interest in its subsidiary. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted is accounted for as capital surplus as long as the parent retains control over its subsidiary.
c. Cash and Cash Equivalents—For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents represent cash and amounts due from the Bank of Japan.

        55 THE 77 BANK INTEGRATED REPORT
THE 77 BANK INTEGRATED REPORT 56

 d. Trading Account Securities, Investment Securities and Money Held in Trust—Securities other than investments in affiliates are classified into three categories, based principally on the Companies’ intent, as follows: (1) trading account securities, which are held for the purpose of earning capital gains in the near term, are reported at fair value and the related unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings; (2) held- to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost; and (3) available-for-sale securities, which are not classified as either of the aforementioned securities, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity.
The cost of trading account securities and available-for-sale securities sold is determined based on the moving-average method.
In addition, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries not accounted for by the equity method are reported at cost determined by the moving-average method.
Available-for-sale securities for which fair value is extremely difficult to determine are reported at cost determined by the moving-average method.
For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, investment securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income.
Securities included in money held in trust are also classified and accounted for using the same method as above.
The components of trust assets are accounted for based on the standard appropriate for each asset type. Instruments held in trust for trading purposes are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other income/ expenses. Instruments held in trust classified as available-for- sale are recorded at fair value with the corresponding unrealized gains/losses recorded directly in a separate component of equity. Instruments held in trust classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.
e. Tangible Fixed Assets—Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and gains deferred on the sale and replacement of certain assets. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets, except for lease assets, is mainly computed using the declining-balance method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of useful lives is principally from 5 to 31 years for buildings and from 4 to 20 years for equipment. Lease assets under finance lease transactions, in which substantial ownership is not deemed to have been transferred, are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The salvage value is zero or the guaranteed amounts if specified in the lease contracts (see Note 2.o).
f. Intangible Fixed Assets—The amortization of intangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method. Capitalized costs of computer software developed/obtained for internal use are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of five years.
g. Long-Lived Assets—The Companies review their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows (“DCFs”) from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
h. Foreign Currency Items—Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies held by the Bank at year-end are translated into Japanese yen at the current exchange rates in effect at each consolidated balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses are recognized in the fiscal periods in which they occur.
i. Reserve for Possible Loan Losses—The Bank determines the amount of the reserve for possible loan losses by means of management’s judgment and assessment of future losses based on a self-assessment system. This system reflects past experience of credit losses, possible future credit losses, business and economic conditions, the character, quality and performance of the portfolio, and other pertinent indicators.
As part of the Bank’s self-assessment system, the quality of all loans is assessed by branches and the credit supervisory division with a subsequent audit by the Bank’s asset review and inspection division in accordance with the Bank’s policy and rules for self-assessment of asset quality.
The Bank has established a credit rating system under which its debtors are classified into five categories. The credit rating system is used in the self-assessment of asset quality. All loans are classified into one of the following five categories for self- assessment purposes: “normal,” “caution,” “possible bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “legal bankruptcy.”
For loans to borrowers classified as legal bankruptcy or virtual bankruptcy, the Bank fully provides the net amount of loans and estimated collectible amounts by collateral or guarantees. Regarding loans to borrowers classified as possible bankruptcy, a specific reserve is provided to the necessary extent for the net amount of loans and estimated collectible amounts by collateral or guarantees.
For large debtors who are likely to become bankrupt and debtors with restructured loans, if the cash flows from collection of the principal and interest can be reasonably estimated, the reserve is provided based on the difference between the relevant cash flows discounted by the initial contractual interest rates and the carrying amounts of the loans (the “DCF method”).
The reserve for other possible loan losses is recorded principally at the amount of estimated losses over the next two or three years. Estimated losses are determined by calculating a loss rate based on the average of actual loss ratio over the past certain period, which is calculated with credit loss experience over two or three years. Adjustments are to be made as necessary in light of future outlook and other factors.
All the loans are assessed by sales related department in accordance with the self-assessment standard and the results are audited by asset audit department independent from the sales related department.
The Bank’s subsidiaries determine the reserve for possible loan losses by a similar self-assessment system as that of the Bank.
(Additional Information)
The Bank records the reserve for possible loan losses for the risk of future economic recession but specifically increased the reserve for certain loans considering the worsening business conditions due to the impact of the novel coronavirus infectious disease. This accounting estimate is based on the assumption that the domestic economy is prospected to continue to be weak for the time being because of the impact of the novel coronavirus infectious disease, and therefore, is judged to be reasonable.
The economy is in the situation that further economic downside risk is concerned due to the impact of the disruption of supply chains on production activities and continued sluggish personal consumption with consumers refraining from going out, and accordingly, the reserve for possible loan losses may possibly fluctuate in future.
In addition, the Bank is making the accounting estimates based on the information available at the time of preparing consolidated financial statements, including worsening business conditions caused from the impact of the novel coronavirus infectious disease.
j. Reserve for Stock-Based Benefits—Reserve for stock-based benefits is provided for the grants of the Bank’s shares to directors, etc. in accordance with the stock grant program based on the estimated stock-based benefits liabilities as of the fiscal year end.
k. Reserve for Reimbursement of Deposits—Reserve for reimbursement of deposits which were derecognized as liabilities is provided for the future estimated payments for reimbursement claims on dormant deposit accounts based on the historical reimbursement experience.
l. Reserve for Contingent Losses—Reserve for contingent losses is provided for the future estimated payments of burden money to the Credit Guarantee Corporations based on the historical experience of subrogation.
m. Employees’ Retirement and Pension Plans—In calculation of projected benefit obligations, expected benefits are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Treatment of prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses is as follows:
Prior service cost is charged to expenses when incurred.
Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized by the straight-line method from the following fiscal year after the fiscal year when they were incurred over a definite period (10 years) with the employees’ average remaining service period when incurred.
Consolidated subsidiaries apply a shortcut method whereby the amount of the retirement benefits required to be paid if all the employees voluntarily retired at the end of the fiscal year is regarded as projected benefit obligations in determining the liability for employees’ retirement benefits and net periodic retirement benefit costs.
n. Asset Retirement Obligations—The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the DCFs required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost.
o. Leases
As a lessee
Finance lease transactions are capitalized to recognize lease assets and lease obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. As a lessor
All finance leases that are deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as lease receivables, and all finance leases that are deemed not to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as investments in leases.
p. Income Taxes—The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences.
q. Derivatives and Hedging Activities—It is the Bank’s policy to use derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) primarily for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with its assets and liabilities. The Bank also utilizes derivatives to meet the needs of its clients while entering into derivatives as a part of its trading activities. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions as a means of hedging its interest rate risk on certain loans and investment securities and to meet the needs of its clients. The Bank also enters into currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and currency options to hedge foreign currency exchange risk associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to meet the needs of its clients.
Derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Gains or losses on derivative transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. If derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions.
The interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expense or income.
r. Per Share Information—Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits or share consolidation.
Cash dividends per share presented in the consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.
s. New Accounting Pronouncements—On March 31, 2020, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) issued ASBJ Statement No. 31, “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates.”
The standard aims to disclose useful information for the readers of the financial statements about the contents of accounting estimates of the items which may be exposed to a risk that may have a significant impact to the financial statements for the following fiscal year, in cases where the amount recorded in the financial statements for the current fiscal year is based on accounting estimate.
The Companies will apply this accounting standard from the end of the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2020.

Loans to borrowers in bankruptcy represent nonaccrual loans to debtors who are legally bankrupt, as defined in the Enforcement Ordinance for the Corporation Tax Law.
Past due loans are nonaccrual loans which include loans classified as “possible bankruptcy” and “virtual bankruptcy.”
Nonaccrual loans are defined as loans for which the Bank has discontinued accruing interest income due to substantial doubt existing about the ultimate collection of principal and/or interest. Such loans are classified either as “possible bankruptcy” or “virtual bankruptcy” under the Bank’s self- assessment guidelines.
In addition to past due loans, certain other loans classified as “caution” under the Bank’s self-assessment guidelines include past due loans (three months or more) which consist of loans for which the principal and/or interest is three months or more past due, but exclude loans to borrowers in bankruptcy and past due loans.
Restructured loans are loans where the Bank and its subsidiaries relax lending conditions by reducing the original interest rate or by forbearing interest payments or principal repayments to support the borrower’s reorganization. Restructured loans exclude loans to borrowers in bankruptcy, past due loans or past due loans (three months or more).
7. FOREIGN EXCHANGES

  National government bonds Local government bonds Other securities
Total
¥18,873 ¥19,848 $173,417
* Unlisted equity securities for which the fair value is extremely difficult to determine are not included.
Securities, other than trading account securities, with readily determinable fair value, whose fair value significantly declined compared with the acquisition cost and whose fair value is not considered likely to recover to their acquisition cost, are written down to the respective fair value. The related losses on revaluation are charged to income for the fiscal year.
Impairment losses were recognized for available-for-sale securities in the amount of ¥201 million ($1,846 thousand), consisting of ¥201 million ($1,846 thousand) of equity securities, and ¥44 million, consisting of ¥44 million of equity securities for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The criteria for determining whether the fair value has “significantly declined” are defined based on the asset classification of the issuer in the internal standards for asset quality self-assessment as follows:
(a) Normal issuer: Fair value declined by 50% or more of the acquisition cost or fair value declined between 30% and 50% and average fair value during the past one month declined by 50% or more (30% or more for issuers who have credit risk more than a certain level).
(b) Caution issuers: Fair value declined by 30% or more of the acquisition cost.
(c) Legally bankrupt, virtually bankrupt, and possibly bankrupt issuers: Fair value is lower than the acquisition cost.
Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, were ¥37,056 million ($340,494 thousand) and ¥32,581 million, respectively.

The accumulated depreciation of tangible fixed assets as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, amounted to ¥85,053 million ($781,521 thousand) and ¥82,684 million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred gains for tax purposes of ¥7,695 million ($70,706 thousand) and ¥7,695 million, respectively, on tangible fixed assets sold and replaced with similar assets have been deducted from the cost of newly acquired tangible fixed assets.
9. LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Bank recognized impairment losses of ¥126 million ($1,157 thousand) and ¥761 million on certain operating branches, business premises, branches to be closed, and unused facilities for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The impairment losses were composed of ¥67 million ($615 thousand) on buildings and ¥59 million ($542 thousand) on other fixed assets for the year ended March 31, 2020, and ¥165 million on buildings, ¥525 million on land and ¥70 million on other fixed assets for the year ended March 31, 2019.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, the Bank recognizes each individual branch office as a cash-generating unit for which it continues to manage and monitor identifiable cash flows. Branch offices to be closed and facilities not in operation are individually assessed for impairment. Subsidiaries recognize each company as a cash-generating unit. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the DCFs from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. The DCFs were calculated using discount rates of 5.7% and 8.0% for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the net selling price was determined by quotation from a third-party vendor.
10. CUSTOMERS’ LIABILITIES FOR ACCEPTANCES AND GUARANTEES

 Contracts of overdraft facilities and loan commitments are contracts with customers to lend up to the prescribed limits in response to customers’ applications for a loan, as long as there is no violation of any condition within the contracts. As of March 31, 2020, the unused amount of such contracts totaled ¥1,617,531 million ($14,862,914 thousand), of which amounts with original agreement terms of less than one year were ¥1,512,502 million ($13,897,840 thousand). As of March 31, 2019, the unused amount of such contracts totaled ¥1,647,277 million, of which amounts with original agreement terms of less than one year were ¥1,564,783 million.
Since many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon, the unused amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement. Most of these contracts have conditions allowing the Companies to refuse customers’ applications for a loan or decrease the contract limits based on proper reasons (e.g., changes in financial situation, deterioration in customers’ creditworthiness). At the inception of the contracts, the Companies obtain collateral real estate, securities, etc., if considered to be necessary. Subsequently, the Companies perform a periodic review of the customers’ business results based on internal rules and take necessary measures to reconsider conditions in contracts and require additional collateral and guarantees.

b. Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve and Surplus
The Banking Law requires that an amount equal to 20% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of the legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 100% of stated capital.
Under the Companies Act and the Banking Law, the aggregate amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve that exceeds 100% of the stated capital may be made available for dividends by resolution of the stockholders after transferring such excess to retained earnings in accordance with the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that stated capital, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus, and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the stockholders.
c. Treasury Stock and Treasury Stock Acquisition Rights
The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury stock and dispose of such treasury stock by resolution of the Board of Directors. The amount of treasury stock purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the stockholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury stock. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights.

The Bank has introduced a performance-linked stock compensation system (the “System”) based on the Board Incentive Plan (“BIP”) trust from the perspective of enhancing motivation to make contributions to improving the medium- to long-term performance and corporate value by further clarifying the linkage between compensation to directors, etc. and stock value of the Bank.
Under the System, the Bank’s shares are acquired using the funds contributed by the Bank as compensation to directors, etc. through the trust and such shares are granted to directors, etc. through the trust according to their ranks and achievement of management plans. Said transactions are related to the System.
The Bank’s shares remaining in the trust are recorded as treasury stock under “Equity” and the carrying amount of such treasury stock was ¥1,089 million ($10,006 thousand) and ¥1,243 million and the number of shares was 396 thousand shares and 452 thousand shares as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
18. EQUITY
Japanese banks are subject to the Banking Law and to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”). The significant provisions in the Companies Act and the Banking Law that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: a. Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the general meeting of stockholders. For companies that meet certain criteria such as (1) having a Board of Directors, (2) having independent auditors, (3) having an Audit & Supervisory Board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than two years of normal term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Bank meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends-in-kind (noncash assets) to stockholders subject to certain limitations and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Bank can do so because it stipulates this in its articles of incorporation. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury stock. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the stockholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¥3 million.
Other expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, consisted of the following:
   retirement benefit trust established under lump-sum payment plans by 22%.
b. Method of determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets
The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined considering allocation of plan assets which are expected currently and in the future and the long-term rates of return which are expected currently and in the future from the various components of the plan assets.

   23. INCOME TAXES
The Companies are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in a normal effective statutory tax rate of approximately 30.5% for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019.
The tax effects of significant temporary differences which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
24. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
The components of other comprehensive loss for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
Maturities of investment in leases for finance leases as of March 31, 2020, are as follows:
identifying, monitoring, and controlling credit risk. Additionally, the Bank utilizes the “Credit Rating System” applied to counterparties granted with credit from the viewpoint of identifying credit risk objectively and enhancing credit risk control.
In addition, as an organization responsible for credit risk management, credit risk control functions and review functions have been established to secure the effectiveness of credit risk management.
The Risk Management Division, as a credit risk control function, is engaged in identifying the level of future possible credit risk and the status of credit concentration in major borrowers through measurement of the level of credit risk and analysis of credit portfolios.
The Credit Supervision Division, as a review control function, is engaged in reviewing lending operations based on strict examination standards, system development for strengthening the daily control of loan receivables, and appropriate maintenance of operational procedures.
Market risk management
a. Market Risk Management System
The Bank has established the “Market Risk Control Policy” as a basic policy for market risk management and various rules concerning market risk management. Based on these policies and rules, the Bank clarifies fundamental approaches for appropriate market risk control operations and control procedures for identifying, monitoring and controlling market risk.
As an organization responsible for market risk management, a market risk control function (middle office) has been established and furthermore, the operating function (front office) and the administration function (back office) have been separated. Additionally, market risk control function staffs are assigned to the operating function to secure the effectiveness of market risk management.
The Risk Management Division, as a market risk control function, measures the level of market risk of the Bank as a whole using Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) approach models and other models and regularly monitors the status of compliance with position limits and loss limits established according to the type and characteristics of transactions to control the level of market risk within a certain range.
In addition, an ALM and Income Control Committee was established for the purpose of analyzing flexible investment strategies in order to prevent risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and market prices, while forecasting future interest rates, market prices, and trends of fund and business conditions. The committee is also responsible for securing the soundness of management and also improving profitability at the same time based on appropriate asset and liability management through the unification of risk management and earnings control.
b. Quantitative Information about Market Risk
The Bank adopts the variance-covariance method (holding period: 125 business days for strategic equity securities and 60 business days for others; confidence interval: 99.0%; observation period: 250 business days) in computing the VaR with respect to money held in trust, securities, Japanese yen deposits and loans, and Japanese yen money market funds. The volume of market risk (estimated losses) that the Bank is exposed to as of March 31, 2020, amounts to ¥146,420 million ($1,345,401 thousand) (¥76,667 million in 2019) as a whole. However, the risk under certain abnormal market fluctuations may not be captured since, under the VaR method, the volume of market risk under a definite probability of statistically computed incidence is measured based on historical market fluctuations.
The Bank implements back testing to compare the VaR computed by the model with actual profit and loss in the securities and confirms that the measurement model in use captures the market risk with sufficient precision.

26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
(1) Group Policy for Financial Instruments
The Companies provide financial services such as credit card business and leasing operations in addition to banking operations. In the course of these operations, the Companies raise funds principally through deposit taking and invest funds in loans, securities, and others. As such, the Bank holds financial assets and liabilities which are subject to fluctuation in interest rates and conducts comprehensive Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) to avoid unfavorable effects from interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are also employed by the Bank as part of ALM.
(2) Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments
Financial assets held by the Companies mainly consist of loans to domestic corporations, local government agencies, and individual customers which are exposed to credit risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from nonperformance of borrowers and interest rate risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from fluctuations in interest rates.
Securities, mainly debt securities, equity securities, and investment trusts are held to maturity and for other purposes and also certain debt securities are held for the purpose of selling to customers. These securities are exposed to credit risk of issuers and market risks of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices. In addition, they are exposed to market liquidity risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from difficulties in executing financial transactions in certain environments such as market turmoil.
Financial liabilities, mainly consisting of liquid deposits or time deposits taken from corporate and individual customers, are exposed to cash flow risk that the Bank may experience a situation where unexpected cash flows are incurred in certain environments where the credit rating of the Bank may be lowered and, accordingly, necessary funding may become difficult.
Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign exchange risk that the Bank may suffer from losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives mainly include interest rate swaps and bond futures, which are used to manage exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates of loans and investment securities, and foreign exchange forward contracts, which are used to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting is applied to certain hedging activities related to loans and investment securities as hedged items.

 Liquidity risk management
The Bank has established the “Liquidity Risk Control Policy” as a basic policy for liquidity risk management and various rules concerning liquidity risk management. Based on these policies and rules, the Bank clarifies fundamental approaches for stable funding of operations and control procedures for identifying, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. In addition, the Bank has established the “Contingency Plan for Liquidity” to enable it to make quick and correct responses to unexpected events.
Furthermore, as an organization responsible for liquidity risk management, a liquidity risk control function has been established and a cash management function and a settlement control function have been established to control daily cash management and settlement related to cash and securities.
The Risk Management Division, as a liquidity risk control function, manages the liquidity risk of the Bank as a whole by identifying, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk.
The Treasury Administration and International Division, as a cash management control function and settlement control function, prepares daily or monthly cash flow projections and conducts cash management by identifying possible funds and liquidity of assets and verifying the concentration of settlement of major account funds to a certain date. The Division also controls settlement by identifying the status of settlement through systems such as the BOJ-NET and among financial institutions.
Risk management system of subsidiaries
The subsidiaries have a risk management system similar to that of the Bank.
(4) Supplementary Explanation about Fair Values of
Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments include, in addition to the value determined based on market prices, valuations calculated on a reasonable basis if no market prices are available. Since certain assumptions are used in calculating the value, the outcome of such calculation may vary if different assumptions are used.
(5) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount, the fair value, and the differences thereof as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, are disclosed below. Note that unlisted equity securities for which fair value is extremely difficult to determine are not included in the following table (see Note 2 below) and insignificant accounts in terms of the carrying amount are omitted:

4,680,944
¥8,458,886
¥7,873,063 116,617
¥7,989,681
The carrying amount is presented as the fair value if the maturity is within a short time period (less than one year) and the fair value approximates the carrying amount.
For receivables from “legally bankrupt,” “virtually bankrupt,” and “possibly bankrupt” borrowers, possible loan losses are estimated based on the DCF method or factors such as the expected amounts to be collected from collateral and guarantees. Since the fair value of these items approximates the carrying amount, net of the currently expected loan losses, such carrying amount is presented as the fair value.
For loans for which the repayment due date is not defined because of the characteristics that the loan amount is limited within the pledged assets, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since the fair value is assumed to approximate the carrying amount considering the expected repayment schedule and terms of the interest rates.
Liabilities
(1) Deposits
Regarding demand deposits, the amount payable as of the balance sheet date (i.e., the carrying amount) is considered to be the fair value. Time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit are grouped by maturity length, and the fair value is determined using the present value of the aggregate amounts of principal and interest discounted at an interest rate that would be applied to newly accepted deposits. For deposits with maturities within a short time period (less than one year) and whose fair value approximates the carrying amount, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value.
(2) Borrowed money
For each type of borrowed money financed, the fair value is determined based on the present value of the aggregated amounts of principal and interest discounted at a rate which is the rate assumed if a new financing was made. The carrying amount is presented as the fair value if the maturity is within a short time period (less than one year) and the fair value approximates the carrying amount.

      For due from banks, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since the fair value approximates the carrying amount.
Investment securities
The fair values of equity securities and debt securities are determined using the quoted price of the stock exchange, Japan Securities Dealers Association, or the price calculated by financial institutions. The fair value of investment trust is determined using the published standard quotation or the standard quotation offered by the securities investment advisors. With respect to privately placed guaranteed bonds, the fair value is determined using the future cash flows (coupons, redemption of principal, guarantee fees) discounted at an interest rate considering the market interest rates and issuers’ credit risk.
Loans and bills discounted
With respect to loans with floating interest rates, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since the fair value approximates the carrying amount as they reflect the market interest rates over a short period, unless the creditworthiness of the borrower has changed significantly since the loan origination. With respect to loans with fixed interest rates, for each category of loan based on the type of loan, internal ratings, and maturity length, the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected cash flows of aggregated amounts of principal and interest discounted at a rate which is the rate assumed if a new loan was made, or market interest rate, which is adjusted by the standard spread (including overhead ratio) by credit rating.

27. DERIVATIVES
It is the Bank’s policy to use derivatives primarily for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with its assets and liabilities. The Bank also utilizes derivatives to meet the needs of its clients while entering into derivatives as a part of its trading activities.
The Bank enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions as a means of hedging its interest rate risk on certain loans and investment securities while entering into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions to meet the needs of its clients.
The Bank also enters into currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and currency options to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to meet the needs of its clients.
Derivatives are subject to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the exposure created by potential fluctuations of market conditions, including interest or foreign exchange rates. Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may result from a counterparty’s failure to perform its obligations under a contract.

Contract or Notional Amount
    The Bank sets limits on credit risk for those derivatives by limiting the counterparties to major financial institutions and securities companies and establishing maximum risk exposures to the counterparties.
The Bank has established a standard of risk management including management approaches for each type of risk. Derivative transactions entered into by the Bank have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate trading activities and credit risk management including maximum risk exposures and loss-cutting rules. Concerning risk management associated with derivative transactions, the front and back offices of the trading divisions are clearly separated and risk managers are assigned to the trading divisions, while the Risk Management Division synthetically manages the Bank’s market risks. In this manner, an internal control system is effectively secured.
The Bank’s positions, gain and loss, risk amount, and other conditions are periodically reported to the executive committee.

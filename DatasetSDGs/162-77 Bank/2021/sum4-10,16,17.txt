■ Enhancement of IR and SR activities
The Bank is actively involved in IR and SR activities including the holding of corporate briefings for institutional investors and individual investors (IR), and engaging in dialogue to build relationships of trust with shareholders (SR), so that stakehold- ers can understand the management conditions of the Bank.
■ Communication of message to employees
In order to deepen employees’ understanding of changes in the environment surrounding the Bank, the management issues facing the Bank, and other issues, the Bank has been holding the “77 President’s School,” led by the President of the Bank.
Additionally, in order to promote an understanding of “Vision 2030” and communicate the concept that it is key that every employee thinks for themselves and acts proactively as a message from senior management, we are also holding “Vision 2030 Briefings” at headquarters and bank branches, with speakers including the President, Senior Managing Director, and Managing Directors. At these briefings, we ensure there is a lively exchange of opinions, including Q&A sessions, as part of our aim to “establish a corporate culture of taking on new challenges.”

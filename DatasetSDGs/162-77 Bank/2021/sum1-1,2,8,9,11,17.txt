The Bank aims to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society through consulting with, and building partnerships with, regional public bodies and corporate and individual customers.
Second “77 Regional Revitalization Business Matching Event”
For five days, between January 28 and February 3, 2021, we held the second “77 Regional Revitalization Business Matching Event.”
The purpose of this event is to promote collaboration between regional public bodies and private companies as a means of finding solutions to the challenges faced by regional public bodies. This initiative has attracted significant attention from around Japan, including receiving an award from the Minister in charge of Regional Revitalization in FY2020 as a “unique initiative” by a financial institution, etc. that contributes to regional revitalization.
Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to cooperate with regional public bodies as we actively promote initiatives aimed at improving community value.
Response to the COVID-19 pandemic

Conducting the Student City experiential educational program
We provide a Student City experiential educational program for elementary school students, conducted at the Sendai Children Experience Plaza Elem, which was opened by Sendai City in September 2014 as a working experience facility. As a sponsoring company of this program, the Bank has established a booth that is a reproduction of a bank counter, and dispatches operations volunteers. 8,684 students from 120 schools participated in FY2019.

Cooperation in blood donation projects through a corporate blood donation campaign
We have conducted a corporate blood donation campaign in cooperation with the Miyagi Prefecture Red Cross Blood Center in order to contribute to ensuring a stable supply of blood required for medical treatment. During FY2019, a blood donation campaign using a mobile blood bank was conducted at the Head Office and branches, with 294 participants.
In 2008, in commemoration of the 130th anniversary of our establishment, the Bank donated one mobile blood bank to the Miyagi Prefecture Red Cross Blood Center, which is now being used throughout the prefecture.
Small Kindness Movement
Since the establishment of the Miyagi Prefecture Headquarters of the Small Kindness Movement, the Bank has been involved in the planning and operation of these activities, while serving as the secretariat for 43 years. The Summer Sendai Cleaning Campaign is conducted each year prior to opening of the Sendai Tanabata Festival, and in FY2019, it was participated by approximately 290 people including 110 employees of the Bank.
Each year, we donate wheelchairs to social welfare facilities in the prefecture, and make visits to welfare facilities for the elderly and hold entertainment performances. In addition, we donate mini sunflower seeds to elementary schools in the prefecture, and gather used stamps and donate them to stamp collection organizations.

Environmental conservation activities through financial products and services
The Bank supports companies and individual customers actively involved in social contribution activities such as those for environmental conservation through the provision of environmentally-friendly financial products and services.
<Products for businesses>
We offer the 77 Social Contribution Activities Support Loan for companies engaged in efforts such as the prevention of global warming and the introduction of recycling-related equipment.
In addition, from April 2019, we started providing the 77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bond for companies that have formulated targets for ESG measures.
<Products for individual customers> [140th Anniversary Project]
We offer the Fidelity Three Basic Fund (Water, Land and Energy), an investment trust that invests in environmentally- conscious companies, as well as reduced interest rates for the 77 Car Loan for customers purchasing eco-cars.
In addition, from July 2018, we started offering the 77 ESG Japanese Equities Open (Alias: Miyagi no Kizuna) to commemorate the 140th Anniversary of our foundation. The fund donates a portion of the trust fees received by the Bank to restoration activities of the coastal disaster prevention forest, which suffered catastrophic damage from the earthquake. <Offering bankbooks that use environmentally-friendly materials>
Our bankbooks use paper cloth, which can be turned into recycled paper, for material;
vegetable oil inks for printing to reduce toxic gases in the incineration process; and PVC-free
materials for the magnetic stripes.
In addition, from April 2018, we have given users the option of selecting an online bankbook when opening an account at the counter, which was previously available only through the app for account opening and Internet banking.
The online bankbook is a convenient, eco-friendly bankbook that allows users to make balance and transaction record inquiries online, such as through using Internet banking instead of issuing a paper bankbook.

Participation in regional events
The 35th Sendai Aoba Festival was held in May 2019, during which approximately 160 employees participated in the Yamaboko Parade, which was the highlight of the festival. The stirring sound of the Japanese drums and the energy of the people pulling the Bank’s “Shichifuku Odaiko Yamaboko” in the parade and the beautiful performance of the dancers were met with applause and cheers from the audience.

During the Sendai Tanabata Festival, which is held in August every year, we put up Tanabata decorations in front of the branch located in the arcade where the festival is held and Head Office Business Division. At the traditional Dontosai Festival that celebrates the Lunar New Year every January, approximately 50 employees made the traditional hadakamairi (naked shrine visit) to Osaki Hachiman Shrine wearing only light clothing in January 2019.

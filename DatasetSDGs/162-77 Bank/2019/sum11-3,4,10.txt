77 Caring Fund Raising Committee
The 77 Caring Fund Raising Committee was established in 1994 by the executives and employees of the Bank for the purpose of donating to social welfare projects and facilities in appreciation of the support received from the local community to that time.
During FY2019, we made a disaster relief donation of ¥1.96 million to the Japanese Red Cross Society as support for the regions affected by the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018. In addition, a total of ¥3.37 million was donated to 10 social welfare facilities recommended by the Miyagi Prefecture Social Welfare Council and 14 volunteer groups. The donated funds are used to cover facility repair costs, running costs for volunteer activities and other expenses.

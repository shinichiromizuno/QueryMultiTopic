Promotion of sports through local professional sports teams
We contribute to the promotion of local sports by supporting the activities of local professional sports teams as an official sponsor of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, Vegalta Sendai, and the Sendai 89ERS.
In addition, we support the activities of the academy team (elementary school students to high school students) of Vegalta Sendai, as a uniform sponsor.
From April 2019, we launched the 77 Local Professional Sports Support Bond (Donation- Type), which donate a portion of the fees and commissions received from customers as activities funds.

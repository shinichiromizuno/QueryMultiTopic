  Sources of competitive advantages
1Effective Corporate Governance
In order to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors through the diversification of Directors, the Bank is proactively appointing Outside Directors and female Directors, and the ratios of Outside Directors and female
Directors now stand at 41.1% and 11.7%, respectively.
2Trust from the local community The Bank is supported by many customers, as
seen by the high percentages of approximately
55% deposit share and approximately 43% loans and bills discounted share in Miyagi Prefecture.
  1 Deep connection with Eiichi Shibusawa
Eiichi Shibusawa, a businessman who was known as “the father of Japanese capitalism,” had a strong interest in the Tohoku region through Munenari Date, who provided him with the opportunity to enter the Ministry of Finance. At the time, there was no bank based in Miyagi Prefecture and for this reason, when The 77th National Bank was established, Shibusawa not only provided investment and various advice regarding such matters as the nature of the banking business and basic management concepts, he also seconded exceptional talent including Keishi Endo (the second and fourth President) and Seikei Ono from The Dai-Ichi Bank Limited.
Furthermore, Shibusawa provided both mental and practical support to the Bank over many years, including his transfer of The Dai-Ichi Bank Limited’s banking business in Miyagi Prefecture to The 77th National Bank and his appointment as Advisor in 1908. Eiichi Shibusawa’s spirit of “harmony of morality and the economy” lives on today in the line from the Bank Creed, which describes the Bank’s management philosophy, that states “the Bank’s progress goes hand in hand with prosperity in the local community.”
2 Trust relationship with the Tokyo Stock Exchange
The Tokyo Stock Exchange (currently Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.), which was established in May 1878, along with an increase in trading volume, in 1894 designated The 77th National Bank as the only bank among many banks to handle receipts and disbursements operations (*) for all trades of shares cleared.
The reasons for this designation include a recommendation from Eiichi Shibusawa and the provision of relief financing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange during a stock market crash caused by a recession when Seikei Ono, who became the fifth president, was manager of the Tokyo Branch, which rescued the exchange.
Over the next 120 years and to the present, The 77 Bank, Ltd. remains the only regional bank designated as a funds settlement bank, alongside the mega banks.
* Receipts and disbursements operations refers to account processing for the trading floor of a stock exchange

earthquake reconstruction support
On March 11, 2011, unprecedented damage was caused when the Great East Japan Earthquake, one of the largest recorded natural disasters in our history, struck Japan. Immediately after the earthquake, The 77 Bank, Ltd. worked to provide financial infrastructure and fulfill financial intermediary functions, and has since provided financial support for the reconstruction efforts of the region and customers.

         Message from the President
   “For The Customer & For The Future”
Becoming the “Best Consulting Bank”
We will further enhance the degree of customer satisfaction and confidence in the Bank through consulting, offering the optimum solutions by identifying customers’ needs and issues.
Hidefumi Kobayashi
President
  Review of the First Year of the Medium-term Management Plan
To that end, as we pass the milestone year of our anniversary, I feel even more strongly the need to further enhance our ability to respond to the changes of the era, while enriching our ideas and proactively researching and preparing for the new experiences that lie ahead.
2. Consulting by the Bank
The Medium-term Management Plan that we started in FY2019 stipulates a business model whereby we further enhance the degree of customer satisfaction and confidence in the Bank, and achieve higher profitability and employee satisfaction through consulting.
Consulting is about “always putting the customer first” and “being of use to the customer,” as well as the resulting initiatives that lead to the Bank’s earnings. It is a business model whereby we demonstrate our consulting capabilities in order to achieve goals and resolve development and growth issues by establishing relationships with customers and conducting business evaluations in the case of corporate clients and becoming involved with household finances and life planning in the case of retail customers, so that we can contribute to our customers while at the same time achieve increased transactions and earnings overall.
The main point of consulting is not simply the products and services that the Bank wants to sell; it is about
initiatives that are based on the actual or potential needs of customers. In order to carry out consulting, it is necessary to make frequent visits to customers and use our ingenuity. This is not something that can be achieved overnight but involves time-consuming effort, and that is exactly why it will be appreciated by customers and lead to differentiation with other banks.
It is a rewarding business model which enables us to share issues face to face with customers, and utilize our ingenuity to think how to be of use to customers, deal with difficulties together, and reach a resolution. I believe that consulting-based sales will enrich all customers and the local community, regardless of whether the customers are corporate or retail customers.
As the nation’s declining birthrate, aging population and population decline continue, the biggest concerns for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the lack of successors and business succession. If these trends continue, it is said that one third of SMEs will go out of business. Ninety nine percent of Japanese corporations are SMEs, and if the number of SMEs continues to decline, the niche areas that are not covered by large corporations will no longer be filled, possibly resulting in the decline and collapse of local industries and the loss of jobs in local communities. This will lead to a crisis whereby the regional banking market, which includes the
 1. Celebrating the 140th anniversary of the Bank’s foundation
FY2019 was a memorable year for the Bank during which we started our new three-year Medium-term Management Plan and, in December 2018, celebrated the 140th anniversary of the Bank’s foundation.
We held a number of commemorative projects to mark our 140th anniversary, including the “One branch, one social contribution campaign,” whereby all branches engage in social contribution activities, and business forums which were held with the aim of expanding business opportunities for customers and contributing to regional economy vitalization, as well as some new initiatives such as business contests to collect IT-based service models and ideas from startup companies, announcement of the official mascot “Shichi-Shika-Kun,” and renovation of the Currency and Banking Museum.
By engaging with the local community in a way that surpassed previous efforts, we were able to further strengthen our connection with customers and the local community, as well as reaffirm the Bank’s history. Above all, I believe that we were able to convey our gratitude to our customers.
Looking back over the past thirty years that have formed the Heisei era, the environments surrounding finance and the Japanese economy have undergone significant change. With the collapse of the “bubble” economy, the issue of bad debt disposal, deregulation such as the financial Big Bang, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and more, the environment surrounding financial institutions has become increasingly harsh as Japan’s economic growth has slowed, and today we are entering a new phase of monetary easing and negative interest rates.
Many areas of the economy, not just finance, have undergone significant change due to globalization and exposure to the market economy. I believe that in the future, with the addition of the further progress of digitalization, we will face even greater changes at an accelerated pace.
Under these circumstances, as a leading bank in the Tohoku region that provides integrated financial services, in order to create an outstanding business model, be the most useful and the most trusted by our customers and the region, and to continue to contribute to the development of society, we must respond to the changing times even more quickly and astutely and regard those changes as opportunities.

          Bank, shrinks and disappears, which will in turn have a major impact on regional revitalization.
In addition, the coastal areas in Miyagi Prefecture have entered the development period of the Miyagi Prefecture Earthquake Disaster Recovery Plan. However, as the reconstruction budget has shrunk, there are companies among our clients whose sales channels have not recovered, while other companies are facing issues of the aging of their employees, a shortage of labor, and a lack of successors. In order to recover from the earthquake disaster, we must focus on corporate rehabilitation, business succession, and M&A, which is also a measure that provides a solution to these issues.
Local industry and finance are two sides of the same coin. Through consulting-based sales utilizing the Bank’s network, we will protect the regional economy, regional companies, and our market.
3. Initiatives for our key strategies
Key Strategy 1: Growth strategy —Strengthening of profitability—
<Establish systems and structures for strengthening consulting capabilities>
In order to improve the sales promotion structure of Headquarters, the name of the Corporate & Retail Banking Division was changed to Consulting Promotion Division, and the Corporate Finance Department, which offers financing services for corporate clients, including syndicated loans and structured finance, was established. In addition, the name of the Asset Management Support Department was changed to the Consulting Promotion Department to develop a structure that can support a wide range of customer needs including business succession, M&As, inheritance, and asset management. Furthermore, branches have been categorized into six areas within Miyagi Prefecture, and Region Support Team staffed by liaison personnel from the Consulting Promotion Division in each area was formed in order to strengthen the support system for branches by Headquarters.
In addition to these system improvements, the number of sales personnel in the Consulting Promotion Division was increased from 42 prior to the start of the current Medium-term Management Plan to 68 as of March 31, 2019, and will be further increased to approximately 80 by March 31, 2020.
Additionally, 77 Research and Consulting Co., Ltd. was established as a subsidiary to undertake highly specialized research studies involving the regional economy and industry trends, etc. and to provide effective consulting services for resolving clients’ issues.
<Human resources development>
When it comes to “putting the customer first,” I believe that customers will not be satisfied with digital services alone, and I do not believe that there will no longer be a need for services provided by people. There are still many services that must be provided by human beings, including business such as sales activities and negotiations with customers, and planning and management operations, and I believe that the quality and level of our employees will result in differentiation with our competitors. Education for this purpose is essential, and we have therefore formulated human resources development programs to enhance consulting capabilities, and are working on human resources development.
The weekday evening seminars that we launched in FY2019 as part of our working style reforms have been held on seven occasions with 807 participants.
<Business evaluation initiatives>
All businesses receive consideration for responding to the various needs of customers. It is customers who bring profits to banks, and knowing your customers well, broadly capturing their needs, and considering how to meet those needs are fundamental to considering a business model. Business evaluations are also conducted for this purpose, and it is important to give thorough consideration to our customers.
The number of business evaluations conducted as of March 31, 2019 increased by 1,723 compared with the number as of March 31, 2018 to 4,978 evaluations. Since we share a great many management issues with our customers, we would like to contribute to the sustainable growth and development of customers by way of initiatives aimed at resolving these issues.
Key Strategy 2: Regional economy vitalization strategy —Enhancement of value of the region—
We have engaged in earthquake reconstruction support in accordance with the situation in the affected area, while taking into consideration the change in the stage of the Miyagi Prefecture Earthquake Disaster Recovery Plan from the regeneration to the development period, and trends in reconstruction demand.
Regional revitalization involved initiatives for the revitalization of towns, people, and jobs. With a focus on the creation of jobs, we worked on four frameworks: support for starting new companies and businesses, support and development of regional core companies, promotion of urban development, and support for promotion of tourism. In addition to support for starting new companies and businesses through recommendations to companies that will drive the future of the region, there are also many other good examples such as business matching that also leads to PR for products from Miyagi Prefecture, support for formulation of business plans utilizing former schools, and support for enhancing tourism resources.
Key Strategy 3: Productivity enhancement strategy —Effective and efficient allocation of resources—
The Nozomino Sub-Branch, a next generation branch, was established in order to secure manpower and time to focus on consulting services, while branches introducing next generation branch functions, including a remote consultation system and the use of tablets, were expanded. In addition to reviewing business hours, we also expanded operations in the form of branches within branches.
Furthermore, we are working to automate operations by centralizing branch operations at Headquarters, reviewing administrative workflow, and introducing RPA (robotics process automation), thereby creating a reduction effect of approximately 85,000 hours per annum.
In terms of working style reforms, we formulated the “health and productivity management declaration” to establish an environment where each and every employee can work actively in a healthy state of mind and body, and implemented initiatives including a total prohibition of smoking on all Bank property.
Key Strategy 4: Governance strategy
—Strengthening of governance for sustainable growth—
<Enhance and strengthen governance>
In light of the increasing international importance of preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism, we established the Money Laundering Countermeasures Department, and also formulated the Policy for Prevention of Money Laundering.
In addition, as part of measures to strengthen corporate governance, we increased the number of Outside Directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members by one in order to enhance the management oversight functions of the Audit & Supervisory Committee and establish a more effective corporate governance system.
As a result of these efforts, the ratio of Outside Directors now stands at 41.1% and the ratio of female Directors at 11.7%.
<Enhance shareholder value>
With regard to shareholder returns, the Bank’s basic policy is to continue stable dividend returns while holistically considering the public nature of banks and the maintenance of sound management.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we increased the annual dividend by ¥2.50 per share from the previous fiscal year to ¥47.50 per share from the perspectives of comprehensively taking into consideration business performance and enhancing shareholder returns. The annual dividend for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 is expected to be ¥50.00 per share.
In addition, the Bank has acquired treasury stock of approximately ¥800 million from the perspective of implementing flexible capital policies and returning profits to shareholders.
Going forward, we will continue to enhance shareholder returns, including through the acquisition of treasury stock, taking into account changes in the business environment.
Message to stakeholders
In April this year, the government announced that the portrait of Eiichi Shibusawa would be used on ¥10,000 bills scheduled to be issued in 2024. Eiichi Shibusawa, who is also known as “the father of Japanese capitalism,” has an extremely deep connection with the Bank, as seen in his support, both mental and practical, at the time of the Bank’s foundation.
The “harmony of morality and the economy” advocated by Shibusawa is the idea of the coexistence of profit and public interest that warns against a monopoly on profits and encourages the return of profits to society. This spirit is one of the models that corporate managers should use as reference, and I believe that it also leads to the idea of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are promoted by the United Nations.
Shibusawa’s spirit of coexistence is reflected in the line from the Bank Creed, which is the Bank’s management philosophy, that states “the Bank’s progress goes hand in hand with prosperity in the local community.” Today this lives on in the hearts of all our executives and employees.
The environment surrounding financial institutions is becoming increasingly severe due to social structural issues such as the declining birthrate, aging population and population decline, and the continuation of the monetary easing policy by the Bank of Japan. I believe that it is precisely because this is the era in which we live that we must once again go back to our management philosophy, develop a business model that has its roots in the region, and contribute to the prosperity of the local community.
Going forward, we will continue to aim to be a bank that is trusted, useful, and brings happiness to all our customers, and we hope for your continued understanding and support.

The Economy and Growth Potential of Miyagi Prefecture
Miyagi Prefecture, the primary base of operations for The 77 Bank, is located in the southeast of the Tohoku region. The prefecture is an important crossroads linking Tohoku to Tokyo, the nation’s capital. In 1989, Sendai, the prefectural capital, became the 11th city in Japan specially designated by ordinance. The branches and offices of major national businesses and organizations, including government agencies, are concentrated in Sendai, thereby positioning Sendai as the preeminent city of the Tohoku region. In terms of major economic indicators such as population, gross prefectural product, and retail sales amount, Miyagi Prefecture ranks around 15th within the nation, and the national share is roughly 2%.
Although Miyagi Prefecture experienced significant damage due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, particularly in coastal areas, reconstruction projects have now reached the final phase thanks to joint efforts by the public and private sectors. In addition, with the expansion of major automotive and electronics companies, the manufacturing industry is expected to become a driver for post-recovery economic growth while economic concentration is advancing owing to active construction investment related to redevelopment projects in Sendai.
Industrial transformation
● Expansion of manufacturing industry has created new jobs and grown peripheral industries (e.g., Toyota Motor East Japan and Tokyo Electron Miyagi).
● Toyota Motor East Japan has concentrated production of compact cars.
● Alps Alpine’s new core plant in Japan starts operation. [Number of offices]

Human resources development programs to enhance consulting capabilities
Ideal human resources—Toward enhancement of consulting capabilities that are firmly rooted in the region—
Basic approach toward human resource development
OJT at the workplace forms the basis for human resource development. Our basic approach toward the knowledge and skills that each employee believes to be necessary, or that they would like to study, involves personal development through self-study. A variety of training is conducted to complement OJT and personal development, and to provide opportunities to learn more specialized knowledge and skills, and for further skill improvements.
We aim to develop human resources by repeating such OJT, personal development, and training.
   Insatiable desire to improve: Human resources who will continue to grow, and who are full of ambition for personal development, and have the constant desire to improve and explore from a broad perspective
Robust spirit of taking on challenges: Human resources who will continue to take on challenges without being held back by precedents or previous successes, while working toward high goals without fear of failure
Ability to execute independently: Human resources who think independently with a sense of responsibility, and who are capable of performing to the end Abundant personal capabilities: Human resources who are capable of building trust relationships with the people around them through abundant personal capabilities and achieving results through cooperation
High sense of ethics: Human resources who are capable of faithfully putting compliance and customer-oriented initiatives into practice, based on a high sense of ethics

 Capturing and discovering a wide variety of needs through business evaluations, etc.

Launch of 77 Local Professional Sports Support Bonds (Donation-Type) and 77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bonds
In April 2019, we launched 77 Local Professional Sports Support Bonds (Donation-Type) and 77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bonds with the goal of satisfying customer needs for engaging in social contribution activities and backing sustainable growth of customers who support ESG efforts.
With 77 Local Professional Sports Support Bonds (Donation-Type), the Bank donates a portion of the fees and commissions received from the issuing company at the time of bond issuance, as activity funds for a professional sports team in Miyagi Prefecture selected by the customer from among bank-designated teams (Vegalta Sendai, Mynavi Vegalta Sendai Ladies, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, and the Sendai 89ERS).
With 77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bonds, preferential treatment is offered for a portion of fees and commissions at the time of privately placed corporate bond issuance, in order to support the sustainable growth of customers that support ESG efforts and have set specific targets for ESG measures.
Regional Regeneration and Revitalization Network (Nine Banks Network)
We participate in the Regional Regeneration and Revitalization Network (Nine Banks Network), a business alliance between nine regional banks (*) that works to create new value and regenerate and revitalize the regional economy by leveraging the information and networks held in different management bases and sales areas.
The Bank works with partner banks to resolve management issues, including matching clients between banks in cases where matching within one’s own bank is difficult, expanding sales channels, and introducing suppliers. For example, in February 2018, the Bank and a partner bank (The Hiroshima Bank) matched a client of the Bank that wanted to expand from Tohoku into western Japan with a client of a partner bank in the same industry that was struggling to find a successor, which led to an M&A deal.

Miyagi and Tohoku Food Tasting Fair and Food Japan 2018
We supported Food Japan 2018, the largest Japanese food tasting fair in the ASEAN countries, which was held in Singapore from October 25 to 27, 2018, and six of our clients with needs for developing overseas sales channels exhibited at the fair.
In addition, the Miyagi and Tohoku Food Tasting Fair was held, together by the Bank and related organizations within Miyagi Prefecture on the day prior to Food Japan 2018. Eight of our clients held business talks with approximately 40 visitors involved in the local restaurant industry.
Furthermore, for the purpose of test marketing by the exhibiting companies, local restaurant chefs were asked to develop dishes using the foods of exhibiting companies and these dishes were provided at actual restaurants for a period of roughly one month before the food tasting fair and feedback was sought.

In response to needs for property management and smooth asset succession by the elderly using civil trusts, along with the advance of the aging population, we started offering deposit accounts based on civil trust agreements in October 2018, and the 77 Apartment Loan (civil trust accounts) in March 2019.
A civil trust is a means for an
elderly trustor to entrust the
management of assets (real
estate, deposits, etc.) to a
trusted family member (trustee), in preparation for a decline in judgment ability caused by factors such as dementia. This type of trust is also called a family trust.
The use of a civil trust enables smooth estate division at the time of succession. In addition, the use of an apartment loan that supports a civil trust makes it possible to continue a real estate rental business and procure the funds needed for large-scale repairs, etc. even if the trustor suffers from dementia.
* Customers can also consult with the Bank’s subsidiary 77 Research and Consulting Co., Ltd. regarding entering a trust agreement.

  Earthquake Reconstruction Support
Reconstruction Support Policy
In view of the massive damage inflicted by the Great East Japan Earthquake, The 77 Bank formulated its “Reconstruction Support Policy” to contribute to the reconstruction and development of the regional economy. The objective of this policy is to fulfill the Bank’s responsibility as a regional financial institution that should work hand-in-hand with the local region, through the provision of financial services and financial intermediary functions aimed at supporting reconstruction efforts of the region and customers.
All executives and employees of the Bank are working to support the region and the Bank’s customers by tackling various challenges in order to restore Miyagi and the wider Tohoku region to their original states of places brimming with vitality, affluence and kindness.

Corporate rehabilitation support and business reform support
Support for corporate rehabilitation and business reforms by the Credit Supervision Division
The Corporate Support Office was established in the Credit Supervision Division, and is working to support corporate rehabilitation and the business reform of clients. Following the earthquake, the number of personnel in the Corporate Support Office was increased from five persons before the earthquake to 11 (as of March 31, 2019), in order to strengthen support for corporate rehabilitation and business reform.
In an effort to revitalize the regional economy and strengthen the soundness of the Bank’s assets, we have designated clients for which there is a need to plan and execute rehabilitation support measures, such as those who have repeatedly changed loan terms over many years, as corporate rehabilitation support clients, and are directly involved in corporate rehabilitation support for these clients.

Support for business reforms at branches
In order to strengthen efforts to improve borrower classification levels, branches conduct analysis regarding the necessity of business reform support for each client so as to identify to whom support should be provided. Based on such analysis, branches offer support for business reform, including presentation of approaches to resolve issues related to financial position and profitability.
Specifically, clients whose management intends to continue business, and for which improvements can be expected through the implementation of business reform support, are identified as business reform support clients, and support is provided through the formulation of business reform plans based on thorough discussions with the clients, as well as cooperation between the Corporate Support Office of the Credit Supervision Division and external experts.
In light of the impact of the earthquake, since April 2012, the scope of business reform support clients has been expanded, and the Corporate Support Office has started regular monitoring of business reform support clients to strengthen the involvement of the Headquarters in business reform support.

Establishment of the Nozomino Sub-Branch, a next generation branch
In June 2018, the Hebita Branch Nozomino Sub-Branch was established in Nozomino, Ishinomaki City, based on a new branch concept that differs from traditional ones, in order to create manpower, time, and space for business activities, with the aim of strengthening consulting capabilities and improving customer satisfaction.
This new branch offers a self-service counter (77 Smart Counter) that can be used with employee assistance, as well as tablets that support digital signatures when applying to open a new account.

  Corporate Governance Initiatives
Basic stance toward corporate governance
We will work to strengthen and enhance corporate governance in accordance with the following basic stance.
• In accordance with the Bank Creed, which is our basic principle of management, we will operate business that give
constant consideration to the public mission of a regional bank — contributing to the development of the regional economy
and society — through banking operations.
• We will improve the transparency of management and the appropriateness of processes and work together appropriately
with stakeholders including the regional society, clients, and shareholders for the Bank’s sustained growth and improvements in corporate value over the medium- to long-term.
Past Efforts to Enhance and Strengthen Governance
November 2015: Establishment of Corporate Governance Policy
In order to further improve the transparency of management and the appropriateness of processes, and to further enhance the corporate governance function, the Corporate Governance Committee was established as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, and the Corporate Governance Policy which states the basic stance toward corporate governance and the action policy for the Bank was established.
Discussion items for the Corporate Governance Committee
Necessary items from the perspective of enhancing the corporate governance function are discussed and reported to the Board of Directors.
• Nomination of Director candidates
• Appointment/dismissal of Representative Directors
• Compensation, etc. for Directors (excluding Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members) • Disciplinary actions on Directors and Executive Officers
• Analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, etc.
June 2017: Transition to a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee
The Bank has transitioned to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee to improve corporate value through further enhancement of corporate governance.
• We strengthened the audit function over the Board of Directors and executives by establishing an Audit & Supervisory Committee, the majority of which is
• composed of Outside Directors, and granting Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee Members voting rights on the Board of Directors.
• We worked to accelerate the decision making process by delegating a portion of the authority of the Board of Directors to Directors.
With this transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, we will work to further improve the transparency and objectivity of management
• by increasing the ratio of Outside Directors.
Along with the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, we have revised the compensation system for Directors and introduced a performance-linked compensation system in which Director compensation is linked to the degree of attainment of the management plan, etc.
June 2018: Revision of executive officer system and appointment of a female Director
The Executive Officer System introduced in April 2014 was partially revised, and the business execution function of Executive Officers was further strengthened. In addition, the former mayor of Sendai City, Ms. Emiko Okuyama was appointed as an Outside Director in order to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors through the diversification of Directors.
• A new position, Senior Executive Officer, was introduced to streamline and vitalize the Board of Directors, with an aim of accelerating decision-making,
oversight and business execution, as well as strengthening functions.

Strengthening of comprehensive risk management system
The 77 Bank’s risk management system
   Independent Auditors
  The operating environment surrounding financial institutions has significantly changed in recent years, exposing them to an unprecedented variety of risks. In this environment, financial institutions are required more than ever before to accurately identify, analyze and appropriately control risks.
From the viewpoint of increasing the soundness of management, the risks the Bank faces are assessed by category, and comprehensive risk management systems are established for self-control type risk management through comprehensive assessment, and by comparison and contrast with the Bank’s capital. At the same time, efforts are being made to improve risk management methods through means such as the enhancement of risk measurement techniques.
We have implemented risk capital management as a specific framework for comprehensive risk management. Risk capital management is a management method where a risk capital budget, which represent risk tolerance, is allocated by risk category to each unit (domestic business units, funds and securities units, and other units), and the risks measured for each unit are monitored to ensure that they do not exceed their respective budgets. Risk capital management is also utilized to monitor whether the expected profits that are suitable for the risks taken are being secured.

Responding to increasing cyberattacks
In order to respond to cyberattacks, which are becoming increasingly advanced and sophisticated on a daily basis, the Bank has established Cyber Security Management Regulations, and has implemented multi-layer technical measures, including the prevention of unauthorized intrusions and blocking of information leakage, as well as detection of malicious viruses.
In addition, the Bank has undertaken organizational measures such as drills and exercises that assume the occurrence of a cyberattack, and is continuously working to strengthen systems for swiftly responding to cyberattacks.
The Bank has developed a Disaster Emergency Response Plan that clarifies the basic principles of action for times of emergency, such as earthquakes or other disasters and systems failures.
Under the Disaster Emergency Response Plan, we have worked to develop systems to ensure business continuity through the establishment of business continuity plans for continuing the minimum operations required to maintain the finance function, and to achieve the prompt resumption or recovery of this function, in the event that the Bank incurs sufficient damage that it becomes impossible to fulfill normal bank operations, due to an unforeseen disaster. In addition, in order to confirm the effectiveness of the Disaster Emergency Response Plan, we conduct regular disaster drills and business continuity drills and conduct revisions to make our preparations for disaster more robust in consideration of the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in an effort to strengthen the Bank’s crisis response capabilities.

Going forward, along with the advancement of reconstruction efforts in the affected area, the Bank will steadily implement support measures according to the stage of earthquake reconstruction, and vigorously supply risk money through the promotion of financing focused on business feasibility and future potential as well as the utilization of various funds, after appropriately assessing the issues and needs of customers in various life stages.

Strengthening corporate rehabilitation support and business reform support
In order to support clients who have had difficulties repaying loans due to the impact of the earthquake, the Bank has responded flexibly to changes in loan conditions, including reductions in repayment amounts, depending on the degree of damage experienced by clients. After the earthquake, in order to strengthen the consulting functions, including corporate rehabilitation and business reform, we have increased the number of personnel at the Corporate Support Office (increased from five before the earthquake to current 11) in the Credit Supervision Division, which is a specialized department and stationed external experts with advanced corporate rehabilitation know-how in Credit Supervision Division as part of efforts to strengthen our structures.
We will work to support corporate rehabilitation and business reform of customers by flexibly supporting new issues and diverse needs that arise with advancements in the stage of earthquake reconstruction, and by continuing to conduct analysis and proposals aimed at resolving issues related to the financial position and profitability of customers.

Common KPIs that are comparable with investment trust sales companies
1. Percentage of customers by gains (losses) from investment trusts
For customers holding investment trusts, the cumulative gains (losses) from investment trusts (after deduction of commissions), from the time of purchase held as of the base date, is calculated, and the percentage of customers by gains (losses) from investment trusts is presented.
This indicator can be used to visualize the distribution of gains (losses) since the time of purchase, for investment trusts held by individual customers.
The performance of investment trusts is positive for 26.1% of customers. In addition, as a point of reference, the percentage of customers by gains (losses) from investment trusts including realized gains and losses at the time of sale (voluntary KPI), is positive for 32.2% of customers.
The percentage of customers with results of “Over -10% under 0%” is the highest. This could be the result of factors including a short investment trust holding period for customers due to the company having entered into business relatively recently, the negative impact equivalent to purchase commissions, and market volatility. To support the asset management of customers going forward, we will endeavor to introduce products and provide information suitable for long-term, diversified investment.
Key performance indicators (voluntary KPIs) for sales of financial products
1. Surveys on top-selling investment trusts
We regularly conduct surveys on the top-selling investment trusts and use these surveys to review and expand the product lineup, in order to offer an investment trust product lineup that supports the diverse investment needs of customers.
Number of investment trust products
 2. Costs and returns for the top 20 investment trusts in terms of deposit balance
The relationship between the costs and returns for each trust and the balance weighted average is presented for the top 20 investment trusts, in terms of deposit balance (based on March 31, 2019), with at least five years since trust establishment.
This indicator can be used to see how many products with the track record of returns commensurate with costs have been provided to customers
Returns exceed costs for 18 of the top 20 investment trusts, in terms of deposit balance.

Installation of priority seats
Priority seats for use by elderly customers and customers with children that can be used during waiting times have been installed at all branches.

To enable the use of our services by customers who are visually impaired, we have equipped all of our ATMs with voice interaction functions, and also display Audio Codes on our ATM Usage Guide leaflets in order to allow voice announcements using a dedicated reader.
Installation of ramps and elimination of level differences at branch entrances
We have actively worked to install ramps and eliminate level differences at entrances to allow easy branch access for people with wheelchairs.
<Equipment, supplies, tools, etc. at branches>
Installation of COMUOON desktop-type interaction support system
In order to make customers including elderly customers feel comfortable using the Bank, we have installed the COMUOON desktop-type interaction support system, which enables smooth communication at all branches within Miyagi Prefecture. This device uses a high- performance microphone to listen to the voice of the person speaking and reproduces a voice that is easy-to- listen to through egg-shaped speakers.
Installation of lap writing tables
Lap writing tables have been installed at all branches so that elderly customers and customers with disabilities can enter forms and documents while remaining seated at a sofa or chair.
Equipping branches with wheelchairs
In order to make elderly customers and customers with disabilities feel comfortable using the Bank, all branches within Miyagi Prefecture have been equipped with wheelchairs.
In order to make people who
feel uneasy towards
conversations at bank
counters (customers with
hearing disabilities, foreigners,
elderly people, etc.) feel
comfortable using the Bank,
all branches have been
equipped with communication boards (*) and writing boards to confirm the purpose of bank visits and transactions.  Measures to strengthen security related to transactions using cash cards
<Setting of withdrawal limit>
The withdrawal limit per day for individual customers using a cash card has been set at ¥1 million in order to prevent increased damage from cash card counterfeiting, theft, fraud and bank transfer scams. In addition, IC cash cards for which biometric authentication information has been registered can be used to withdraw up to ¥2 million per day as long as the Bank’s ATMs are used.
Customers who wish to change this withdrawal limit should consult a service counter at the Bank’s Head Office or a branch.
<Partial use limits on bank transfers>
To prevent damage from financial crimes such as bank transfer scams and refund scams, which are widespread throughout Japan, and to protect the valuable deposits of customers, we have set limits on transfers using cash cards at ATMs for some customers.
Applicable customers who wish to make transfers using a cash card at ATMs should consult with a service counter at the Bank’s Head Office or a branch.
<Responding to the loss, etc., of cash cards on holidays>
To prevent damage from counterfeit or stolen cash cards and stolen bankbooks, we have established a 24-hour system for customers to contact us regarding incidents such as loss or theft of cash cards.
Strengthening security for Internet banking
In light of the fact that the unauthorized use of Internet banking is becoming a social problem, we provide compensation for corporate clients that have incurred damages due to unauthorized withdrawals, and launched one-time passwords (temporary passwords that change after a certain amount of time has elapsed) in our Internet banking services for corporate clients and individual business owners.
In addition, in our Internet banking services for retail customers (77 Direct Service), we provide temporary passwords, email notification passwords, and risk-based authentication. In addition, in July 2018, we lowered the limit amount on payments when using email notification passwords, and in September 2018, we began providing a biometric authentication function for logging in to Internet banking using a smartphone.
In addition to the measures above, we introduced a security feature that detects both virus infections on the computers of customers and unauthorized transactions, and which requires no customer installation.
Signing of an agreement on the joint handling of cybercrimes with the Miyagi Prefectural Police
In light of the increase in cybercrimes throughout Japan, the Bank has signed an agreement on the joint handling of cybercrimes with the Miyagi Prefectural Police in an effort to further strengthen coordination with the Miyagi Prefectural Police and to promptly detect and prevent the spread of damage from cybercrimes.
In addition, guidance signs for people with hearing disabilities have been installed in branches, and communication by writing is conducted with customers who have hearing disabilities.
(Note) The communication board has been created by the Japanese Bankers Association and uses pictorial symbols to represent the major banking transactions and procedures.
Display of service dog welcome stickers
Service dogs for people with disabilities are welcome at our branches, and service dog welcome stickers are displayed at the entrance of each branch.

Interaction with the Region E S G
 Implementation of One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign [140th Anniversary Project]
The One Branch, One Social Contribution Campaign has been carried out as part of the 140th Anniversary Project, in an effort to deepen interactions with the region as a member of the local community and raise the awareness of Bank employees regarding social contribution. These
activities were conducted in the period from
August to the end of December 2018 at all of the Bank’s 142 branches (excluding branches that only offer transfers) after selecting social contribution activities in accordance with the Bank’s six themes.

Participation in regional events
The 35th Sendai Aoba Festival was held in May 2019, during which approximately 160 employees participated in the Yamaboko Parade, which was the highlight of the festival. The stirring sound of the Japanese drums and the energy of the people pulling the Bank’s “Shichifuku Odaiko Yamaboko” in the parade and the beautiful performance of the dancers were met with applause and cheers from the audience.

During the Sendai Tanabata Festival, which is held in August every year, we put up Tanabata decorations in front of the branch located in the arcade where the festival is held and Head Office Business Division. At the traditional Dontosai Festival that celebrates the Lunar New Year every January, approximately 50 employees made the traditional hadakamairi (naked shrine visit) to Osaki Hachiman Shrine wearing only light clothing in January 2019.

Forest conservation activities [140th Anniversary Project]
Executives and new employees from FY2019 planted 1,000 black pine seedlings in the Arahama District of Sendai City, based on the “Citizens’ Reforestation Activities to Restore the Miyagi Coastal Forests” agreement that was entered into with Miyagi Prefecture, etc. in September 2018 as part of the 140th Anniversary Project. The tree planting area has been named the “77 Forest for the Future,” and will be managed as a coastal disaster prevention forest to protect the region from disaster.

Environmental conservation activities through financial products and services
The Bank supports companies and individual customers actively involved in social contribution activities such as those for environmental conservation through the provision of environmentally-friendly financial products and services.
<Products for businesses>
We offer the 77 Social Contribution Activities Support Loan for companies engaged in efforts such as the prevention of global warming and the introduction of recycling-related equipment.
In addition, from April 2019, we started providing the 77 ESG Privately Placed Corporate Bond for companies that have formulated targets for ESG measures.
<Products for individual customers> [140th Anniversary Project]
We offer the Fidelity Three Basic Fund (Water, Land and Energy), an investment trust that invests in environmentally- conscious companies, as well as reduced interest rates for the 77 Car Loan for customers purchasing eco-cars.
In addition, from July 2018, we started offering the 77 ESG Japanese Equities Open (Alias: Miyagi no Kizuna) to commemorate the 140th Anniversary of our foundation. The fund donates a portion of the trust fees received by the Bank to restoration activities of the coastal disaster prevention forest, which suffered catastrophic damage from the earthquake. <Offering bankbooks that use environmentally-friendly materials>
Our bankbooks use paper cloth, which can be turned into recycled paper, for material;
vegetable oil inks for printing to reduce toxic gases in the incineration process; and PVC-free
materials for the magnetic stripes.
In addition, from April 2018, we have given users the option of selecting an online bankbook when opening an account at the counter, which was previously available only through the app for account opening and Internet banking.
The online bankbook is a convenient, eco-friendly bankbook that allows users to make balance and transaction record inquiries online, such as through using Internet banking instead of issuing a paper bankbook.

Supporting Financial Education
 A course provided by The 77 Bank has been held at the Faculty of Business Administration at Tohoku Gakuin University since FY2012 for the purpose of promoting social contributions to the region through education and research contributing to the development of the regional economy and human resources.
This course is taught by an employee of the Bank, and covers topics such as specific details of bank operations, recent financial trends, and the role of regional financial institutions. The course was held for the 8th time in FY2019, and it has been participated by 272 students since the start of the course in September 2018.
National High School Student Finance and Economics Quiz Championship “Economics Koshien” Miyagi Tournament
The Miyagi Tournament of the National High School Student Finance and Economics Quiz Championship “Economics Koshien” has been held since FY2010 through joint sponsorship with the Association for the Promotion of Financial Literacy, in an effort to make social contributions to the region through an educational project for acquiring the financial and economics knowledge that is essential for life planning and safeguarding one’s lifestyle. In December 2018, the 10th Miyagi Tournament was held at the Head Office of the Bank.

The 77Bank Currency and Banking Museum [140th Anniversary Project]
The 77Bank Currency and Banking Museum was opened in December 1998 in celebration of the 120th anniversary of our founding and in gratitude for the many years of support from people in the region. Media such as exhibition panels, actual materials, videos, and experiential displays are used to introduce topics, including the history and roles of money, the birth and development of banks, and industry and economy in Miyagi Prefecture and Japan in a manner that is easy to understand.
The center was reopened after remodeling in March 2019, as part of the 140th Anniversary Project, and new features including a projection mapping and a children’s area have been added.
77 Kids Land financial education website for children [140th Anniversary Project]

Conducting the Student City experiential educational program
We provide a Student City experiential educational program for elementary school students, conducted at the Sendai Children Experience Plaza Elem, which was opened by Sendai City in September 2014 as a working experience facility.

The 77 Caring Fund Raising Committee was established in 1994 by the executives and employees of the Bank for the purpose of donating to social welfare projects and facilities in appreciation of the support received from the local community to that time.
During FY2019, we made a disaster relief donation of ¥1.96 million to the Japanese Red Cross Society as support for the regions affected by the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018. In addition, a total of ¥3.37 million was donated to 10 social welfare facilities recommended by the Miyagi Prefecture Social Welfare Council and 14 volunteer groups. The donated funds are used to cover facility repair costs, running costs for volunteer activities and other expenses.

Cooperation in blood donation projects through a corporate blood donation campaign
We have conducted a corporate blood donation campaign in cooperation with the Miyagi Prefecture Red Cross Blood Center in order to contribute to ensuring a stable supply of blood required for medical treatment. During FY2019, a blood donation campaign using a mobile blood bank was conducted at the Head Office and branches, with 294 participants.
In 2008, in commemoration of the 130th anniversary of our establishment, the Bank donated one mobile blood bank to the Miyagi Prefecture Red Cross Blood Center, which is now being used throughout the prefecture.
Small Kindness Movement
Since the establishment of the Miyagi Prefecture Headquarters of the Small Kindness Movement, the Bank has been involved in the planning and operation of these activities, while serving as the secretariat for 43 years. The Summer Sendai Cleaning Campaign is conducted each year prior to opening of the Sendai Tanabata Festival, and in FY2019, it was participated by approximately 290 people including 110 employees of the Bank.
Each year, we donate wheelchairs to social welfare facilities in the prefecture, and make visits to welfare facilities for the elderly and hold entertainment performances. In addition, we donate mini sunflower seeds to elementary schools in the prefecture, and gather used stamps and donate them to stamp collection organizations.

          Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
d. Trading Account Securities, Investment Securities and Money Held in Trust—Securities other than investments in affiliates are classified into three categories, based principally on the Companies’ intent, as follows: (1) trading account securities, which are held for the purpose of earning capital gains in the near term, are reported at fair value and the related unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings; (2) held- to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost; and (3) available-for-sale securities, which are not classified as either of the aforementioned securities, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity.
The cost of trading account securities and available-for-sale securities sold is determined based on the moving-average method.
In addition, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries not accounted for by the equity method are reported at cost determined by the moving-average method.
Available-for-sale securities for which fair value is extremely difficult to determine are reported at cost determined by the moving-average method.
For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, investment securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income.
Securities included in money held in trust are also classified and accounted for using the same method as above.
The components of trust assets are accounted for based on the standard appropriate for each asset type. Instruments held in trust for trading purposes are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other income/ expenses. Instruments held in trust classified as available-for- sale are recorded at fair value with the corresponding unrealized gains/losses recorded directly in a separate component of equity. Instruments held in trust classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.
e. Tangible Fixed Assets—Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and gains deferred on the sale and replacement of certain assets. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets, except for lease assets, is mainly computed using the declining-balance method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of useful lives is principally from 5 to 31 years for buildings and from 4 to 20 years for equipment. Lease assets under finance lease transactions, in which substantial ownership is not deemed to have been transferred, are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The salvage value is zero or the guaranteed amounts if specified in the lease contracts (see Note 2.o).
f. Intangible Fixed Assets—The amortization of intangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method. Capitalized costs of computer software developed/obtained for internal use are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of five years.
g. Long-Lived Assets—The Companies review their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows (“DCFs”) from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
h. Foreign Currency Items—Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies held by the Bank at year-end are translated into Japanese yen at the current exchange rates in effect at each consolidated balance sheet date. Exchange gains and losses are recognized in the fiscal periods in which they occur.
i. Reserve for Possible Loan Losses—The Bank determines the amount of the reserve for possible loan losses by means of management’s judgment and assessment of future losses based on a self-assessment system. This system reflects past experience of credit losses, possible future credit losses, business and economic conditions, the character, quality and performance of the portfolio, and other pertinent indicators.
As part of the Bank’s self-assessment system, the quality of all loans is assessed by branches and the credit supervisory division with a subsequent audit by the Bank’s asset review and inspection division in accordance with the Bank’s policy and rules for self-assessment of asset quality.
The Bank has established a credit rating system under which its debtors are classified into five categories. The credit rating system is used in the self-assessment of asset quality. All loans are classified into one of the following five categories for self- assessment purposes: “normal,” “caution,” “possible bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “legal bankruptcy.”
For loans to borrowers classified as legal bankruptcy or virtual bankruptcy, the Bank fully provides the net amount of loans and estimated collectible amounts by collateral or guarantees. Regarding loans to borrowers classified as possible bankruptcy, a specific reserve is provided to the necessary extent for the net amount of loans and estimated collectible amounts by collateral or guarantees.
For large debtors who are likely to become bankrupt and debtors with restructured loans, if the cash flows from collection of the principal and interest can be reasonably estimated, the reserve is provided based on the difference between the relevant cash flows discounted by the initial contractual interest rates and the carrying amounts of the loans (the “DCF method”).
The reserve for other possible loan losses is calculated based on the specific actual past loss ratio for normal and caution categories and the fair value of the collateral for collateral- dependent loans and other solvency factors including the value of future cash flows for the other self-assessment categories.
The Bank’s subsidiaries determine the reserve for possible loan losses by a similar self-assessment system as that of the Bank.
j. Reserve for Stock-Based Benefits—Reserve for stock-based benefits is provided for the grants of the Bank’s shares to directors, etc. in accordance with the stock grant program based on the estimated stock-based benefits liabilities as of the fiscal year end.
k. Reserve for Reimbursement of Deposits—Reserve for reimbursement of deposits which were derecognized as liabilities is provided for the future estimated payments for reimbursement claims on dormant deposit accounts based on the historical reimbursement experience.
l. Reserve for Contingent Losses—Reserve for contingent losses is provided for the future estimated payments of burden money to the Credit Guarantee Corporations based on the historical experience of subrogation.
THE 77 BANK, LTD. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES Year Ended March 31, 2019
1. BASIS OF PRESENTING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and the Enforcement Regulation for the Banking Law of Japan (the “Banking Law”), and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to the 2018 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2019.
In accordance with the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and other relevant regulations, all Japanese yen figures in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen, except for per share data. Accordingly, the total of each account may not be equal to the combined total of individual items. Also, U.S. dollar amounts have been rounded down to the nearest thousand dollars.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which The 77 Bank, Ltd. (the “Bank”) is incorporated and operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.99 to U.S.$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2019. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Bank and its significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”). There were five (seven in 2018) consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2019.
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Bank, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profits included in assets resulting from transactions within the Companies are eliminated in consolidation.
(1) Scope of consolidation
Consolidated Subsidiaries
77 Business Services Co., Ltd., 77 Jimu Daiko Co., Ltd. and 77 Computer Service Co., Ltd. were excluded from the scope of consolidation due to completion of liquidation.
77 Research & Consulting Co., Ltd. which was newly established has been included in the scope of consolidation from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
77 Capital Co., Ltd.
77 New Business Investment Limited Partnership
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership Unconsolidated subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of
consolidation because they are not material to the consolidated financial statements in terms of total assets, income, net income (corresponding to the Bank’s share), retained earnings (corresponding to the Bank’s share) and accumulated other comprehensive income (corresponding to the Bank’s share).
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership which was newly established has been included in the scope of unconsolidated subsidiaries from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
(2) Equity method
Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Not Accounted for by the Equity Method
77 Capital Co., Ltd.
77 New Business Investment Limited Partnership
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership
These companies are excluded from the scope of equity
method accounting because they are not material to the consolidated financial statements in terms of net income (corresponding to the Bank’s share), retained earnings (corresponding to the Bank’s share) and accumulated other comprehensive income (corresponding to the Bank’s share).
77 Strategic Investment Limited Partnership which was newly established has been included in the scope of unconsolidated subsidiaries not accounted for by the equity method from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
b. Business Combinations—Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Acquisition-related costs, such as advisory fees or professional fees, are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, an acquirer shall report in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition, the acquirer shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Such adjustments shall be recognized as if the accounting for the business combination had been completed at the acquisition date. A parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary might change if the parent purchases or sells ownership interests in its subsidiary. The carrying amount of noncontrolling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in the parent’s ownership interest in its subsidiary while the parent retains its controlling interest in its subsidiary. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted is accounted for as capital surplus as long as the parent retains control over its subsidiary.
c. Cash and Cash Equivalents—For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents represent cash and amounts due from the Bank of Japan.

           m. Employees’ Retirement and Pension Plans—In calculation of projected benefit obligations, expected benefits are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Treatment of prior service cost and actuarial gains and losses is as follows:
Prior service cost is charged to expenses when incurred.
Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized by the straight-line method from the following fiscal year after the fiscal year when they were incurred over a definite period (10 years) with the employees’ average remaining service period when incurred.
Consolidated subsidiaries apply a shortcut method whereby the amount of the retirement benefits required to be paid if all the employees voluntarily retired at the end of the fiscal year is regarded as projected benefit obligations in determining the liability for employees’ retirement benefits and net periodic retirement benefit costs.
n. Asset Retirement Obligations—The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the DCFs required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost.
o. Leases
As a lessee
Finance lease transactions are capitalized to recognize lease assets and lease obligations in the consolidated balance sheet. As a lessor
All finance leases that are deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as lease receivables, and all finance leases that are deemed not to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as investments in leases.
p. Income Taxes—The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences.
q. Derivatives and Hedging Activities—It is the Bank’s policy to use derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) primarily for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with its assets and liabilities. The Bank also utilizes derivatives to meet the needs of its clients while entering into derivatives as a part of its trading activities. The Bank enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions as a means of hedging its interest rate risk on certain loans and investment securities and to meet the needs of its clients. The Bank also enters into currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and currency options to hedge foreign currency exchange risk associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to meet the needs of its clients.
Derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Gains or losses on derivative transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. If derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions.
The interest rate swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expense or income.
r. Per Share Information—Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits or share consolidation.
Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net income per share of common stock assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants.
Cash dividends per share presented in the consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.
s. Additional Information—The Bank has applied “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Statement No. 28, February 16, 2018) (hereinafter, “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting”) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Accordingly, the Bank added the information indicated in explanatory note 8 (excluding the total amount of valuation allowance) of “Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” prescribed in Paragraphs 3 to 5 of the Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting in the Note 24, “Income Taxes.”
3. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year and cash and due from banks in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, was as follows:

   Investment securities as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following:
* Unlisted equity securities for which the fair value is extremely difficult to determine are not included.
Securities, other than trading account securities, with readily determinable fair value, whose fair value significantly declined compared with the acquisition cost and whose fair value is not considered likely to recover to their acquisition cost, are written down to the respective fair value. The related losses on revaluation are charged to income for the fiscal year.
Impairment losses were recognized for available-for-sale securities in the amount of ¥44 million ($396 thousand), consisting of ¥44 million ($396 thousand) of equity securities, and ¥99 million, consisting of ¥99 million of other securities for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The criteria for determining whether the fair value has “significantly declined” are defined based on the asset classification of the issuer in the internal standards for asset quality self-assessment as follows:
(a) Normal issuer: Fair value declined by 50% or more of the acquisition cost or fair value declined between 30% and 50% and average fair value during the past one month declined by 50% or more (30% or more for issuers who have credit risk more than a certain level).
(b) Caution issuers: Fair value declined by 30% or more of the acquisition cost.
(c) Legally bankrupt, virtually bankrupt, and possibly bankrupt issuers: Fair value is lower than the acquisition cost.
Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were ¥32,581 million ($293,548 thousand) and ¥38,786 million, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses on these sales, computed on a moving average cost basis, were ¥6,051 million ($54,518 thousand) and ¥932 million ($8,397 thousand), respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2019, and ¥3,030 million and ¥880 million, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2018.

            5. MONEY HELD IN TRUST
The carrying amounts and aggregate fair values of money held in trust as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:
Loans and bills discounted as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, included the following loans:
9. LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Bank recognized impairment losses of ¥761 million ($6,856 thousand) and ¥709 million on certain operating branches, business premises, branches to be closed, and unused facilities for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The impairment losses were composed of ¥165 million ($1,486 thousand) on buildings, ¥525 million ($4,730 thousand) on land and ¥70 million ($630 thousand) on other fixed assets for the year ended March 31, 2019, and ¥401 million on buildings, ¥243 million on land and ¥65 million on other fixed assets for the year ended March 31, 2018.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, the Bank recognizes each individual branch office as a cash-generating unit for which it continues to manage and monitor identifiable cash flows. Branch offices to be closed and facilities not in operation are individually assessed for impairment. Subsidiaries recognize each company as a cash-generating unit. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the DCFs from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. The DCFs were calculated using discount rates of 8.0% and 5.0% for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the net selling price was determined by quotation from a third-party vendor.
10. CUSTOMERS’ LIABILITIES FOR ACCEPTANCES AND GUARANTEES
All contingent liabilities arising from acceptances and guarantees are reflected in “Acceptances and guarantees.” “Customers’ liabilities for acceptances and guarantees” are shown as assets, representing the Bank’s right to receive indemnity from the applicants.
The amount of guarantee obligations for privately placed corporate bonds included in securities as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, was ¥14,993 million ($135,084 thousand) and ¥6,165 million, respectively.
11. ASSETS PLEDGED
Assets pledged as collateral and their relevant liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:
Other assets include security deposits for financial instruments amounting to ¥3,700 million ($33,336 thousand) and ¥2,130 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and guarantee deposits for leased tangible fixed assets (lessee side) amounting to ¥92 million ($828 thousand) and ¥93 million as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
12. LOAN COMMITMENTS
Contracts of overdraft facilities and loan commitments are contracts with customers to lend up to the prescribed limits in response to customers’ applications for a loan, as long as there is no violation of any condition within the contracts. As of March 31, 2019, the unused amount of such contracts totaled ¥1,647,277 million ($14,841,670 thousand), of which amounts with original agreement terms of less than one year were ¥1,564,783 million ($14,098,414 thousand). As of March 31, 2018, the unused amount of such contracts totaled ¥1,661,188 million, of which amounts with original agreement terms of less than one year were ¥1,569,181 million.
Since many of the commitments expire without being drawn upon, the unused amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement. Most of these contracts have conditions allowing the Companies to refuse customers’ applications for a loan or decrease the contract limits based on proper reasons (e.g., changes in financial situation, deterioration in customers’ creditworthiness). At the inception of the contracts, the Companies obtain collateral real estate, securities, etc., if considered to be necessary. Subsequently, the Companies perform a periodic review of the customers’ business results based on internal rules and take necessary measures to reconsider conditions in contracts and require additional collateral and guarantees.

Loans to borrowers in bankruptcy represent nonaccrual loans to debtors who are legally bankrupt, as defined in the Enforcement Ordinance for the Corporation Tax Law.
Past due loans are nonaccrual loans which include loans classified as “possible bankruptcy” and “virtual bankruptcy.”
Nonaccrual loans are defined as loans for which the Bank has discontinued accruing interest income due to substantial doubt existing about the ultimate collection of principal and/or interest. Such loans are classified either as “possible bankruptcy” or “virtual bankruptcy” under the Bank’s self- assessment guidelines.
In addition to past due loans, certain other loans classified as “caution” under the Bank’s self-assessment guidelines include past due loans (three months or more) which consist of loans for which the principal and/or interest is three months or more past due, but exclude loans to borrowers in bankruptcy and past due loans.
Restructured loans are loans where the Bank and its subsidiaries relax lending conditions by reducing the original interest rate or by forbearing interest payments or principal repayments to support the borrower’s reorganization. Restructured loans exclude loans to borrowers in bankruptcy, past due loans or past due loans (three months or more).

17. PERFORMANCE-LINKED STOCK COMPENSATION SYSTEM
The Bank has introduced a performance-linked stock compensation system (the “System”) based on the Board Incentive Plan (“BIP”) trust from the perspective of enhancing motivation to make contributions to improving the medium- to long-term performance and corporate value by further clarifying the linkage between compensation to directors, etc. and stock value of the Bank.
Under the System, the Bank’s shares are acquired using the funds contributed by the Bank as compensation to directors, etc. through the trust and such shares are granted to directors, etc. through the trust according to their ranks and achievement of management plans. Said transactions are related to the System.
The Bank’s shares remaining in the trust are recorded as treasury stock under “Equity” and the carrying amount of such treasury stock was ¥1,243 million ($11,199 thousand) and ¥1,514 million and the number of shares was 452 thousand and 551 thousand as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
18. EQUITY
Japanese banks are subject to the Banking Law and to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”). The significant provisions in the Companies Act and the Banking Law that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: a. Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the general meeting of stockholders. For companies that meet certain criteria such as (1) having a Board of Directors, (2) having independent auditors, (3) having an Audit & Supervisory Board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than two years of normal term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Bank meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends-in-kind (noncash assets) to stockholders subject to certain limitations and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Bank can do so because it stipulates this in its articles of incorporation. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury stock. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the stockholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¥3 million.
b. Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve and Surplus
The Banking Law requires that an amount equal to 20% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of the legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 100% of stated capital.
Under the Companies Act and the Banking Law, the aggregate amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve that exceeds 100% of the stated capital may be made available for dividends by resolution of the stockholders after transferring such excess to retained earnings in accordance with the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and the legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that stated capital, legal reserve, additional paid-in

b. Method of determining the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets
The expected rate of return on plan assets is determined considering allocation of plan assets which are expected currently and in the future and the long-term rates of return which are expected currently and in the future from the various components of the plan assets.

          Maturities of investment in leases for finance leases as of March 31, 2019, are as follows:
secure the soundness of assets and control procedures for identifying, monitoring, and controlling credit risk. Additionally, the Bank utilizes the “Credit Rating System” applied to counterparties granted with credit from the viewpoint of identifying credit risk objectively and enhancing credit risk control.
In addition, as an organization responsible for credit risk management, credit risk control functions and review functions have been established to secure the effectiveness of credit risk management.
The Risk Management Division, as a credit risk control function, is engaged in identifying the level of future possible credit risk and the status of credit concentration in major borrowers through measurement of the level of credit risk and analysis of credit portfolios.
The Credit Supervision Division, as a review control function, is engaged in reviewing lending operations based on strict examination standards, system development for strengthening the daily control of loan receivables, and appropriate maintenance of operational procedures.
Market risk management
a. Market Risk Management System
The Bank has established the “Market Risk Control Policy” as a basic policy for market risk management and various rules concerning market risk management. Based on these policies and rules, the Bank clarifies fundamental approaches for appropriate market risk control operations and control procedures for identifying, monitoring and controlling market risk.
As an organization responsible for market risk management, a market risk control function (middle office) has been established and furthermore, the operating function (front office) and the administration function (back office) have been separated. Additionally, market risk control function staffs are assigned to the operating function to secure the effectiveness of market risk management.
The Risk Management Division, as a market risk control function, measures the level of market risk of the Bank as a whole using Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) approach models and other models and regularly monitors the status of compliance with position limits and loss limits established according to the type and characteristics of transactions to control the level of market risk within a certain range.
In addition, an ALM and Income Control Committee was established for the purpose of analyzing flexible investment strategies in order to prevent risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and market prices, while forecasting future interest rates, market prices, and trends of fund and business conditions. The committee is also responsible for securing the soundness of management and also improving profitability at the same time based on appropriate asset and liability management through the unification of risk management and earnings control.
b. Quantitative Information about Market Risk
The Bank adopts the variance-covariance method (holding period: 125 business days for strategic equity securities and 60 business days for others; confidence interval: 99.0%; observation period: 250 business days) in computing the VaR with respect to money held in trust, securities, Japanese yen deposits and loans, and Japanese yen money market funds. The volume of market risk (estimated losses) that the Bank is exposed to as of March 31, 2019, amounts to ¥76,667 million ($690,755 thousand) (¥66,894 million in 2018) as a whole. However, the risk under certain abnormal market fluctuations may not be captured since, under the VaR method, the volume of market risk under a definite probability of statistically computed incidence is measured based on historical market fluctuations.
The Bank implements back testing to compare the VaR computed by the model with actual profit and loss in the securities and confirms that the measurement model in use captures the market risk with sufficient precision. Liquidity risk management
The Bank has established the “Liquidity Risk Control Policy” as a basic policy for liquidity risk management and various rules concerning liquidity risk management. Based on these policies and rules, the Bank clarifies fundamental approaches for stable funding of operations and control procedures for identifying, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. In addition, the Bank has established the “Contingency Plan for Liquidity” to enable it to make quick and correct responses to unexpected events.
Furthermore, as an organization responsible for liquidity risk management, a liquidity risk control function has been established and a cash management function and a settlement control function have been established to control daily cash management and settlement related to cash and securities.
The Risk Management Division, as a liquidity risk control function, manages the liquidity risk of the Bank as a whole by identifying, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk.
The Treasury Administration and International Division, as a cash management control function and settlement control function, prepares daily or monthly cash flow projections and conducts cash management by identifying possible funds and liquidity of assets and verifying the concentration of settlement of major account funds to a certain date. The Division also controls settlement by identifying the status of settlement through systems such as the BOJ-NET and among financial institutions.
Risk management system of subsidiaries
The subsidiaries have a risk management system similar to that of the Bank.
(4) Supplementary Explanation about Fair Values of Financial
Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments include, in addition to the value determined based on market prices, valuations calculated on a reasonable basis if no market prices are available. Since certain assumptions are used in calculating the value, the outcome of such calculation may vary if different assumptions are used.
(5) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The carrying amount, the fair value, and the differences thereof as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, are disclosed below. Note that unlisted equity securities for which fair value is extremely difficult to determine are not included in the following table (see Note 2 below) and insignificant accounts in terms of the carrying amount are omitted:

      27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
(1) Group Policy for Financial Instruments
The Companies provide financial services such as credit card business and leasing operations in addition to banking operations. In the course of these operations, the Companies raise funds principally through deposit taking and invest funds in loans, securities, and others. As such, the Bank holds financial assets and liabilities which are subject to fluctuation in interest rates and conducts comprehensive Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) to avoid unfavorable effects from interest rate fluctuations. Derivatives are also employed by the Bank as part of ALM.
(2) Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial
Instruments
Financial assets held by the Companies mainly consist of loans to domestic corporations, local government agencies, and individual customers which are exposed to credit risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from nonperformance of borrowers and interest rate risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from fluctuations in interest rates.
Securities, mainly debt securities, equity securities, and investment trusts are held to maturity and for other purposes and also certain debt securities are held for the purpose of selling to customers. These securities are exposed to credit risk of issuers and market risks of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices. In addition, they are exposed to market liquidity risk that the Companies may suffer from losses resulting from difficulties in executing financial transactions in certain environments such as market turmoil.
Financial liabilities, mainly consisting of liquid deposits or time deposits taken from corporate and individual customers, are exposed to cash flow risk that the Bank may experience a situation where unexpected cash flows are incurred in certain environments where the credit rating of the Bank may be lowered and, accordingly, necessary funding may become difficult.
Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign exchange risk that the Bank may suffer from losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives mainly include interest rate swaps and bond futures, which are used to manage exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates of loans and investment securities, and foreign exchange forward contracts, which are used to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting is applied to certain hedging activities related to loans and investment securities as hedged items.

Money held in trust
For securities that are part of trust property in an independently managed monetary trust with the primary purpose to manage securities, the fair values of equity securities and debt securities are determined using the quoted price of the stock exchange, Japan Securities Dealers Association, or the price calculated by financial institutions. The fair value of investment trust is determined using the published standard quotation or the standard quotation offered by the securities investment advisors.

          determined using the future cash flows (coupons, redemption of principal, guarantee fees) discounted at an interest rate considering the market interest rates and issuers’ credit risk.
(4) Loans and bills discounted
With respect to loans with floating interest rates, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since the fair value approximates the carrying amount as they reflect the market interest rates over a short period, unless the creditworthiness of the borrower has changed significantly since the loan origination. With respect to loans with fixed interest rates, for each category of loan based on the type of loan, internal ratings, and maturity length, the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected cash flows of aggregated amounts of principal and interest discounted at a rate which is the rate assumed if a new loan was made, or market interest rate, which is adjusted by the standard spread (including overhead ratio) by credit rating. The carrying amount is presented as the fair value if the maturity is within a short time period (less than one year) and the fair value approximates the carrying amount.
For receivables from “legally bankrupt,” “virtually bankrupt,” and “possibly bankrupt” borrowers, possible loan losses are estimated based on the DCF method or factors such as the expected amounts to be collected from collateral and guarantees. Since the fair value of these items approximates the carrying amount, net of the currently expected loan losses, such carrying amount is presented as the fair value.
For loans for which the repayment due date is not defined because of the characteristics that the loan amount is limited within the pledged assets, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since the fair value is assumed to approximate the carrying amount considering the expected repayment schedule and terms of the interest rates.
Liabilities
(1) Deposits
Regarding demand deposits, the amount payable as of the balance sheet date (i.e., the carrying amount) is considered to be the fair value. Time deposits and negotiable certificates
of deposit are grouped by maturity length, and the fair value is determined using the present value of the aggregate amounts of principal and interest discounted at an interest rate that would be applied to newly accepted deposits. For deposits with maturities within a short time period (less than one year) and whose fair value approximates the carrying amount, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value.
(2) Borrowed money
For each type of borrowed money financed, the fair value is determined based on the present value of the aggregated amounts of principal and interest discounted at a rate which is the rate assumed if a new financing was made. The carrying amount is presented as the fair value if the maturity is within a short time period (less than one year) and the fair value approximates the carrying amount.

28. DERIVATIVES
It is the Bank’s policy to use derivatives primarily for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with its assets and liabilities. The Bank also utilizes derivatives to meet the needs of its clients while entering into derivatives as a part of its trading activities.
The Bank enters into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions as a means of hedging its interest rate risk on certain loans and investment securities while entering into interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions to meet the needs of its clients.
The Bank also enters into currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, and currency options to hedge foreign exchange risk associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to meet the needs of its clients.
Derivatives are subject to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the exposure created by potential fluctuations of market conditions, including interest or foreign exchange rates. Credit risk is the possibility that a loss may result from a counterparty’s failure to perform its obligations under a contract.
The Bank sets limits on credit risk for those derivatives by limiting the counterparties to major financial institutions and securities companies and establishing maximum risk exposures to the counterparties.
The Bank has established a standard of risk management including management approaches for each type of risk. Derivative transactions entered into by the Bank have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate trading activities and credit risk management including maximum risk exposures and loss-cutting rules. Concerning risk management associated with derivative transactions, the front and back offices of the trading divisions are clearly separated and risk managers are assigned to the trading divisions, while the Risk Management Division synthetically manages the Bank’s market risks. In this manner, an internal control system is effectively secured.
The Bank’s positions, gain and loss, risk amount, and other conditions are periodically reported to the executive committee.

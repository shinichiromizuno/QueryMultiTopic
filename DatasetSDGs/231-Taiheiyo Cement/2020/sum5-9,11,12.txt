   Resource Recycling with Industries
鼓Electric Power Utilities
We accept coal ash produced at coalfired power
plants and use it as a substitute for clay as a raw
material in cement. In addition, we operate ash
centers* to use more ash effectively. We also supply
the power plants with limestone powder which is
used as a flue-gas desulfurization material to scrub
the harmful sulfur oxide from the exhaust produced
by the burning of coal. The reaction of the flue-gas
desulfurization material with sulfur oxide forms
gypsum, which we use effectively as a raw material
for cement.
*Ash centers are distribution sites with collection/transportation (transshipment and storage) and intermediate-processing (powder mixing) functions. They receive coal ash from coal- fired power plants and ensure a stable supply to our cement plants, while enabling effective utilization of coal ash and supplying diverse products that meet user needs.
鼓Steelmakers
In the iron and steelmaking process, impurities are removed from iron ore to make iron. We supply the limestone powder and quicklime used as purifying materials in the refining process. We also use by-products such as blast furnace slag and steel slag that remain after the refining process as raw materials for cement and mineral components.
鼓Construction Soil
Conventionally this soil had been dumped
into landfills. By making effective use of it as an alternative raw material for cement we contribute to the material recycling of construction soil as well as to the extension of the lifetime of landfills. We have also set up intermediary facilities that organically link sites where construction soil is produced to our nationwide plants.
Resource Recycling with Communities
Although most municipal waste is incinerated and the ash is buried in landfills, finding new landfill
sites has become very difficult. Waste treatment has particularly become a source of concern for Japan’s major city governments and the situation is expected to get worse. We have three systems for recycling municipal waste and strive to make effective use of such resources and resolve environmental issues.
● Incineration Residues Recycling System
A system for recycling municipal waste incineration ash (bottom ash and fly ash) as a raw material for ordinary Portland cement.
● AK System
A system for recycling household waste and general business waste as alternative raw materials and fuels for cement manufacture. The waste is pre-processed through biological breakdown (fermentation) using a waste recycling kiln.
● Ecocement System
Ecocement is a new type of cement made primarily from the municipal waste incineration ash. More than 500 kg of ash and other waste materials are used per tonne of Ecocement.

All of our directly operated cement plants in Japan recycle waste and by- products into alternative raw materials and fuels for cement. This helps to extend the lifetime of landfills, prevent the depletion of natural mineral resources, limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.
In FY2020 we recycled 6.387 million tonnes of waste and by-products, a decrease of approximately 178,000 tonnes compared to the amount in FY2019 This was due to a decrease in the amounts of blast furnace slag, by- product gypsum, unburned ash, soot and dust we accepted, which offset the increased volumes of coal ash, waste plastic, waste oil, water treatment plant sewage sludge and ash. This means we recycled 409.5 kg of waste and by- products per tonne of cement produced.
In addition, all of the group’s cement plants in Japan accept waste and by-products for recycling.

Freight cars
    Limestone
Rotary kiln
Burning Process
After preheating, the materials are burned in a rotary kiln. The resultant material is then rapidly cooled to form an intermediate product called clinker.
Finish mill
Finishing Process
A small amount of gypsum is added to the clinker and ground in the finish mill to produce cement.
Non-consolidated
    Various kinds of materials
Transportation
The cement is then transported by ship, truck or railway freight car.

Limestone, iron wastes, etc., are mixed together, dried and ground in a raw mill.

Environmental Improvement of Mudflats and Lakes
Product used: Ceraclean
A healthy mudflat is restored by applying Ceraclean to the bottom sediment, where there are fewer fish and shellfish due to deterioration of the water environment in relation to that sediment. In FY2018 the effect of this technology on improving that mudflat environment was confirmed by the Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program, sponsored by the Ministry of the Environment.

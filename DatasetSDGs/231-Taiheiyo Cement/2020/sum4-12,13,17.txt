Among the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our domestic group companies (excluding power generation companies) that are reporting their greenhouse gas emissions by business segment
in accordance with the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, about 95% of greenhouse gas emissions were generated from cement production companies in FY2017.* The amount of greenhouse
gas emissions associated with our service stations, headquarters, branches and shipping, as well as electricity purchased by the group, was around 5% in FY2020. Under Scope 3 (value chain) calculations for cement, for which downstream value is not calculated since cement is considered an intermediate product at this stage, the emissions were around 5.0% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 (direct air emissions) in FY2019.
The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of our group companies is CO2 from cement production. We are therefore working to reduce emissions from cement production, as indicated in our CSR Objectives for 2025, in order to achieve our long-term quantitative target of reducing specific net CO2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product by 10% or more from FY2001 levels by FY2026.
Some of our plants are taking part in the target
setting type emissions trading program for Saitama
Prefecture and California’s cap-and-trade program,
striving to achieve the reduction targets. To support
voluntary approaches we are also working in line with
Keidanren’s voluntary action plan and the measures to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions established by the
*Most of our overseas affiliated companies are cement production companies so the total
CO2 emissions from production overall is higher than that of domestic companies alone. 700

   Efforts Related to the Cement Production Process
GRI302-1, 3, 4, 305-4, 5
Not a less amount of carbon dioxide is generated in the course of cement manufacture. This is because the production process requires a high temperature of 1,450°C and limestone, used as raw material, is decarbonated through a chemical reaction during the calcination process (CaCO3 → CaO + CO2). About 35% of CO2 emissions generated during cement production are from the consumption of energy, about 55% are from the calcination of raw materials and about 10% are from electricity use. To reduce CO2 emissions we have been working to conserve energy by installing energy-efficient equipment
and improving the stability and efficiency of our
kiln operations. We have also been implementing measures such as using waste- and biomass-derived energy sources to decrease our rate of use of fossil fuels. Moreover, we are moving toward using recycled resources with less carbonate content to bring down CO2 emissions from the calcination of the limestone used as raw material, and have started using WHR power generation to tackle CO2 emissions associated with conventional electricity generation.
Specific heat consumption was reduced in FY2020 delivering a reduction in CO2 emissions of 4-kg-CO2/t cementitious product compared to FY2019, mainly as a result of a decrease in the clinker-to-cement ratio.

generation systems at the group’s cement production companies in FY2020 increased by
3 GWh from FY2019 to 483 GWh. Its ratio to all electricity consumed in the production of cement was 13.5%. We were therefore able to reduce CO2 emissions by about 333 thousand tonnes in FY2020 compared to purchased power generated from coal-fired power plants (emission factor: 0.69 t-CO2/ MWh).

Reducing CO2 Emissions during Transportation GRI305-3
We contract the delivery of our raw materials and products to transportation companies and are striving to reduce CO2 emissions as a specified consigner designated under the Japanese Energy Saving Act. Major efforts include implementing a plan to transport goods on return trips, encouraging drivers to eco-drive, and promoting energy efficient devices such as digital tachometers and eco-tires on vehicles. In shipping we continue to pursue energy efficiency technologies and operate new ships that are equipped with many energy-saving features. We are also supporting energy-saving operations for conventionally powered ships.
In FY2020 our CO2 emissions decreased by about 3% compared to FY2019, mainly due to a 3% decrease in both the distance and tonnage transported.

▪ Use of Alternative Energy Resources and Alternative Raw Materials In FY2020 non-fossil energy and biomass energy accounted for about 14.1% of all energy used for group kilns. A decrease of about 8.2 kg-CO2/t- clinker was also achieved by using alternative raw materials. As a result of using both alternative energy resources and raw materials, reductions in CO2 emissions are expected to reach 1.47 million tonnes (emission factor for coal: 0.096 kg-CO2/MJ).

We focused our scenarios, evaluation and analysis on the business risks and opportunities that climate change will pose to the Group by the year 2050. We sorted out events that will materially impact climate- related risks and opportunities, based on climate- related, long-term scenarios founded on science, such as the World Energy Outlook (WEO) and Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) published
by the IEA and The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) published by the IPCC. Then we created two climate-related scenarios, 4°C and 2°C, that will have impact on the business operations of the Group. To follow up, we analyzed the business impacts in every scenario by size and time horizon (short, medium and long).

4°C
Renewable energy is more widely used in developed countries. For example, no new coal-fired power stations have been constructed in those nations. Coal-fired power generation, however, continues to grow globally. Priority is placed on economic activities while restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions stay lax and the cost of emitting greenhouse gases (carbon price) is set low. There is no significant change in cement manufacturing. The recycling of mineral resources, such as fly ash, slag and other by-products further increases at home and abroad.
Technologies, Society and Infrastructure
4°C
Global cement demand continues
to grow due to growing populations, urbanization and the increased scale and frequency of natural disasters.
In renewing cement manufacturing facilities, energy-saving equipment
is introduced and capacity for the production of blended cement
using less clinker is increased. Moderately low carbon taxes and market emissions prices discourage businesses from introducing CCUS (CO2 capture, utilization and storage). The process-derived CO2 emissions* per unit of cement output stay at the same level as the present.
Rise in Average Temperature and Changes in Rainfall Pattern
4°C
Greenhouse gas emissions
continue to grow, which makes it difficult to mitigate climate change. Flood damage associated with overflowing rivers and storm surges increases due to the rise in global average temperature and sea level. Flooding occurs more frequently worldwide due to torrential rains and massive typhoons. While our manufacturing and supply systems must be reinforced, demand remains strong for cement and concrete
to strengthen urban and national resilience.
      2°C 2°C 2°C
Costs related to carbon emissions
rise due to carbon pricing and the reinforcement of regulations on
CO2 emissions. The cement industry promotes research on low-CO2
cement production and development of new technologies including those
for saving energy while continuing investments to meet demand. The proportion of cement manufacturing facilities featuring CCS (CO2 capture and storage) increases through the government’s policy for promoting CCS. Thus process-derived CO2 emissions* per unit of cement output drop.
*CO2 emissions do not include those derived from energy sources since they are generated by the calcination of limestone.
   Efforts to mitigate climate changes are taken toward realizing a decarbonized society; however, efforts are not sufficient. Greenhouse gas emissions slowly increase.
Greenhouse gas emissions are limited to the level that their concentration meets the 2°C target. Physical impacts due to a 2°C rise in average temperature, however, cannot be avoided. Changes in rainfall patterns also continue. Consequently, the production and supply system for cement and concrete must be enhanced. In parallel with mitigation actions, adaptive measures are required
 In terms of efforts toward zero greenhouse gas emissions, the operation of coal-fired power stations decline due to system reforms related to energy supply and demand. A shift takes place toward renewable energy and low-carbon energy such as LNG. Carbon taxes and emissions trading programs become popular.

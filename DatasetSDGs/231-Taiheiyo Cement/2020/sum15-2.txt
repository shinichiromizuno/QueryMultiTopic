Stabilizing Water Quality with Ceraclean and Improving the Productivity
of Shrimp Aquaculture
Water Quality Stabilizer “Ceraclean” for Aquaculture
The aquaculture industry is drawing worldwide attention as a stable source of fishery resources since global consumption of seafood is increasing with
the changes in food habits due to advances in the internationalization of food distribution and economic growth. The production of shrimp and similar resources is rising due to the high feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1 to 1.5. On the other hand, in China, the world’s largest shrimp producer and consumer, the construction of new

and Technology and Walailak University (Thailand), we
confirmed that it improved the shrimp survival rate. It
is thought that stable water quality and the increase of phytoplankton that is non-toxic and serves as shrimp food are attributable to the absorption of phosphorus and release of silicic acid, which are characteristic features of Ceraclean. It is already being used at shrimp farms in Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

aquaculture ponds is restricted due to the impact on the water environment. And in Southeast Asia, the production volume of shrimp is falling as a result of the degradation of water quality caused by excessively high-density aquaculture.

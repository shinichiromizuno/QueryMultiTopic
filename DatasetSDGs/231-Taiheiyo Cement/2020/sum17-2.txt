Increasing Rice Production Capacity
in Southeast Asia
Siliceous Fertilizer “SILICANITE ”
SILICANITE releases silicic acid in the soil. As rice absorbs silicic acid, it gen- erates silicified cells, which strengthen the plant. These characteristics give resistance to rice against pests, diseases, heat and strong winds, thereby con- tributing to a higher yield of high-quality rice. Major demand for the product is expected in Southeast Asia, where rice production is seriously affected by rice blast. We selected Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia for the promotion of a wider use of the product, and we are presentingit to the relevant ministries and agencies in those countries while applying for its registration as a fertilizer.

Keeping Livestock Healthy
by Improving Their Bedding Environment “Healthy bed” Sanitary Material for Dairy Farms
Demand for dairy products has recently been growing in Southeast Asian countries along with the development of their economies. The low productivity of raw milk requires the region to import it from Australia and other countries. Improving productivity will require reducing cow stress and preventing the occurrence of mastitis, which in turn depends on sanitary breeding conditions. The use of Healthy bed enables dairy farmers to maintain dry, low-alkaline bedding while suppressing the growth of pathogens and ammonia odor.Given that demand for raw milk is expected to grow in Southeast Asia and China, we will conduct local demonstration tests of the product toward quickly achieving commercialization.

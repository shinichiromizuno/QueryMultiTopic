   History of the Taiheiyo Cement Group
Nascent Period of Cement Production in Japan
In 1873 the Ministry of Finance constructed a cement production
works in Fukagawa, Tokyo. Two years later the works successfully produced and launched sales of domestic
cement comparable in quality to foreign products. Following this, Asano Cement Co., Ltd., predecessor of Nihon Cement Co., Ltd., Onoda Cement Co., Ltd. and Chichibu Cement Co., Ltd., which merged into Chichibu Onoda Cement Corporation, were founded and supported the modernization of Japan.

     Taiheiyo Cement Corporation was founded in October 1998 through the merger of Chichibu Onoda Cement Corporation and Nihon Cement Co., Ltd., both of which had operated for over 100 years. The Taiheiyo Cement Group continues to support infrastructure development by supplying high quality cement and construction materials and applying advanced technologies at nine cement plants in Japan and nine in the Pacific Rim region, including in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia. We will continue to strive to create a sustainable society by demonstrating the group’s overall capabilities.
Commitment to Environmental Issues
In 2006, in response to the Kyoto Protocol which had come into effect the previous year, we formulated
the Taiheiyo Cement Environmental Management Policy, declaring an active commitment to environmental issues as key management challenges. In 2007 we launched The Taiheiyo brand cement concrete project and started activities for improving the value of the group’s technological strengths and solutions.
Period of Economic Downturn, Earthquake and Adversity
The group marked its 10th anniversary amid a serious economic downturn in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2010 we implemented business restructuring and in 2011 the Great East Japan Earthquake struck, hitting the Ofunato Plant and eight service stations in the Tohoku region, and forcing
all of them to suspend operations. Our financial structure was bolstered through an increase in capital and we were able to navigate the adversity.
Making Progress by
Fully Deploying Our Capabilities
The Ofunato Plant fully resumed operations in 2012 and ensured the stable supply of cement used in disaster restoration work while also treating disaster waste. Capitalizing on those experiences, we have engaged in the treatment of disaster waste generated by earthquakes and typhoons. To achieve continued growth we will contribute to social infrastructure development by providing solutions as pledged in the Group mission.

GRI102-2, 9
The cement industry has two major social roles. One is to ensure a stable supply of base materials for building social infrastructure, and the other is to take advantage of cement production technology to encourage the circulation of resources in society through the safe recycling of wastes and by-products as alternative raw materials and fuels for cement. The social value Taiheiyo Cement Group seeks to create under its growth strategy calls for performing these two social functions in the Pacific Rim region, providing a sense of safety and security, and thereby contributing to sustainable development.

 Business Environment and Results of Our Performance in FY 2020
Increasing Uncertainty in the Global Economy
The Taiheiyo Cement Group has announced its intention to achieve its vision and direction targeting the mid-2020s to be an enterprise group capable
of providing a sense of safety and security to communities in the Pacific Rim by demonstrating
the group’s overall capabilities. In FY2020, the second year of the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019−2021), which we formulated as the second step for realizing our Future Vision and Direction, the Japanese economy mildly recovered amid improvements in employment and income. Business performance, however, particularly that of manufacturers, remained weak and the economic outlook was uncertain.
In the Pacific Rim region, a main focus for the group’s overseas business, the U.S. economy achieved robust growth with low unemployment and strong consumer spending. While the pace of China’s economic growth slowed due to the prolonged trade conflict with the U.S., the rapidly growing economies of Vietnam and the Philippines demonstrated strength. Since the start of 2020, COVID-19 has spread across the globe. Given that the impact of infections across the world will be prolonged, the uncertainty surrounding the global economy is increasing.
Under these circumstances the group’s net sales and operating income for FY2020 declined from the previous fiscal year to 884,350 million yen and 61,008 million yen, respectively. The business environment surrounding the group will continue to support a certain level of demand for domestic cement, our main business, due to investments for urban redevelopment and disaster protection and mitigation projects,
and an increase in construction work related to the Linear (maglev) Chuo Shinkansen. The prospects for the domestic business, however, will depend on the extent to which economic activities are affected by the spread of COVID-19. Domestic demand for cement
for FY2020 was 41.0 million tonnes, the same level as 50 years ago. While we were unable to achieve the net sales we had originally targeted, we are clearly making steady progress toward our goal of strengthening our presence across the Pacific Rim.
For instance, in the West Coast of the U.S., a key area for our investments, we are steadily preparing
for an increase in demand through measures such
as expanding equipment at the Oro Grande plant, which we acquired in 2015. We also concluded a basic agreement on capital and business partnership with an Indonesian state-owned company, the largest cement manufacturer in Indonesia, in April 2020. This represents a significant step toward establishing a base in an area where the group has not previously maintained any business sites. For example, we are exporting clinker to Australia and Bangladesh from Japan in a partnership with an Indonesian company, and this investment is expected to help us boost efficiency in logistics by leveraging Indonesia as
our new export base. In line with its growth strategy, the group has restructured its portfolio through additional investments in the U.S. and equity injection in the Philippines, Vietnam and other South Asian countries. Indonesia, where we have now established a foothold, is the sole untapped region in our strategic business expansion in the Pacific Rim. While declining cement demand in Japan is unavoidable, this recent action could be highly significant for the group in taking a number of proactive measures to ensure its sustainable growth. We will continue to explore future investments in each of our business sites to drive the growth of the group.

 Commitment of Top Management
Boosting Corporate Resilience in Times of Change
We achieved an operating income of over 60 billion yen despite a greater-than-expected decline in domestic demand for cement. However, we believe we have established a corporate structure that would have delivered the earnings targeted in the Mid-term Management Plan had the level of cement demand been as projected.
One strength of the group’s corporate structure
is that all of our businesses are well balanced.
For instance, the operating income of 66 billion
yen for FY2019 was distributed evenly across the domestic cement business at 21.4 billion yen, the overseas cement business at 20.3 billion yen, and
the total of Natural Resources, Environmental, and Construction Materials and Building Construction
& Civil Engineering businesses at 24.5 billion yen.
Even though domestic demand for cement shrank in FY2020, we have established a corporate structure that ensures we would still achieve profits for the group as a whole, regardless of the condition of the domestic market, through the growth in overseas demand and other businesses.
It is undeniable that in the past the Group had been highly reliant on the domestic cement business
to earn the major portion of profit. However, we have taken steps to broaden the experience of employees though, for example, cross-departmental and international assignments and, as a result, our human resources have significantly strengthened in each of the businesses and communication in every division has
improved, largely contributing to the group’s growth. FY2021, which will be significantly impacted by the spread of COVID-19, is the final year of the 20 Medium- Term Management Plan. The Taiheiyo Cement Group has worked on establishing a solid business foundation while balancing its investments for continued business growth, strengthening its financial structure and enhancing shareholder returns. FY2021 will challenge the results of the various measures the group has taken. I am confident that the corporate structures of the company and the group have sufficiently evolved to navigate through this adversity.
Progress of CSR Objectives for 2025
Targeting an 80% Reduction in CO2 Emissions by 2050 The group has established quantitative targets in the areas of (1) Prevention of accidents, (2) Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and (3) Workplace diversity as CSR Objectives for 2025. We have incorporated these into the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan and have been working to achieve them.
We declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in June 2019. We also set a target of reducing the net CO2 emissions from cement production by 80% from the 2000 level by 2050 in a framework for our long-term vision of greenhouse gas emissions reduction toward 2050, which we formulated in July 2019. While it
is challenging to completely avoid the generation
of CO2 emissions from cement production, the
public would never allow the cement industry to demonstrate a reluctance to take action. It is feasible that an alternative material to concrete could be developed but it is unlikely to be available in sufficient quantities to replace the world’s most used man- made product. We will therefore continue to pursue the reduction of CO2 emissions associated with cement and concrete. Moreover, we should regard the reduction of CO2 emissions as a challenge not for the survival of the company but for that of the cement industry as a whole.
While our environmental technologies in cement production are among the best in the world, outside- the-box, innovative technologies are essential for achieving our target of reducing CO2 emissions by
  12 TAIHEIYO CEMENT REPORT 2020

 80%. For instance, establishing CCS/CCU technology to separate, capture and utilize CO2 will play a key role in those innovative technologies. Following the construction of a test facility at the Fujiwara Plant
in Inabe City, Mie Prefecture, we are planning a demonstration plant with the support of NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization). We are also preparing to dispatch engineers and researchers to research institutions around the world with the aim of acquiring the latest knowledge. We must clearly address this tough challenge by seizing the initiative and take action toward mitigating climate change as a leading company in the cement industry.
Initiatives for Creating Safety Culture and
Promoting Diversity
We continuously focus on establishing a safety culture and creating a safe workplace, and the prevention of accidents has been raised as a priority among our CSR objectives for 2025. Creating a safety culture that secures the happiness of our employees and their families comes first in doing business. A company cannot pursue growth if it is unable to produce safe products in a safe manner. As a result of focusing on measures for the safe operation of equipment, we have nearly achieved zero accidents from equipment malfunctions. Most of the remaining accidents have been due to a lack of safety awareness. The heads of the business sites are responsible for ensuring that employees remain completely aware of safety. In the area of diversity we have set a target of women representing at least 30% of new hires, with specific measures in place for achieving this goal. I fully expect them to have opportunities to continue advancing their careers toward reaching management and senior executive positions. We are also implementing specific initiatives in anticipation of the roles women will have in energizing the future of Taiheiyo Cement. The group has worked on developing global human resources in expanding its business areas focusing on the Pacific Rim region, and we must further promote the effective use of their capabilities.
Our overseas business is not based on a strategy
of injecting capital and receiving dividends; our
employees are directly engaged in production and sales on-site. Therefore, it is vital for us to recruit and develop human resources from a global perspective regardless of nationality. Looking ahead, we will continue striving to develop and deploy human resources from the viewpoint of motivation and skills.
The Future Envisioned by Taiheiyo Cement
Toward Realizing a Sustainable Society with a Focus on Cement
The Taiheiyo Cement Group has continued to grow while focusing on the cement business and pursuing the potential of cement and concrete. It also contributes to the resolution of social issues by providing environmentally sound products and creating a recycling-based society.
Cement plays a central role in the group’s business. Ensuring the availability of limestone,
a raw material for cement, is essential for the group’s continued contribution to society. With this philosophy we have secured reserves of limestone equivalent to the total production volume of cement over the next 100 years and established a system
to ensure the stable supply of cement. In addition
to cement, our core product, we will develop
the cementitious materials* business to further strengthen the company’s presence in overseas markets. In overseas regions where we produce or sell cement, we will contribute to the development of local communities and increase our corporate value by offering the advanced technologies we have nurtured in the Environmental and Natural Resources businesses in Japan.
In order to create a sustainable society we are committed to meeting the expectations of our stakeholders by contributing to achieving the SDGs, which are goals shared internationally, through business activities focused on the cement business. *Cement with mineral components, such as slag and pulverized fuel ash

The Taiheiyo Cement Group’s efforts to prevent or lessen the impacts of risks that could significantly affect its business are key for its sustainable growth. Every three years the Risk Management & Compliance Committee leads the review of the risks that have been identified across the company while implementing risk management from PDCA cycles in each fiscal year. During the review in FY2020 we categorized them in terms of impact of anticipated changes in social and environmental conditions over the next ten years, in relation to uncertainty of group corporate management. The three categories are: change risks, company-specific risks and compliance risks. The review identified 16 risks that could have a material impact on the group.

  (1) Change risks
the impact of the monetary evaluation) and the magnitude of the global impact (“occurrence” multiplied by “impact”). In selecting material risks we identified seven items using the magnitude of the impact on the company as the sole metric for selection.
(2) Company-specific risks
In this category the items are not closely related to any changes in global conditions but are closely connected to the group’s business history. We identified two such items that could significantly impact on the group. (3) Compliance risks
Items in this category serve as the foundation of the organization and are essential for effectively controlling the organization
and ensuring its continued acceptance by society. We therefore identified all items as material company-wide.

     Future Business
Strategies
Based on Results of a Company-wide Risk Review
Contributing to
National Resilience
The increase in the number and severity of natural disasters are challenging social structures to formulate disaster prevention and mitigation actions. We
will contribute to national resilience by enhancing the stable supply of cement
and other construction materials for strengthening infrastructure and supporting rapid disaster restoration.
Supporting the Creation of
a Recycling-based Society
We have recently been recycling disaster waste as raw materials and fuels for cement production as well as industrial waste, by-products, municipal waste and incineration ash. We will play our role in establishing a recycling-based society
by applying and developing the necessary expertise and technologies.
Advancing the Creation of a
Low-carbon Society
Viewing the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions as a positive opportunity to advance the creation of a low-carbon society through our operations, we will expand our efforts to efficiently replace fossil fuels with alternative energy derived from waste and promote technological progress in such areas as the development of low-CO2 cement and innovative technologies for CO2 capture, utilization and storage (CCU and CCS).
 Summary of the Collection, Evaluation and Identification of Company-wide Risks
Step 1
Compile anticipated changes in social and environmental conditions over the next ten years.
List the anticipated changes in social
and environmental conditions over the next ten years as a scenario and produce a list of changes by categorizing and organizing them by keywords.
Step 2
Evaluate the impact of collected changes on the group.
Review and evaluate the listed changes for their impact in relation to uncertainties of group corporate management.
Step 3
Review the results of the evaluation of the impact.
Review the uncertainties identified by each business unit.
Step 4
Identify company- wide material risks (Risk Management & Compliance Committee).
Determine the level of materiality of
the uncertainties, summarize the results of the identification and review changes.
Step 5
Determine company-
          We collect, evaluate and identify company-wide risks, including those of group companies, every three years and conduct an annual review of those risks. FY2020 was the third year of the company-wide risk review since it was first conducted in FY2017. The purpose of identifying risks is to understand the impact of anticipated changes in social and environmental conditions over the next ten years in relation to uncertainty of group management and then formulate measures to avoid and reduce that uncertainty. We review risks with reference to the corporate risk management guidance based on ISO 31000, COSO and WBCSD as well as other risk information. We also consult risk management experts.

    Financial Strategy and Shareholders’ Returns
1 Capital expenditure and investment and financing
We plan to invest 230 billion yen, including 120 billion yen in growth investment, over the three years. In FY2019 and 2020 we decided to invest around 60 billion yen domestically and overseas as growth investment. This includes the amount invested for a planned capital alliance with the PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk group as announced in April 2020.
2 Returns to shareholders
We have stated that we will consider flexibly repurchasing
shares toward achieving a total return ratio of around 30%. In FY2019 we achieved a total return ratio of around 34% by paying commemorative dividends for the 20th anniversary of the company’s founding and repurchasing our shares in addition to ordinary
dividends. In FY2020, although we only paid ordinary dividends,
the inclusion of repurchased shares announced in May 2020 and concluded in July 2020 in FY2020 financial figures would bring the total return ratio to around 32%. Thus, our total return ratio exceeded 30% in those two years.
3 Further strengthening our financial structure
We have set a target of a net DER of 0.5 or less at the end of FY2021 as a guideline. The financial structure has been steadily improving, as seen at the end of FY2020 by the equity ratio of 42.3% (an improvement of 3.6% from the end of FY2018) and the balance of interest-bearing debt of 266.1 billion yen (a reduction of 22.4 billion yen from the end of FY2018). Moreover, we achieved our net DER target of 0.5 times or less, ahead of schedule at the end of FY2020.

Taiheiyo Cement Group Efforts to Mitigate Climate Change
GRI102-11, 103-2, 201-2, 203-1
Significantly reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions toward mitigating climate change has been underway following the adoption of the Paris Agreement at the COP21 in 2015 as a common challenge across the world. The cement industry, which by-produce not a less amount of CO2 in the course of manufacture, must take action. The Taiheiyo Cement Group is developing and introducing technologies to reduce their CO2 emissions from a medium- to long-term perspective in order to mitigate global warming and ensure its sustainable development.

  Taiheiyo Cement’s Countermeasures to
Mitigate Climate Change
The cement industry is estimated to generate CO2 emissions equivalent to about 6% of total man-made greenhouse gas emissions. Of the CO2 produced in the course of cement manufacture, approximately 45% is derived from the thermal energy used to heat the raw materials and the consumption
of electricity for cement, and 55% from the decarbonation of limestone used as raw material during the calcination process. We must therefore focus on those two areas in order to reduce CO2 produced in the course of cement manufacture.
Since the 1990s we have focused on introducing energy-efficient equipment to reduce our CO2 emissions. We have also promoted the use of recycled resources without decarbonation as raw materials and are aggressively
responding to the demands of the international community. We added the CSR Objectives for 2025 to the Medium-Term Management Plan in 2015, the year the Paris Agreement was adopted. Included in the objectives is the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Having declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in June 2019, we are committed to a strategic implementation of countermeasures to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, we formulated a framework in July 2019 for our long-range vision of greenhouse gas emissions reduction toward 2050 and positioned it as a group-wide goal.
Formulating Our Long-term Vision toward 2050

Reducing CO2 emissions intensity by:
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction toward 2050. In order to achieve the goal of an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions
by 2050, we need to develop innovative technologies as
well as to advance the application and development of existing technologies. To this end, the group formulated three reduction scenarios for lowering CO2 emissions in cement production. Specifically, we will continue to develop and expand the technologies we currently own to reduce energy- derived and raw materials-derived CO2 emissions whilst also developing and introducing new innovative technologies. Furthermore, we aim to avoid emissions equivalent to
20% of CO2 emissions through the value chain of cement and cement-related products. These reductions will be in the areas of use/reuse of cement, power generation for cement production and transportation, and the reductions
evaluated based on the “Calculation and Reporting Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Avoided GHG Emissions through the Value Chain of Cement and Cement-based Products” which we formulated in 2019.
In order to realize the Long-term Vision, we must address challenges such as social acceptance of our businesses and the development and implementation of new technologies to avoid, capture, utilize and store CO2. The associated financial burden of such technologies will need to be shared as will the technologies themselves. We have positioned the Long- term Vision as a goal we must achieve, and we will continue our efforts in light of our future sustainable growth as well as changes in social systems.

   The Ofunato Plant Launching the Biomass Power Generation Business to Brighten the Future of the Community
   T
he Ofunato plant, in Ofunato City, Iwate Prefecture, began producing cement in 1937 as one of the company’s major manufacturing
biomass power stations. Annual electric power generation is approximately 520 GWh, equivalent to the electricity consumption of around 119,000 ordinary households, and the associated CO2 emissions reduction is 308,000 tonnes/year.
The Ofunato Biomass Power Station is environmentally sound. The plant concluded an Agreement on Environmental Conservation with the Ofunato City government in 2017, under which it constrains NOx and SOx emissions to below specified values. Furthermore, the exhaust chimneys are twice the height of ordinary facilities to minimize the effects of the emissions on the surrounding environment. The design of the power station minimizes its environmental impacts such as by recycling industrial water for cooling. In terms of fuel, the small amount
of coal currently used will be reduced in the future to make the plant solely dependent on biomass fuel.
The Taiheiyo Cement Group is working to increase the use of environmentally sound, renewable energy through the launch of its biomass power generation business while also contributing to job creation and the economic revitalization of the local community.
always believed that the problems associated with climate change were our responsibility, not those of someone else. With the designation of Ofunato City as a Future City by the national government, we have been working to create a sustainable community through such efforts as introducing renewable energy with a focus on solar power. Reducing carbon emissions is an urgent concern for all humankind, and governments and businesses must cooperate
to address it. We hope Taiheiyo Cement’s biomass power generation business will serve as a foundation for creating a prosperous future.
sites and it has reliably supplied high-quality cement products since then. It installed a waste heat power generation system in 1986 and has actively taken action to save energy. Unfortunately, the plant was significantly damaged by the tsunami following the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. While it was able to quickly resume cement production, including restarting of the waste heat power generation system, its in-house power generation system was severely damaged and did not resume operation. To address this the Ofunato Power Generation Project Team was set up in 2016.
The Ofunato Biomass Station was constructed on the premises of the Ofunato cement plant over a period of three years and started commercial operations in January 2020. The power station can supply all of the electricity required by the plant as well as for the community. It uses palm kernel shell (PKS) and a small amount of coal as fuels with an output of 75 MW, making it one of Japan’s largest

These systems generate power by recovering thermal energy from high-temperature exhaust gas generated in the cement calcination process and contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. In October 2019 the company decided to install a WHR power generation facility incorporating a cutting-edge waste heat recovery boiler at its Saitama plant in Hidaka City, Saitama Prefecture. This facility is scheduled to begin operations in September 2022, marking the completion of the initiative to install waste heat power generation systems at all six company plants. The operation of these facilities is expected to help reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 27,000 tonnes per

  Promoting the Regional Treatment of Disaster Waste
Cement plants are contributing to regional restoration by accepting waste such as the debris generated by natural disasters. We started to accept disaster waste following the Chuetsu Earthquake in Niigata Prefecture in 2004. Since then we have concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with several local governments in areas where our plants are located to prepare for future disasters.
In June 2019 we concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with the Miyagi prefectural government where
the company does not operate any plants. Taking into consideration the maximum use of prefectural port facilities along with additional new routes, more of our plants would be able to accept disaster waste. Three months after the conclusion of the agreement, typhoon No. 19 made landfall
in October 2019 and caused severe damage in the Tohoku

  region. Under the agreement with the Miyagi prefectural government, our Ofunato plant accepted a large volume of waste rice straw that had been generated immediately after the harvest and treated 23,000 tonnes by the end of March 2020. Our Saitama and Kumagaya plants also treated materials such as straw mats and quail droppings that were destined after use in a digester after drying but had become sodden in the typhoon. We plan to establish a system for treating disaster waste regionally by leveraging our plants across Japan as well as our land and marine transport network.

Developing Business in Southeast Asia and China
Leveraging Our Cement Technology to
Contribute to a Stable Food Supply and
Preservation of the Water Environment
While engaged in the stable supply of cement as a basic material for infrastructure, the Taiheiyo Cement Group has broadened its scope of business by developing products that capitalize on its cement technology. This project, which started with the water treatment business, has evolved into the development of overseas markets and new products while also improving our domestic aquaculture technology. Moreover, it has rapidly grown into a business that contributes to a stable food supply and preservation of the water environment in Southeast Asia and China.
      Products Derived from Cement Technology for Diverse Applications
We are cultivating markets in the aquaculture, agriculture and livestock sectors for our products that contribute to solving food and environmental problems by capitalizing on technologies we have verified in the water treatment sector. These products help preserve the water environment, recover the purifying capacity of
nature, and ultimately contribute to ensuring a stable food supply while creating a sustainable society. They have been sold in Japan and overseas through our Group companies. In our overseas operations we started production in Thailand in 2018 and Indonesia in 2019. We also conducted demonstration tests for the products and launched them in Southeast Asia and China.

Water Quality Stabilizer “Ceraclean” for Aquaculture
The aquaculture industry is drawing worldwide attention as a stable source of fishery resources since global consumption of seafood is increasing with
the changes in food habits due to advances in the internationalization of food distribution and economic growth. The production of shrimp and similar resources is rising due to the high feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1 to 1.5. On the other hand, in China, the world’s largest shrimp producer and consumer, the construction of new

is thought that stable water quality and the increase of phytoplankton that is non-toxic and serves as shrimp food are attributable to the absorption of phosphorus and release of silicic acid, which are characteristic features of Ceraclean. It is already being used at shrimp farms in Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Siliceous Fertilizer “SILICANITE ”
SILICANITE releases silicic acid in the soil. As rice absorbs silicic acid, it gen- erates silicified cells, which strengthen the plant. These characteristics give resistance to rice against pests, diseases, heat and strong winds, thereby con- tributing to a higher yield of high-quality rice. Major demand for the product is expected in Southeast Asia, where rice production is seriously affected by rice blast. We selected Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia for the promotion of a wider use of the product, and we are presenting
 it to the relevant ministries and agencies in those countries while applying for its registration as a fertilizer.

Keeping Livestock Healthy
by Improving Their Bedding Environment “Healthy bed” Sanitary Material for Dairy Farms
Demand for dairy products has recently been growing in Southeast Asian countries along with the development of their economies. The low productivity of raw milk requires the region to import it from Australia and other countries. Improving productivity will require reducing cow stress and preventing the occurrence of mastitis, which in turn depends on sanitary breeding conditions. The use of Healthy bed enables dairy farmers to maintain dry, low-alkaline bedding while suppressing the growth of pathogens and ammonia odor.
 Given that demand for raw milk is expected to grow in Southeast Asia and China, we will conduct local demonstration tests of the product toward quickly achieving commercialization.

    Achieving Sustainable Growth with Our Solid Supply Infrastructure and Improved Customer Satisfaction
In our cement business in Japan we stably supply our products to users through
our solid foundation in manufacturing, transportation and supply chains, which includes 9 cement plants, 106 service stations and 36 cement tankers. In the future, as measures for national resilience are implemented, a larger number of projects will adopt diversified construction methods and call for soil stabilizers and specialty cement such as medium-heat cement. We will therefore further enhance our logistics network to meet these demands.
To support our customers we organize our user societies by business sector such
as ready-mixed and concrete product manufacturers. We provide them with technical services based on knowledge acquired by the group’s technical and R&D divisions. Along with our stable supply and high product quality we believe our enhanced technical services are one of the main reason for users to select our products. Thus, we will strengthen initiatives such as the activities
of user societies to improve customer satisfaction.

Results of Operations and Principal Initiatives for FY2020
Both public and private sector demand for cement in Japan declined in FY2020 following the completion of preparations for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, and also the reconstruction projects in the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Furthermore, extended construction periods due to labor shortages at construction sites across Japan has had an impact. As a result, the group’s domestic cement sales by volume, including sales in conjunction
with toll-manufacturing agreements, fell by 5% to 14.47 million tonnes year-on-year. As a result, net sales for FY2020 declined by 19.7 billion yen to 415.1 billion yen year-on- year. Operating income for FY2020 dropped by 6.4 billion yen to 14.9 billion yen year-on-year due to the decrease in sales volume and an increase in fixed expense such as repair expense.
Under such a business environment, we were able to reach agreements to revise prices with around 80% of our customers. We started supplying cement to Hitachi Cement Co., Ltd. based on a toll-manufacturing agreement with the company in April 2019. In addition, we duly responded to regulations on sulfur oxide (SOx) contained in fuel for cement tankers, which were enforced in January 2020. With regard to major capital investments for plants, we installed a bag filter system and a high-efficiency cooler to No.5 kiln at Oita Plant. We also expanded the chloride bypassing capacity for the No. 6 kiln and installed a facility to accept biomass ash at the Kamiiso plant.

We are actively addressing the key challenges of reducing CO2 emissions and achieving zero work-related accidents in cement manufacturing.
To reduce CO2 emissions, we will work on using less fossil energy by doubling the annual amount of waste plastic used from 200,000 tonnes by the middle of the 2020s, based on the CSR Objectives for 2025 that the group formulated in 2015. We will both maintain the stable operation of kilns and save energy by fully operating an AI-enabled operating support system by FY2021. Moreover, we decided to install a WHR power
generation system at the Saitama plant, the only one of our six directly managed plants not equipped with the system. Installation work is scheduled for completion in 2022.
Every employee must fully comply with safety rules to eradicate occupational accidents. The group achieved zero fatalities over two consecutive years, FY2019 and 2020, although we still had a number of occupational accidents with no leave of absence. We will strengthen measures to improve the situation. To create a safe workplace for our employees we will also take action to prevent heatstroke and COVID-19 infection.

Providing Environmental Solutions as Our Added Value
Ensuring the stable supply of products and meeting quality requirements unique to the region are prerequisites for providing customers with solutions as a cement company.
We will focus on providing environmental solutions as our added
value. Various initiatives for reducing
CO2 emissions are being implemented in California in the U.S. We have promoted
the use of natural gas as a fuel for concrete mixer trucks while increasing the use of natural gas as kiln fuel, enabling us to reduce environmental impact at a minimum cost. In Dalian, our contribution to the community through the efficient treatment of sewage sludge was recognized by the government, thereby allowing us to continue operations.
We will also provide environmental solutions for municipal waste and sewage sludge to countries in Southeast Asia and other regions by properly combining existing and new technologies. We
believe this is a time when our continued contributions to solving environmental issues are highly valued, even if each alone is relatively small in countries that face the challenge of improving their environments.

In the U.S., prices increased despite minimal growth
in shipment volume for both cement and ready-mixed concrete, which was partly due to bad weather on
the West Coast. In China the market held solid due to improved supply and demand conditions as a result
of the government’s policy to curb cement production nationwide. In Vietnam our business was affected by the entry of a new manufacturer. In the Philippines the level of demand and market conditions stayed the same as in the previous year mainly due to the temporary suspension of and delays to public investments during the campaigning for the unified regional and national elections. As a result, net sales for FY2020 were 213.2 billion yen (up 1.6 billion yen year-on-year) and operating income for the year was 21.5 billion yen (up 1.2 billion yen year-on-year).
Given this business environment, in the U.S. we completed the construction of a finish mill at the Oro Grande plant. In the Philippines we are constructing a belt conveyor system that links the port and the plant, and in Vietnam we established a local subsidiary
to handle products related to resources and the environment.

Making Full Use of Our Global Network of Plants by Mutually Introducing Domestic Environmental Technologies and New Technologies Overseas
Yoshiyuki Uenoyama
Managing Executive Officer, Overseeing Production Department and Maintenance & Engineering Department
Overseas operations represent a group strength that we must fully capitalize on in applying environmental technologies developed in our cement plants.
We are providing environmental technologies that we have developed in Japan to our overseas plants. On the same token, some of our overseas plants have taken the lead in introducing advanced technologies to satisfy stricter environmental regulations. We will introduce those technologies into our domestic plants as appropriate.
For instance, our domestic plants are introducing a NOx
reduction technology used in China and another for preventing the discharge of mercury used in the U.S. Other innovative environmental technologies will be introduced into our plants in Japan as soon as they are applicable.
In our plants in Japan we are accelerating the use of alternative raw materials and thermal energy by applying a technology for recycling waste containing high- concentration chlorine. We will also see a shift toward a recycling-oriented society in emerging markets, for which group technologies will be significantly beneficial to users, and we will continue to expand them into our global operations.

     Achieving Sustainable Growth through the Full Use and Appropriate Development of Group Mineral Resources
Limestone is one of the few mineral resources in which Japan is self-sufficient; however, ongoing quarry development is becoming increasingly difficult. The aggregates and mineral products businesses, our division’s core businesses, largely rely on the mineral resources that the group owns so we are therefore developing quarries with a long-term perspective.
The characteristics and quality of every mineral varies by quarry so we need to establish an optimum supply system for the most effective use of resources. To ensure stable supply, we are strategically implementing capital investments to establish a smarter and more flexible logistics system.
The geo-solutions business significantly contributes to society through the sales of the heavy metal immobilizer focusing on large infrastructure projects and the treatment of construction soil and surplus soil. In view of this we will strive to ensure the stable operations of this business.
Our growth strategy will remain centered
on expanding the overseas mineral resources business and achieving the early commercialization of the functional materials business. We will
also continue to maximize earnings and achieve sustainable growth through business operations
in collaboration with the production and sales divisions in cooperation with group companies.
Results of Operations and Principal Initiatives for FY2020
The sales of limestone aggregates for ready-mixed concrete declined in FY2020 due to the end in demand related to preparations for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and restoration projects in the areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Limestone sales for the domestic steel industry were also sluggish, due to a reduction in the domestic production volume of steel. Our geo-solutions business steadily achieved the target sales of the heavy metal immobilizer for highway construction projects in the Greater Tokyo Area. As a result, net sales for the business in FY2020 were 80.1 billion yen (down 4.1 billion year-on-year) and operating income was 7.1 billion yen (down 1.0 billion yen year-on-year).
Under such a business environment we are expanding production equipment for crushed limestone sand at the Shin-Tsukumi Quarry of Tsukumi City in Oita Prefecture. Additionally, we are conducting environmental assessments for the development quarry site for cement raw materials at the Yato area of Shin-Tsukumi Quarry. In the field of functional hollow particles, we began a trial mass production of CellSpheres, which are expected to increasingly be used for paints and electronic devices. This was conducted in the demonstration plant we had installed at the group company Chichibu Taiheiyo Cement Corporation. In overseas operations, we established
a subsidiary in Vietnam and started to handle mineral resource products.

    Outlook for FY2021
We expect ongoing projects at construction sites across Japan to be temporarily suspended in response to the spread of COVID-19. Due partly to this, the sales volume of our limestone aggregates for ready-mixed concrete will decline in FY2021. In the mineral products business, we expect a decline in sales volume given the projected reduction in
the production volume of crude steel. Despite this severe environment, we will strive to maximize earnings based on the following key strategies while strengthening collaboration with group companies and driving cost reductions. We plan to achieve net sales of 78.0 billion yen for FY2021 (down 2.1 billion yen year-on-year) and operating income of 6.0 billion yen for the year (down 1.1 billion yen year-on-year).
Development of a Next-generation Quarry Site at the Ofunato Quarry
The Ofunato Quarry is providing limestone to the Ofunato plant and is developing the Horoshi area for its next-generation operations toward the start of quarrying
in 2021. Its limestone deposits amount to around 250 million tonnes, equivalent
to more than 100 years of limestone consumption as a raw material for cement in Ofunato. The new site also includes a deposit of crystalline limestone, used in paper manufacturing, and is expected to become a new shipment base for the product.
Aggregates Yard for the Greater Tokyo Area
Concrete made with limestone aggregates is less susceptible to alkali-aggregate reaction and exhibits low drying and self shrinkage, thereby helping to prevent cracks. Demand
is therefore rising for limestone aggregates, particularly in the Greater Tokyo Area where there are many high-rise buildings. We operate an aggregates yard with a storage capacity of 230,000 tonnes, the largest in the Greater Tokyo Area in Sodegaura City, Chiba Prefecture to ensure the stable supply of aggregates.
  Key Strategies for FY2021
 1. Maximize profits from core businesses
Aggregates business
Mineral products business
• Reinforce the supply and sales system for limestone aggregates in the Greater Tokyo Area
• Establish the Taiheiyo-Brand Sand business in the Tokyo Bay area
• Establish the optimal limestone supply system for steelmaking
• Improve the profitability of the crystalline limestone business and strategically expand sales, including exploring the possibility of quarrying crystalline limestone at the Horoshi area of the Ofunato Quarry
Geo-solutions • Further develop the heavy metal immobilizer and

    Aiming to Achieve Sustainable Growth and Contribute to Society by Maximizing the Earnings Capacity of Our Businesses and Commercializing New Technologies
We have established and operate our recycled- waste-to-cement system to treat a large volume of industrial waste and by-products as well
as municipal waste, and reusing the recycled waste for cement production. We have striven to create and expand a recycling-oriented society through this system. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have recently been accelerating across the world. Taking action to address this is becoming vital for every industry.
The Taiheiyo Cement Group formulated its long-term vision for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Our efforts in the Environmental Business include increasing the use of alternative fuels. We are also focusing on establishing technologies to recycle discarded lithium-ion batteries and for the recycling and recovery of materials using low-temperature embrittlement technology, as well as conducting R&D for the recovery of precious metals and phosphorus from municipal waste incineration
ash. We plan to continue developing the environmental business by making progress in these new fields and building up the new businesses to the same level as our current e-materials and recycling businesses.
Results of Operations and Principal Initiatives for FY2020
The volume of waste plastic treated increased following stricter restrictions by China and Southeast Asia on the import of waste plastic. In addition, more disaster waste was treated such as straw mats and rice straw generated by tropical cyclones such as Typhoon No.19. Sales of biomass fuel also rose as the Ofunato Biomass Power Station started operation. The operation of coal-fired power stations in Japan has declined due to a global shift toward a low-carbon society, resulting in a drop in the availability of coal ash, the mainstay of our environmental business. Sales of calcium carbonate for scrubbing systems at power stations declined proportionally, as did the trade in by-product gypsum. As a result, net sales for the business in FY2020 was 84.4 billion yen (down 8.2 billion yen year-on-year), although operating income was 7.7 billion yen (up 1.0 billion yen year-on-year).
Given this business environment, we introduced
an ash washing system for cleaning municipal waste incineration bottom ash to allow its use in cement production at the Kumagaya plant. We also launched our container liner service (Tokyo–Hakodate) to transport waste plastic to the Kamiiso plant.
In addition, we concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with the Miyagi prefectural government and launched the regional treatment of disaster waste such as waste rice straw generated by Typhoon No. 19 and other disasters.

    Outlook for FY2021
We expect demand for waste plastic treatment in
Japan will remain high. The treatment of disaster waste generated by the typhoons in 2019 will also accelerate. Given formal enforcement of the Paris Agreement this year the volume of our business related to coal-fired power stations, such as the treatment of coal ash, our core business, will continue to decline in FY2021. Moreover, steelmakers are being forced to reduce production volume due to the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the volume of our business with steelmakers, such as the acceptance of blast furnace slag, is also likely to drop. Despite this difficult business environment we hope to maximize earnings based on the following key strategies while reducing costs. We plan for 85.0 billion yen in net sales for FY2021 (up 0.6 billion yen year-on-year) and operating income of 6.0 billion yen for the year (down 1.7 billion yen year-on-year).
A resource complex initiative
All of the waste and by-products treated at our cement plants is recycled to manufacture cement. We proposed the Materials Recovery Complex initiative, under which each of the various industries such as non-ferrous metal, scrap smelting, chemicals and recycling sells to others the waste materials that it does not reuse and purchases waste materials from other industries that it can recycle. We are now working with the government and academia to establish a working complex model.
Lithium-ion Battery Recycling
As large lithium-ion batteries become more widely used for electric vehicles and other purposes, we will soon face the challenge of treating a large quantity of end- of-life lithium-ion batteries. We jointly established a technology to recycle large- sized lithium-ion batteries with Matsuda Sangyo Co., Ltd., leveraging the cement production process, and launched the lithium-ion batteries recycling business in April 2020.
  Key Strategies for FY2021
 1. Accept a larger volume of waste plastic
• Reinforce capital investments and transport routes to ensure the acceptance of a larger volume of waste plastic at our major plants
2. Appropriate treatment of disaster waste
3. Establish a new model for recycling resources through a resource complex initiative in which the cement industry plays a central role
4. Establish a new business model through the development of advanced technologies such as low-temperature embrittlement

           Enhancing Our Earning Bases by Developing New Business Domains such as Southeast Asia and Promoting Labor Savings
As part of our efforts to develop new business domains we established a local subsidiary in Vietnam to engage in ground improvement projects, and we are focusing on taking orders for large projects such as subway construction
to achieve the vision of expanding business operations to new horizons overseas as symbolized by our corporate logo. We also recruit local employees in Myanmar and Vietnam where we operate representative offices, and provide on-the-job training for them in Japan.
In response to the need to save labor
at construction sites and concrete products manufacturing plants, we developed a dry spraying method for repair materials and introduced truck-mounted mixers for supplying materials at road repair sites. To ensure the stable supply of products, we have carefully identified manufacturing sites and products to focus on, while also promoting collaboration with other companies on a toll-manufacturing basis and by other means.
Governance is a prerequisite and foundation for our business operations. We
call the representatives of companies that our department oversees and hold a president’s meeting to discuss business performance as well as risk management and compliance.
   38 TAIHEIYO CEMENT REPORT 2020
Results of Operations and Principal Initiatives for FY2020
Sales of construction materials and buiding exterior construction materials increased due partly to the progress of urban redevelopment projects related to The Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. Sales of autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC), however, declined due to weak demand. The start of some ground improvement projects were delayed and, as a result, the department’s net sales were 81.3 billion (down 0.8 billion yen year-on- year) and operating income was 4.5 billion yen (down 0.4 billion yen year-on-year).
In the Construction Material Business we have focused on making capital investments and developing new construction methods to save labor at construction and manufacturing sites in accordance with priorities of the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan. For instance, we are working on visualizing the state of underground work using information and communications technology (ICT) in carrying out ground improvement work. We are also developing material technologies for pre-cast concrete products to improve productivity at construction sites, and implementing countermeasures for the deterioration of production facilities and reducing environmental impacts to enhance the foundation of our businesses.
To deal with a significant increase in the volume of construction work for national projects such as the Tokyo- Gaikan Expressway and the Chuo Shinkansen, we are fully prepared to provide related products, materials and services such as the deployment of engineers.

  Recently Developed Technologies
Technologies for Recovering and Recycling CO2 Emissions
We must develop revolutionary carbon recycling technologies to achieve our long-term vision. Our technology for CO2 separation and capture from cement kiln exhaust gas was adopted as a project sponsored by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and will be demonstrated in FY2021 and 2022.
AI Prediction Technology for Concrete Slump
We developed an AI technology to instantly predict slump from images of mixing inside the concrete mixers during the production process. Its use in
the production of ready-mixed concrete and concrete-related products will further stabilize the quality of concrete and save labor through process automation.
This new technology allows us
to accept a larger volume of difficult-to-process waste plastic and increase our use of alternative energy, dechlorination and recover precious metals. We installed a commercial-scale demonstration of the equipment (7,840 tonnes/year) at the Kawasaki Plant of the Group company DC Co., Ltd. in FY2020.
Environmentally Sound Products Developed by Group Companies
    Heat Barrier Coat Heat-shielding Colored Cement Resin Mortar for Road Surfaces (Chichibu Concrete Industry Co., Ltd.)
 Heat Barrier Coat is a heat-shielding colored cement resin mortar containing specialized pigments for application on road surfaces. It inhibits the rise of road surface temperature by reflecting
heat sources such as infrared rays from the sun. It is expected
to mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve the environment along sidewalks and roadsides. It can be applied across a wide range of settings, including sidewalks and parks in urban areas, and the rooftops of condominiums and office buildings. The product can be sprayed on both concrete and asphalt road surfaces. As a highly elastic cement-type material developed using the company’s proprietary technology, it firmly adheres to the road surface with high durability. Its muted color harmonizes with the surroundings and provides a comfortable daily living environment.

    42 TAIHEIYO CEMENT REPORT 2020
The Taiheiyo Cement Group is striving for highly transparent management by enhancing its corporate governance. What issues does the group need to clear in order to maintain sound management and continue to grow further? Two outside directors and two outside corporate auditors talked about the group’s governance from their points of view.
 
 Since assuming this position in 2015 I have always had the impression that this company is solid. I regularly receive a large volume of documents that are prepared for outside directors as well as frequent explanations from
the drafting and other departments. The company’s expectations of me as
an outside director are high and, while that places a lot of pressure on me,
I believe that is why we have maintained a relationship in which I can speak frankly. The company employs a self-evaluation system in which all directors fill out a questionnaire to assess the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. A new process has been added in which the chairman of the board and outside directors analyze and evaluate effectiveness based on the results of the questionnaire. I feel that this new process also demonstrates the company’s willingness to listen to the candid opinions of outsiders.
In fulfilling my role as an outside director, I have valued the importance of interacting with employees onsite through direct communication. These experiences have made me realize that the spirit of valuing people and communities continues to be alive and well in the company, and that the cement industry is built on people and communities. As the company expands its business across the Pacific Rim it will face the challenge of instilling this spirit in regions with different history, climates and cultures, while practicing effective governance. My role as an outside director would be analysis and provision of advice on corporate legal affairs, applying
my many years of experience as an international lawyer, and openly expressing my opinions based on my experience as an outside director and outside auditor at other companies—even in relation to matters that the company has not recognized as issues. Since the company has so many outstanding personnel, if we can understand the essence of an issue, we will naturally find a solution.
Having worked for a chemical manufacturer that also makes cement, I know the company’s business environment well and can provide advice leveraging my practical experience as a corporate manager. Having only recently been appointed to the post I am not yet ready to make detailed observations but I intuitively sense that management of a large group
with approximately 120 consolidated subsidiaries will be difficult. Since group companies differ in history, business formats and corporate culture, a great deal of effort will be required to check, every day, on whether or not governance has permeated throughout the group. This important
task should be carried out no matter what it takes, in order to provide prompt, effective guidance in times of emergency. Fostering a relationship of trust between the headquarters and each group company is key for establishing and instilling group governance, and this depends on daily communication. As for creating a governance system in line with the real situation, I believe that I will be able to provide advice based on my own experience.
In FY2021 the number of the company’s board members was changed from 15 to 10. This was intended to increase the ratio of outside officers and strengthen the monitoring function, and I feel this was a very reasonable action. Going forward, each director must take responsibility for attending board meetings and enriching the content of discussions to enable effective and thorough discussions. As an outside director who understands corporate management practices, I think my role is not only to apply brakes on management but also to step on the accelerator once in a while. I hope to effectively contribute as an outside director who can offer helpful advice when the company faces difficult decisions.
  Outside Director Yoshiko Koizumi
I will shed light on unrecognized issues to help promote the group’s governance.
         Outside Director Shinhachiro Emori
I plan to have effective discussions by
using my practical experience as a corporate manager.

Two years have passed since I became an outside corporate auditor. During that time I attended various important meetings in addition to the Board of Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board meetings, and I deepened my understanding of the company’s strategy. I participate in visits to as many branches, plants and group companies as possible, both in Japan and overseas. When I speak with local employees I am provided with specific and direct information. They constantly amaze me with their level of activity and openness.
I have also had direct discussions with employees on important matters and compliance issues. The company is the largest in the Japanese cement industry and maintains hundreds of group companies of different sizes. Therefore, while it maintains a high level of compliance as a leading company, it needs to have an internal control system that matches the business format and scale of each group company, and a level of internal control that lives up to the name of the Taiheiyo Cement Group. From a lawyer’s point of view, striking this balance can be difficult, but I believe that the group will continue to instill a vision of what it should be across the entire organization. One issue I point out in this regard is that I feel
the need to establish a group internal control system that enables group companies to share information and roll out countermeasures so that when a compliance problem arises, they can prevent the same problem from reoccurring anywhere else in the group.
While the role expected of outside corporate auditors and the level of expectation differs from company to company, I strongly feel that this company actively seeks and reflects external opinions. I will continue to work hard to meet their expectations.
The company makes outside corporate auditors work in what we consider as “a good way.” It has been only a year since I was appointed as outside corporate auditor but I have already visited many sites in Japan and abroad. At every work site I felt they tried to conduct effective audits relevant to the current business environment rather than “pro-forma” reviews. Furthermore, compared to my previous auditing experience, no other company has provided so much information, making this a very refreshing experience for me.
Also, when I assumed this post, I was very interested in how the group,
which consists of approximately 300 subsidiaries and affiliated companies, can instill and maintain the basic spirit of its internal control system group-wide. When conducting audits as an outside corporate auditor, I paid attention to this point while also exchanging opinions based on explanations received about management and the operations of each department at the headquarters, plants and subsidiaries. As a result, I realized that group employees share a common understanding. I feel this is due to the significant contribution of over 130 years of group history and pride which have fostered human resources who understand and practice the spirit of internal control and have nurtured an environment that maintains that spirit. However, the group went through a period of limiting new hires in the past so to continue consistently conveying this spirit and fostering awareness will be among its management challenges.
I also think that it is important for the group’s sustainable growth to enhance the disclosure of corporate information related to non-financial information, which has recently been attracting attention, while at the same time creating an environment that secures human resources and maintains a sound internal control system. I would like to increase the impact of auditor’s audits from a professional perspective as a certified public accountant while also offering appropriate advice as an outside corporate auditor.

Our organizational structure is anchored by our Board of Directors and Board of Auditors. We have also introduced an executive officer system in order to separate management decision-making and monitoring/supervisory functions from business execution. Our Corporate Auditor’s Office consists of one manager and two subordinates, which comprehensively supports corporate auditors
in performing their duties. Our Internal Auditing Department conducts internal audits, identifies issues that require improvement and reports audit results to the president to increase the effectiveness of internal audits.
Also, our CSR Management Committee determines the ideal direction for our business activities from the perspective of CSR and promotes the strengthening of corporate governance.
In FY2020 we held 14 board meetings, with all directors and auditors in attendance.

      ▪Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors In accordance with the Basic Policy on Corporate Governance, we analyze and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors on an annual basis. We also have all directors take part in a self- assessment survey by filling out a questionnaire
on the composition of the Board of Directors, operational status, decision-making process and external communication. The results are analyzed and evaluated by the board chairman and outside directors and reported to the Board of Directors for future discussion and confirmation on improvements from the previous fiscal year as well as on issues and measures. In FY2020 the Board of Directors was considered to be generally well managed and its overall effectiveness ensured.
In addition, after reviewing the results and opinions presented by each director, we are working to raise the level of board effectiveness through such efforts as reducing the number of directors to strengthen management oversight and accelerate decision-making.

鼓Support System for Outside Officers
The Corporate Planning Department assists outside
directors with the execution of duties by, for example, explaining in advance Board of Directors meeting agendas and regularly reporting on important matters concerning business execution.
Full-time auditors regularly report to outside auditors on the matters deliberated in major internal meetings regarding business execution. In addition, our Corporate Auditor’s Office provides support to corporate auditors.
鼓Training for Directors and Corporate Auditors Internal directors, internal corporate auditors and
executive officers receive training on corporate law, corporate governance and other key issues upon assuming their posts. They also receive training from external organizations to acquire the knowledge they need for their respective roles.
As for outside directors and outside corporate auditors, their initial training includes business, finance, organization and corporate governance. They are also given opportunities to visit our business sites and affiliated companies in Japan and overseas to bolster their understanding of our company.
  鼓Board Member Remuneration
Resolutions of the General Meeting of Shareholders
determine the upper limits of remuneration
for board directors and auditors. The board of directors, including outside directors, has resolved that the level of remuneration for individual board directors is decided by the representative director. The level of remuneration for individual auditors
is determined by the Audit and Supervisory Board members. The remuneration system for directors consists of fixed compensation and performance- based compensation, while the remuneration system for the outside directors and auditors consists solely of fixed compensation.
鼓Determining Board Member Remuneration Fixed compensation is set according to position. Performance-based compensation for directors
is calculated by multiplying profit attributable to owners of parent for the fiscal year under review
by 1% (up to 400 million yen) and a coefficient by position, although this can be reduced depending on business and other conditions. If the annual dividend for the fiscal year under review is less than 30 yen per share, in principle no performance- based compensation will be paid. The ratio
of performance-based compensation to total compensation in FY2020 was 37%, and the profit attributable to owners of parent in FY2019, the basis for calculation, was 43.4 billion yen.

鼓Basic Risk Management Policy and Regulations In our Business Principles we declare “we will strive
to anticipate the changing business environment to assess new opportunities for growth.” We consider risk management as a foundation for reducing management uncertainties and achieving management objectives. We manage risks that make the achievement of management goals uncertain, such as social change, changes in the global environment, natural disasters, accidents and scandals, based on our basic risk management policy. In addition, we have established risk management regulations to incorporate the risk management policy into specific risk management activities. Risk management regulations include emergency responses.

 鼓Basic Compliance Policy
Under our Business Principles we pledge that we will act in strict compliance with the law and in accordance with social mores. Fully aware that compliance is the foundation of CSR management, we published the Basic Compliance Policy and simultaneously created compliance rules in March 2005. We do not limit our definition of compliance to legal compliance; our definition includes compliance with the social mores from which our laws originate, the mission and business principles of our group, and internal regulations.

▪Identifying, Evaluating and Specifying Company-wide Risks We identify, evaluate and specify group-wide risks
every three years and conduct annual reviews of those risks.
FY2020 was the third year of the company-wide risk review since the first was conducted in FY2017. The purpose of identifying risks is to identify
the impact of anticipated changes in social and environmental conditions over the next ten years in relation to uncertainty of group management and then formulate measures to avoid and reduce that uncertainty. We reviewed risks.

鼓Risk Reduction Countermeasures
With the evaluation results of identified company-
wide risks, our Risk Management & Compliance Committee takes the lead in specifying those to be addressed every year and implementing activities to reduce risk impact through PDCA cycles.
Issues addressed in FY2020 were: (1) Leakage of pollutants and hazardous substances, (2) Enhancement of information security, (3) Product/ service accidents, (4) Aging of facilities and equipment, (5) Prevention of traffic accidents, (6) Strengthening of overseas crisis management measures, (7) Enhancement of group corporate governance including risk management and the compliance system, (8) Work-related accidents, (9) Response to shortage of human resources, and (10) Respect for intellectual property rights and strengthening risk prevention.
▪Examples of Overseas Risk Countermeasure Activities We created and regularly revise the Riot/Terrorism Response Manual. In addition, regarding high-risk countries to which our employees are dispatched, we stipulate an outline for deciding on local evacuation as necessary, create a tool for evaluating the emergency evacuation level according to changes in local situations, and provide training using the tool. We also list and secure supplies (food, clothes, hygiene supplies, and medicines),
as well as cash and other resources needed, in the event of evacuation or an emergency at each overseas business site.
鼓Emergency Task Force
When any event such as a disaster, accident or misconduct has occurred, the affected business site informs the general manager of the General Affairs Department. The general manager determines the appropriate countermeasure from the following options while considering the severity of the event: establish the Emergency Task Force or delegate site leadership to respond to the event. Action is then taken through the chosen countermeasure.
Although we received 25 reports in FY2020, none required action by the Emergency Task
Force. Major information, including its handling, is deliberated by the CSR Management Committee. In addition, as preparation for responding to disasters
and accidents, we conducted Shake Out drills for earthquakes at each business site, and workshops on a business continuity plan for the headquarters and branches in case of an earthquake. Moreover, we provided training for plant staff so they would understand how to appropriately handle complaints if an accident occurs.
▪Response to the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) In response to the government’s declared state
of emergency on April 7, 2020 due to the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, we set up the Emergency Task Force as of the same date and announced the company’s “Our emergency measures.“
Specific measures introduced by the emergency task force included our strong promotion of working from home, staggered work hours and the use of video conferencing systems depending on the COVID-19 infection situation. We also prohibited domestic and overseas business trips, and implemented other measures to prevent the spread of the virus and ensure business continuity.
In addition, each overseas office has
taken measures against COVID-19 in line with
local circumstances as soon as receiving an announcement from the Emergency Task Force. The head office has supported delivering masks and medical supplies to all overseas offices.
▪Risk Management and Compliance Promotion Training We provide training for managers and promoters for risk management and compliance of the company’s business sites and group companies to ensure effective risk management and compliance.
In November 2019, we presented a lecture by
a risk management consultant for group company managers based on two themes: “Unconscious
bias management required for leaders” and “Creating an organizational climate that does not cause compliance problems,” with 100 companies participating, and including a lecture titled “How to conduct PDCA for risk management and compliance promotion” followed by case study discussions for promoters, with 80 companies participating.

To fulfill our mission and uphold our business
principles we formulated the Standards of Conduct to guide all officers and employees of Taiheiyo Cement in the performance of their daily duties. The standards consists of 35 items in 6 categories and gathers together Taiheiyo Cement’s policies, regulations and president’s messages delivered within and outside the company.
We created and distributed to all our employees, as well as all those of our main group companies, the Standards of Conduct (Casebook), which describes specific examples on how to act in line with the Standards of Conduct.
We regularly revised The Standards of Conduct (Casebook) to reflect the latest information.
In addition, for all company employees
including those on loan to group companies, we conduct monthly quiz tests as part of e-learning programs to provide education on the Standards of Conduct (Casebook) and other materials so they learn how to act in individual situations.
In FY2020, 73.3% of employees participated in the program.

in which we distributed the Information Security Measures Guide and explained measures to promote it. In addition, we conducted disaster recovery drills, a security level survey of group companies and information security training. No serious incidents related to information security have occurred.
We will continue our efforts to improve the security levels of our domestic and overseas group companies.
Protection and Use of Intellectual Property
鼓Intellectual Property Policy
Our fundamental intellectual property policy is to
contribute to management through intellectual property activities that support our business, ensuring our competitive advantages by strategically conducting intellectual property activities. Under this policy we are developing our intellectual property activities in collaboration with business and R&D divisions to contribute to increasing the corporate value of the Taiheiyo Cement Group.
▪In-house Intellectual Property Management System The company has established the Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Rights. Under the management system based on these rules, we are working on intellectual property activities. The Intellectual Property Department assigns staff members to
the headquarters mainly to perform planning and administrative tasks, and to the Central Research Laboratory to handle applications for and protect rights and research efforts. In addition, intellectual property promoters are assigned as contact points to the major business divisions and the Central Research Laboratory to actively promote the effective and efficient creation, protection and use of our intellectual property in collaboration with the Intellectual Property Department.
▪Intellectual Property Management System for the Group In March 2018 we formulated and began applying
the Taiheiyo Cement Group Intellectual Property Management Guidelines, which apply to the entire group, to promote the use of our intellectual property
and reduce associated risks. We have also established
a committee consisting of those related to intellectual property at the main group companies in order
to promote and vitalize our intellectual property activities corresponding to the scale and industry of each group company, by sharing issues, exchanging information and holding workshops. Our company headquarters was previously used as the venue, but since FY2019 we have created new opportunities to use group companies for that purpose. As a result, the management of each company has begun to attend the venues and further enhancements have been made.
鼓Outline of Our Intellectual Property
As of the end of March 2020 the company owned 1,235
domestic patents and 216 overseas, 273 domestic trademarks and 132 overseas, and 11 domestic design rights. (See the “Research and Development” section for graphs by segment.)
The cement segment accounts for the largest share
of patents owned by the company. However, over the
past several years the share of patent applications in
the environmental and mineral resources segments
has been growing in line with our business and R&D strategies. In order to increase business revenue from patents, we must obtain patents for technologies including peripheral technologies, considering the company’s business conditions. With this understanding we are firmly establishing a wide collection of strong, advanced patents from the perspective of retaining a competitive advantage in terms of intellectual property.
As a technology-oriented manufacturer we have recently focused on raising the percentage of inventors among all employees. We believe this would further cultivate a mindset of valuing corporate intellectual property and develop the originality and portfolio of each business by protecting effective inventions, leading to the continued strengthening of our competitiveness.

鼓Licensing Activities
While the company applies for and acquires rights
primarily to ensure competitive advantages in our business activities, we also proactively license rights that we do not use to other companies. In some cases we also license technologies from other enterprises if they are likely to contribute to our business.

     Special Feature Business Activities
The Environment Collaborating with Society
鼓Risk Management for Intellectual Property Our acquisition and control of intellectual property is
conducted under the Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Rights stated above. This intellectual property rights strategy is intended to ensure that implementation corresponds with the reality of our individual businesses.
Intellectual property, including pending patent applications, is handled through a centrally controlled database by the Intellectual Property Department.
We strive to prevent infringements of competitors’ patents and strictly manage risks by ascertaining recent developments of issues through the periodic circulation of patent information, a problematic patent watch system and an intellectual property review service with the utmost attention paid to setting our own criteria. Moreover, we are educating employees and increasing their awareness by holding in-house training, intellectual property strategy promotion meetings with various divisions and so forth. To date, we have never been sued for infringing intellectual property rights and therefore not suffered any business interference as a consequence.
To manage trade secrets and prevent leaks of know-how and technology, we formulated and enforce Information Security Management Regulations and Document Management Rules that cover the entire group. In addition, we use the guidelines stipulated in the Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Rights to determine whether we will file a patent application for a technology or keep it secret as internal expertise in order to prevent technology leaks.
Group companies have formulated or reinforced various intellectual property rules while completing
the execution of agreements with each inventor. Given that we are strategically licensing our core technologies overseas from the perspective of our projected global management stance, we also address the risks of overseas licensing. The legal systems of emerging
Asian countries are different from the system in Japan. For example, licensors are responsible for quality/ performance assurance in those countries. In addition to internal information dissemination, we are implementing risk management in cooperation with specialized lawyers who are familiar with situations in those countries.
鼓Intellectual Property Award Program
We have paid specified compensation to inventors for
their patent applications and for registered patents that have significantly contributed to the business
profits under our regulations. Furthermore, in FY2018 we started to operate an Intellectual Property Award Program to strengthen employee awareness of intellectual property. In FY2020, achievements were recognized through the Excellent Invention Award (1 award, 7 individuals), the Largest Number of Patent Applications Award (1 individual and 1 team) and the Intellectual Property Contribution Award (2 awards, a total of 8 individuals).
鼓Training and Awareness Raising
To raise awareness of intellectual property and increase its potential, the company encourages employees, especially members of the research division and the technology development division, to take the Intellectual Property Management Skills Test, a national licensing examination. We have continued other employee training and awareness- raising efforts such as external workshops held
by the Japan Intellectual Property Association
and Japan Institute for Promoting Invention and Innovation, in addition to in-house training at
our headquarters, Central Research Laboratory, branches and plants. In FY2020 we implemented the training programs described below, with 90 attendees including employees from affiliated companies. We have also partially introduced an e-learning program. Furthermore, through efforts such as information exchange gatherings and study meetings for those related to the intellectual property of each company stated above, we strive to duly protect and use intellectual property across the group while respecting other companies’ intellectual property
and preventing
infringement,
focusing primarily
on intellectual
property as a source
of profit.

In addition, we dispatch one person every year to the WBCSD Leadership Program. So far we have dispatched eight people thereby contributing to the development of global human resources.
鼓Participation in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo
We participate in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo. Established in November 1979, the federation now consists of 123 companies (representing about 1.5 million employees as of July 2020), most of which are headquartered in Tokyo. Under its basic philosophy of voluntary management and full participation, the federation endeavors to resolve the issue known as Dowa, a discrimination issue in Japan, and other human rights issues.
  We provide CSR education through training programs for each position, including sessions
for newly hired employees, follow-up courses for second-year employees, career development (around ten years after joining the company)
and training for newly appointed managers. For education on specific issues such as human rights, each specialized committee provides the relevant training programs. We also conduct executive- level CSR training once a year, including for group companies. Moreover, in order to enhance their understanding of the 2019 CSR Report, we created and distributed a report summary.

Environmental Management Policy
Our environmental management policy declares an active commitment to environmental issues facing society, including not only preventing pollution but also creating a recycling-based society, mitigating climate change, reducing environmental impacts, protecting water resources and conserving biodiversity as key management challenges. Under this policy we are focusing on improving our environmental performance.
Environmental Management Policy
In January 2006 we created an Environmental Management Policy, reflecting the fact that we consider an active commitment to the environmental issues facing society to be key management challenges. In addition to initiatives emphasizing these six items in all business operations, we strive to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders, from international society to local communities, and to seek the ideal form for a sustainable cement industry as a member of the WBCSD and GCCA (Global Cement and Concrete Association).
Created in January 2006 Revised in April 2019
Company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS)
In June 1997 Taiheiyo Cement initiated ISO 14001 certification of each of its plants and attained 100% certification by 1999. Recognizing, however, that plant level management systems alone are insufficient to ensure comprehensive environmental protection through environmental management projects, we built
a companywide environmental management system (EMS) and extended it beyond plants to cover our headquarters, branches and Central Research Laboratory. In April 2009 our EMS was ISO 14001 certified by
the Japan Testing Center for Construction Materials, an independent third-party testing, standardization and certification authority. As part of the continuing certification the company-wide system underwent a renewal audit for the third time in March 2018.
鼓EMS Readiness
Top management (officer in charge of the Production Department) chairs the Environmental Management Committee with ultimate decision-making authority for environmental management. Overseen by the Environmental Management Committee, the relevant headquarters division manages our plants, mines and branches using an “umbrella” system. Each group cement company in Japan and overseas is committed
       ❶ Pursuing Environmentally Conscious Business Activities In pursuit of zero environmental impacts we target the impacts of our business activities, including those of the value chain, which are emitting GHGs, pollutants, noise and vibration, withdrawing water, degrading forest and others. We promote the introduction of eco-efficient technologies into our business and the development of eco-conscious products as a member of both the regional and global society.

to environmental preservation. Over 90% of the group’s total cement output in FY2020 was produced in ISO 14001-certified plants. Facilities in countries where ISO is not adopted as the mainstream standard operate their own EMS.
鼓Internal Environmental Audits
In FY2020 we conducted internal environmental audits at all our sites.
As priority items from this year’s audit, confirmation of legal compliance reviews, external communications and corrective actions for unachieved items were identified as company-wide concerns. The status of a follow-up, including corrective and preventive actions for nonconformity with environmental requirements, and the status of responses to emergencies were identified as items that plants must deal with. Verifying the compliance status of a service stations was identified as an item that must be dealt with by branches.
The audit identified 21 findings including 6 for which improvements were requested. Corrective actions were taken for all 6 findings for which improvements were requested.
鼓Environmental Education
During Environment Month each June we deliver a
message from the president and provide educational materials on the environment page of our portal
site to increase awareness and encourage learning about the environment, and about environmental preservation activities throughout the group. Each workplace also engages in a number of different activities, such as conducting training sessions related to accident response, viewing environment-related DVDs, holding
or penalties or significant accidents that affected the environment including animals or plants. However, we had two accidents (cement dust) and took measures to prevent these accidents from recurring.
鼓Response to Environmental Accidents
Each plant maintains emergency response
plans in preparation for possible environmental accidents. They also conduct training, including periodic fire-fighting training in cooperation with local fire departments. Other training includes
how to reduce environmental impact when an environmental accident occurs and how to report it to a government entity.
鼓Environmental Complaints
As we increasingly utilize wastes and by-products and they become more diverse, the number of environmental issues we need to consider also increase. Therefore, we are ramping up our efforts to reduce environmental impact through activities such as introducing indoor storage and sealed containers for waste and by-products, and improving our flue gas stacks. When we receive an environmental complaint we quickly travel to the site in question, whenever possible, to check the situation, investigate the cause and provide an explanation. When we find that our activities are the cause, we implement improvements.
In FY2020 our cement plants received 104 environmental complaints. We responded to 28 of these, which were associated with our operations. The number of complaints received in FY2019 increased from the previous year due to a change in the counting method. However, the number in FY2020 remained unchanged from the previous year.

GRI102-11, 302-3, 305-1, 2, 4, 5
Among the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our domestic group companies (excluding power generation companies) that are reporting their greenhouse gas emissions by business segment
in accordance with the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, about 95% of greenhouse gas emissions were generated from cement production companies in FY2017.* The amount of greenhouse
gas emissions associated with our service stations, headquarters, branches and shipping, as well as electricity purchased by the group, was around 5% in FY2020. Under Scope 3 (value chain) calculations for cement, for which downstream value is not calculated since cement is considered an intermediate product at this stage, the emissions were around 5.0% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 (direct air emissions) in FY2019.
The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of our group companies is CO2 from cement production. We are therefore working to reduce emissions from cement production, as indicated in our CSR Objectives for 2025, in order to achieve our long-term quantitative target of reducing specific net CO2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product by 10% or more from FY2001 levels by FY2026.
Some of our plants are taking part in the target
setting type emissions trading program for Saitama
Prefecture and California’s cap-and-trade program,
striving to achieve the reduction targets. To support
voluntary approaches we are also working in line with
Keidanren’s voluntary action plan and the measures to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions established by the
*Most of our overseas affiliated companies are cement production companies so the total
CO2 emissions from production overall is higher than that of domestic companies alone. 700

   Efforts Related to the Cement Production Process
GRI302-1, 3, 4, 305-4, 5
Not a less amount of carbon dioxide is generated in the course of cement manufacture. This is because the production process requires a high temperature of 1,450°C and limestone, used as raw material, is decarbonated through a chemical reaction during the calcination process (CaCO3 → CaO + CO2). About 35% of CO2 emissions generated during cement production are from the consumption of energy, about 55% are from the calcination of raw materials and about 10% are from electricity use. To reduce CO2 emissions we have been working to conserve energy by installing energy-efficient equipment
and improving the stability and efficiency of our
kiln operations. We have also been implementing measures such as using waste- and biomass-derived energy sources to decrease our rate of use of fossil fuels. Moreover, we are moving toward using recycled resources with less carbonate content to bring down CO2 emissions from the calcination of the limestone used as raw material, and have started using WHR power generation to tackle CO2 emissions associated with conventional electricity generation.
Specific heat consumption was reduced in FY2020 delivering a reduction in CO2 emissions of 4-kg-CO2/t cementitious product compared to FY2019, mainly as a result of a decrease in the clinker-to-cement ratio.

Reducing CO2 Emissions during Transportation GRI305-3
We contract the delivery of our raw materials and products to transportation companies and are striving to reduce CO2 emissions as a specified consigner designated under the Japanese Energy Saving Act. Major efforts include implementing a plan to transport goods on return trips, encouraging drivers to eco-drive, and promoting energy efficient devices such as digital tachometers and eco-tires on vehicles. In shipping we continue to pursue energy efficiency technologies and operate new ships that are equipped with many energy-saving features. We are also supporting energy-saving operations for conventionally powered ships.
In FY2020 our CO2 emissions decreased by about 3% compared to FY2019, mainly due to a 3% decrease in both the distance and tonnage transported.

▪ Use of Alternative Energy Resources and Alternative Raw Materials In FY2020 non-fossil energy and biomass energy accounted for about 14.1% of all energy used for group kilns. A decrease of about 8.2 kg-CO2/t- clinker was also achieved by using alternative raw materials. As a result of using both alternative energy resources and raw materials, reductions in CO2 emissions are expected to reach 1.47 million tonnes (emission factor for coal: 0.096 kg-CO2/MJ).

4°C
Renewable energy is more widely used in developed countries. For example, no new coal-fired power stations have been constructed in those nations. Coal-fired power generation, however, continues to grow globally. Priority is placed on economic activities while restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions stay lax and the cost of emitting greenhouse gases (carbon price) is set low. There is no significant change in cement manufacturing. The recycling of mineral resources, such as fly ash, slag and other by-products further increases at home and abroad.
Technologies, Society and Infrastructure
4°C
Global cement demand continues
to grow due to growing populations, urbanization and the increased scale and frequency of natural disasters.
In renewing cement manufacturing facilities, energy-saving equipment
is introduced and capacity for the production of blended cement
using less clinker is increased. Moderately low carbon taxes and market emissions prices discourage businesses from introducing CCUS (CO2 capture, utilization and storage). The process-derived CO2 emissions* per unit of cement output stay at the same level as the present.
Rise in Average Temperature and Changes in Rainfall Pattern
4°C
Greenhouse gas emissions
continue to grow, which makes it difficult to mitigate climate change. Flood damage associated with overflowing rivers and storm surges increases due to the rise in global average temperature and sea level. Flooding occurs more frequently worldwide due to torrential rains and massive typhoons. While our manufacturing and supply systems must be reinforced, demand remains strong for cement and concrete
to strengthen urban and national resilience.
      2°C 2°C 2°C
Costs related to carbon emissions
rise due to carbon pricing and the reinforcement of regulations on
CO2 emissions. The cement industry promotes research on low-CO2
cement production and development of new technologies including those
for saving energy while continuing investments to meet demand. The proportion of cement manufacturing facilities featuring CCS (CO2 capture and storage) increases through the government’s policy for promoting CCS. Thus process-derived CO2 emissions* per unit of cement output drop.
*CO2 emissions do not include those derived from energy sources since they are generated by the calcination of limestone.
   Efforts to mitigate climate changes are taken toward realizing a decarbonized society; however, efforts are not sufficient. Greenhouse gas emissions slowly increase.
Greenhouse gas emissions are limited to the level that their concentration meets the 2°C target. Physical impacts due to a 2°C rise in average temperature, however, cannot be avoided. Changes in rainfall patterns also continue. Consequently, the production and supply system for cement and concrete must be enhanced. In parallel with mitigation actions, adaptive measures are required
 In terms of efforts toward zero greenhouse gas emissions, the operation of coal-fired power stations decline due to system reforms related to energy supply and demand. A shift takes place toward renewable energy and low-carbon energy such as LNG. Carbon taxes and emissions trading programs become popular.

   Resource Recycling with Industries
鼓Electric Power Utilities
We accept coal ash produced at coalfired power
plants and use it as a substitute for clay as a raw
material in cement. In addition, we operate ash
centers* to use more ash effectively. We also supply
the power plants with limestone powder which is
used as a flue-gas desulfurization material to scrub
the harmful sulfur oxide from the exhaust produced
by the burning of coal. The reaction of the flue-gas
desulfurization material with sulfur oxide forms
gypsum, which we use effectively as a raw material
for cement.
*Ash centers are distribution sites with collection/transportation (transshipment and storage) and intermediate-processing (powder mixing) functions. They receive coal ash from coal- fired power plants and ensure a stable supply to our cement plants, while enabling effective utilization of coal ash and supplying diverse products that meet user needs.
鼓Steelmakers
In the iron and steelmaking process, impurities are removed from iron ore to make iron. We supply the limestone powder and quicklime used as purifying materials in the refining process. We also use by-products such as blast furnace slag and steel slag that remain after the refining process as raw materials for cement and mineral components.
鼓Construction Soil
Conventionally this soil had been dumped
into landfills. By making effective use of it as an alternative raw material for cement we contribute to the material recycling of construction soil as well as to the extension of the lifetime of landfills. We have also set up intermediary facilities that organically link sites where construction soil is produced to our nationwide plants.
Resource Recycling with Communities
Although most municipal waste is incinerated and the ash is buried in landfills, finding new landfill
sites has become very difficult. Waste treatment has particularly become a source of concern for Japan’s major city governments and the situation is expected to get worse. We have three systems for recycling municipal waste and strive to make effective use of such resources and resolve environmental issues.
● Incineration Residues Recycling System
A system for recycling municipal waste incineration ash (bottom ash and fly ash) as a raw material for ordinary Portland cement.
● AK System
A system for recycling household waste and general business waste as alternative raw materials and fuels for cement manufacture. The waste is pre-processed through biological breakdown (fermentation) using a waste recycling kiln.
● Ecocement System
Ecocement is a new type of cement made primarily from the municipal waste incineration ash. More than 500 kg of ash and other waste materials are used per tonne of Ecocement.

 Performance of Recycled-Waste-to-Cement System GRI301-1, 2
All of our directly operated cement plants in Japan recycle waste and by- products into alternative raw materials and fuels for cement. This helps to extend the lifetime of landfills, prevent the depletion of natural mineral resources, limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.
In FY2020 we recycled 6.387 million tonnes of waste and by-products, a decrease of approximately 178,000 tonnes compared to the amount in FY2019 This was due to a decrease in the amounts of blast furnace slag, by- product gypsum, unburned ash, soot and dust we accepted, which offset the increased volumes of coal ash, waste plastic, waste oil, water treatment plant sewage sludge and ash. This means we recycled 409.5 kg of waste and by- products per tonne of cement produced.
In addition, all of the group’s cement plants in Japan accept waste and by-products for recycling.

   Environmental Impact of Our Operations
GRI304-1, 2, MM1, MM2
鼓Environmental Impact of Our Operations Cement production starts with quarrying limestone, the primary raw material for cement. We also quarry other raw materials such as aggregates and other minerals.
Since quarrying requires the removal of topsoil, quarry development has an impact on the biodiversity of the development area. However,
the limestone, rocks and sand we quarry only require crushing for particle size adjustment and sorting, and do not require any refining processes. Consequently, our operations are unlikely to cause chemical contamination to surrounding areas. In addition, we minimize the amount of waste stones generated during our limestone quarrying by using them as construction materials.
鼓Limestone Quarries of the Group
The group operates 19 major limestone quarries
around the world, most of which are near our
integrated cement plants. The total site area* of the
quarries is 4,327 ha (Japan: 2,409 ha; U.S.A.: 1,281
ha; other regions: 637 ha).

*Require consideration refers to quarries that fall under category IV or higher in terms of the IUCN’s Protected Area.
Using the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment
Tool (IBAT) provided by BirdLife International, we checked whether any of our limestone quarries are in any of the protected areas defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). We found that none of our quarries are within or adjacent to Protected Area Category III or lower categories. However, In Japan, one quarry is within a Category IV area and two are adjacent to Category IV areas.
All these quarries have obtained the necessary licenses and conduct environmentally friendly
quarrying operations. They have no pending litigations concerning biodiversity or other environmental issues.
Outline of Protected Area Categories of the IUCN
Areas that have outstanding or representative ecosystems or have geographical or physiological features or species.
Large unmodified or slightly modified areas.
Areas set aside to protect the environmental integrity of the ecosystem.
Areas that have outstanding features of nature or cultural values.
Areas that require active interventions to maintain habitats or address the requirements of particular species.
Activities to Reduce Environmental Impact
GRI103-2, 3, 304-1, 2, 3, 4, MM1
Throughout the group we believe that balancing the conservation of ecosystems in communities and development of the communities themselves is important in quarry operations. With this belief, we hold discussions with local governments, communities and academics while operating quarries. This helps to ensure we not only prevent pollution but also conserve biodiversity and water resources while minimizing our environmental impact.
鼓Environmental Impact Assessment
In developing quarries we conduct ex-ante
assessments of environmental impact of the development of quarries based on environmental research of the development area such as on biodiversity and water resources. We then discuss the results of the research with local governments, communities, academics, and other stakeholders toward finalizing a development plan. Moreover,
we regularly monitor the surrounding environment during the development and operations of quarries and report to our stakeholders on the environmental impact that the quarries have in these areas.

preserving rare wildlife species in cooperation with external experts and local residents. Furthermore, we minimized noise and vibration during the development work and also limited the traffic hours for trucks used in construction work. In addition, even after development work begins, we carry out regular ex-post assessments and environmental protection measures.
鼓Biodiversity Protection
When environmental impact assessments determine
that protection is required, we protect rare species through the installation of protective measures, transplanting and restricting development work.
Since 1972, at the Minowa Quarry of Chichibu Taiheiyo Cement Corporation, we have been protecting and nurturing rare species of native plants on Mt. Buko, which is on the border of Chichibu City and Yokoze Town in Saitama Prefecture. We created a botanical garden at the quarry and, together with local experts and other people, we preserve 68 native plant species there while increasing the plant population. Additionally, our Central Research Laboratory continues to research and develop ways to preserve and grow endangered plants, and to verify genetic diversity of native plant species using biotechnology. Since 2016, in the course of developing the Ofunato Quarry, we have been working with experts to preserve and cultivate various rare plant species
in their native biospheres by creating a botanical garden on the side of the office of Ryushin Mining Co., Ltd.
Botanical garden
鼓Greening Quarries
In working quarry areas, rocks and soil are
exposed leaving no flora coverage. However, we continuously restore greenery to the quarry slopes on terraces formed during the quarrying process as early as possible, particularly if no quarrying work is expected for some time. We also plant vegetation in stockyards for excavated topsoil where no construction work is expected. At some quarries, at the request of the community, we restore greenery if operations have been suspended for several months.
We usually plant vegetation that is native to
the region. Group greening of quarries in Japan in FY2020 involved a 20,630 m2 area where seeds were sprayed and 1,726 tree seedlings planted.
Other efforts include participating in an annual tree planting campaign with contractors and local residents to improve
awareness of quarry
development and
greening activities.
Greening quarry slopes
鼓Water Resource Conservation
In quarrying we also pay close attention to
protecting not only terrestrial plants but also water resources such as rivers and natural springs in an effort to protect biodiversity. From the perspective of conserving water resources, spring water discharged from quarrying and rainwater is directed into retention basins to minimize impact outside of the quarrying area. In some quarries we drill wells for domestic water and supply this water to local communities for everyday use.
鼓Use of Old Quarry Sites
We reuse old quarry sites where operations have
completely ended after consultation with the local community. When greening a site we strive to restore the original natural environment.

鼓Water Contamination
Most of the water discharged from our plants to
public waterways is cooling water and not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. At our cement plants all water resources are reused as circulation water to minimize the impact of water discharge into public waterways. Also, we are working to prevent the leakage of potential pollutants by installing bunds around our oil tanks and acid/alkali tanks. Moreover, we are installing sedimentation tanks, water-oil separation tanks,
oil film detectors, pH meters and suspended solid sensors on water discharge routes that connect to public waterways.
Example of Water Circulation Flow at a Cement Plant
    鼓Air Pollution
Air pollutants generated from cement production are primarily NOx, SOx and dust in combustion gases emitted from cement kilns. To ensure the proper management of these substances we remain committed to reducing air pollutant emissions through measures such as continuously monitoring emission concentrations, improving NOx reduction systems and installing bag filter equipment to capture dust emissions. With such measures we focus on controlling the emission of air pollutants with the goal of maintaining FY2011 emission levels.
Emissions of NOx and dust in FY2020 were lower than in FY2011, whereas emissions of SOx were higher than in FY2011 (base year) because
we accepted waste with high sulfur content. Nonetheless, the level of SOx emissions was very low compared to the limit set under the Air Pollution Control Act.

 According to the results of the water risk analysis conducted using the Water Risk Filter*, the
average score for the total basin risk for all our plants (weighted average taking into account the cementitious production volume) was 2.8 (the maximum score is 5.0, with a higher score indicating a greater risk). The highest total basin risk score
was 3.5, higher than that of the previous year. The volume of cement produced at the plant with the highest score accounted for about 15% of the production volume of all the plants. However, when we analyzed conditions at that plant, no imminent issues were identified.
*This is a water risk mapping tool developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature and used to evaluate impacts on businesses related to water scarcity, flooding, drought, seasonal variation, physical water quality risks, regulatory risks, etc.

At present there are no foreseeable specific concerns regarding water resources that may be raised by local communities. We therefore remain focused on reducing the amount of water withdrawal from the perspective of improving production efficiency. Also, we will continue to contribute to promoting the appropriate use of water resources for local communities by maintaining close communication with them.
As for Taiheiyo Cement Philippines, it supplies clean water to local communities in the Philippines from a well drilled by the company.

  Status of Water Consumption
GRI303-1, 2, 3, 4, 306-1
  Most of the water used at our cement plants is for the cooling of production equipment, exhaust gas and in-house power generators. Therefore, the water discharged from the plants is mostly cooling water, which is not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. Our plants near the ocean
use seawater to cool in-house power generation equipment. We circulate and reuse all freshwater at these facilities (except for household wastewater) in order to reduce water withdrawal and prevent water pollution by the discharged water.
The total withdrawal of freshwater for FY2020 was about 27.61 million m3 and the total seawater withdrawal for the same year was about 147 million m3. The seawater was used to cool in-house power generation equipment at our plants near the ocean and then released back into the sea after use. The amount of freshwater discharged was approximately 13.67 million m3, meaning that about 13.93 million m3 of freshwater was used at the plants. However,
it is not used as a raw material input but for the cooling of equipment so is consequently released into the atmosphere through evaporation.
In FY2020 we withdrew 0.817 m3 of freshwater (withdrawal per unit of production) to produce 1 tonne of cement. Moreover, there was little change in our water consumption efficiency.

       鼓 External Economic Benefits Derived from the Recycled-Waste-to-Cement System
Taiheiyo Cement uses the external economic benefit (EEB) evaluation method to express, in monetary terms, its evaluation of socioeconomic benefits
from environmental impact reduction due to the increase in recycling of wastes accepted from
outside the company. As a type of deemed benefit, an EEB of 91.2 billion yen was identified for FY2020, representing a 13% increase on the previous year as a result of an increase in the total amount of waste and by-products used.

    About Taiheiyo Cement’s External Economic Benefit Evaluation
   • Taiheiyo has developed a unique evaluation method to estimate the contribution to overall environmental benefit to society by utilizing waste materials from other industries.
• We use information, including data collected for the GCCA Cement CO2 Protocol, to calculate the reduction in consumption of fossil energy and natural resources
associated with the use of waste and by-products.
• EEBs are calculated by multiplying the reduced volumes of CO2, crude oil, natural resources and waste (resulting from the utilization of waste and by-products in the
cement production process compared to cement production without using waste and by-products) by market prices for each of the four items. The prices, assumed to be kept constant at year 2000 levels, are estimated as follows: CO2: 3,000 yen/t (a hypothetical CO2 emission tax rate); crude oil: import price; natural resources: estimated price; waste: controlled landfill cost in the Tokyo area.
• A portion of the EEB, such as the waste treatment fee, is accounted for in Taiheiyo’s profit and loss statement.
   Environmental Accounting for One of Our Projects
A clinker cooler uses air to cool clinker, an intermediate product of cement that is burned at a high temperature of 1,450°C in a rotary kiln. The hot air generated by heat exchange during the cooling process is effectively used as combustion air for the rotary kiln.
The clinker cooler introduced for the No. 5 kiln at the Oita plant in FY2020 is a new type of cooler that only requires a small amount of air and is significantly more efficient in heat recovery than conventional units. Requiring less heat energy for clinker burning, the new cooler will further reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impact.
Investment: Reduction in CO2 emissions: Approximately 740 million yen 12,313 tonnes/year

   Quality Policy
In 1998, the year of Taiheiyo Cement’s inception, we established a quality policy based on our management policy. We revised the policy by incorporating a visual description of the code
of conduct. Through those efforts we have been continually raising awareness of the policy across the organization. Moreover, it represents our aspiration to continue to be a company that customers trust and rely on by sharing a sense of achievement through each employee’s actions and by providing high-quality products and services, leveraging our high technological capabilities and quality assurance system.
Quality Policy
Improve customer satisfaction by ensuring each employee is pursuing quality that meets the needs of users in the Pacific Rim from a global perspective and providing quality assurance.
Quality Assurance Initiatives and Quality Management System
GRI416-1
We focus on stabilizing and improving product quality while capitalizing on the production and quality control technologies we have developed over the years. Recently, we have further enhanced product quality control by capitalizing on advanced technologies to ensure improved stability such as an online analysis system for raw materials, clinker and cement, the measurement of clinker minerals by X-ray diffraction and our proprietary Taiheiyo Cement Quality Predictive System (TQPS).
All of our cement plants in Japan, including
those of group companies, have obtained ISO
9001 certification, the international standard for quality management systems. Furthermore, all of
our overseas cement plants in countries that adopt ISO have obtained ISO 9001 certification. To ensure product quality and improve business operations, we obtained ISO 9001 certification from the Japan Testing Center for Construction Materials. The scope of our certification encompasses the development, design and production of a range of cement, cement clinker and cement-based soil stabilizer products.
We will continue to fully apply the ISO
9001 approach in addition to our own quality management system to more deeply integrate our quality management system and business processes in an effort to strengthen our ability to continually provide ISO 9001-compliant products and deliver greater customer satisfaction.
鼓Strengthening Our Relationship with Customers We place the highest priority on achieving greater customer satisfaction. We periodically exchange information among business units to strengthen production focused on quality that meets customer expectations. From our sales and technical staff at the branches and sales offices we collect information on customer requirements for product quality
and services, including delivery, and analyze the information in order to provide suggestions for improvements. To encourage overseas customers to adopt our high-quality products we have started to incorporate local needs into product quality,
just as we do for domestic customers, and we are fine-tuning our products to meet the requirements of each overseas market. We respond to each quality issue raised by customers and strive to improve product quality and customer satisfaction. Also, we actively identify potential quality risks, investigate their causes and implement extensive countermeasures while enhancing cross-divisional coordination toward establishing a more secure and safer quality assurance system.
In addition, we have been expanding our quality assurance system to include the products
of our group companies beyond Taiheiyo Cement products. We strive to identify and address material issues in a well-organized manner through cross- divisional activities toward strengthening the reliability of the Taiheiyo brand as well as customer satisfaction.

Safe Cement and Cement Products
GRI416-1
Today every product is expected to be safe and cement, as a construction material that is indispensable for developing social infrastructure, is no exception. The cement industry has long made use of industrial waste and by-products such as blast furnace slag, coal ash and by-product gypsum as substitutes for natural mineral resources. Furthermore, using technologies we developed to recycle household waste such as the AK system to recycle municipal waste and the incineration residue recycling system, we also recycle construction-related soil and waste materials into raw material and fuel for cement production. When our cement plants accept waste we prevent its dispersal and minimize the release of odor by transporting the waste in a tightly sealed panel truck and storing it in a fully enclosed facility to protect the environment of the surrounding area as well as inside the plants.

minute quantities of heavy metals such as chromium 300

under which we conduct three kinds of inspection related 10

Ensuring Product Safety Following a Nuclear Accident
GRI416-1, 417-1
As a consequence of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company in 2011, we discovered
that some industrial waste used for making cement contained radioactive material. We have established a system to ensure that the radioactive concentration in cement shipped from our plants is below the safety limit* set by the Japanese government by strictly controlling the radioactive concentrations in raw materials and
fuels for cement. In the interest of full disclosure we
post measurements of radioactive concentrations in our
products on our website every month.
*The Japanese government set the limit of 100 Bq/kg, effective May 2011, as the safety standard for radioactive concentrations in cement.
For more information about radioactive concentration in our products, please visit:
https://www.taiheiyo-cement.co.jp/news/sokutei.html (Japanese only)
Information Provision Using SDS and Labeling
GRI417-1
To ensure the safety of cement users we prepare Safety Data Sheets which contain hazard identification details and make these sheets available on our website. Labels showing safety information are also attached to bags and flexible containers.
User Societies and Industry Associations
GRI417-1
We founded and manage a variety of societies for cement users and industry associations to support them in strengthening their businesses and developing technological competitiveness. The National Taiheiyo Cement Ready-mixed Concrete Society, the largest
of these organizations, has established 10 Taiheiyo Cement Ready-mixed Concrete Societies from Hokkaido to Kyushu. For technical support we hold technical sessions and presentations while conducting activities under a specific theme that meets regional user requirements. We also support users in obtaining qualifications such as Authorized Concrete Engineer, Authorized Chief Concrete Engineer, and Authorized Concrete Diagnosis and Maintenance Engineer.
In addition to the Ready-mixed Concrete Society, we established other associations such as the Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving Block Industry and
SPLITTON Association Japan to proactively deliver technical support for the mutual development of concrete companies. We will continue to support activities that benefit cement users.
Representative Activities of the Ready-mixed Concrete Society (under Specific Themes)
Survey of technical staff and education/training at ready-mixed concrete plants
Compiling a booklet on representative near-miss cases at ready- mixed concrete plants
Workshop on concrete work technologies by general contractor’s engineers
Workshop on safety management at ready-mixed concrete plants
Survey of trial mixing of concrete using fly ash from different sources
Training workshop for young engineers at concrete plants in each prefecture
Case study of annual policy and quality policy at ready-mixed concrete plants
Workshop on health and safety for operators
Compiling technical materials for hot-weather concrete in response to work in hot or extremely hot seasonal conditions
Developing an FAQ on ready-mixed concrete technologies
鼓Initiatives through the Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving Block Industry
Concrete paving blocks are being deployed to lower vehicle speeds and reduce traffic accidents associated with excessive speed. To encourage the dissemination of our roadway blocks developed by the association, we are conducting an anecdotal evaluation of performance required for roadway pavement, their durability, and other properties at the Central Research Laboratory.
Work style reform is currently in high demand
at production and construction worksites for
paving blocks. To gather information on the world’s advanced technologies to address this challenge,
we, accompanied by association members, attended bauma2019, one of the world’s largest trade shows for construction machinery held in Germany in April 2019, and visited precast concrete-related companies.
The knowledge we gained there has been shared with other member companies so that, as a means of contributing to society, we can promote a wider spread use of concrete block paving.

 Our aim is to develop human resources that are highly regarded both inside and outside the company.
 ❶ In principle, human resources will be developed through on-the-job training supplemented by off- the-job training.
 ❷ Human resources will be developed to succeed the roles of their superiors, playing central roles in the future in each area and at each level.
 ❸ Human resources will be developed to take action in constant consideration of group management.
❹ Human resources will be developed to be competent by global standards.
❺ Human resources will be developed to protect the environment and to serve society by assuming active roles in CSR initiatives.
❻ Human resources will be encouraged and assisted to develop their motivation and to adopt broader perspectives through self-development.
 鼓Human Resource Development
We implement company-wide measures, including group
training by position, and the development of global human resources. We also introduce measures aimed at developing the individual potential of each employee as a basis for energizing the organization. These efforts provide our employees with opportunities for personalized learning experiences that foster autonomy and independence, and ultimately raise their motivation to the next level. We actively encourage and create environments in which employees can freely make decisions about their careers during their work and training.
In addition, we ask all employees to submit self-appraisals once a year, including future career development aspirations, worksite preferences and family considerations, to help us improve the work environment so they can fully demonstrate their abilities and to ensure stable employment.
Respecting Diversity
GRI404-2, 405-1
 ▪Promoting Diversity and the Empowerment of Women Acknowledging that promoting diversity and empowering women is the biggest and most immediate challenge for creating an innovative labor force, we have engaged in a wide range of efforts.
In July 2015 we established the Diversity Promotion Office (name at the time) to review various measures and strengthened our awareness-raising efforts. In addition to reviewing company systems and establishing new ones, the office operates the Kirakira Palette portal site*, which provides employees with information such as details of company programs and available fringe benefits.
In October 2019 we held the fifth Diversity Forum and invited an external lecturer who has long been engaged in initiatives for enabling diverse human resources to demonstrate their capabilities and realize diverse workstyles. The theme of the lecture was diversity among role models. We made the video of the forum available online via the Kirakira Palette site for all employees to watch at their convenience.
 Characteristics of Ideal Employees
From the standpoint of human resource development we have identified the following desirable characteristics and traits for revolutionizing the company and creating a dynamic Taiheiyo Cement.
Self-confident individuals who are able to contribute to the sustainable growth of the group with a firm commitment to achieving the group mission:
❶ Individuals with innovative ideas, strong leadership and the ability to take bold actions
❷ Individuals who can be competent by global standards ❸ Individuals who can contribute to group management

We have been participating since FY2018 in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Challenge (Riko- challe) program led by the Gender Equality Bureau of the Cabinet Office, to empower women in the workplace. In August 2019 we organized a plant tour for experiencing work and interacting with our female engineers at the Fujiwara Plant and Quarry.
We are steadily working on the general business owner action plans pursuant to the Act of Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. In addition, we have been participating in Keidanren’s Action Plan on Women’s Active Participation in the Workforce and announced our voluntary action plans. We will continue our sincere efforts to increase job opportunities for women and create an environment that fosters more female managers.
We have been actively recruiting female employees to increase the ratio of female employees to over 10% by 2020 (the ratio of female employees as of March 31, 2020 was approximately 9.0%). Women who are “G Course” employees accounted for approximately 21% of the new employees joining the company in April 2020. We also hired one female foreign national and will continue to hire outstanding employees with a focus on individual capabilities, regardless of nationality.
While our target of at least 10% of female employees by 2020 expires at the end of FY2021, we will continue to promote the empowerment of women toward achieving the target in our CSR Objectives for 2025.

 鼓Flexible Work Arrangements
We are working to provide flexible work arrangements
by adopting various employment systems that will enable our employees to enhance work-life balance.
Support for Childcare and Caregivers
We established a long-term leave system in 2017 for employees who are given no choice but to give up their careers due to unavoidable circumstances such as relocating for their spouse’s job or childcare. We also operate a reemployment system for employees who leave their jobs due to child or family care. In addition to our childcare/family-care leave, we have instituted measures that support employees who do not want to take leave, such as a telecommuting, flextime, shortened work hours and starting work early or finishing late.
Responding to the Act for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation
Since FY2006 we have been formulating general business owner action plans based on the Act for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation. After having obtained the initial “Kurumin” certification in 2017, we achieved the objectives set in the general business owner action plan during the plan’s fifth term, from April 2017 to March 2019. We also met multiple certification criteria such as the rate of childcare leave taken and actual overtime work. In recognition of
our efforts we obtained the second “Kurumin” certification in January 2020. Also, in FY2020 we started implementing various efforts in accordance with our sixth-term general business owner action plan.

since undertaken initiatives based on the “Kenkokeiei*”
concept to maintain and improve the mental and
physical health of every employee.
*Kenkokeiei (Management of Health on Company and Employee) is a trademark of the NPO Health Management Study Group
Mental Healthcare
We provide mental health checkups for all our employees (consultation rate: 95.3% in FY2020). Mental healthcare is a key focus in our efforts
to promote employee health. We also conduct workshops focused on preventing mental health problems. In addition, we offer free counseling services on mental health to employees and their families under a contract with the company’s healthcare trust for this purpose.

Employee Awareness Survey
Toward increasing employee job satisfaction we have conducted an employee survey every two years from FY2014 to FY2018. In FY2021 we plan to conduct the survey after reviewing its content.
Sound Labor-management Relations
GRI102-41, 403-4
All employees who have entered into a labor agreement with the company are members of a union. We occasionally hold labor-management consultation and briefing sessions that provide opportunities for labor and management to exchange opinions and negotiate issues on the basis of mutual trust and understanding. In FY2020, 38
of these sessions were held encompassing labor contract negotiations as well as explanations of corporate performance, revisions to wages and bonuses, and amended systems and rules. Through the sessions we intend to improve communication between labor and management. In addition,
four specialized committees set up as advisory bodies for labor-management consultation provide opportunities for active negotiation and exchanging views between labor and management.
Activities of Specialized Committees

   We produce and use cement and concrete in our major business activities. Much of its main raw ingredient, limestone, is mined and supplied by
our group companies, which also manage the quarries. Coal, the primary fossil fuel thermal energy is supplied by companies outside the group. The wastes and by-products that we recycle in our cement production process come from many different industries and a variety of locations.
A significant part of our production process is automated. The construction and maintenance of our production equipment is outsourced to partner companies and contractors when needed.
Our cement products are mainly supplied to building materials companies. Raw materials and products are transported by both group and non- group companies (for more on their activities, see pages 4-5). Our group operates cement production sites in Japan, the U.S., China, Vietnam, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.
By closely communicating with the governments in the regions and countries where we operate we ensure that we observe their laws and strive to meet their needs and requests.

Safety of Our Business Partners at Production Sites
GRI-403-1, 3
Many of our operations at cement production
and mining sites are mechanized. However, some operations require manual work at height or in
high temperatures, and ensuring safety of workers at our production sites is a prerequisite to our
stable business performance. In an effort to prevent employees of contractors working at our sites from becoming involved in any accidents, we request that they go through safety training, submit a safety plan and reflect our instructive feedback in advance.
Antimonopoly Law Compliance Manual
鼓E-learning Programs
To ensure that all employees understand compliance
across our supply chain and act accordingly,
we conduct monthly tests as part of e-learning programs to provide education on the Standard of Conduct Casebook and the Antimonopoly Law Compliance Manual for all company employees, including those on loan to group companies or others. The monthly tests that began in FY2019 always contain one question concerning anti- bribery.
Looking ahead, we will continue to provide e-learning education.

Taiheiyo Cement Health & Safety Policy
Our Occupational Health and Safety Policy is shown below. Under this policy, our headquarters and business sites review and implement yearly management policies on health and safety.
Taiheiyo Cement Health and Safety Policy
We are aware that the health and safety of our employees is part of the foundation of our company, and we effectively implement the following policy by devoting sufficient management resources to prevent work-related accidents and diseases in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health Act and the Mine Safety Act.
❶ Promote health and safety activities through cooperation between management and labor, with the aim of eliminating work-related accidents.
We established the Companywide Occupational Health & Safety Committee, chaired by the officer in charge of safety, as a Specialized Committee under
the CSR Management Committee and reporting to
the Board of Directors and reporting to the Board of Directors which oversees the system. The Companywide Occupational Health & Safety Committee oversees promotion activities at all business sites and also collects safety-related data from group companies as well as the company itself, and provides guidance.
All plants, quarries and branches have a Health &
Safety Committee consisting of representatives from
both management and labor to promote the activities at
each business sites. We manage health and safety at our
cement plants and quarries at home and abroad using
the OSHMS*.
*Occupational Safety and Health Management System: A framework that allows organizations to reduce potential dangers at workplaces and promote comfortable worksites by voluntarily practicing continuous, uninterrupted health and safety management as prescribed in the guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 1999.
Occupational Health & Safety System
     Basic Policy
❷ Ensure the health and safety of our employees and those of our affiliates by complying with health and safety-related laws and regulations, the health and safety management regulations created by us, and health and safety regulations created by our business sites.

❸ Strive to improve the level of safety and health by actively promoting the implementation and operation of an Occupational Safety and Health Management System, and by continually ensuring the true safety of our equipment, providing education and training, and raising awareness
   Companywide Health & Safety Committee (chaired by the officer in charge of safety)
    ❹ Continually improve the working environment and work methods through the company-wide and business site Health & Safety Committees, by applying technological progress and utilizing new knowledge and information about health and safety.
鼓Safety Operation Officer Certification System Since FY2008 we have been using the Safety Operation Officer System which emphasizes the importance of improving leadership capabilities and therefore only certifies those who complete qualification seminars held at plants as leaders (safety operation officers) of working groups. To further improve the capabilities of these leaders we imposed a stricter requirement for the qualification seminars starting in FY2016, restricting participants to those who have completed the foreman training course stipulated in the Industrial Safety and Health Act.
鼓Health and Safety Training Program
To ensure employee safety at work we conduct health and safety training in accordance with the
❺ Ensure health and safety throughout the Taiheiyo Cement Group by advancing programs to eliminate work-related accidents under the leadership of the company-wide, business site, group company and affiliate Health & Safety Committees.

鼓Report and Database of Work-related Accidents Regardless of severity, any work-related accident is reported to the Companywide Occupational Health
& Safety Committee immediately after it occurs. We promptly post the details of any accident on the group bulletin board in an effort toward avoiding recurrence.
We have maintained a work-related accident database since FY2009 to help avoid the recurrence of accidents. It contains information about accidents involving employees of the company and group companies as well as all employees of partner companies including temporary workers. It is also used to store information on identified accident causes and response reports, including measures taken in response to unsafe actions and equipment with respect to the “4 Ms” (men, machines, methods and management). Information on the database is translated into English and Chinese so that it can be understood by those at overseas business sites.

the Taiheiyo Cement Group and (b) promoting ongoing safety activities at cement plants and by
the industry; (2) implementing concrete actions to reduce accidents; (3) the speedy dissemination of information following an accident; (4) the horizontal rollout of countermeasures taken by the accident site; (5) prevention of occurrence or recurrence of serious work-related accidents at specific business sites and affiliates; and (6) checks on countermeasures taken in response to an accident.
As a result we attained our objective of zero fatalities in FY2020 following FY2019. We also achieved our objective of 30 or fewer lost-time injuries for the first time since the company's foundation and lost-time ratio of 0.580%. However, we fell short of meeting the work-related accident objective with 94. While we have sought to prevent serious accidents as a key activity, there was a serious accident in FY2020 involving human contact with heavy machinery. In response we are promoting thorough no entry and separation of pedestrians and vehicles to prevent contact between heavy machinery and people. The number of accidents at overseas group companies declined as a result of implementing the same safety policy and system used in Japan.
Reviewing accidents by type, we found that a large number of accidents involved being caught by and dragged into equipment, or falling, and we are now focused on preventing their recurrence. Among work- related health hazards, the number of incidents of heatstroke increased more than four-fold compared to the average for previous years with 15 cases reported, and so prevention of heatstroke has emerged as a key challenge.

鼓Hands-on Safety Training
To develop each employee’s sense of safety we
have promoted hands-on safety training during which employees experience simulated dangers that could happen in daily operations. In FY2019 we introduced hands-on safety training equipment for them to experience simulated dangers related to heights, rotating equipment, electricity and objects hanging from a crane. Furthermore, we introduced virtual reality equipment in each cement plant for quickly training young or inexperienced employees and also provide the equipment to partner and group companies upon request.

鼓Promoting Safety Activities at Group Companies The Companywide Occupational Health & Safety
Committee supports safety activities at group companies. We started conducting safety surveys
in FY2019 and in FY2020 we conducted a survey covering the group’s ten business sites in Japan and five sites overseas. We seek to raise safety standards by visiting the sites in order to hear about safety activities, conduct facility inspections and directly share information. Moreover, we are working to improve safety practices by, for example, having group companies conduct safety patrols together.

(General Affairs Department)
A cartoon book titled Secret of Cement by Gakken Plus Co., Ltd. was published in March 2020 as part of a series of cartoon books under the name “Let’s Learn with Cartoons.” The goal of the series is to explain about subjects in various fields using cartoons so children can readily understand them. The series is distributed to elementary schools, public libraries and children’s halls, and is used
as supplementary material for classes and for other proposes. In producing the book the company and its group companies cooperated extensively, and also invited the writer to its plants and laboratories where he was provided with useful reference materials. This facilitated the publication of a book that explains
the cement industry in an easy-
to-understand way. We received
many comments from schools that
received it, such as in reference to
learning the difference between
cement and concrete, having
technical content explained in an
easy-to-understand manner using
cartoons and learning new things
about something we see every day.
▪Participating in the “Riko-challe” Program (Fujiwara Plant) The Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics Challenge (Riko-challe) program is led

▪Recycling Disaster Waste as Raw Materials (Chugoku Branch) The Chugoku branch provided its former premises as a
temporary storage yard for disaster waste caused by the West Japan Flood in July 2018. It transported some of the soil, approximately 31,500 tonnes, generated in Kure City, Hiroshima Prefecture, during the period between June 2019 and April 2020 to the Ofunato plant, the Oita plant and the Itoigawa plant of Myojo Cement Co., Ltd. by sea, where it was recycled as raw materials.
   The branch implemented this initiative in close cooperation with COCCO Co., Ltd., an industrial waste treatment operator in the affected area, and REMATEC Holdings Corporation, headquartered in Kishiwada City, Osaka Prefecture,
who have extensive
experience in treating
disaster waste for
reconstruction and other
operations for the Great
East Japan Earthquake.
鼓Maintaining the Agreement for Use of Matsuzaki Company-managed Housing as an Evacuation Center for Tsukumi City Residents (Oita Plant)
The area surrounding the Matsuzaki company- managed housing of the Oita plant lies near
the bank of the Aoe River, a location that can be exposed to seawater forced upstream in the event of a tsunami. An evacuation is therefore required when a significant earthquake occurs. The evacuation center, however, is over a kilometer away from the area, raising concerns that small children and the elderly may be evacuated too late.
We therefore recommended that the Tsukumi City government use the common areas on and above the 4th floor of the six-story Matsuzaki company-managed housing as a temporary evacuation center. We concluded the agreement on its use for this purpose in July 2011.
    These took place at the Oita plant in 2017 and the Central Research Laboratory in 2018. Another was held this year at the Fujiwara plant. The students were given a tour of the cement
plant and limestone
quarry, and then met our
female engineers to ask
questions and talk about
club activities and career
selection.
Fortunately, the housing space has not yet been needed. We will continue to offer it to local residents as an evacuation center in the event of an emergency.

  Third-party Opinion
GRI102-44
Takeshi Mizuguchi
Professor, Faculty of Economics, Takasaki City University of Economics
COVID-19 highlighted the significance of social issues in ESG. The direct challenges companies must address are focused on countermeasures for preventing employees from contracting the disease and protecting their operations from the deteriorating economic conditions. Given the continued focus on creating a healthy and safe workplace as a CSR activity, while I trust you have taken sufficient measures to address those challenges, I believe it would have been good to cover them in the report. Also, the fact that there are some who could not afford
to take action against the infectious disease shines light on the problem of economic inequality. Your company fully understands the concept of an “inclusive economy,” as is shown in regard to your supply chain as partners.
I encourage further development of this philosophy and communication of your commitment as a global enterprise to address economic inequality as a material social issue.
The concept of a “green recovery” has been advocated across the world to link efforts to recover from COVD-19 by establishing this type of economy. Specifically, the European Commission has started
to implement aspects of the Green Deal Program it announced in December 2019, which will accelerate the shift toward a green economy.
Your company has been proactive in this regard, such as by formulating the Long-term Vision of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction toward 2050 and announcing support for the recommendations of the TCFD last year. Another major step forward was making public the results
Response to
Third-party Opinion Managing Executive Officer, Vice-Chairperson of the CSR Management Committee
of the scenario analysis based on the recommendations of the TCFD. I highly value the ambitious vision of targeting an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions in cement production by 2050. Responding as a third party, however, I wondered why the base year is 2000, or 20 years ago. That said, what counts is the level of a reduction rather than the base year. I recommend obtaining an objective evaluation at the global level through, for instance, Science Based Targets (SBT).
The Special Feature section reported on efforts in biomass and waste heat power generation. That report made me realize your strong commitment to addressing the issue of climate change. The use of palm kernel
shell (PKS) is somewhat controversial. While PKS is an effective use of waste generated by squeezing palm for oil production, you do not face the conflict of generating power from burning palm oil, which is also used as food. Moreover, importing PKS from Indonesia and Malaysia raises the other issues of whether the renewable fuel can be used in those countries and of CO2 emissions during its transport to Japan. I recommend discussing this with an environmental NGO that has broad knowledge in the field. The use of domestically produced biomass should also be explored.
The concept of a circular economy will also play a central role in the green economy as well as zero carbon. “Recycling waste and by-products into alternative raw materials and fuels for cement” such as the Ecocement system, is a commendable initiative that contributes to both zero carbon and a circular economy. However, duly pointed out in the scenario analysis based on the TCFD, the volume of coal ash produced at coal-fired power plants will decline in the future, and so I expect you will consider alternative measures. The Materials Recovery Complex initiative, presented in the Environmental Business section, is attractive for creating a circular economy. I look forward to its early commercialization.
The explanation of the assessment of biodiversity at the limestone quarries is very clear and easy to understand. In order to improve the reliability of this assessment,
I suggest having it evaluated by an international environmental NGO that specializes in the field.
you point out that we have our CO2
emissions reduction target evaluated
at a global level and explore the use
of domestically produced biomass.
You also suggest that we disclose
our efforts to address social issues as
part of ESG in connection with the
spread of COVID-19, and we will sincerely respond to these recommendations.
As for this report, we will continue improving the content so that it can be more easily read and understood by all of our stakeholders.
  Hideaki Asakura
   I am grateful to Mr. Mizuguchi for his valuable comments
on the Taiheiyo Cement Report 2020. We are honored by
your strong recognition of the formulation of our Long-term Vision of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction toward 2050 and published results of the scenario analysis based on the recommendations of the TCFD as an effort to contribute to the shift toward a green economy. Given the growing importance of a circular economy, we are encouraged that you highly value the vital role the cement industry plays in recycling waste and by-products into alternative raw materials and fuels for cement, and we look forward to the early realization of our original Materials Recovery Complex initiative. On the other hand,

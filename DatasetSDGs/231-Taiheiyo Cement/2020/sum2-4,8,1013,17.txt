Basic Policy for Promoting CSR Management
GRI102-16
We promote CSR management in accordance with our CSR guidelines which specify actions that are essential for realizing the Mission of the Taiheiyo Cement Group and implementation of our Business Principles. The guidelines direct the company in conducting activities in and outside of the business that fulfill our social responsibility while we pursue sustainable growth for both the company and society as a whole. Moreover, they lay down basic policies for promoting CSR management.

GRI102-18, 19, 20, 21, 28, 29, 30, 32
To promote our CSR management we have created a cross-departmental CSR Management Committee, chaired by the president with all board directors and all managing executive officers as members, under the direct oversight of the Board of Directors.
The CSR Management Committee’s role is
to screen CSR action plans and other material
items, and review their progress. Reporting to this committee are seven specialized committees for individual CSR subjects, each chaired by the director responsible for that area. The department most closely associated with any given issue acts as the secretariat for the related committee.

In addition, the
GCCA launched a
research network called
Innovandi in 2020 and
is expanding research worldwide on sustainable concrete and cement, which are characterized by low CO2, as well as the separation and recovery of CO2. We have also participated in Innovandi since its establishment.
The challenges that the GCCA and Innovandi are working on are recognized as one of our management issues and we are making efforts to take action.
鼓The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
As a core member of
the WBCSD Cement
Sustainability Initiative
(CSI) since 2000, we
have been engaged in international activities for sustainable development. Even after the activities of CSI have been succeeded to the GCCA, we continue to work as a WBCSD member and exchange the latest information on ESG with member companies from a broader perspective.
In addition, we dispatch one person every year to the WBCSD Leadership Program. So far we have dispatched eight people thereby contributing to the development of global human resources.
鼓Participation in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo
We participate in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo. Established in November 1979, the federation now consists of 123 companies (representing about 1.5 million employees as of July 2020), most of which are headquartered in Tokyo. Under its basic philosophy of voluntary management and full participation, the federation endeavors to resolve the issue known as Dowa, a discrimination issue in Japan, and other human rights issues.
  We provide CSR education through training programs for each position, including sessions
for newly hired employees, follow-up courses for second-year employees, career development (around ten years after joining the company)
and training for newly appointed managers. For education on specific issues such as human rights, each specialized committee provides the relevant training programs. We also conduct executive- level CSR training once a year, including for group companies. Moreover, in order to enhance their understanding of the 2019 CSR Report, we created and distributed a report summary.

鼓Global Cement and Concrete Association The Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) was founded
in 2018 as a CEO led initiative for
the industry. As a founding member
company Taiheiyo Cement is the
sole Japanese cement and concrete manufacturer participating in the initiative. The association succeeded the activities of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI), a sector project of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD),
in January 2019. Under the strategic partnership,
the GCCA collaborates with the WBCSD toward sustainable development.
The GCCA established six working groups
to develop various guidelines on the themes of responding to climate change, a long-term roadmap for CO2 reduction, low-carbon concrete, biodiversity, and health and safety. Through the GCCA we are working on building a sustainable society by setting and disclosing CO2 emission reduction targets for each member company.

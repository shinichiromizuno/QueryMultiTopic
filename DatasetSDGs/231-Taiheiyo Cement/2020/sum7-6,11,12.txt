鼓Water Contamination
Most of the water discharged from our plants to
public waterways is cooling water and not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. At our cement plants all water resources are reused as circulation water to minimize the impact of water discharge into public waterways. Also, we are working to prevent the leakage of potential pollutants by installing bunds around our oil tanks and acid/alkali tanks. Moreover, we are installing sedimentation tanks, water-oil separation tanks,
oil film detectors, pH meters and suspended solid sensors on water discharge routes that connect to public waterways.

    鼓Air Pollution
Air pollutants generated from cement production are primarily NOx, SOx and dust in combustion gases emitted from cement kilns. To ensure the proper management of these substances we remain committed to reducing air pollutant emissions through measures such as continuously monitoring emission concentrations, improving NOx reduction systems and installing bag filter equipment to capture dust emissions. With such measures we focus on controlling the emission of air pollutants with the goal of maintaining FY2011 emission levels.
Emissions of NOx and dust in FY2020 were lower than in FY2011, whereas emissions of SOx were higher than in FY2011 (base year) because
we accepted waste with high sulfur content. Nonetheless, the level of SOx emissions was very low compared to the limit set under the Air Pollution Control Act.

鼓Soil Contamination
In FY2001 Taiheiyo Cement evaluated the risks
associated with cement plants that may be sited
on contaminated ground by appointing an expert consultant to undertake a soil history survey. We are continuing to conduct drilling surveys, starting with the higher-risk locations, to verify whether or not the soil is contaminated. Actions have been taken as necessary based on the findings.
We are also working to eliminate the possibility of soil contamination by preventing the leakage of wastewater from scrapyards and fluid from oil tanks, acid/alkali tanks, pipes and so forth.

鼓Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) The PRTR Law requires that we report on equipment
installed at our Kumagaya plant for the washing
of municipal waste incineration ash. This washing process uses water, and our total discharge of dioxins and ferric chloride into public waterways are as follows.

  鼓Initiatives at Plants and Quarries
Our cement plants and quarries reduce the amount
of waste handled by disposal contractors by reusing waste from operations as material for cement production. We also endeavor to reduce the volume of waste to landfill through recycling made possible using chromium-free kiln bricks.

Service stations reduce the waste handled by waste
disposal contractors by returning any residual cement that remains in silos after switching the cement products. Returned cement is recycled and used as raw material.
In FY2020 the recycling rate was 77.9%, up 12.2% from the previous fiscal year.

鼓Management of PCB Waste
We properly store and dispose of high and low concentrations of PCB waste in accordance with
the “Amendment to the Law concerning Special Measures for Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Wastes“ (revised in 2016).
For high-concentration PCB waste with an early disposal deadline as stipulated by law, we signed a processing contract with the Japan Environmental Safety Corporation (JESCO) in 2006 and have prioritized processing.
In FY2020 capacitors stored in the Saitama plant and our Chubu Hokuriku branch, as well as pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored in the Oita, Fujiwara, Kumagaya and former Chichibu plants, were processed.
In FY2021 pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored in the Fujiwara plant and the former Kawara, Tosa and Osaka plants as well as the Chichibu quarry and a packaging site are scheduled for processing.

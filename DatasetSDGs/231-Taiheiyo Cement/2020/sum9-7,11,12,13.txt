       鼓 External Economic Benefits Derived from the Recycled-Waste-to-Cement System
Taiheiyo Cement uses the external economic benefit (EEB) evaluation method to express, in monetary terms, its evaluation of socioeconomic benefits
from environmental impact reduction due to the increase in recycling of wastes accepted from
outside the company. As a type of deemed benefit, an EEB of 91.2 billion yen was identified for FY2020, representing a 13% increase on the previous year as a result of an increase in the total amount of waste and by-products used.

    About Taiheiyo Cement’s External Economic Benefit Evaluation
   • Taiheiyo has developed a unique evaluation method to estimate the contribution to overall environmental benefit to society by utilizing waste materials from other industries.
• We use information, including data collected for the GCCA Cement CO2 Protocol, to calculate the reduction in consumption of fossil energy and natural resources
associated with the use of waste and by-products.
• EEBs are calculated by multiplying the reduced volumes of CO2, crude oil, natural resources and waste (resulting from the utilization of waste and by-products in the
cement production process compared to cement production without using waste and by-products) by market prices for each of the four items. The prices, assumed to be kept constant at year 2000 levels, are estimated as follows: CO2: 3,000 yen/t (a hypothetical CO2 emission tax rate); crude oil: import price; natural resources: estimated price; waste: controlled landfill cost in the Tokyo area.
• A portion of the EEB, such as the waste treatment fee, is accounted for in Taiheiyo’s profit and loss statement.
 Environmental Accounting for One of Our Projects
A clinker cooler uses air to cool clinker, an intermediate product of cement that is burned at a high temperature of 1,450°C in a rotary kiln. The hot air generated by heat exchange during the cooling process is effectively used as combustion air for the rotary kiln.
The clinker cooler introduced for the No. 5 kiln at the Oita plant in FY2020 is a new type of cooler that only requires a small amount of air and is significantly more efficient in heat recovery than conventional units. Requiring less heat energy for clinker burning, the new cooler will further reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impact.
Investment: Reduction in CO2 emissions: Approximately 740 million yen 12,313 tonnes/year

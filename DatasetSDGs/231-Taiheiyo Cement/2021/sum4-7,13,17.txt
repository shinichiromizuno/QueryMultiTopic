Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Achievement of Our CSR Objectives for 2025
 GRI102-11, 302-3, 305-1, 2, 4, 5
Among the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our domestic group companies (excluding power generation companies) that are reporting their greenhouse gas emissions by business segment in accordance with the Act on Promotion
of Global Warming Countermeasures, about 95%
of greenhouse gas emissions were generated from cement production companies in FY2017.* Roughly 5% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were associated with our service stations, headquarters, branches
and shipping, as well as electricity purchased by the group. Our Scope 3 emissions, calculated according to categories 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the WBCSD/CSI Scope 3 guidelines, were roughly 4% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of our group companies are directly associated with cement production. We have therefore set in the CSR Objectives for 2025 a medium to long-term quantitative target of reducing specific net CO2 emissions by 10% or more from FY2001 levels.
* Most of our overseas group companies are cement production companies, 683 679 so the ratio of cement production companies in our overall CO2 emissions 675
fromproduction is higher than it would be for domestic companies alone.

Efforts Related to the Cement Production Process
 GRI302-1, 3, 4, 305-4, 5
A significant amount of CO2 is generated during cement production. This is because the production process requires a high temperature of 1,450°C and limestone, used as a raw material, is decarbonated through a chemical reaction during the calcination process (CaCO3  CaO + CO2). About 35% of CO2 emissions generated during cement production are from the consumption of energy, about 55% are from the calcination of raw materials, and about 10% are from electricity use. In order to reduce CO2 emissions we have been working to conserve energy by installing energy-efficient equipment and improving the stability and efficiency of our kiln operations.
We have also been implementing measures such as expanded use of waste- and biomass-derived energy sources to decrease our rate of use of fossil fuels. We are also moving toward using recycled resources with less carbonate content to lower CO2 emissions from the calcination of limestone. We are moving forward with the adoption of waste heat power generation to reduce CO2 from electric power.
Our specific net CO2 emissions for FY2021 were 675 kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious product, the same as in FY2020.

Reducing CO2 Emissions during Transportation
 GRI305-3
We contract the delivery of our raw materials and products to transportation companies and are striving to reduce CO2 emissions as a specified consigner designated under the Japanese Energy Saving Act. Major efforts include implementing a plan to transport goods on return trips, encouraging drivers to eco-drive, and promoting energy efficient devices such as digital tachometers and eco-tires on vehicles. In shipping,
we continue to pursue energy efficiency technologies and operate new ships that are equipped with various energy-saving features. We are also supporting energy- saving operations for conventionally powered ships.
Our FY2021 CO2 emissions were roughly 8% lower than in FY2020 thanks to energy efficiency initiatives and a decrease in shipping volume.

Waste Heat Power Generation
Waste heat power generation associated with the group’s cement production was 430 GWh in FY2021, a roughly 53GWh decrease on FY2020. Its ratio to all electricity consumed at our cement plants was about 12.5%. Assuming an emission factor of 0.69 t-CO2/ MWh if we were to purchase electric power from an external source, this works out as a reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 297 thousand tonnes.

Alternative Energy Resources and Alternative Raw Materials
In FY2021, non-fossil energy and biomass energy accounted for about 14.2% of all energy used for group kilns. A decrease in CO2 emissions of about 9.5kg-CO2/t-clinker was also achieved by using alternative raw materials instead of limestone. Assuming an emission factor of 0.096 kg-CO2/MJ for coal, our use of alternative energy resources alternative raw materials works out as a reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 1.47 million tonnes.

Air Pollution
Air pollutants generated from cement production are primarily NOx, SOx and dust in combustion
gases emitted from cement kilns. To ensure the proper management of these substances we strive
to reduce air pollutant emissions through measures such as installing equipment to continuously monitor emission concentrations, improving NOx reduction systems and installing bag filter equipment to capture dust emissions. Our target in this is to maintain our FY2011 emissions levels.
In FY2021, emissions of NOx, SOx and dust were
all lower than the figures for FY2011, our benchmark year. Furthermore, the level of SOx emissions was very low compared to the limit set under the Air Pollution Control Act.

Water Contamination
Most of the water discharged from our plants to public waters is cooling water and not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. At our cement plants all water resources are reused as circulation water to minimize the impact of water discharge into public waters. Moreover, we are installing sedimentation tanks, water-oil separation tanks, oil film detectors, pH meters and suspended solid sensors on water discharge routes that connect to public waters.

Reducing Waste
 GRI306-2
Initiatives at Plants and Quarries
Our cement plants and quarries reduce the amount of waste handled by disposal contractors by reusing waste from operations as material for cement production. We also endeavor to reduce waste that ultimately ends up in a landfill via measures such as the use of chromium-free kiln bricks.

Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR)
The PRTR Law requires that we report on equipment installed at our Kumagaya plant for the washing of municipal waste incineration ash. This washing process uses water, and our total discharge of dioxins and ferric chloride into public waterways are as shown below.

We properly store and dispose of high and low concentrations of PCB waste in accordance with the Amendment to the Law concerning Special Measures for Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Wastes (revised in 2016), hereinafter referred to as the PCB Special Measures Law.
For high-concentration PCB waste with an early disposal deadline as stipulated by the PCB Special Measures Law, we signed a processing contract with the Japan Environmental Safety Corporation (JESCO) in 2006 and have prioritized processing.
Pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored at the Ofunato Plant, Fujiwara Plant and the former Kawara, Tosa and Osaka plants, as well as at the Chichibu quarry and branch office service stations, were processed in FY2021. Transformers and capacitors containing high- concentration PCB in the Kyushu, Chugoku and Shikoku area were processed before March 31, 2018. However, we have confirmed that two unprocessed capacitors still remain in that area. We have submitted a report
to the prefectural governor about the two capacitors, and they are being stored appropriately until the local government decides on the disposal method for equipment that has passed its deadline for processing.
Pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored at the Ofunato Plant, Kumagaya Plant, Saitama Plant and Chubu Hokuriku Branch service stations are scheduled for processing in FY2022.

Service stations (SS) reduce the waste handled by waste disposal contractors by returning any residual cement that remains in silos after switching the cement products. Returned cement is recycled as raw material. In FY2021, the recycling rate was 80.3%, up 2.4% from the previous fiscal year.

  Water Risk Analysis
conducted using the Water Risk Filter*, the average score for the total basin risk for all our plants (weighted average taking into account the cement production volume) was 2.6. The highest total basin risk score was 3.5, and the average score was 0.2 lower than that of the previous year. The volume of cement produced at the plant in question accounted for about 13% of the production volume of all the plants. However, when we analyzed conditions at that plant, no urgent issues were identified.
* A water risk mapping tool developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It is used to evaluate business impacts related to water scarcity, flooding, drought, seasonal variation, physical water quality risks, regulatory risks, etc. The maximum score is 5.0, and the higher the score, the greater the risk.
Water Consumption
the cooling of production equipment, exhaust gas and in-house power generators. Therefore, the water discharged from the plants is mostly cooling water, which is not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. Our plants near the ocean use seawater to cool in-house power generation equipment. All the fresh water used at the plants is circulated and reused, except for the household wastewater, as we strive to reduce our water withdrawal and lessen the impact of wastewater on bodies of water.

 Our total withdrawal of fresh water in FY2021 was about 27.19 million m3 and our total withdrawal of seawater about 150 million m3. The seawater was used to cool in-house power generation equipment at our plants near the ocean and then released back into the sea after use. The amount of fresh water discharged was approximately 13.45 million m3, meaning that about 13.75 million m3 of fresh water was used at the plants. However, most of this water is not used as a raw material and evaporates after being used to cool equipment or gas.
• We have developed a unique evaluation method to estimate the contribution to overall environmental benefit to society by utilizing waste materials from other
  In FY2021 our fresh water withdrawal to produce 1 tonne of cement was 0.832 m3 (withdrawal per unit of production). There was no great change in our water consumption efficiency.

CalPortland Company has constructed a system for the sustainable use of water at its Rocky Canyon Aggregate Plant in California, USA. This system has improved the collection and storage of rainwater and spring water at the site. Developing these water resources has made it possible to secure a supply of the water it needs in its work, without having to build new wells or increase the volume of ground water it extracts, and also to keep the amount of water that drains out of the site to a bare minimum. (There are strict regulations with regard to water that drains out of a site.)

industries.
We use information, including data collected for the GCCA Cement CO2 Protocol, to calculate the reduction in consumption of fossil energy and natural resources associated with the use of waste and by-products.
Economic benefits are calculated by multiplying reductions in consumption (effects of environmental conservation) by set market prices.
The market values of the inventory items are set at FY2001 levels, and are estimated on the basis of the following considerations.
CO2: 3,000 yen/t (a hypothetical CO2 emission tax rate). Crude oil: import price. Natural resources: estimated price. Waste: controlled landfill costs in the Tokyo area. A portion of the EEB is accounted for in our profit and loss statement.
Environmental Accounting for One of Our Projects
Installation of a Hydrated Raw Material Mixing System at
the Fujiwara Plant No. 5 Kiln  GRI201-2
In order to boost the rotary kiln firing efficiency, standard raw materials for cement are dried, pulverized and homogenized in a raw mill. In recent years the amount of substitutes used for natural resources is increasing, and some of those recycled resources have a strong odor like hydrated sludge and cannot be processed in a raw mill. This makes it necessary to feed them directly into a rotary kiln to decompose

any malodorous components.
The hydrated raw material mixing system installed at the Fujiwara Plant
Investment: Approx. Reduction in CO2 emissions: 340 million yen 2,388 tonnes/year
 No. 5 Kiln in FY2021 was jointly developed by Taiheiyo Cement and Taiheiyo Engineering Corporation. It is a new type of mixing system that separates high-temperature raw materials inside the preheater and premixes them before they are fed into the rotary kiln, thereby dramatically boosting drying and firing efficiency. The new mixing system will lead to less thermal energy being required for clinker burning, and is intended to further reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impact.

Zero Waste from Cement Production
Basically, secondary waste is not generated since we use flammable waste as a substitute for fossil energy, and combustion waste is utilized as a raw material for cement.
Since cement is fired at a temperature of 1,450°C, hazardous chemicals generated during the production process, such such as dioxins and fluorocarbons are decomposed and detoxified.

Utilization
Contributions to infrastructure
As stated in The Value of Cement on pages 10 and 11, cement is used for various purposes to create safe and stable infrastructure that improves people’s daily lives, makes economic activities more convenient, and protects communities from natural disasters.

Limestone 100% sourced in Japan
Limestone is the only mineral resource in which Japan is self-sufficient. Japanese limestone contains high- quality calcium carbonate and has become the source of a stable cement supply.
Ratios of Japan’s self-sufficiency in other mineral resources
- Liquefied natural gas: 2.4%
- Crude oil: 0.3%
- Iron ore: 0%
Production
Utilization of Waste and By- products
In our cement production we make efficient use of blast furnace slag from steel mills and thermal power plants, coal ash, industrial waste such as plastic and oil from various industries, ash from incinerated municipal waste, and disaster waste generated by natural disasters as recycled materials for cement. We utilize 402.7 kg of waste and by-products to produce one tonne of cement.
Transportation
Comprehensive Transportation Network
We possess 9 cement plants, over 100 service stations, and 36 cement tankers in Japan, and provide a stable supply of our products via our robust manufacturing, transportation and supply chain infrastructure.Water withdrawal

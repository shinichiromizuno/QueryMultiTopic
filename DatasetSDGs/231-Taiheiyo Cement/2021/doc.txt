Message from Top Management
 Aiming to continue our growth and become an outstanding
leading company
 Our mission is not merely to achieve financial growth, but to also develop business activities that are environmentally sound and make a positive contribution to society. Adhering to that mission, we aim to become a leading company in the Pacific Rim based around our cement business in Japan and our mineral resources, environmental and construction materials businesses.
In addition to expanding our businesses globally, we have contributed to the preservation of the global environment and the creation of a recycling-based society via the special characteristics of our cement plants that make it possible to process and recycle large amounts of waste and by-products, and by maximizing the recycling technologies we have cultivated over the years.
We are currently moving forward with various strategies in the three steps of the 17 Medium-Term Management Plan, 20 Medium-Term Management
Plan and 23 Medium-Term Management Plan in order to achieve our stated future vision and direction of becoming an enterprise group capable of providing a sense of safety and security to communities in the Pacific Rim by the mid-2020s. As a result of the initiatives in the first two aforementioned medium-term management plans to boost corporate value and establish a solid business foundation, I believe we were able to build an earnings foundation capable of maintaining operating income of 60 billion yen despite the unprecedented business environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which even delayed the holding of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
The 23 Medium-Term Management Plan is the final
step towards achieving rapid progress, and I also see this as a period in which not just Taiheiyo Cement but the Japanese cement industry as a whole will be required
to display business boldness and a determination to survive and commit to effective initiatives aimed at sustainable growth. In that business environment, the Taiheiyo Cement Group will contribute to the creation of a sustainable society, and lay solid groundwork for our next growth stage.
Results of Our Performance in FY 2021
In addition to achieving operating income of more than 60 billion yen for eight terms in a row, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the achievement of our 20 Medium-Term Management Plan goals regarding growth investment, the further strengthening of our financial structure, and shareholder returns
In FY2021, factors such as the increase in COVID-19 infections around the world and the declaration of a state of emergency in Japan had a direct impact on sales of cement, concrete and building materials due to reduced demand for construction and project delays. As a result, FY2021 saw the lowest domestic demand for cement
in 54 years. In addition, economic activities in general slowed down and there was also extensive stagnation
in corporate activities, including in industries which
have close links with our Mineral Resources Business
and Environmental Business, such as the steel, paper and power industries. Overseas, some of the regions in which we operate were subject to lockdowns due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., however,

Message from Top Management
 demand for housing increased due to factors such as lower interest rates on housing loans and the increase
in telecommuting. As a result, cement and ready-mixed concrete performed well in terms of sales volume and price. Under these business circumstances the group’s net sales for FY 2021 declined from the previous fiscal year to 863.9 billion yen. However, operating income for FY 2021 increased to 63.6 billion yen.
Furthermore, in FY2021 which was the final year of the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan, we worked on establishing a solid business foundation while maintaining a balance with investing for continued business growth, strengthening our financial structure and enhancing shareholder returns.
Even though there were only limited opportunities to visit and negotiate, we were able to decide on appropriately timed investments for growth, including
a capital and business alliance with a state-run group of cement companies in Indonesia and renovation
of production lines at our cement plant in Cebu, Philippines.
We had set a net debt/equity ratio (DER) of 0.5 times or less as a guideline for the strengthening of our financial structure, but were able to surpass it by the end of FY2020, one year earlier than planned. The net DER at the end of FY2021 had improved to less than 0.4 times.
With regard to shareholder returns, we continued steady dividend payments of 60 yen per share during the three years of the plan (in FY2019 an additional commemorative dividend meant that the dividend payment per share was 80 yen.) In addition, we purchased 15 billion yen of treasury shares to achieve a total return ratio of around 30% for the period of the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan.
Unfortunately, given the aforementioned business environment, we were unable to achieve the operating income on net sales and ROA we had set as management targets. In particular, issues still remain with regard to reinforcing the earnings foundation
of our domestic business. We identify this as a key management challenge that the Taiheiyo Cement Group will continue to tackle under the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan.
Outline of the Medium-Term Management Plan
Establish a business foundation with long-term stability, and aim to become an outstanding leading company
With regard to the business circumstances surrounding the Taiheiyo Cement Group, there are fears the downturn in demand for cement may continue for a certain period given the considerable impact of the growing momentum for CO2 reductions, and also depending on when the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end. In addition to the issue of the aging workforce
on construction sites, the labor shortage is intensifying in the construction and logistics industries since the lengthy impact of the COVID-19 pandemic means that overseas workers cannot re-enter the country. If there are further delays to projects there is the possibility that the recovery of demand for cement will also be delayed.
On the other hand, given that climate change is becoming increasingly obvious in recent years, and
it seems that every year major disasters occur, the government has announced a policy of building national resilience by actively promoting measures to prevent or mitigate damage from natural disasters. In Japan we anticipate that the current steady demand for cement will continue for a while due to factors such as redevelopment projects in urban areas, and the fact that construction work related to the Linear Chuo Shinkansen (maglev) is expected to start in earnest. Given that business environment we expect demand to fluctuate by around 40 million tons over the next decade or so.
Bearing in mind that anticipated demand, the Taiheiyo Cement Group has formulated the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan covering the three-year period
from FY2022 to FY2024 based on our philosophy of contributing to the creation of safe and stable social infrastructure by continuing to provide essential products and technical services for the development
EBITDA 145 billion yen or more Net debt/equity ratio (DER) Around 0.4 times Net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA 1.5 or less
We plan to generate a cash flow of 330 billion yen over the three-year period of the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan by means of our cash flow, capital gains and so on, and, in principle, carry out new investment aimed at sustainable growth and implement shareholder returns while maintaining a net DER ratio of around 0.4 times.
Aiming to achieve carbon neutrality via sustainable growth investments
We plan to implement 280 billion yen of capital expenditure and investment and financing over three years, of which 120 billion yen will be allocated to growth investments. In addition, with the aim of strengthening the business foundation that supports our sustainable growth, we plan to prioritize the following themes: maintaining growth investment; implementing initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality; enhancing
our plants, mines and quarries; and restructuring
our businesses in Japan. Amongst these themes, we recognize that the achievement of carbon neutrality plays a central role in our growth strategies, since establishing technologies for net zero CO2 emissions
is one of the most important challenges for the future
of the cement industry, where CO2 emissions from raw materials are unavoidable.
We published the Framework for Our Long-term Vision of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction toward 2050 in March 2020. The goals stated in it were,
in addition to an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions
in cement production, to contribute to reductions equivalent to 20% of CO2 emissions throughout the cement value chain by 2050. However, in response to the carbon neutrality policy announced by the Japanese government in October 2020, we have revised the wording of that goal to “we aim to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the supply chain by 2050.”
 of social infrastructure and for projects to prevent or mitigate damage from natural disasters, and maximizing our corporate value. Under the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan we will aim to construct a business model unique to us, where all businesses in our group function together comprehensively and integrally, with the aim of becoming an outstanding leading company. Our business targets for FY2024, the final year of the plan, are an operating income on net sales of 11% or more, and an ROE of 10% or more. We have adopted the following indicators as guidelines for achieving those targets.
Net sales
Operating income
 750 billion yen or more 85 billion yen or more

Message from Top Management
 In order to achieve carbon neutrality, in addition
to applying and developing existing technologies, it
is essential that we develop innovative technologies
and raise them to a level where they are practical and viable. We have set up the Carbon-Neutral Technology Development Project Team as a lateral in-house organization responsible for promoting the development of such innovative technologies. With the project team playing a core role, we will aim to establish at an early stage technologies that can feasibly be implemented by society, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
Aiming for sustainable growth by strengthening corporate governance, promoting diversity and creating a safety oriented culture
In addition to boosting our earnings capacity, we need to strengthen corporate governance, promote workplace diversity and create a safety oriented culture in order that the Taiheiyo Cement Group can achieve sustainable growth.
Recognizing that strengthening corporate governance is essential to boost our corporate value and fulfill our responsibilities to all our stakeholders, as a trusted company we will work even harder to maintain sound management.
Based on our awareness that respect for human rights and diversity are formative principles of a sustainable society, we will engage in various initiatives, such as promoting women’s participation and advancement
in the workplace, and adopting measures designed
to attract diversity in our recruitment and offer a good work-life balance. We are striving to create employee- friendly workplaces where each employee can achieve professional growth. For example, we have set a ratio
of at least 30% female recruits for jobs that have no geographical restrictions as our target in promoting women’s participation and advancement in the workplace. Furthermore, in addition to aiming to create a suitable human resource portfolio with at least a 10% ratio of female employees, we are promoting an initiative
aiming to increase the ratio of newly appointed female managers to at least 10%. Moreover, we engage in business activities based upon respect for human rights, and this includes our supply chains.
We consider the health and safety of our employees to be the foundation on which our company exists.
We aim to eliminate work-related accidents and create comfortable workplace environments, and constantly engage in systematic health and safety activities. To be more specific, the Taiheiyo Cement Health and Safety Policy sets a target of zero work-related accidents, we have established our Companywide Health & Safety Committee chaired by the officer in charge of safety, and we are strengthening action at all our business sites and group companies that start with ensuring compliance with our safety rules. We are improving our OSHMS*, which was launched in 2002 and has been being rolled out to our cement plants, mines and quarries in Japan since 2003. Going forward, we will continue with our aim of creating a safety oriented culture.
* OSHMS:
Occupational Safety and Health Management System: A framework for reducing potential dangers at workplaces and promoting comfortable work sites by autonomously practicing continuous, uninterrupted health and safety management. Prescribed in the guidelines of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
A Message to Our Stakeholders
The future envisioned by Taiheiyo Cement
Our business is based on cement. We have continued to grow while emphasizing the cement business and pursuing the potential of cement and concrete. We
also contribute to the resolution of various social issues by providing environmentally sound products and working to create a recycling-based society. Securing a stable long-term source of limestone the raw material of cement, could be said to be a matter of life or death for Taiheiyo Cement, as we continue to achieve sustainable growth and contribute to society. We have already secured reserves in Japan of limestone equivalent to the
total production volume of cement over the next 100 years. Going forward, we will continue with initiatives to enhance our plant facilities, mines and quarries, and will establish a system capable of ensuring a long-term stable supply of cement.
With regard to our overseas cement business, we
will expand our business portfolio via steps such as our capital and business partnership with a state-run group of cement companies in Indonesia and renovation
of production lines at our cement plant in Cebu, Philippines, strengthen our global logistics network, and strive to boost our market presence. At our business sites in each region we will deploy the advanced technologies we have nurtured in our Environmental and Mineral
Resources businesses in Japan, and will aim to contribute to the development of local communities and to further boost our corporate value.
In addition to contributing to environmental conservation, resource recycling and measures against climate change via our business activities, we will strive to resolve transnational social issues by helping to create a sustainable society. This includes contributing to the protection of human rights and conservation of water resources and biodiversity, which are among the globally shared goals of the SDGs. We appreciate your kind understanding of our activities, and your expectations for our future growth.

History of the Taiheiyo Cement Group
Taiheiyo Cement Corporation was founded in October 1998 through the merger of Chichibu Onoda Cement Corporation and Nihon Cement Co., Ltd., both of which had operated for over 100 years. The Taiheiyo Cement Group continues to support infrastructure development by supplying high quality cement and construction materials and applying advanced technologies at nine cement plants in Japan and eight in the Pacific Rim region, including in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia. We will continue to strive to create a sustainable society by demonstrating the group’s overall capabilities.
Commitment to Environmental Issues
In 2006 we formulated the Taiheiyo Cement Environmental Management Policy, which identified an active commitment to environmental issues as a key management challenge. Then in 2007 we launched the Taiheiyo Brand Cement and Concrete Project and began taking action to boost the value of the group’s technological strengths and solutions.
A Period of Economic Downturn, Earthquakes and Adversity
The group marked its 10th anniversary amid a serious economic downturn in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.
We then carried out business restructuring for the group in 2010. While the Ofunato Plant and eight of our service stations in the Tohoku region were out of action due to the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, our financial structure was bolstered by
an increase in capital and we were able to navigate a way through this adversity.
Making Progress by Fully Deploying Our Capabilities
We formulated our 23 Medium-Term Management Plan as the third step toward realizing our future vision and direction targeting the mid-2020s. All businesses
in our group will function together comprehensively and integrally as we aim to become an outstanding leading company.
Nascent Period of Cement Production in Japan
In 1873 the government constructed a cement production works in Fukagawa, Tokyo. Two years later the works successfully produced and launched sales of domestic cement comparable in quality to foreign products. Following this, Onoda Cement Co., Ltd., Asano Cement Co., Ltd. (predecessor of Nihon Cement Co., Ltd.) and Chichibu Cement Co., Ltd. were founded and underpinned the modernization of Japan.
Launch of Taiheiyo Cement
Taiheiyo Cement Corporation was founded in 1998 via the merger of Chichibu Onoda Cement Corporation and Nihon Cement Co., Ltd. The company has supplied cement for various national construction projects in Japan. In 2000 we completed the construction of the Nghi Son Cement Corporation plant in Vietnam, and then in 2003 made Taiheiyo Cement Philippines, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary, further expanding the group’s global network.

 GRI102-4, 6, 7, 8, 45
The Taiheiyo Cement Group deploys production and logistics sites in Japan and overseas, and establishes systems to ensure stable supplies of cement and mineral products. In addition to that, we utilize our world-leading environmental cement production technologies to contribute to the creation of a recycling-based society and countermeasures to mitigate climate change.
Taiheiyo Cement Group Profile
1 Stable supply of cement and mineral resource products
A new site came into operation in the spring of 2021 at Ofunato Quarry in Iwate Prefecture. Our Oita Plant has made plans to develop new quarries in Tsukumi City and Usuki City. The planned sites, covering a total of 206 hectares, are expected to secure a hundred years’ worth of limestone. Development work will begin in FY2022, and the plan is that they will start to be used in tandem with our existing quarries in FY2030. This development work is included in our planned investment of 100 billion yen. In Southeast Asia, we are moving forward with business expansion and the creation of the optimum logistics network, and are striving to provide
a stable supply of cement and mineral resource products
by reconstructing our logistics network covering the entire Pacific Rim area to include our new bases in Indonesia.

Initiatives Aimed at Achieving Carbon Neutrality
Marshalling All Our Wisdom and Aiming to Achieve Carbon Neutrality
In response to the policy announced by the Japanese government, the Taiheiyo Cement Group’s long-term vision for reducing CO2 emissions has been revised to “aim to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our supply chain by 2050.” In our long-term vision, we plan to utilize the following three scenarios to achieve reductions in CO2 emissions: apply existing technologies, advance existing technologies, and develop innovative technologies. The Carbon-Neutral Technology Development Project Team was set up in April this year with the aim of intensifying and accelerating initiatives.
It is a lateral in-house organization that marshals all the wisdom of our company. Around 30 members, including people holding additional posts, are currently working mainly on the development of innovative technologies.
The 23 Medium-Term Management Plan identifies initiatives aimed at carbon neutrality as the Taiheiyo Cement Group’s key strategies. We are scheduled toinvest20billionyeninthemduringtheperiod covered by the plan, which is part of the 100 billion yen we will invest over a ten-year period. As of this fiscal year, we have introduced ICP (internal carbon pricing) to accelerate capital investment in low carbon technologies by including the economic effects of reduced CO2 emissions in our investment index. The ICP value will initially be set as the current market value (1,500 yen/CO2 t) in J-Credit but will be periodically

reviewed.
Of the CO2 emitted during the cement production
process, roughly 60% comes from the raw materials and 40% from the energy used. We plan to halve the energy- derived CO2 via steps such as installing energy-efficient equipment and increasing the volume of waste plastic processed. We are developing technologies regarding raw material-derived CO2, such as greater use of admixtures and the introduction of low-carbon clinker. However, since carbon neutrality cannot be achieved by applying and expanding existing technologies alone, it is imperative to develop innovative technologies such as carbon recycling, where CO2 is separated from the cement kiln exhaust gas, captured and used efficiently.
With regard to our research and development of innovative technologies, after successfully capturing 20 kg per day of high purity CO2 at our Fujiwara Plant using the amine method, since 2020 we have been working on Development of Carbon Circulation Technology
for the Cement Industry, a Taiheiyo Cement project
that has been adopted by NEDO (the New Energy and Industrial Development Organization). In this project
we are installing equipment at our Kumagaya Plant
to capture 10 tonnes of CO2 per day, 500 times more than the Fujiwara Plant prototype, and are developing optimal CO2 separation and capture technologies. It is currently still under construction but a demonstration run is expected to start soon. With regard to carbon recycling technology, we are developing technologies to sequester CO2 as carbonate in demolished
concrete and concrete sludge, which are then used as construction materials such as raw material for cement or subbase pavement material. We are also carrying
out R&D into CO2 sequestration during the production of ready-mixed concrete and the curing of concrete products. These CO2 sequestration technologies are getting the expected results in lab experiments and
we will move on to demonstration tests using full-scale equipment in the near future.
An average size cement plant emits a few thousand tonnes of CO2 per day, but CO2 only makes up around 20% of the exhaust gas. This makes it necessary to process five times that amount of exhaust gas in order to capture all the CO2, and that requires proportionately large-scale equipment which would be difficult to install at existing plants. Accordingly, we have also started R&D on the essential task of making that equipment more compact and less expensive. In addition to
CO2 sequestration technologies we are looking at technologies capable of creating low-cost synthetic methane but, since this would be difficult for the cement industry alone to do, we are also concentrating on technological development in collaboration with other industries that may lead to the efficient creation of energy sources.
The NSP kiln developed in Japan is currently the standard type around the world. Similarly, we are aiming to be a world leader in the carbon neutrality field as well, and to create technologies that become the global standard.
In our Development of Carbon Circulation Technology for the Cement Industry project, funded by NEDO (the New Energy and Industrial Development Organization), we
are installing a pilot plant with a capacity of
10 tonnes per day at the Kumagaya Plant to separate and capture CO2 emitted during
the cement production process. With the cooperation of group companies located near the plant we will demonstrate technologies
to cause the captured CO2 to react with demolished concrete, concrete sludge and ready-mixed concrete, which will then be reused as construction materials such as raw material for cement or subbase pavement material. The scheduled NEDO demonstration period is until FY2022, but we plan to continue with additional tests for a few years after that and compile the various kinds of expertise gained from the project.
We are aiming to increase the amount of combustible waste, such as plastic waste, used as an alternative source of energy so that we can reduce the CO2 emissions generated during cement calcination. We used a thermohydrodynamic computer simulation to design a burner so that combustible waste
can be efficiently combusted. The kiln burner has now been installed at the Saitama Plant and we are checking combustion, optimizing operations and running various tests, such as on the concrete quality obtained. We plan to make maximum use of combustible waste to reduce CO2 emissions by adopting this kiln burner and the expertise we have gained at other plants.
We are working on the development of innovative cement production processes that enable efficient capture of raw material-derived CO2 generated by limestone calcination, which is recognized to be an unavoidable part of cement manufacturing. Since most of the raw material-derived CO2 is generated in the calciner, making this a CO2 capturing calciner willenabletheefficientcaptureofhighconcentrationsof energy-derived CO2 during the calcination process as well
as the raw material-derived CO2. Being able to capture high concentrations of CO2 directly makes it possible to use more compact equipment than that of CO2 capture technologies such as chemical methods. This production process combines the high thermal efficiency of the suspension preheater with even greater waste treatment capacity, and inherits the advantages of existing NSP kilns.

23 Medium-Term Management Plan
Aiming to Maximize Our Corporate Value and Become an Outstanding Leading Company
The 23 Medium-Term Management Plan is the third step toward realizing our future vision and direction targeting the mid-2020s. Even though domestic demand for cement fell below 50 million tonnes in FY2010, and since then has hovered in the 40 million tonnes range, the Taiheiyo Cement Group has achieved operating income of more than 60 billion yen for eight consecutive fiscal periods. I believe this is due to the business restructuring we carried out in FY2011, and to the growth investment continued under our medium- term management plans since then. Under the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan our fundamental policy is to construct a business model unique to us, where all businesses in our group function together comprehensively and integrally so that we become
Management Targets
Capital productivity is a management challenge. Although we have made the return on assets (ROA) a management target in our medium-term management plans, our ROA at the end of FY2021 was 6.3%, meaning we did not achieve our target of 8% or more. In the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan we have adopted
an ROE (return on equity) of 10% or more as a new management target to clarify our target of maximizing corporate value. I believe that it is absolutely essential
to achieve operating income of 85 billion yen or more if we are to attain that target. With no end to the COVID-19 pandemic in sight, with the harsh business environment expected to continue and with domestic demand for cement hovering at around 40 million tonnes, we will try once more for the profit targets set in the 20 Medium Term Management Plan and attain them by steadily implementing the strategies of the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan.
Investment Strategy and Shareholder Returns
We expect to generate funds of 330 billion yen (3- year cumulative total) with assignment of assets added to our cash flow from operating activities. Of that, a
total of 280 billion yen is scheduled to be allocated to investment aimed at sustainable growth, with 160 billion yen allocated to strengthening our business foundation and 120 billion to growth investments. Meanwhile, we will distribute shareholder returns with a total return ratio of around 33% (one third of the net profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders) as our benchmark. We will also continue to work on improving our financial soundness and will maintain a net DER of around 0.4 times.
Key Strategies in Medium to Long-term Investment
In order to strengthen the business foundation
that supports our sustainable growth, we have set key strategies concerning medium to long-term investment with a focus on the business environment during the decade from FY2022 to FY2031, which also includes the period of the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan.

In addition to continuing with growth investment in overseas M&As and domestic development of new products, we plan to invest a total of 300 billion yen (100 billion yen each) in the following three areas: 1) Initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality. 2) Strengthening plant facilities. 3) Strengthening mines and quarries. Shifts in the global attitude towards climate change and in social conditions hold tremendous significance for the cement industry around the world, and it will inevitably have to engage with initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality. As
a leading company in the Japanese cement industry
we will spearhead the development of technologies
to achieve carbon neutrality. At the same time, we
are investing considerable funds and manpower in strengthening our plant facilities and limestone quarries with the aim of securing stable long-term production. Such initiatives, undertaken at a time when society and the business environment are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes, show a strong determination to strive for sustainable growth and to become an outstanding leading company with our cement business playing the core role.
Human Resource Development
We will also focus on human resource development since, even if we strengthen our facilities, plants and quarries, how well they function depends on the human resources engaged. In particular, we plan to provide the younger generation with opportunities where
they can gain plenty of experience of thinking things through and making their own decisions. Major projects such as the development of an integrated plant and
the establishment of logistics facilities will begin in the Philippines and Indonesia during the period of the 23 Medium Term Management Plan. We will be proactive in deploying the younger generation there as I believe that such projects are opportunities for the Taiheiyo Cement Group to transmit our technologies.

Cement Business (Japan)
 Strengthening the Foundations of Our Stable Supply System Is a Top Priority Whilst Promoting Further Efficiency
Our Cement Business in Japan has built a solid foundation for manufacturing, transportation and supply, and has successfully created a stable supply of cement. Currently, it is difficult to
assume that public investments such as in national resilience will provide any supporting effect to domestic cement demand and, furthermore, COVID-19 has badly impacted the performance of railway companies and other major infrastructure investors resulting in the postponement of these companies' capital expenditure on infrastructure. Given this business environment we will continue to make strengthening the foundations of our stable supply system a top priority, and will strive for further cost reductions and to optimize our sales system. In addition, the Cement Business Department, Mineral Resources Business Department and Environmental Business Department are creating a sales system where we can

Aiming to become an outstanding leading company
With “Aiming to become an outstanding leading company” as our slogan, we aim to utilize flexible thinking and bold action to reconstruct our cement business in Japan. In addition to carrying out enhancements of our plants, mines and quarries with the next hundred years in view, we will focus our sales strategies on the four pillars of the previous medium-term management plan: sales, ready-mixed concrete, concrete products, and the securing of more large-project orders. Also, in addition to utilizing AI to create an optimal logistics system for land
and marine transport, our Sales and Production departments are jointly engaged in finding ways to improve labor productivity using AI and
the IoT, and we will also promote the development and expansion of technologies for reducing environmental impact and CO2. Furthermore, along with enhancing our plant facilities, we plan to strengthen our technical sales activities to expand applications and sales of cement- based soil stabilizer which is positioned as a growth field, with expansion of our lineup of products for specific soils such as peat.

• Seek efficient transportation
*Since we have adopted the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Standard No. 29) etc. from FY2022, the net sales in the FY2024 plan show the amount after adoption of the new standard. (The adoption of the new standard has a downside impact of -185 billion yen.)
Although the impact of events such as the suspension of construction
work due to COVID-19 was only temporary, the continued declarations of
a state of emergency led to labor shortages on construction sites, slowing down their progress and causing longer construction periods. In addition, with no prospect of demand from inbound tourism, there is less investment
in tourism and transportation. Domestic demand for cement dipped below
40 million tonnes for the first time since FY1967, reaching its lowest point in 54 years at 38.67 million tonnes. Including consignment sales, the Taiheiyo Cement Group sold 13.78 million tonnes of cement in Japan (a 4.8% decrease on the preceding fiscal year). Due to that business environment we recorded net sales of 406.2 billion yen (a 8.9 billion yen decrease on the previous fiscal year) and operating income of 16.2 billion yen (a 400 million yen decrease
on the previous fiscal year) since, even though energy costs were lower, the decrease in sales volume had a huge impact.
Under those business circumstances we completed the replacement of the EP (Electrostatic Precipitator) with bag filters at Oita Plant Kiln No. 4, and our group company Myojo Cement Co., Ltd. has expanded its fuel supply equipment for the kiln burner to increase waste plastic utilization.

The mission of a cement production site is to provide its customers with a
stable supply of safe and reliable products. Towards this mission we strive to
create robust systems to manage safety, quality and the environment, and to boost customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the market environment of the cement industry
is undergoing huge changes as humanity aims to achieve carbon neutrality, and
we will swiftly implement strategies to reduce CO2 and decrease our environmental impact. Given the aging of facilities, we continuously focus on enhancing facilities with not only including replacement of principal equipment, but also employing AI and IoT for automatic operation and modernization of equipment maintenance. We will build firm and capable “people” simultaneously with solid plant facilities for our sustainable development.

We have also decided to renovate production lines at Taiheiyo Cement Philippines, Inc. Demand for cement is expected to continue to grow, and we intend to meet that demand, and also to make huge improvements in energy efficiency by utilizing cutting- edge technologies.
We will continue our active commitment to business expansion in Southeast Asia and the reduction of our environmental impact.
   Construction Materials businesses overseas • Implement thorough cost cuts
*The adoption as of FY2022 of the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Standard No. 29) etc. has had no impact on the net sales in the FY2024 plan.
In the USA, although the construction industry was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, projects that were deemed to be essential were allowed to continue, and there was also strong demand for housing. As a result, the volume of cement sales and cement prices were both higher than in the previous fiscal year. In China sales volume decreased due to the impact of bad weather and the suspension
of construction work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and also to factors such
as the transfer of Qinhuangdao Asano Cement Co., Ltd. equity interests. In Vietnam sales volume was up on the previous fiscal year, despite the impact of competition with other companies. In the Philippines sales volume decreased as a result of the suspension of construction work due to the impact of COVID-19 travel restrictions. As a result of all that, we posted net sales of 214.8 billion yen (an increase of 1.5 billion yen on the previous fiscal year) and operating income of 25.1 billion yen (an increase of 5.2 billion yen on the previous fiscal year).
Given those business circumstances, in the Philippines construction of the belt conveyor between the wharf and our plant is almost complete, and we have enhanced our capacity to transport imported raw materials etc. In addition, we decided on a capital and business alliance with the SI Group in Indonesia and work to renovate production lines in the Philippines as growth investment under the 20 Medium-Term Management Plan.

Business Strategies
Mineral Resources Business
 Establishing Our Earnings Foundation via Mine and Quarry Development with the Next 100 Years in View
In addition to selling limestone as a raw material for cement and aggregates for ready-mixed concrete, the Mineral Resources Business sells mineral products to a wide range of industries, including the construction, civil engineering, steel and chemical industries. The natural resources that form our business base are mainly extracted from our own mines and quarries, but factors such as environmental regulations make it harder each year to develop mines and quarries. Given the circumstances, we are developing mines and quarries with a medium- to long-term perspective, for example by devising a plan to invest 100 billion yen in enhancing mines and quarries during the ten-year period that includes the 23 Medium- Term Management Plan. In addition, we aim to make optimal use of those precious natural resources by supplying them for the optimum purpose, depending on the quality and characteristics of each mine or quarry,
and by enhancing our transport system. Meanwhile, our geo-solutions business will contribute to the creation of a recycling-based society via the appropriate treatment of construction soil and surplus soil, and we aim to expand sales of heavy metal immobilizer, which makes it possible to treat contaminated soil on construction sites. Furthermore, our mineral expertise is made fully manifest in our functional materials business, where we are developing versatile products that accurately respond to customer needs and which we aim to commercialize before very long.

We plan to develop the Yato area, a new site at Shin-Tsukumi Quarry, to ensure a long-term supply of limestone products on into the future. The development will match the characteristics of the mining zone, and we will switch to a production system that is based around limestone products for cement and aggregate. Production and shipment of limestone for steelmaking will be transferred to
other quarries in the group and we will take steps to optimize our production structure, for example by installing a new aggregate classification plant at Shin-Tsukumi Quarry. Of the aggregate produced by that plant, we plan to sell the fine aggregate in coastal areas of
the Greater Tokyo Area, and to create a stable supply system by constructing a new shipment yard in Sodegaura, Chiba Prefecture.
Commercialization of our functional hollow particles
Hollow particles have been applied as a material that make things lighter or more adiabatic, due to their balloon-like structure with an internal cavity.
We have developed CellSpheres, which have an average
diameter of 5μm or less, which means they are a tenth of the size of conventional hollow particles. They also have a 70% higher hollowness ratio, making them the ideal material to meet the lightness and insulation needs of products such as painting materials, which have shifted to thin film in recent years, and plastic products, which have become increasingly compact. In addition, we will develop products with better dielectric characteristics and heat-resisting properties, while maintaining the high hollowness ratio, and will grow materials that contribute to the development of areas such as 5G and 6G high- speed communication technologies into a future core business.

*Since we have adopted the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Standard No. 29) etc. from FY2022, the net sales in the FY2024 plan show the amount after adoption of the new standard. (The adoption of the new standard has a downside impact of -4 billion yen.)
In our aggregates business, sales of limestone aggregate for ready-mixed concrete for high-rise buildings declined due to redevelopment projects in urban areas being delayed by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Limestone for steel, the mainstay of our mineral products business, saw a decline in sales due
to decreased volumes of crude steel in Japan and overseas. Our geo-solutions business ran sales promotions for our heavy metal immobilizer for highway construction projects but, due to factors such as the impact of construction site cave-ins, sales remained at the same level as last year. As a result of all that, we posted net sales of 75.7 billion yen (a decrease of 4.3 billion yen on the previous fiscal year) and operating income of 6 billion yen (a decrease of 1.1 billion yen on the previous fiscal year).
Under those business circumstances, we have finished the development work on Horoshiyama (Sumita Town, Iwate Prefecture), a new mining area for Ofunato Quarry, and completed the environmental assessments for the Yato area of Shin- Tsukumi Quarry (Tsukumi City and Usuki City, Oita Prefecture), which will be the next source of raw materials for the Oita Plant. We also successfully developed Nanolitia, our lithium-ion battery cathode material.

Business Strategies
Environmental Business
 Aiming to Maximize Our Waste Treatment Business and Establish a New Model for Recycling Resources
Our core business is recycling waste and by-products
generated at thermal power stations, steelmakers and chemicals manufacturers, as well as recycling things such as municipal waste, incineration ash and sewage sludge at the request of municipalities. For this, we leverage the diverse environmental technologies the company has cultivated in our cement production. In recent years we have also been focusing on growth in the aquatics business
via products such as water purification materials as a way to create and promote a recycling-based society. Meanwhile, global action to reduce greenhouse gases is accelerating. The Environmental Business is working on expanding the use of alternative energies with the aim of achieving our long-term vision and carbon neutrality. We also aim to establish a new resource recycling model with the cement industry at its core, a model that includes measures such as the recycling of lithium-ion batteries, the establishment
of low-temperature embrittlement technologies and the recovery of precious metals from municipal waste incineration ash and separation of phosphorus.

Corporate activities in general stagnated due to the impact of COVID-19, which meant that less waste and by-products were generated. This stagnation
led to a reduced demand for electricity which, combined with the acceleration of global action to reduce greenhouse gases, led to reduced operation of coal-fired power plants. This meant that, in addition to a drop in the availability of coal ash, sales of calcium carbonate for scrubbing systems at power stations declined, as did the trade in FGD gypsum. As a result of all that, we posted net sales of 78 billion yen (a decrease of 6.3 billion yen on the previous fiscal year) and operating income of 6.4 billion yen (a decrease of 1.2 billion yen on the previous fiscal year).
Under those business circumstances, we installed equipment at group company Tsuruga Cement Co., Ltd. and launched our lithium-ion battery recycling business. In addition to engaging in the regional treatment of disaster waste when group company Myojo Cement Co., Ltd. accepted wood waste generated in the Kuma River drainage basin in Kumamoto prefecture due to
the torrential rains of July 2020, we have concluded comprehensive partnership agreements with Hokkaido and Saitama prefectures with regard to the creation of a recycling-based society.
3. Implement large-scale initiatives and create new business models
• Expand sales of biomass fuel, and discuss strengthening alliances with other companies and M&As
Due to their wide use in electric vehicles etc., the amount of waste lithium-ion batteries is expected to increase in the near future. We therefore jointly established a technology that leverages cement production processes to recycle large sized lithium-ion batteries with Matsuda Sangyo Co., Ltd., and installed equipment at group company Tsuruga Cement Co., Ltd. that began treating the waste batteries in April 2020. This technology enables us to make lithium-ion batteries harmless safely and efficiently. Furthermore, total recycling is possible since, in this treatment, the lithium-ion batteries are dismantled, pulverized and sorted through, with useful metals such as rare metals being recycled, and all the residue being reused as raw material for cement production.

Scrapped electrical appliances and the residue after useful metals have been recovered from scrapped cars (ASR, Automobile Shredder Residue) are a kind of waste that is difficult to treat since plastics are entangled with metals that were unable to be separated out. However, in 2021 group company DC launches a business treating waste such as ASR using low-temperature embrittlement technology we have developed.
Low-temperature embrittlement is used to heat the plastics in the ASR and make them more brittle so that it is easy to separate the plastics from the metals. The separated metals are recycled, and the plastics used as fuel for cement production, thereby contributing to the recycling of resources.

In addition to offering basic features of dry spraying such as a thicker sprayed layer, longer feed hoses and no need for mixing equipment, this method utilizes a special nozzle to spray mortar to which an agent to reduce dust has been added, thereby greatly reducing the generation of dust during spraying work that has been a dry spraying issue. All ingredients other than water are contained in the dry mortar powder. Furthermore,
the use of polymer powder to enhance the properties of the mortar means that we have no longer any need to measure liquid polymer and no waste container is generated. In addition, this mortar can be applied using the plastering method, so it is possible to use it even in small-scale work.
Reducing Life Cycle Costs: the Hyper Road System
TAIHEIYO PRECAST CONCRETE INDUSTRY Co., Ltd. sells the Hyper Road System, which inhibits pavement deterioration such as ruts and reduces the frequency of repair work. Commonly, 80 mm-thick paving blocks are used for pavement for vehicles. This system applies 100 mm-thick blocks and special sand that makes it harder for fine particles to be generated by friction between the joint sand and the paving sand. This has boosted load transfer performance and at the same time inhibited the decline in bearing capacity that is a consequence of sand being washed out by water penetration. This means that a level surface can be maintained over a long period of time, even in areas traveled by special large vehicles. This product has been applied for construction in container yards at a number of ports, including the Port of Osaka, and remains in good condition even after five years.

• Strengthen initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of
*Since we have adopted the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Standard No. 29) etc. from FY2022, the net sales in the FY2024 plan show the amount after adoption of the new standard. (The adoption of the new standard has a downside impact of -10 billion yen.)
The Construction Materials Business has been impacted by construction
work delays and postponements, and sluggish private investment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and sales of autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC) panels and other construction materials have declined. Ground improvement projects have also decreased due to factors such as temporary suspension of construction work under the direct control of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. As a result of all that, we posted net sales of 73 billion yen (a decrease of 8.3 billion yen on the previous fiscal year) and operating income of 3.5 billion yen (a decrease of 900 million yen on the previous fiscal year).
Under those business circumstances the group is tackling capital investment and the development of new construction methods to save labor at construction and manufacturing sites as a priority issue. For example, Taiheiyo Materials Corporation has developed Early Cleat, an input system for anti-washout underwater concrete additive that automates the underwater anti-washout additive agitator. This input system has been registered in NETIS (New Technology Information System).

Research and Development places an emphasis on contributing to the resolution of various social issues, and on drafting and implementing R&D strategies to contribute to the group’s sustainable growth.
In particular, we recognize that society is aiming for carbon neutrality; accepting that demand and aiming to establish innovative technologies that will be implemented in society to achieve that is a top priority challenge that will impact the future of the cement industry. We therefore position it as a very important growth strategy. We will also seek to further refine our infrastructure technologies so that we can maintain and develop “Taiheiyo quality” while responding
to the changes in various business environments,
and can supply high-quality products and advanced solutions. Contributing to the creation of circular economies is another important role we play, and further enhancing our technologies for utilizing recycled resources is a key challenge. We also position the following as key future-oriented challenges: the enhancement of innovative technologies that will
lead to new generation of profits, the boosting of productivity via AI and the IoT, and the development of labor-saving technologies.
We aim to promote those five key strategies and
develop outstanding R&D capabilities to contribute
to society and sustainable growth. While doing so we will also promote the training of global resources who will play an active role in Japan and overseas, and develop organic collaborations and operations for our organization, so that our technological capabilities can support the group’s aim of “becoming an outstanding leading company.”

 Nanolitia, cathode material for lithium-ion batteries
 We have successfully developed basic production technologies for calcium carbonate concrete that is hardened using CO2, water and used concrete. As a member of the NEDO Moonshot Research & Development Program (project manager: Professor Takafumi Noguchi, The University of Tokyo) we are responsible
for the development of materials. Going forward, we aim to promote the establishment of industrial production methods and create innovative carbon-neutral construction materials.

Sample of the calcium carbonate concrete under development
Rock debris generated during tunnel excavation sometimes contains hexavalent selenium (Se6+), which is water-soluble and occasionally harmful. Taiheiyo Cement is moving forward with the development of a new technology to immobilize selenium that will reduce and remove harmfulness of hexavalent selenium (Se6+) using microorganisms that
exist in rock debris. If detoxification becomes possible, it is expected to prevent ground water contamination and make the rock debris a recyclable resource that can be used as a material for civil engineering works such as embankments.
This is a labor-saving technology for the inspection of external walls. The suspended inspection robot traverses the external wall to carry out a tapping test. This system also helps to cut costs and contribute to operational safety since it does not require the use of suspended work platforms or scaffolding. We will contribute to the creation of a safe and secure society by promoting external wall diagnostic check projects using this system.
1. Tappers strike the external wall and the percussive sounds are automatically collected
Nanolitia is a cathode material for lithium- ion batteries that does not use rare cobalt as a raw material. It is expected to offer better thermostability and reliability than existing cathode materials, which contain nickel and cobalt. A demonstration plant with annual capacity of 100 tonnes is under construction at Central Research Laboratory. It will be completed and commence operation during FY2022, and will move forward with action aimed at commercialization.
In recent years we have been focusing in particular on activities involving intellectual property solutions, and are working on IP Landscape, which performs panoramic analysis and assessment combining perspectives such as intellectual property data and business information. We collaborate with R&D and business divisions, and supply information that contributes to new R&D developments and new business creation via the analysis of patent information and market data.

Messages from Outside Directors
Expectations of Further Dissemination of Information on Topics Such
as Trailblazing Initiatives on
Social Issues and Transparent Governance Structures
Outside directors Yoshiko Koizumi, Shinhachiro Emori and Hideyuki Furikado spoke about their recommendations and expectations of our governance system and ESG management based on their respective experience in corporate legal affairs as a lawyer, in business management, and at the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Service Agency.
Strengthen Governance via Constructive Dialog with Group Companies
The company has maximized the technologies it has cultivated in its cement production, created a recycling-based business model, and established its profitability. I applaud how, in addition to that, the company has committed to a policy of investing a total of 300 billion yen over the next decade, which includes the three years covered by the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan. This will consist of 100 billion yen investments in, respectively, the achievement of carbon neutrality, the strengthening of plant facilities, and the development of mines
and quarries. I also applaud how it has made clear to stakeholders its corporate stance of aiming to become an outstanding leading company, and revealed the specifics of the group’s sustainable management policies. Governance systems are at the heart of sustainable management, and I can see that robust and detailed structures and organizations have been constructed that are based on expertise amassed over more than a century of corporate activities. However, the Taiheiyo Cement Group is composed of many subsidiaries in Japan and overseas, and I feel that there are more opportunities to improve cooperation between the Internal Auditing Department at Headquarters and each business division overseeing group companies with regard to the governance system within the group and
  Business Will Be Driven Over the Next 100
Years by Sustainability Which Has Become
Part of the Company’s DNA
The Standards of Conduct (Casebook) is distributed to all Taiheiyo Cement employees, and we are working consistently to fulfill the commitment made in the 2015 edition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40-70% by 2050. This fiscal year is the first of the 23 Medium- Term Management Plan, which makes initiatives aimed at carbon neutrality one of its key strategies. The commitment to a strategy of investing
100 billion yen over the next decade, which includes the three years covered by the 23 Medium-Term Management Plan, clearly demonstrates a corporate stance ahead of global trends. The decision to establish
a project team under the direct control of the vice president to drive
this strategy shows how determined the company is to achieve carbon neutrality. I highly rate Taiheiyo Cement’s corporate activities, which are based on a sense of responsibility and awareness of being a leading company in Japan’s cement business, and intend to make such excellent initiatives more widely known amongst stakeholders and in society at large. With regard to diversity, the company is moving forward with medium and long-term plans to develop excellent human resources at its overseas bases. In my opinion, slightly more progressive strategies for the utilization of human resources are required for the company to develop globally, such as the promotion to executive positions of personnel from overseas group companies. The group is targeting sustainable growth and is making systematic investments aimed at developing mines and quarries and strengthening plant facilities with the next 100 years in view. I can sense that sustainability has become so firmly rooted in the company that it should be considered part of its DNA. I will do my best to contribute to TCC's strategy for sustainable growth by using my experience as an international lawyer to offer beneficial recommendations with regard to overcoming and providing solutions to any obstacles that may arise in this corporate culture as the company aims for further globalization.
the thorough enforcement of compliance. Although I worked for a chemical manufacturer, where the business structure was different from that of a cement manufacturer and in an industry which expected different functions of group companies, I do have experience as a representative of both the head company and its group companies. Based on that experience, I believe that group unity which leads to further growth can be created not only by regular audits and group round table discussions, but also by opportunities for constructive discussions where the top management at headquarters and group companies can express themselves freely about the management policies and various business challenges of each group company. I will make the most of the experience I have obtained so far to offer recommendations aimed at strengthening governance in the management of the group.
 Shinhachiro Emori
Improve Information Disclosure to Various Stakeholders
Outside Director
 The Taiheiyo Cement Group is the leading company in the Japanese cement industry, with a history stretching back more than 100 years. I can see the strong management determination to boost transparency and governance displayed
in such steps as the thorough provision of information in advance of its Board of Directors meetings so that outside directors can fully leverage their individual expertise, and can sense how that determination pervades company-wide activities. It is also a global enterprise which has eight production sites in the Pacific Rim region and where employees of many different nationalities flourish, and I can sense the strong interest it arouses in domestic and overseas investors etc. In recent years, stakeholders such as investors have been paying attention to not just financial data but also non-financial data such as details about initiatives such as ESG and SDGs that are linked with a company’s sustainable growth,
 and about the results of such initiatives. The company is engaged in ambitious corporate activities in this field, such as initiatives aimed at carbon neutrality, and I think it should strive to disclose more information based on those activities.
So far, I have designed and enforced various systems mainly in monetary policy. Recently there has been engagement in constructive dialogue between business enterprises and shareholders based on the Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code. I was deeply involved in the policy making aimed at creating such connections and dialogue. Going forward, I hope to make such expertise fully manifest in the business world and make recommendations aimed at more appropriate information disclosure. I intend also to boost the medium and long-term corporate value of the company by leveraging my experience in establishing governance-related legal systems for financial institutions and the like, and strengthening the company’s group governance.

Corporate Framework for CSR
The Taiheiyo Cement Group Mission was formulated in 2002 as the highest level concept and guiding principle of our business activities. Our Business Principles present more detailed guidelines for action based on the Mission. The vision and direction targeting the mid-2020s have been established as our vision for the future, based on the
Mission. They present the group’s values and orientation in qualitative terms.

                Business Strategies
Basic Policy for Promoting CSR Management
We promote CSR management in accordance
with our CSR guidelines, which specify actions that are essential for realizing the Mission of the Taiheiyo Cement Group, and implementing our Business Principles. The guidelines steer the company as we conduct activities in and outside of our businesses that fulfill our social responsibility while pursuing sustainable growth for both the company and society as a whole. Moreover, they lay down basic policies for promoting CSR management.
The System to Promote CSR Management
To promote our CSR management we have created a cross-departmental CSR Management Committee, chaired by the president with all board directors and all managing executive officers as members, under the direct oversight of the Board of Directors. The CSR Management Committee’s role is to screen CSR action plans and other important matters, and review their progress. Reporting to this committee are seven specialized committees for individual CSR subjects, each chaired by the director responsible for that

Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA)
  The Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) was established in 2018. As a founding member,
Taiheiyo Cement is the sole Japanese cement and concrete manufacturer participating in its activities. The
GCCA inherited the activities of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI), a sector project of the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), in January 2019 and collaborates with the WBCSD
in initiatives aimed at sustainable development. The GCCA has established six working groups to develop
various guidelines on such themes as responses to climate change, a long-term roadmap for CO2 reduction, low-carbon concrete, biodiversity, and health and safety. We are working to build a sustainable society via such GCAA initiatives, for example by setting and disclosing CO2 emission reduction targets for each member company.
  In addition, the GCCA launched a research network called Innovandi in 2020 and is expanding research worldwide into sustainable concrete and cement, which are characterized by low CO2, as well as into the separation and recovery of CO2. We have participated in Innovandi since its establishment. We recognize the challenges that the GCCA and Innovandi are working on as one of our management issues and strive to engage with them.
The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
   As a core member of the WBCSD Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) since 2000 we have engaged in international activities for sustainable development. Even after the activities of CSI were taken over by the GCCA, we continue to work as a WBCSD member and exchange the latest information on ESG with member companies from a broader perspective.
  In addition, each year we enroll one employee in the WBCSD Leadership Program. We have sent eight employees so far, and this training program is helping us to develop global human resources.
Participation in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo
Taiheiyo Cement is a participant in the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo. Established in November 1979, the federation now consists of 123 companies (representing about 1.5 million employees as of July 2020), most of which are headquartered in Tokyo. Under its basic philosophy of voluntary management and full participation, the federation endeavors to resolve the “Dowa issue” (discrimination against a caste-like minority of ethnic Japanese) and other human rights issues from a company perspective.

Our management structure is based upon the Board of Directors and Board of Auditors. However, the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee was established on March 31, 2021 as an advisory body of the Board of Directors on decisions regarding the nomination and remuneration of executives. We have also introduced an executive officer system and are endeavoring to separate management decision- making and monitoring/supervisory functions from business execution. Our Corporate Auditor’s Office provides comprehensive support for corporate auditors in the performance their duties. We have set up an internal control system in the Internal Auditing Department and, by means of internal audits, strive to ensure that operations are properly executed in the company and group companies.
In addition, the CSR Management Committee was established to strengthen our corporate governance, for example by improving our business activities from the perspective of CSR.

The Foundations of Our Growth
Corporate Governance
Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
In accordance with the Basic Policy on Corporate Governance, we analyze and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors on an annual basis. We employ a self-evaluation system in which all directors and corporate auditors fill out a questionnaire. The chairman of the board and outside directors analyze and assess the results of the questionnaire and report the details to the Board of Directors. Future challenges and measures are then discussed and confirmed.
We have made improvements to the structure and operations of the Board of Directors on the basis of the results, and the evaluation has deemed that the overall effectiveness of our Board of Directors is being ensured.
 Outline of Our Governance System (As of June 29, 2021)
presented to the General Meeting of Shareholders, whose vote decides their appointment. The deliberations of the Board of Directors respect the results of the discussions and findings of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee.
Nomination and Appointment of Prospective Corporate Auditors
After gaining the approval of the Board of Auditors the president proposes to the Board of Directors prospective corporate auditors endowed with suitable experience and skills, and with adequate expertise
in financial affairs, accounting and legal affairs. After deliberations and decisions by the Board of Directors, candidates are presented to the General Meeting of Shareholders, whose vote decides their appointment.
Nomination and Appointment of Prospective Outside Officers
Prospective outside officers must satisfy the company’s Independence Criteria for Outside Officers and be capable of supervising our directors and management from an independent, external standpoint, and of providing proper and appropriate advice based on their experience and insights from careers in professions such as lawyer, corporate manager, certified public accountant and government official.
Please see our website for more information about Independence Criteria for Outside Officers

About UsCorporate Governance Board Member Remuneration
Determining Board Member Remuneration
A Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee is established to determine board member remuneration. The committee is chaired by an outside director and has a majority of outside directors. The committee deliberates and reports its findings to the Board of Directors, which respects those findings.
The decision is then entrusted to the representative director, within the scope decided at the General Meeting of Shareholders and determined by our company regulations.
The remuneration system for directors (excluding outside directors) consists of fixed compensation, share-based compensation and performance-based compensation, while the remuneration system
for the outside directors consists solely of fixed compensation. The remuneration system for auditors also consists solely of fixed compensation.
• Fixed compensation is set according to position.
• Performance-based compensation is calculated by multiplying profit attributable to owners of parent company shares for the fiscal year under review by 1% (up to 400 million yen) and a coefficient according to position.
• Share-based compensation is calculated according to position and issued yearly in the form of share options with restrictions on transfer. In principle, the restrictions on transfer are rescinded on the day the director retires.
Annual Remuneration of Board Members
Remuneration for directors was decided at the General Meeting of Shareholders on June 29, 2021. After the said meeting, there are nine directors (of whom three are outside directors), for whose annual remuneration there is a maximum of 1.2 billion yen (of which 100 million yen is for outside directors). Included in that is a maximum annual sum of 200 million yen (200 thousand shares) as restricted transfer share-based remuneration.
Remuneration for corporate auditors was decided at the General Meeting of Shareholders on June 29, 2020. After the said meeting, there are four corporate auditors, for whose monthly remuneration there is a maximum of 13 million yen.
Annual Remuneration of Board Members (FY2021) 15 552

The above count of board members and corporate auditors who received remuneration includes eight board directors (including one outside director) who retired or resigned at the conclusion of the 22nd Ordinary General Meet- ing of Shareholders held on June 26, 2020.
Internal Control System
 GRI102-30
We follow the Basic Policy for Building an Internal
Control System to ensure suitable and efficient operations at the company and group companies. Our basic approach is to improve and strengthen systems that are currently in operation, and to review and reappraise essential matters. In accordance with this policy, and with the aim of establishing systems that ensure suitable operations at group companies, we are running training and awareness campaigns about Revisions to Our Internal Audit Regulations and Internal Audit Detailed Regulations (November 2020) and our Audit Manual for Auditors Dispatched to Affiliated Companies. Audits were carried out
at four Taiheiyo Cement business sites and fifteen
domestic group companies in FY2021. Matters in need of improvement were identified, and advice and recommendations are being given.

Basic Risk Management Policy and Regulations
In our Business Principles we declare “we will strive to anticipate the changing business environment
to assess new opportunities for growth.” We
consider risk management to be a foundation for reducing management uncertainties and achieving management objectives. Based on our basic risk management policy, we manage risks that make the achievement of management goals uncertain, such as social change, changes in the global environment, natural disasters, accidents and scandals. In addition, we have established risk management regulations to incorporate the risk management policy into specific risk management activities. Our risk management regulations include responses to emergencies.
each business site and group company has an officer responsible for risk management and compliance, and a risk management and compliance promoter, who carry out specific duties. We held four Risk Management & Compliance Committee meetings in FY2021.

  Basic Risk Management Policy
❶ We prevent and reduce risks in order to ensure the quality and safety of our products and services, protect the lives and safety of our employees
and their families, and earn greater trust from our stakeholders.
❷ We create a system to appropriately manage a wide range of risks associated with our business activities.
❸ We promote risk management through a plan-do- check-act cycle.
❹ We quickly and appropriately deal with risks as they are identified.
❺ In collaboration with group companies we build
a system for immediately detecting new risks arising from changes in our business environment and for quickly and appropriately dealing with risks at the group level.
      Basic Compliance Policy
Under our Business Principles we pledge that we will act in strict compliance with the law and in accordance with social mores. Fully aware that compliance is the foundation of CSR management, we published the Basic Compliance Policy and simultaneously created compliance rules in March 2005. We do not limit
our definition of compliance to legal compliance;
our definition includes compliance with the social mores from which our laws originate, the mission
and business principles of our group, and internal regulations.
Our president has ultimate responsibility for risk management and compliance promotion. The officer in charge of both areas (officer in charge of the General Affairs Department) is appointed by the president
to preside over and run the Risk Management & Compliance Committee and systematically promote organized activities.
The committee plays a core role in our risk management and compliance promotion for the
entire group. It deploys the policy, identifies, evaluates and specifies company-wide risks, implements risk management activities based on PDCA cycles and promotes compliance. Moreover, it studies and proposes the creation and revision of rules for risk management and compliance, and provides instructions for advancing the awareness and education of employees. Under the guidance of this committee,

Whistleblowers have the option of either disclosing their identity, or reporting anonymously to mitigate any potential psychological constraints. We have whistleblower hotlines both internally (at the CSR Group of our General Affairs Department) and externally (at a law firm). Our internal hotline is in a dedicated, locked room equipped with dedicated phone and
fax lines, as well as a computer with a dedicated address, in order to safeguard the privacy of those submitting reports. Our external hotline is also available to all employees of group companies in an effort to strengthen group governance, improve program effectiveness and reduce the burden on individual companies.

The Foundations of Our Growth
Risk Management and Compliance
Measures to Reduce the Impact of Risks
Based on evaluations of identified company-wide risks, our Risk Management & Compliance Committee takes the lead in specifying those to be addressed every year and implementing activities to reduce risk impact through PDCA cycles. The challenges addressed in FY2021 were (1) the establishment of a system to prevent scandals such as accounting irregularities, and (2) the revision of compliance-related rules.
Examples of Overseas Risk Countermeasures
We have created and regularly revise the Riot/Terrorism Response Manual. In addition, with regard to high-risk countries to which our employees are dispatched,
we clearly state the procedure for deciding on local evacuations, have created a tool for evaluating the emergency evacuation level according to changes in local situations, and provide training using the tool. We also list and secure supplies (food, clothes, hygiene supplies, and medicines), as well as cash and other resources needed, in the event of evacuation or an emergency at our overseas business sites.
Emergency Task Force
If an event such as a disaster, accident or misconduct has occurred, the affected business site informs the general manager of the General Affairs Department. The general manager considers the severity of the event and determines if an emergency
task force should be established or if the response to the event can be delegated to the site management. Appropriate action is then taken by the emergency task force or local management.
13 such events were reported in FY2021. Important information, including how the situation is handled, is reviewed by the CSR Management Committee.
As preparation for responding to disasters and accidents, we also conducted Shake Out earthquake drills at each business site, and the general manager of the General Affairs Department attended an external course while exploring the question of providing executives with training on how to deal with the mass media. We also provided training for plant staff so
they would understand how to appropriately handle complaints if an accident occurs.
Response to the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
We and our group companies prioritized the
safety of our customers, business partners, the local community and employees of our business sites as COVID-19 infections spread. The emergency task force, headed by the president, implemented various measures and strove to ensure a stable supply of cement and mineral resources products that are essential for social infrastructure.
The Main Measures to Prevent the Spread of Infections • Strongly encourage telecommuting by setting
workplace attendance targets and publishing the actual attendance figures in-house and outside the company.
• Limit close contact between employees and prevent clusters from developing.
• Limit or completely ban get-togethers and occasions where people eat together.
• Utilize web conferencing and limit or completely ban business trips and meetings.
• Evacuate expatriate employees if so warranted by local conditions such as the spread of infections and the state of the medical care system.
• Provide workplace inoculations for Taiheiyo Cement and group company employees who work at the Headquarters or Central Research Laboratory, and for Taiheiyo Cement employees who work in the vicinity of Tokyo.
Going forward, the pandemic is expected to have a long-term impact on the economy and the business environment. However, Taiheiyo Cement and our group companies will continue to boost production while further promoting flexible work arrangement reforms, and to strive for business continuation even during states of emergency.

We provide risk management and compliance training for managers and promoters working at the company’s business sites and group companies to ensure effective risk management and compliance.
In FY2021, we invited outside lecturers to give talks
to the managers at our group companies. Held in November, “Aiming for Harassment-free Workplaces: The Latest Legislation and Corporate Responses”
and “Preventing Irregularities and Scandals at Group Companies” were attended by 82 companies, including those who participated remotely. A training program for the promoters was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Compliance Training
In order to fulfill our mission and uphold our business principles, we formulated the Standards of Conduct to guide all our officers and employees in
the performance of their daily duties. The standards consist of 35 items in 6 categories that draw upon Taiheiyo Cement’s policies, regulations and president’s messages delivered within and outside the company.
We have created and distributed to all our employees, as well as all those of our main group companies, the Standards of Conduct (Casebook), which describes specific examples on how to act in line with the Standards of Conduct.
We regularly revise the Standards of Conduct (Casebook) to reflect the latest information.
In addition, for all company employees, including those on loan to group companies, we conduct monthly quiz tests as part of e-learning programs to provide education on the Standards of Conduct (Casebook) and other materials so they learn how to act in individual situations. In FY2021, 77.4% of employees participated in the program.
Please see our website for more information about our Standards of Conduct (Casebook).

Legal Roundtables for Group Companies
Since FY2006 we have been holding roundtable discussions attended by management and legal affairs representatives from our group companies. These provide opportunities to share legal information (mainly responses to revisions of laws)
in order to further our understanding of major laws relating to corporate management and to assist in the
creation of our group’s compliance regime. These roundtables were postponed due to the
impact of COVID-19 in FY2021, but the table below shows those held in FY2019 and FY2020. We plan to hold them in an appropriate form in FY2022, based on the COVID-19 situation and other considerations.

  Explosion at the Saitama Plant
On April 26, 2021 at 21:58, there was an explosion at the on-site power generation facility located on the north side of the Saitama Plant. We apologize profoundly for the trouble and anxiety we caused to the local residents, our customers, related companies, the authorities concerned, and many others.
It has been confirmed that debris flew beyond the plant perimeter, vehicles caught fire, buildings and vehicles were damaged and dirtied, and flying debris caused damage
to farmland. People who were in a nearby parking lot have reported health issues, but there were no injuries to other local residents or other people.
We are dealing in good faith with the damage etc. working on implementing countermeasures to prevent
a reccurance of the accident. There was no damage to plant facilities other than the on-site power generator and, after safety checks, cement production and shipments continued as normal, as did the treatment of municipal waste (combustible waste) entrusted to us by Hidaka, the city where the plant is located.
In addition, an accident investigation committee, including external experts, was established on June 1. We are working with the committee to investigate the causes of the accident based on an objective survey, and to formulate measures to prevent a recurrence.

Activities to Promote Information Security
In FY2021 we used a portal site on our intranet to remind and educate all employees about information security, and also hired outside experts to carry out a dark web analysis. A number of risks were identified and, after checking the details, we have taken appropriate measures. We also held a gathering for the information departments of group companies at which we promoted information security measures. In addition, we conducted disaster recovery drills based on hypothetical emergencies, and carried out a security level survey
of group companies and information security training designed to enhance our security system. No serious incidents related to information security have occurred.
We will continue our efforts to improve the security levels of our domestic and overseas group companies.
Protection and Use of Intellectual Property
Fundamental Intellectual Property Policy
Based on our policy of boosting the outstanding competitiveness and brand value of the Taiheiyo Cement Group via business-oriented intellectual property activities, in addition to strengthening the group’s business competitiveness by securing and utilizing intellectual property, we support the creation of an advantageous business environment by sharing information gleaned from totally new perspectives, based on an integrated analysis of information about patents, markets and the like.
System to Promote Intellectual Property Action
We have formulated and apply our Rules for Handling

In the process to create intellectual property we construct robust patent clusters by establishing rights to peripheral and improved technologies. As well
as constructing a wide-ranging, robust intellectual property portfolio, we support business expansion by promoting a strategic mix of intellectual property that also includes assets such as trademarks and design rights.
We also appropriately manage our intellectual property rights, carrying out comprehensive evaluations of their business and technological value, and deciding whether to maintain or renounce them.
Risk Management for Intellectual Property
With regard to preventing the infringement of
other companies’ rights, we strive to ascertain recent developments in our competitors’ rights via measures such as the periodic circulation of patent information, our problematic patent watch system and our intellectual property review service, and engage in thorough risk management based on our own criteria. Moreover, we boost our employees’ awareness of intellectual property risks via measures such as holding in-house training and intellectual property strategy promotion meetings with our various divisions. To date, we have never been sued for infringing intellectual property rights, and therefore have not suffered any ensuing business obstacles.
To prevent technology leaks we comprehensively assess such factors as the implementation status of the invention concerned, and the relative difficulty of confidentiality for it, make a decision on know-how concealment, and handle it carefully as a trade secret.
We are also focusing on risk strategies for overseas intellectual property in view of further expansion of our overseas business going forward. The legal systems of emerging Asian nations are different from the system in Japan. We make sure that any differences from Japan are well-known in our group companies, establish support systems that draw upon outside experts well- versed in the situation in specific countries, and carry
out risk management for our intellectual property.
Action to Boost Awareness of Intellectual Property
Our steps to make employees aware of intellectual property and boost the group’s intellectual property capabilities include holding in-house training, informing employees about external training programs, and encouraging them to take the national Intellectual Property Management Skills Test.
Our in-house training program includes basic training for new recruits who have almost no experience of dealing with intellectual property, periodical courses providing patent description training for young inventors, and patent research skills training. Thanks to the addition of remote training courses, our regional branches, plants and group companies participated actively in our FY2021 in-house training program with the number of participants increasing from 90 in the previous fiscal year to 164 in FY2021.
Furthermore, utilizing classes held by external organizations such as the Japan Intellectual Property Association has made it possible for participants to select training that matches their level and needs, and we are promoting such educational and awareness programs for employees at our group companies.

We have been working to improve the working environment for employees with disabilities, including the establishment of three special purpose subsidiaries. As a result, our employment rate of persons with disabilities has steadily improved. The rate was 2.50% as of June 2020 and the annual average employment rate for FY2021 was 2.61%, exceeding the statutory rate for the 14th consecutive year. The statutory employment rate was raised to 2.30% in March 2021. Our employment rate was 2.55% as of June 1, 2021, which also exceeded the statutory rate.

      Basic Policy Concerning Human Rights and Labor Practices
❶ Recognizing that respecting human rights is a foundational management concern, we will strive to address human rights issues.
❷ We will respect diversity and will not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form.
❸ Applying accepted international principles and laws and labor practices in each country, we will respect the rights of all our workers, provide them with employment free of discrimination and strive to ensure equal employment opportunities.
❹ We will strive for better working conditions and a workplace environment that ensures the health and safety of our employees.
❺ We will not tolerate child labor or forced labor under any circumstances.
   Our Human Rights Hotline
In terms of our systems, we improved the existing system regarding childcare and caregivers in FY2017, and in FY2018 established a system that made leave available at the time of a life event and a reemployment system. We introduced a telecommuting system in April 2020, and are working on initiatives to improve labor productivity and make diverse workstyles available.
Members of the harassment counseling committees and human rights committees located at all our business sites conduct activities to raise awareness of human rights to prevent harassment, and handle any related complaints to create a positive workplace environment.
In October 2017 we launched Kirakira Palette, a portal site that provides support for continuous employment and is an integrated source of information about
fringe benefits and support available for childcare and caregiving. Kirakira Palette was launched in response to employee feedback stating that they did not know which kind of systems were available in the company and that they would like more details about them.
We intend to continue doing all we can to increase the number of employees with disabilities, including visiting schools, inviting school staff to our workplaces, collaborating with support organizations for persons with disabilities, and participating in recruitment events and seminars for persons with disabilities.
In FY2021, we received 4 reports via the hotline. We reviewed the details of each report based on requests from the complainants, and responded appropriately.

We are striving to provide flexible work arrangements by adopting various employment systems that will enable our employees to enhance work-life balance.
Support for Childcare and Caregivers
We established a long-term leave system in 2017 for employees who have no choice but to give up their careers due to unavoidable circumstances such as relocating for their spouse’s job or childcare. We also operate a reemployment system for employees who leave their jobs due to child or family care. In addition to our childcare/family-care leave, we have instituted measures that support employees who
do not want to take leave, such as telecommuting, flextime, shortened work hours, and starting work early or finishing late.
Responding to the Act for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation
Since FY2006 we have been formulating general business owner action plans based on the Act
for Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation. After gaining our first “Kurumin” certification in 2017, we achieved the targets
for promoting the use of annual paid leave and encouraging male employees to take childcare leave set in the general business owner action plan during its fifth term, from April 2017 to March 2019, and its sixth term, from April 2019 to March 2021. We also met multiple certification criteria such as the rate of childcare leave taken and levels of overtime work. In recognition of our efforts we have gained our third “Kurumin” certification. Also, in FY2022 we started implementing various efforts in accordance with our seventh general business owner action plans.
  Characteristics of Ideal Employees
From the standpoint of human resource development, we have identified the following three desirable characteristics and traits for revolutionizing the company and creating a dynamic Taiheiyo Cement.

Human Resource Evaluation System
We have adopted a human resource evaluation system that prioritizes development over compensation. The system assists employees in deepening their understanding of their evaluation results through feedback. It also strongly emphasizes the exchange of opinions between evaluators and employees, who share their thoughts on issues such as identifying areas for future development.
We have been implementing a management (HR evaluation) training program since FY2008

Support for Volunteer Activities
In June 2012 we formulated a volunteer activity leave scheme and have been supporting volunteer activities undertaken by employees. A total of 44 employees have taken this leave as of FY2021.
Initiatives to Promote Employee Health
In March 2018 the company formulated the
“Taiheiyo Cement Group Commitment to Health” as
its policy for employee health. Under the commitment
we have since undertaken initiatives based on the
“Kenkokeiei*” concept to maintain and improve the
mental and physical health of every employee.
* Kenkokeiei (Health Management) is a trademark of the NPO Health Management Study Group.
Mental Healthcare
We provide mental health checkups for all our employees (consultation rate: 96.7% in FY2021). Mental healthcare is a key focus in our initiatives
to promote employee health. We also conduct workshops focused on maintaining mental health.
In addition, we offer free counseling services on mental health to employees and their families under a contract with the company’s healthcare trust for this purpose.
Promoting Hygiene and Good Health
We conduct annual health examinations for all employees in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health Act. As in FY2019 and FY2020, the attendance rate in FY2021 was 100%. When it is deemed necessary, we encourage the employee to undergo a more thorough examination and provide guidance on how to make lifestyle improvements.
Moreover, as part of the initiative, we hold nutrition seminars at each business site, provide information through our in-house newsletter and distribute pamphlets that boost health awareness.
Employee Awareness Survey
With the aim of boosting our employees’ job satisfaction we conducted an employee survey every two years from FY2014 to FY2018. We are discussing details to implement it more effectively in FY2022.

Environmental Management
Environmental Management Policy
Our environmental management policy declares an active commitment to environmental issues facing society, including not only preventing environmental pollution but also creating a recycling-based society, mitigating climate change, reducing environmental impacts, protecting water resources and conserving biodiversity as key management challenges. Under this policy we are focusing on improving our environmental performance.
Company-wide Environmental Management System (EMS)
In June 1997 we initiated ISO 14001 certification of each of our plants and attained certification of all six
of our directly operated plants by 1999. Recognizing, however, that plant level management systems alone
are insufficient to ensure comprehensive environmental protection through environmental management projects, we built a company-wide environmental management system (EMS) and extended it beyond plants to cover our headquarters, branches and Central Research Laboratory. In April 2009 our EMS was ISO 14001 certified by
the Japan Testing Center for Construction Materials,
an independent third-party testing, standardization
and certification authority. As part of the continuing certification, the company-wide system underwent a renewal audit for the fourth time in March 2021.
EMS Readiness
Top management (the officer in charge of the Production Department) chairs the Environmental Management Committee with ultimate decision-making authority for environmental management. Overseen by the Environmental Management Committee, the relevant headquarters division manages our plants, mines, quarries and branches using an “umbrella” system.
Company-wide EMS Readiness
Secretariat: Environmental Administration Group, Production Department
All of our cement plants in Japan, including those of group companies, have obtained ISO 14001 certification. Furthermore, all of our overseas cement plants in countries that adopt ISO have obtained
ISO 14001 certification and are actively committed
to environmental conservation. Cement plants in countries where ISO is not adopted as the mainstream standard operate their own EMS.
Internal Environmental Audits
We conducted internal environmental audits at all our sites in FY2021.
As priority items from this year’s audit, confirmation of legal compliance reviews, external communications and corrective actions for unachieved items were identified as company-wide concerns. The status of a follow-up, including corrective and preventive actions for nonconformity with environmental requirements, and the status of responses to emergencies were identified as items that plants must deal with. Verifying the compliance status of service stations was identified as an item that must be dealt with by branches.
The audit identified 34 findings, including 3 for which improvements were requested. Corrective actions were taken for all 3 findings for which improvements were requested.
Environmental Education
During Environment Month each June we deliver a message from the president and provide educational materials on the environment page of our portal site to increase awareness and encourage learning about the environment, and about environmental preservation activities throughout the group. Each workplace
also engages in a number of different activities, such as conducting training sessions related to accident response, viewing environment-related videos, holding lectures and taking part in local cleanup activities. In FY2021, more than 400 activities took place, including group companies’ activities.
Relevant SDGs
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 GRI307-1
Environmental Accidents
In FY2021, we had no legal or regulatory violations related to the environment that were subject to fines or penalties, or any significant accidents that affected the environment or ecosystems. However, we had three minor accidents and took measures to prevent their recurrence.
Response to Environmental Accidents
Each plant maintains emergency response plans
in preparation for possible environmental accidents. They also conduct periodic fire-fighting drills in cooperation with local fire departments. Other training includes how to reduce environmental impact when an environmental accident occurs, and how to report it to a government entity.
Environmental Complaints
As we increasingly utilize ever more diverse
forms of waste and by-products the number of environmental issues we need to consider also increases. Therefore, we are ramping up our efforts to reduce environmental impact through activities such as introducing indoor storage and sealed containers for waste and by-products, and improving our flue gas stacks. On receiving an environmental complaint, whenever possible we quickly travel to the site in question to check the situation, investigate the cause and provide an explanation. If we find that our activities are the cause we implement improvements.
In FY2021, our cement plants received 109 environmental complaints, including those from outside sources. We responded to 25 of these, which were associated with our operations. The number
of complaints has remained roughly the same since FY2018.
Number of Environmental Complaints Received
   Environmental Management Policy
In January 2006 we formulated an Environmental Management Policy, reflecting the fact that we consider an active commitment to the environmental issues facing society to be key management challenges. In addition
to initiatives emphasizing these six items in all business operations, we strive to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders, from international society to local communities, and to seek the ideal form for a sustainable cement industry as a member of the WBCSD and GCCA (Global Cement and Concrete Association).
Formulated in January 2006 Revised in April 2019
❶ Pursuing Environmentally Conscious Business Activities
In pursuit of reducing environmental impacts, we properly assess the impacts of our business activities and promote the introduction of eco-efficient technologies into our business and the development of eco-conscious products. Also, we pursue environmental conservation activities as a member of the regional community.
❷ Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations
As a minimum, we comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business activities. Furthermore, beyond compliance, we meet environmental commitments undertaken through voluntary agreements.
❸ Contributing to a Recycling-based Society Leveraging the inherent capabilities of the cement industry, we actively recycle industrial and municipal waste as raw materials and fuels for cement production.
❹ Proactively Addressing the Issue of Climate Change We promote greater energy reduction throughout the whole of our business activities and strive to develop technology to help reduce society's total greenhouse gas emissions.
❺ Promoting Global Technology Transfer
Through the worldwide transfer and deployment of our technology, we aid the development of greater energy conservation, environmental preservation and utilization of waste materials.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Achievement of Our CSR Objectives for 2025
 GRI102-11, 302-3, 305-1, 2, 4, 5
Among the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by our domestic group companies (excluding power generation companies) that are reporting their greenhouse gas emissions by business segment in accordance with the Act on Promotion
of Global Warming Countermeasures, about 95%
of greenhouse gas emissions were generated from cement production companies in FY2017.* Roughly 5% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were associated with our service stations, headquarters, branches
and shipping, as well as electricity purchased by the group. Our Scope 3 emissions, calculated according to categories 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of the WBCSD/CSI Scope 3 guidelines, were roughly 4% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
The bulk of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operations of our group companies are directly associated with cement production. We have therefore set in the CSR Objectives for 2025 a medium to long-term quantitative target of reducing specific net CO2 emissions by 10% or more from FY2001 levels.
* Most of our overseas group companies are cement production companies, 683 679 so the ratio of cement production companies in our overall CO2 emissions 675
fromproduction is higher than it would be for domestic companies alone.

Efforts Related to the Cement Production Process
 GRI302-1, 3, 4, 305-4, 5
A significant amount of CO2 is generated during cement production. This is because the production process requires a high temperature of 1,450°C and limestone, used as a raw material, is decarbonated through a chemical reaction during the calcination process (CaCO3  CaO + CO2). About 35% of CO2 emissions generated during cement production are from the consumption of energy, about 55% are from the calcination of raw materials, and about 10% are from electricity use. In order to reduce CO2 emissions we have been working to conserve energy by installing energy-efficient equipment and improving the stability and efficiency of our kiln operations.
We have also been implementing measures such as expanded use of waste- and biomass-derived energy sources to decrease our rate of use of fossil fuels. We are also moving toward using recycled resources with less carbonate content to lower CO2 emissions from the calcination of limestone. We are moving forward with the adoption of waste heat power generation to reduce CO2 from electric power.
Our specific net CO2 emissions for FY2021 were 675 kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious product, the same as in FY2020.

Reducing CO2 Emissions during Transportation
 GRI305-3
We contract the delivery of our raw materials and products to transportation companies and are striving to reduce CO2 emissions as a specified consigner designated under the Japanese Energy Saving Act. Major efforts include implementing a plan to transport goods on return trips, encouraging drivers to eco-drive, and promoting energy efficient devices such as digital tachometers and eco-tires on vehicles. In shipping,
we continue to pursue energy efficiency technologies and operate new ships that are equipped with various energy-saving features. We are also supporting energy- saving operations for conventionally powered ships.
Our FY2021 CO2 emissions were roughly 8% lower than in FY2020 thanks to energy efficiency initiatives and a decrease in shipping volume.

Waste heat power generation associated with the group’s cement production was 430 GWh in FY2021, a roughly 53GWh decrease on FY2020. Its ratio to all electricity consumed at our cement plants was about 12.5%. Assuming an emission factor of 0.69 t-CO2/ MWh if we were to purchase electric power from an external source, this works out as a reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 297 thousand tonnes.

 Resource Recycling with Industries
Electric Power Utilities
We accept coal ash produced at coal-fired
power plants and use it as a substitute for clay as
a raw material in cement. In addition, we operate ash centers* to use more ash effectively. We also supply the power plants with limestone powder which is used to scrub the harmful sulfur oxides from the exhaust produced by the burning of coal. The reaction of the limestone powder with sulfur oxides forms by-product gypsum, which we make effective use of as a raw material for cement.
*Ash centers are distribution sites that combine collection/transportation (transshipment and storage) and intermediate-processing (powder mixing) functions. They receive coal ash from coal-fired power plants and ensure a stable supply to our cement plants, while also supplying diverse products that meet user needs.
Steelmakers
In the iron and steelmaking process, impurities are removed from iron ore to make iron.
We supply the limestone and quicklime used in the refining process. We also use blast furnace slag and steel slag, by-products that remain after the refining process, as raw materials for cement and as cement admixture.
Construction Soil
Traditionally this soil had been dumped into landfills. By making effective use of it as a cement raw material, we contribute to the conservation of natural resources and also help to prolong the life of landfills. We have also set up intermediary facilities that organically link sites where construction soil is produced to our nationwide plants, and strive to make them effective resources.
Resource Recycling with Local Communities
Most municipal waste is incinerated and the incinerator residue is buried in landfills, but it has become very difficult to find new landfill sites. Waste treatment has become a source of concern for Japan’s major city governments in particular, and the situation is expected to get worse. We have three systems for recycling municipal waste and strive to make effective use of such resources and resolve environmental issues.
 Incineration Residues Recycling System
A system for recycling municipal waste incineration
ash (bottom ash and fly ash) as a raw material for ordinary Portland cement.
 AK System
A system for recycling household waste and
general business waste as alternative raw materials and fuels for cement manufacture. The waste is preprocessed through biological breakdown (fermentation) using a waste recycling kiln.
 Ecocement System
Ecocement is a new type of cement made primarily
from the municipal waste incineration residues. More than 500 kg of ash and other waste materials are used per tonne of Ecocement.
Performance of Recycled-Waste-to- Cement System
 GRI301-1, 2
All of our directly operated cement plants in Japan recycle waste and byproducts into alternative raw materials and fuels for cement. This helps to prolong the life of landfills, prevent the depletion of natural mineral resources, limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.
In FY2021 we accepted a greater volume of wood chips, waste plastic, water treatment plant sewage sludge and ash, and municipal waste incineration ash. However, due to a decrease in the amounts of coal ash, blast furnace slag, by-product gypsum, unburned ash, dust, dust construction soil, and waste oil we accepted, the input of recycled waste and by-products was 6,108 thousand tonnes, a decrease of about 279 thousand tonnes on the previous fiscal year. This means we recycled 402.7 kg of waste and by-products per tonne of cement produced.

Environmental Impact of Our Operations
 GRI304-1, 2, MM1, MM2
Environmental Impact of Our Operations
Cement production starts with quarrying limestone, the primary raw material for cement. We also quarry many mineral resource products used as aggregates and industrial raw materials.
Since quarrying involves the removal of topsoil
to expose the required ore, it inevitably impacts
the environment and biodiversity of the area being developed. However, the limestone, rocks and sand
we quarry only require crushing for particle size adjustment and sorting, and do not require any refining processes. Consequently, our operations are unlikely
to cause chemical contamination to surrounding areas. In addition, we minimize the amount of waste stones generated during our limestone quarrying by using them as construction materials.
Limestone Quarries of the Group
The group operates 17 major limestone quarries around the world, which are located near to our integrated cement plants. The total site area* of the quarries is 4,269 ha (Japan: 2,608 ha; USA: 1,281 ha;
other regions: 380 ha).

Activities to Reduce Environmental Impact
 GRI103-2, 3, 304-1, 2, 3, 4, MM1
Throughout the group we believe that balancing the conservation of ecosystems in local communities and development of the communities themselves
is important in quarry operations. With this belief,
we hold discussions with local governments, local communities and academics while operating quarries. This helps to ensure we not only prevent pollution but also conserve biodiversity and water resources while minimizing our environmental impact.
Environmental Impact Assessment
In developing quarries we conduct ex-ante assessments of environmental impact of the development of quarries based on environmental research of the development area such as on biodiversity and water resources. We then discuss
the results of the research with local governments, local communities, academics and other stakeholders before finalizing a development plan. Moreover,
we regularly monitor the surrounding environment during the development and operations of quarries, and report to our stakeholders on the environmental impact that the quarries have in their areas.
For instance, in the new development of a quarry in the Ofunato Quarry, Iwate Prefecture, we conducted environmental assessment for approximately ten years. We focused on preserving rare wildlife species in cooperation with external experts and local residents. Furthermore, we minimized noise and vibration during the development work and also limited the traffic hours for trucks used in construction work. In addition, even after development work begins, we carry out regular assessments and implement environmental protection measures.
Raptors survey (Ofunato Quarry)
Biodiversity Protection
When environmental impact assessments determine that protection is required, we protect rare species and the like via measures such as installing protective equipment, transplanting and restricting development work.
Since 1972, at the Minowa Quarry of Chichibu Taiheiyo Cement Corporation, we have been protecting and nurturing rare species of native plants on Mt. Buko, which is located in Chichibu City and Yokoze Town in Saitama Prefecture. We created a botanical garden at the quarry and, together with local experts and other people, we preserve 68 native plant species there while increasing the plant population. Additionally, our Central Research Laboratory continues to research and develop ways to protect and propagate plants, and to verify the genetic diversity of wild specimens using biotechnology. Since 2016, in the course of developing the Ofunato Quarry, we have been working with experts to protect and propagate various rare plant species in their native biospheres by creating a botanical garden on the side of the office of Ryushin Mining Co., Ltd.

Relevant SDGs
Greening Quarries
Rocks and soil are exposed in working quarry areas, and no vegetation is left. However, if no quarrying work is expected for some time we strive
to green such areas as soon as possible. We also plant vegetation in excavated topsoil stockyards and in places where the contours of the soil will remain unchanged for a while. At some quarries, at the request of the local community, we restore greenery if operations have been suspended for several months.
We basically plant vegetation that is native to the region. In our greening of quarries in Japan in FY2021, we scattered seeds over a total area of 26,294m2 and planted 3,944 saplings.
Other efforts include participating in an annual tree planting campaign with contractors and local residents to improve awareness of quarry development and greening activities.
Greening quarry slopes (Buko Quarry)
Water Resource Conservation
In quarrying we also pay close attention to protecting not only terrestrial plants but also water resources such as rivers and natural springs in
an effort to contribute to biodiversity. From the perspective of conserving water resources, spring water discharged from quarrying and rainwater is directed into retention basins to minimize impact on the environment outside of the quarrying area. In some quarries we drill wells for domestic water and supply this water to local communities for everyday use.
Use of Old Quarry Sites
We reuse old quarry sites where operations have completely ended after consultation with the local community. When greening a site we strive to restore the original vegetation.

Air Pollution
Air pollutants generated from cement production are primarily NOx, SOx and dust in combustion
gases emitted from cement kilns. To ensure the proper management of these substances we strive
to reduce air pollutant emissions through measures such as installing equipment to continuously monitor emission concentrations, improving NOx reduction systems and installing bag filter equipment to capture dust emissions. Our target in this is to maintain our FY2011 emissions levels.
In FY2021, emissions of NOx, SOx and dust were
all lower than the figures for FY2011, our benchmark year. Furthermore, the level of SOx emissions was very low compared to the limit set under the Air Pollution Control Act.
 Specific Emissions of Clinker for Selected Pollutants GCCA
Water Contamination
Most of the water discharged from our plants to public waters is cooling water and not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. At our cement plants all water resources are reused as circulation water to minimize the impact of water discharge into public waters. Moreover, we are installing sedimentation tanks, water-oil separation tanks, oil film detectors, pH meters and suspended solid sensors on water discharge routes that connect to public waters.

We properly store and dispose of high and low concentrations of PCB waste in accordance with the Amendment to the Law concerning Special Measures for Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Wastes (revised in 2016), hereinafter referred to as the PCB Special Measures Law.
For high-concentration PCB waste with an early disposal deadline as stipulated by the PCB Special Measures Law, we signed a processing contract with the Japan Environmental Safety Corporation (JESCO) in 2006 and have prioritized processing.
Pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored at the Ofunato Plant, Fujiwara Plant and the former Kawara, Tosa and Osaka plants, as well as at the Chichibu quarry and branch office service stations, were processed in FY2021. Transformers and capacitors containing high- concentration PCB in the Kyushu, Chugoku and Shikoku area were processed before March 31, 2018. However, we have confirmed that two unprocessed capacitors still remain in that area. We have submitted a report
to the prefectural governor about the two capacitors, and they are being stored appropriately until the local government decides on the disposal method for equipment that has passed its deadline for processing.
Pollutants such as electrical ballasts stored at the Ofunato Plant, Kumagaya Plant, Saitama Plant and Chubu Hokuriku Branch service stations are scheduled for processing in FY2022.

  Water Risk Analysis
conducted using the Water Risk Filter*, the average score for the total basin risk for all our plants (weighted average taking into account the cement production volume) was 2.6. The highest total basin risk score was 3.5, and the average score was 0.2 lower than that of the previous year. The volume of cement produced at the plant in question accounted for about 13% of the production volume of all the plants. However, when we analyzed conditions at that plant, no urgent issues were identified.
* A water risk mapping tool developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It is used to evaluate business impacts related to water scarcity, flooding, drought, seasonal variation, physical water quality risks, regulatory risks, etc. The maximum score is 5.0, and the higher the score, the greater the risk.
Water Consumption
the cooling of production equipment, exhaust gas and in-house power generators. Therefore, the water discharged from the plants is mostly cooling water, which is not polluted as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act. Our plants near the ocean use seawater to cool in-house power generation equipment. All the fresh water used at the plants is circulated and reused, except for the household wastewater, as we strive to reduce our water withdrawal and lessen the impact of wastewater on bodies of water.

 Our total withdrawal of fresh water in FY2021 was about 27.19 million m3 and our total withdrawal of seawater about 150 million m3. The seawater was used to cool in-house power generation equipment at our plants near the ocean and then released back into the sea after use. The amount of fresh water discharged was approximately 13.45 million m3, meaning that about 13.75 million m3 of fresh water was used at the plants. However, most of this water is not used as a raw material and evaporates after being used to cool equipment or gas.

CalPortland Company has constructed a system for the sustainable use of water at its Rocky Canyon Aggregate Plant in California, USA. This system has improved the collection and storage of rainwater and spring water at the site. Developing these water resources has made it possible to secure a supply of the water it needs in its work, without having to build new wells or increase the volume of ground water it extracts, and also to keep the amount of water that drains out of the site to a bare minimum. (There are strict regulations with regard to water that drains out of a site.)

We use information, including data collected for the GCCA Cement CO2 Protocol, to calculate the reduction in consumption of fossil energy and natural resources associated with the use of waste and by-products.
Economic benefits are calculated by multiplying reductions in consumption (effects of environmental conservation) by set market prices.
The market values of the inventory items are set at FY2001 levels, and are estimated on the basis of the following considerations.
CO2: 3,000 yen/t (a hypothetical CO2 emission tax rate). Crude oil: import price. Natural resources: estimated price. Waste: controlled landfill costs in the Tokyo area. A portion of the EEB is accounted for in our profit and loss statement.

Installation of a Hydrated Raw Material Mixing System at
the Fujiwara Plant No. 5 Kiln  GRI201-2
In order to boost the rotary kiln firing efficiency, standard raw materials for cement are dried, pulverized and homogenized in a raw mill. In recent years the amount of substitutes used for natural resources is increasing, and some of those recycled resources have a strong odor like hydrated sludge and cannot be processed in a raw mill. This makes it necessary to feed them directly into a rotary kiln to decompose

any malodorous components.
The hydrated raw material mixing system installed at the Fujiwara Plant
Investment: Approx. Reduction in CO2 emissions: 340 million yen 2,388 tonnes/year
 No. 5 Kiln in FY2021 was jointly developed by Taiheiyo Cement and Taiheiyo Engineering Corporation. It is a new type of mixing system that separates high-temperature raw materials inside the preheater and premixes them before they are fed into the rotary kiln, thereby dramatically boosting drying and firing efficiency. The new mixing system will lead to less thermal energy being required for clinker burning, and is intended to further reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impact.

Quality Policy
In 1998, the year of Taiheiyo Cement’s inception, we established a quality policy based on our management policy. We revised the policy by incorporating a visual description of the code
of conduct. Through those efforts we have since continually raised awareness of the policy across the organization. It represents our aspiration to continue to be a company that customers trust and rely on by sharing a sense of achievement through each employee’s actions and by providing high- quality products and services, leveraging our high technological capabilities and quality assurance system.
Quality Policy
All of our employees adopt a global perspective, striving to boost customer satisfaction and contribute to society by providing environmentally-friendly products and quality that matches our customers’ needs.
In order to achieve the aims of our policy
quality management systems. Furthermore, all of our overseas cement plants in countries that adopt ISO have obtained ISO 9001 certification. To ensure product quality and improve business operations, we obtained ISO 9001 (JIS Q9001) certification from the Japan Testing Center for Construction Materials. The scope of our certification encompasses the development, design and production of a range
of cement, cement clinker and cement-based soil stabilizer products.
We will continue to fully apply the ISO 9001 approach in addition to our own quality management system (QMS) and enhance initiatives to strengthen our ability to continually provide ISO 9001-compliant products and deliver greater customer satisfaction.
facility to protect the environment of the surrounding area as well as that inside the plant.
We have already established fixed standards
for the management of heavy metals contained in natural resources, and are constantly enhancing
the control of minor components as the volume of waste we receive increases. When we receive new types of waste or waste from new sources we strictly apply rules under which we conduct three kinds
of inspection related to the source of the waste, its chemical composition and the results of trial use to identify any potentially negative impact on product quality or the surrounding environment. We will then make a final decision on whether to receive the waste. These measures help us ensure product safety.
Ensuring Product Safety Following a Nuclear Accident
 GRI416-1, 417-1
As a consequence of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, Inc. in 2011,
we discovered that some industrial waste used for making cement contained specified radioactive material. We have established a system to ensure
that the radioactive concentration in cement shipped from our plants is below the safety limit* set by the Japanese government by strictly controlling the radioactive concentrations in raw materials and fuels for cement. In the interest of full disclosure we post the measurement results on our website every month.
* The Japanese government set a limit of 100 Bq/kg as the safety standard for radioactive concentrations in cement, effective from May 2011.
Please see our website for more information about radioactive concentrations in our products.

   Initiatives of the Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving Block Industry
Labor shortages are becoming more severe in various industries over the past few years, and the paving block industry also needs to take swift measures to boost productivity and save labor. Accordingly, this association is engaged in initiatives focusing on construction, a field where there seems to be a particularly large number of issues.
In other countries it is the norm for blocks to be constructed using specialized machinery, but in Japan there are still companies where such equipment has yet to be adopted and individual blocks are made manually by skilled workers. The Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving Block Industry therefore held a virtual tour on the internet
to show the construction process using a German-made machine, and shared information with association members nationwide with the aim of encouraging the adoption of such equipment in Japan.
The association is already engaged in initiatives aimed
at enhancing the performance of interlocking roadway blocks, and is now moving forward with the reappraisal of performance costs, trial construction and durability tests with the aim of establishing performance regulations.
The Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving Block Industry will continue to aim for sustainable growth, and will contribute to environmentally-friendly and pleasing urban development by promoting the use of paving blocks via its nationwide membership network.

Operations at our cement production sites and quarries are increasingly being mechanized. Since some tasks are performed in elevated places or at high temperatures, ensuring worker safety at our production sites is essential for stable operations. We do our best to ensure that employees of contractors working at our sites avoid any accidents. They receive various types of training when they start work at the site, are required to submit a work plan that includes a safety plan, and are given guidance with regard to that plan.
In addition to the Ready-mixed Concrete Society,
we have established other associations such as
the Taiheiyo Cement Association for the Paving

Health & Safety Policy
Our Health & Safety Policy is shown below. Under this policy our headquarters and business sites review and revise health and safety management regulations each fiscal year.
Relevant SDGs
 Company-wide Health & Safety Committee supervises health and safety activities held by our various business locations. It also collects safety-related data from not only the company itself but also our group companies and provides guidance.
Work-related Accident Reports and Database
that fact, we will add periodic patrols accompanied by guidance to our measures against accidents caused by breaking the rules, and will analyze the rule-breaking behavior and improve areas such as our training, equipment and codes of practice. We will measure WBGT values (heat indices) at each work site and take measures against heatstroke such as establishing a set frequency for breaks.
All plants, quarries and branches under the jurisdiction of our divisions at Headquarters, and all group companies, have a health and safety committee consisting of representatives from both management and labor, as well as a cooperative committee promoting the health and safety-related activities of each business site.
Any work-related accident is reported to the Company-wide Occupational Health & Safety Committee immediately, regardless of how insignificant it may seem. We promptly post the details of any accident on the group bulletin board as a step towards avoiding any recurrence.
  Taiheiyo Cement Health & Safety Policy
Taiheiyo Cement Corporation recognizes that ensuring the health and safety of our employees is a cornerstone of our company. We invest appropriate management resources
to the prevention of work-related accidents and diseases in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health Act and the Mine Safety Act, and efficiently implement the fundamental policies shown below.
Fundamental Policies
❶ Promote health and safety activities through cooperation between management and labor, with the aim of eliminating work-related accidents.
❷ Ensure the health and safety of our employees and those of our contractors by complying with health and safety-related laws and regulations, the health and safety management regulations created by us, and health and safety regulations created by our business sites.
❸ Strive to improve the level of health and safety by actively promoting the implementation and operation of our Occupational Safety and Health Management System, and by continually ensuring the fundamental safety
of our work and equipment, providing education and
training, and raising awareness of health and safety.
❹ Constantly improve workplace environments and work procedures by applying improved technologies and new health and safety information via the company-
wide, business site and group affiliate health and safety
committees.
❺ Ensure health and safety throughout the Taiheiyo
Cement Group by promoting action to eliminate work- related accidents under the leadership of the company- wide, business site, and group affiliate health and safety committees.
Health and safety management at cement plants, mines and quarries in Japan is carried out by our OSHMS*.
We have maintained a work-related accident database since FY2009. It covers accidents involving employees of the company and group companies as well as the employees of all our contractors, including temporary workers. It categorizes accidents according to the “4 Ms” (men, machines, methods and management), analyzes the causes of unsafe behavior and situations, and systematically stores work-related accident review reports that include details of the countermeasures taken. The database is also translated into English and Chinese so that it can be widely used at our overseas business sites.
When we reviewed accidents according to type, we found a big decrease in those involving being trapped by or dragged into equipment. However there are still many cases of falls that lead to serious accidents so we are taking measures to prevent recurrence. We also reviewed work-related accidents according to years

the following objectives for FY2021: zero fatalities, limit lost-time injuries to 30 or less and the total number of work-related accidents to 80 or less, while also setting the absence rate in the 0.5% range. We therefore engaged in health and safety promotion activities with a focus on: (1) improving the level of safety management at group companies in order to achieve our CSR Objectives for 2025, (2) eliminating accidents caused by breaking the rules, (3) eliminating heatstroke-related accidents, (4) preventing the recurrence of similar accidents, (5) complying with safety-related legislation, and (6) preventing the spread of COVID-19 infections (preventing employees from becoming infected or infecting others).
Since FY2008, we have been using the Safety Operation Officer System which emphasizes the importance of improving leadership capabilities to reduce work-related accidents. This system provides the certification as a safety operation officer that is required for leaders of work groups. To further improve the capabilities of those leaders, as of FY2016 we require participants in the certification seminars held at the plants to have completed the foreman training course stipulated in the Industrial Safety and Health Act.
We have established procedures for the implementation of health and safety training, and are committed to providing such training so that work can be carried out safely. Training is provided at all our business sites. It can be categorized into training for newly-hired employees, training for newly-hired employees with professional experience at another company, specialized courses, training for newly- appointed managers, skills training, and training for contractors when they start work at a site.

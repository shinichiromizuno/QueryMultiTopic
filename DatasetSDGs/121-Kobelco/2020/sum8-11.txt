Maintaining transportation infrastructure has a major impact on eco- nomic development, as well as the improvement of living conditions.
Kobe Steel owns self-driving technologies that have been devel- oped through supplying new transit systems like the Port Liner and Yurikamome. We are expanding these technologies across not only Japan but also other Asian countries. Kobe Steel participated in the construction of Indonesiaâ€™s first subway line, the North-South Line of the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit system, which opened in April 2019, contributing to core infrastructure that eases chronic traffic jams in Jakarta and improves the urban environment.

Tighter environmental regulations have led to major changes around the world for large ships that are the backbone of marine transporta- tion. Needs are increasing for better fuel economy and energy conser- vation in the operation of large ships.
Demand is growing for LNG-fueled ships, which have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional ships in response to tightening environmental regulations for SOx and NOx emissions. Kobe Steel has supplied a large number of compressors used in LNG-fueled ships and holds a large share of the market for these compressors. Through pro- viding these products, we will continue to contribute to solutions for global issues.

A key social issue today is the realization of a recycling-oriented society (a society where the burden on the environment is reduced as much as possible by restricting the consumption of natural resources), which was codified into law in Japan in 2000.
The KOBELCO Group aims to help preserve marine environments by slowing the increase in plastic waste, especially plastic bottles, which has become a big concern of late, through the production of highly recyclable* aluminum can stock.

In the construction industry, Kobe Steel has played a vital role in upgrad- ing and maintaining regional infrastructure, responding to emergencies during natural disasters, and creating local employment, while dealing with the major issue of labor shortages caused by the declining popula- tion and aging workforce in Japan.
Kobelco Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. has been advancing R&D for its K-DIVE CONCEPT under the slogan of realizing a teleworking system centered on people who work at construction sites. If success- ful, this system will enable on-site work without being restricted to spe- cific people, location or time, helping to eliminate shortages of skilled construction workers and improving productivity through on-site automation.

Digital technology has rapidly caught on in society today. In a majority of countries, initiatives are underway to spur innovation based on national strategies looking at the future transformation of society and industry driven by digital technologies. Changes are moving at a faster pace in society, including changes in our work styles and lifestyles, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Industrial robots for welding have the potential to change the way we work by reducing the workload amid labor shortages at worksites, while also ensuring the health and safety of workers.
The KOBELCO Group supplies REGARCTM-equipped structural steel welding systems, mainly in Japan, in the face of falling birthrates and an aging population. In the future, we aim to solve issues affecting global society by tapping into potential demand for welding robots overseas.

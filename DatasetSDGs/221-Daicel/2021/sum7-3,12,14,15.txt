The Daicel Group follows its Basic Policies for Responsible Care to implement a variety of initiatives for reducing environmental impact, including preservation of water resources, environmental management of air pollution, reductions in emissions and appropriate management of chemical substances. With regard to waste reduction and recycling, we are further promoting the 3Rs to reduce the amount of waste. This includes efforts to save resources, reuse, and recycle as we strive to realize a circular society and circular economy.

As our mid-term target for the period ending FY2026/3, we are focusing on (1) raising the recycling rate at Daicel's business sites and Domestic Group companies to 95% or higher and (2) achieving zero emissions at Daicel’s business sites and Domestic Group companies. To improve our recycling rate, we will continue to apply the 3Rs to industrial waste by promoting the effective use of resources and reducing the amount of waste incinerated without energy recovery. In regard to achieving zero emissions, we will work on enhancing our recycling rate for plastic waste and organic sludge.

The Daicel Group intends to achieve zero emission status by promoting initiatives for reducing industrial waste centered on the 3Rs. In FY2021/3, the amount of industrial waste generated by the Group decreased by 21% compared to the previous fiscal year to 146 kilotonnes as plant removal work peaked and production of some products was adjusted. The amount of landfill waste fell 54% year-on-year to 2.1 kilotonnes. The recycling rate for Daicel’s business sites and Domestic Group companies in FY2021/3 remained
unchanged from the previous fiscal year at 94%. The landfill rate was 1.1%, and we will seek to achieve zero emissions as a new target from FY2022/3.

  Chapter II: Daicel Group Businesses and Growth Strategies
Materials Business Overview
The Materials Business provides various materials to diverse industries. Daicel is Japan’s only manufacturer of acetic acid, which has a broad range of applications. Our Acetyl Business supplies acetic acid and acetic acid derivative chemicals. It also supplies cellulose acetate, made from cellulose derived from wood pulp or cotton, and acetate tow, obtained by spinning cellulose acetate. In the Chemical Business, we draw on the organic synthesis technologies we have accumulated over the years to manufacture and sell a range of chemicals, including peracetic acid derivatives such as alicyclic epoxy and caprolactone, based on a unique synthetic reaction, and amine and ketene chemicals.

■ Relevant SDGs Contributing Toward Realizing an Eco-friendly Decarbonized Society with the Power of Unique New Materials
Daicel is the only company that manufactures and sells ε-caprolactone and cycloaliphatic epoxy made by an oxidation reaction using peracetic acid. These products are widely used in such areas as automobiles, semiconductors, and displays.
In particular, we are the leading company in the area of cycloaliphatic epoxy, and our main product, Celloxide 2021P, can be used to create cured products with high crosslink density (high thermal resistance and high optical property) despite its low viscosity, and it is attracting attention as an indispensable raw material for highly advanced materials.
Electric vehicles are likely to gain more attention as a means of reducing CO2 emissions and are expected to account for roughly 20% of all automobiles sold globally by 2030. There is growing demand for even more compact electronic components with higher power output, while carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) are attracting attention as a promising alternative to metal for creating lightweight exterior parts. These next-generation components and CFRPs require workability, impregnating ability, and high thermal resistance, which is made possible using the physical properties of cycloaliphatic epoxy, for which further growth is expected.
Looking ahead, we will seek to expand our cycloaliphatic epoxy business by boosting our supply capacity by means of increasing production at multiple bases not to mention our lineup of high-performance, high value-added materials.

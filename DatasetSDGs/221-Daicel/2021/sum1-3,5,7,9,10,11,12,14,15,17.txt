 Chapter II: Daicel Group Businesses and Growth Strategies
Medical Healthcare Business Overview
Our Healthcare Business, consisting of the Cosmetics and Health Foods businesses, is focused on raising the quality of life by delivering high-quality raw materials for cosmetics and marine biodegradable spherical fine particles (cellulose acetate) used in cosmetics. It also focuses on unique nutritional raw materials and supplements derived from natural materials through natural- material extraction and bioconversion technologies. In the chiral separation business, we engage in the manufacture and sale of chiral columns used for separating and purifying optical isomers in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing processes, and we provide chiral separation services under consignment. Daicel boasts a large share of the global market for chiral columns.
Mid-Term Management Strategy: Our Approach to the Business Strategy and Initiatives
■ Relevant SDGs
  Developing Cellulose Acetate Spherical Fine Particles [BELLOCEA®], an Environmentally Sound Cosmetic Material.
Daicel has been consistently developing and selling naturally derived materials for cosmetics with a focus on sustainability. As microplastics come under closer scrutiny for being harmful to the oceans, tighter regulations are being introduced in the cosmetics industry, which handles many products containing these plastics.
The spherical fine particle product BELLOCEA® was developed by processing our long-standing mainstay product
of cellulose acetate using proprietary technology. Although flowing out in ocean, this environmentally sound, highly biodegradable material will be ultimately decomposes into acetate and cellulose which exists in nature. BELLOCEA® features a smooth surface due to its fine particles as well as superior dispersibility and spreadability, which make it softer on the skin than other naturally derived beads such as silica. Also, it is similar to synthetic particles such as nylon in the way that it spreads evenly on the skin.
We are already providing samples with an eye on developing applications in foundations while considering the further enhancement of its functionality and expanding the product lineup. In addition, we have begun developing a new grade in biodegradability to comply with regulations of the European Chemicals Agency.
We will continue to provide raw materials with a higher degree of natural content to respond to the ongoing shift from synthetic to natural in the cosmetics industry.

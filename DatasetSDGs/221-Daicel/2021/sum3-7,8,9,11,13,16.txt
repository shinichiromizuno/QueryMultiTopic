Safety Business Overview
The main products of the Safety Business are automobile airbag inflators (gas generation devices), which protect the lives of occupants and pedestrians by inflating airbags within milliseconds after a collision. Our automobile airbag inflators are highly regarded as the key component of airbag systems. Meanwhile, our pyro-fuse, which safely, instantaneously, and pyrotechnically interrupt high-voltage and high-current electricity in the event of an emergency, are expected to be used in many products that will be automated by AI, not to mention the already burgeoning electric vehicle industry.
■ Relevant SDGs
DAISI Springs to Action, Only When Needed Launching Our DAISI One-Time Energy Technology Creating Value for Wide-ranging Fields from Automobiles to Medicine in an Era of Growing Anxiety
Over the years, Daicel has been cultivating technology safely, accurately, and instantaneously by generating a single burst of optimal energy used in automotive airbags that saves lives around the world. We have launched the “DAISI” brand by redefining this unique technology as “One Time Energy.” We intend to continue creating and co-creating new value for diverse business domains by applying the technology to products such as pyro-fuse for an electric vehicle to prevent passengers from having an accident and being electrocuted as well as our cutting-edge medical device “ActranzaTM lab.”

We boast a track record of zero malfunctions and reliability by continuously protecting lives.
  • Cataloging and integration of products
• Develop a gas generant based on a new composite and shift the production method
• Consolidate production bases to raise cost-competitiveness
• Save labor by automating the production line
• Shift to a “Half-cost line” through standardization, in-house production, and diversion of EOP (End of Production) line
• Set up a production base in India
• Deepen collaboration with airbag module manufacturers
• Bolster development and marketing for pyro-fuse
• Explore applications in other areas by branding Daicel technology • Create new businesses through co-creation with customers
*Jet permeation is a term coined by Daicel to describe the function of injecting fluids inside the body by using a high-speed jet stream instead of a hypodermic needle.

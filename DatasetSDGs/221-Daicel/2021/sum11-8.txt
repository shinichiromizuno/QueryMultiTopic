Initiatives on Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
Under the Daicel Group Basic Policies for Responsible Care, the Daicel Group designates safety as one of the priority foundation that is protected by conducting assessments to identify, eliminate, and mitigate any risks associated with ensuring safe processes and preventing disasters. In the event of an incident involving process safety, we take action based on BCP guidelines for minimizing damage.
Initiatives for Preventing Occupational Accidents
The Daicel Group is working to improve occupational health and safety under the leadership of safety management supervisors assigned to each business site through a system of responsible care under the direct supervision of the president and CEO. Management and business sites exchange information on occupational accidents and process safety incidents using a database specifically designed for that purpose. Supervisors of the environmental and safety divisions meet once a month to determine the root causes of accidents and reported incidents, identify similar cases, and implement countermeasures across relevant business sites.
The number of occupational accidents in FY2021/3 decreased by 23 year-on-year to 53. There were no accidents with fatalities. In FY2021/3, the occupational accident frequency rate improved by 0.66 points from 2.64 in the previous fiscal year to 1.98.

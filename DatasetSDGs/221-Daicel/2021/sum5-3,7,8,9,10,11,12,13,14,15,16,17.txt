Reusing Parts Discarded after Molding Components as a Resource to Create Products at a Recycling Rate of 80% while Guaranteeing Quality Roughly Equivalent to Virgin Material
 Polyplastics has acquired additional UL certification* for its product LAPEROS® LCP S475 Grade which verifies the fact that its quality (physical properties) at a recycled material usage rate of 80% is equivalent to that of a product made from virgin materials.
LAPEROS® LCP features high heat resistance and mechanical sterength and is widely used in micro precision connectors for the latest IT devices, such as tablets and smartphones, which are becoming ever smaller. Normally, molding components requires ancillary parts such as sprues and runners that are subsequently discarded. As components become smaller, the percentage of ancillary parts relatively rises, causing a problem of more waste rate. Therefore, there is ongoing effort to reuse these parts as a recyclable resource for molding new products. There was also concern, however, about the quality of materials that use recycled sprues and runners. In this context, Polyplastics has acquired an additional UL certification for the S475 Grade of LAPEROS® LCP as capable of achieving required product quality, even at a recycled material usage rate of 80%.
Amid greater public demand for the effective use of resources, Polyplastics will continue to pursue further certifications
and development of new products that can realize both effective resource utilization and reliable product quality for a
sustainable and abundant future society, to become the No. 1 engineering plastic solutions provider.
*Certification provided by Underwriters Laboratory (UL), a third-party product safety and environmental assessment organization, which signifies that the product complies with North American safety requirements.

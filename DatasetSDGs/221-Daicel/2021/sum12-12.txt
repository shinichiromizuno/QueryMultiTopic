Initiatives on Chemicals Management
Under the Daicel Group Basic Policies for Responsible Care, the Daicel Group implements chemicals management based on risks that arise across the product life cycle, from development and manufacturing to use, consumption, and disposal. We maintain compliance with domestic and international laws and regulations on chemical product management by gathering information on the latest regulatory trends and revisions and by periodically holding exchanges to share information on regulations governing chemical products.
Initiatives for Enhancing Product Quality
The Daicel Group seeks to ensure and enhance quality based on its Quality Policy. We also pursue continuous improvement by developing a quality management system supervised by the general manager of each production site.
We respond to complaints and inquiries from customers by conducting a primary investigation to verify process failures and signs of abnormality at each stage and promptly provide feedback. Furthermore, we work to prevent a recurrence by following up with investigations into the causes of the incident or leakage and implement corrective and preventive action.

At the entrance on the first floor of our head office, works of art and paper products featured in our public relations magazine TSUNAGU are displayed, providing a space for communication that visiting business partners and lo- cal residents can freely enjoy. In its 10th installation, we exhibited Receipt Art by modern artist Mr. VIKI. Receipt Art is a work of drawings on receipts that makes use of the characteristic of thermal paper that turns black when heated. The 11th installation featured paper textile works by artist Ms. Naoko Senoo. Paper textile is fabric woven using yarn spun from Japanese paper. The textile has the warmth inherent to natural materials.

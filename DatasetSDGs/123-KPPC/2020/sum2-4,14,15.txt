The Organization dispatches athletes to elementary schools in each area to provide extracurricular lessons about the importance of clean water, air, and the earth while enjoying sports. In fiscal 2019, the athletes held baseball and running classes for school children of an elementary school in Chuo-ku, To- kyo, where the KPP Groupâ€™s head office is located. At the environmental classes that followed, the children learned that an environment blessed with clean air and water is indispensable for playing sports. The KPP Group co- sponsors the activities of the Organization in support of their concept of offer- ing environmental education and realizing social contribution through sport.

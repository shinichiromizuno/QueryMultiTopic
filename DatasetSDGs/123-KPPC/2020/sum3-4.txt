Every year, KPP subsidiary Narumiya Kami-shoji Co., Ltd. which produces Sendaiâ€™s Tanabata decorations, displays them at the entrance of our head office as an opportunity for local residents to actually see its activities.
In 2019, children of the local Pocket Land Akashicho Nursery School and the Akashi Kindergarten again visited our head office and enjoyed viewing the Tanabata bamboo decorations, wrote their wishes on the tanzaku papers and tied them to the bamboo trees. During Halloween, kinder- garten children in costumes visited our office and our em- ployees treated them to Halloween candy. These are some of the increasing opportunities for exchange.

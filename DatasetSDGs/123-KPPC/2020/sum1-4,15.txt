Since 2015, the KPP Group has been supporting the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust. It is an organization focused on facilitating peopleâ€™s under- standing of the intrinsic roles of forests through activities to conserve forests, which are the main resource of paper. The Trust also protects and nurtures healthy forests which is the habitat for various forms of life, and promotes research and restoration of satoyama, a symbiosis model of humans and nature. The 7th KPP General Exhibition featured a lecture by Mr. C.W. Nicol, who passed away in April 2020, and introduced the activities of the Trust to many visitors.

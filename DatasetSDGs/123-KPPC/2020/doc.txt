 History of KPP
Since our foundation in 1924, the KPP Group has contributed to the development of society and culture through the sale of paper and its peripheral products
In the history spanning 96 years since our foundation in 1924, we solidified our foundation in the domestic business through mergers with major Japanese paper distributors as a pioneer in industry reorganization after the prewar early peri- od, postwar chaotic period, and high economic growth period. In our Long-term Management Vision, GIFT+1 2024, which finalizes in fiscal 2024, we have successfully listed our shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and wel- comed major overseas paper distributors into the KPP Group in an effort to accelerate our overseas business expansion. Going forward, we will continue developing our business globally and keep taking on the challenge of achieving the second period of expansion.

 Totally Recycling-oriented Business Model
The KPP Group is now building a recycling-oriented business model so that the Group’s business activities themselves are contributions to the creation of a sustainable society. We are expanding our business through the promotion of two ways of recycling: material recycling that supplies recycled resources such as recovered paper, and thermal recycling that supplies renewable energy mainly through our biomass power plant operation support services.
Material Recycling
With a global network of approximately 1,200 suppliers and some 2,400 customers, we boast industry-leading paper sales and collection volume of recovered paper domestically. In the paper sales business, we leverage the vast knowledge in pa- per and peripheral materials that has been cultivated throughout our nearly 100-year history to propose wide-ranging solu- tions. We also utilize our nationwide supply network of recovered paper wholesalers and paper recovery solutions such as Town ecomo and Office ecomo.
If we compare the Group’s business model to the flow of blood, the flow of paper manufactured from forest resources to consumers can be regarded as arteries, and the flow of paper collected after the paper completed its initial role and is de- livered to manufacturers as recovered paper to be used as raw materials as veins. In order to realize a sustainable society, it is important to circulate the flows of arteries and veins without stagnation. The Group plays the role of the heart that con- trols the flow of blood circulating through the arteries and veins.
Thermal Recycling
In addition to paper recycling, in 2017, we started the thermal recycling business that supplies, collects and uses thermal energy generated when wood scraps and unused wood are incinerated. As part of the thermal recycling business, in Octo- ber 2019, we started a demo test of BMecomo, an operation support system utilizing IoT technology for biomass power plants. We will continue to expand our thermal recycling business in an effort to promote the utilization of unused resources and the revitalization of local industries.

The Group is working on supplying biomass fuel such as wood scraps and unused wood as well as developing an operation support system that uses plant IoT technology for biomass power plants, called BMecomo. The Group has started a demo test of BMecomo at Biomass Power Technologies Inc., a company operating a biomass pow- er generation business based in the city of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture since October 2019, helping the biomass power plant to maximize its profitability by utilizing advanced technologies and fully visualizing its operations. Our BMecomo website explains its services and shares examples of deployment in order to facilitate the understand- ing of more consumers.
    Sales of pulp
Global network with pulp suppliers
The Group also serves as a link between suppliers of pulp, which are raw materials for paper, and papermaking companies. In emerging countries, demand for disposable diapers and toilet paper is expected to increase due to population growth and rising living standards, and the global pulp market is expanding. We will strengthen pulp sales by leveraging our broad overseas network, which we have developed over years of sales activities, as well as the relationship of trust we have cultivated with domestic and overseas pulp manufacturers.
Furthermore, in response to growing demand for forest-certified paper amid growing environmental awareness in recent years, the Group has acquired distribution processing certification (CoC certification) by two of the world’s largest forest certification bodies (FSC®, PEFC), and is actively expanding sales of forest-certified pulp and paper.

We boast a variety of supply sources including not only major manufacturers in Japan but also those overseas. Our customers also include major end-users traded directly, and our customers’ business fields also span wide-ranging industries. In addition, we operate a wholesale merchant organization in Japan comprising wholesalers (second-ti- er wholesalers) specializing in small-lot sales. The Group leverages these networks to provide upstream with re- al-time information and market needs and users with the latest product development information, among others.

The KPP Group plays the role of recovering paper through its paper recovery network spanning the entire country, and supplying recovered paper directly to papermaking companies. In addition, our ecomo series, or KPP Group’s proprietary paper recovery solution, include Town ecomo and Office ecomo, as well as ecomo Closed Recycle Service. Town ecomo is a system for recovering paper from households and recycling them. Dedicated collection boxes are installed at local supermarkets, retail stores, and other locations. Consumers bring old newspapers and magazines with them when they visit these stores for shopping and leave what they brought in these boxes. Office ecomo brings the dedicated collection boxes to offices, for collecting confidential documents while protecting se- curity of the documents, and recycling them. ecomo Closed Recycle Service provides tailor-made recycling solu- tions to major corporate customers.

 Messages from the Management
We would like to express our deepest sympathies to those suffering from COVID-19 and those affected by the Heavy Rain Event of July 2020. We hope for the earliest possible recovery and restoration of the disaster-stricken areas. We would also like to express our heartfelt respect to those who are devoted to preventing the spread of infection, giving medical treatment, and restoring the disaster-stricken areas.
In July 2020, I took office as Chairman and CEO of Kokusai Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd. (KPP). Going forward, I will focus on reforming the business portfolio of the entire Group, centered on overseas operating companies, particularly in businesses that transcend traditional paper and the Japanese market through M&As. In addition, I hope to take the initiative in formulating medium-to long-term strategies, group governance, and projects to foster and develop operating companies spanning the five continents of the world.
Daido Yoshiten Ltd., our predecessor, was founded in 1924, and merged with Nichia Co., Ltd. in 1999 in a move to pioneer the reorganization of the paper distribution industry. The company then merged with Hattori Paper & Board Ltd., Kashiwai Shigyo Co., Ltd. and Sumisho Paper Co., Ltd., in 2006, 2007 and 2013, respectively, to solidify our foundation in Japan. Hattori Paper & Board has particular significance in that it was established in 1659 and is considered to be one of the origins of the paper industry in Japan. In recent years, we successively acquired leading paper distributors Spicers Limited (Australia) and Antalis S.A. (France) in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As the domestic industry loses momentum, we believe that expanding business scale through M&As is a prerequisite for competing in the world.

KPP Group Way
History of Paper and Overview of the Pulp and Paper Industry
The history of paper, the core product of the Group, goes back to the late Egyptian civilization around 3000 B.C. The prototype of paper that is widely used today is said to be an invention of Cai Lun, a Chinese eunuch court official of the Eastern Han dynasty, in the first half of the 2nd centu- ry. According to the Nihon Shoki, or the Chronicles of Ja- pan, paper, one of China’s four major inventions, was introduced to Japan in 610. Ever since, the culture of pa- per has continued through time, when the mainstream of papermaking shifted from manual to machine in the Meiji period (1868-1912), marking the era of mass production. After that, Japan went through a period when paper was placed under government control during the Pacific War, the Sanpaku or Three-Whites economic boom (involving white commodities such as paper, sugar and cement) in 1952, the bubble economy in the early 1990s, and the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, as the advent of the Internet substantially changed the way people live in the 21st century, demand for paper, which had been largely linked to GDP growth in the past, has begun to di- verge from the traditional pattern.
On the other hand, growing environmental awareness has attracted people’s attention to paper, which is a bio- mass resource, and demand for paper for packaging ap- plications is increasing along with the growth of the EC* market. Recently, demand for household paper has been expanding due to heightened hygiene awareness brought about by the spread of COVID-19, and this trend has served as a tailwind for the pulp business which produces pulp as raw material for household paper. In addition, as a result of growing remote work arrangements, sales at con- venience stores and bookstores in central Tokyo are strug- gling, while sales at suburban stores are steady. The food and beverage industry is changing its business structure from one focused on eating out to eating at home, and the success of players in the apparel industry has now come to depend on whether they carry loungewear. All industries now have to address how to adapt to life with COVID-19.
In the paper industry as well, paper-free operations are being promoted in line with the growth of remote work ar- rangements, but it is unlikely that all business communica- tions can be completed by web conferences and e-mail only. Such an environment will not induce new innovations. Demand for graphic paper is declining, particularly in de- veloped countries. In the future, it will be important for us to identify the new role and position for paper to take on as its demand structure changes, which is also the most important task for the paper distribution industry.

KPP Group Way
To overcome global challenges, such as the U.S. - China conflict and COVID-19, while we need to weather the storm in front of us, drawing up a long-term strategy in view of the new world after COVID-19 is more important. The KPP Group Way* was established as a guiding princi- ple to enable the Group to find the right path to follow and achieve sustainable growth even during periods of turmoil under drastic changes in the external environment. Com- prising three layers of Management Philosophy, Guidelines for Corporate Conduct-KPP Group and Management Vi- sion, the Group Way serves as a compass for developing strategies of the Group. The KPP Group Way also plays an important role in responding to changes not only in the external environment but also in our internal environment. The respective mergers of Spicers Limited and Antalis S.A. in 2019 and 2020 are typical examples of significant changes in the Group’s internal environment. It is import- ant for KPP to share common milestones, such as the Group Way, with the two companies which are geographi- cally far and different in cultural background from KPP, to generate a synergy as one group.
*KPP Group Way is a basic concept that is shared by all employees of the KPP Group and underlies all our activities as a shared value, comprising three layers of Management Philos- ophy, Guidelines for Corporate Conduct-KPP Group and Management Vision.

Long-term Management Vision GIFT+1 2024
The KPP Group developed the Long-term Manage- ment Vision GIFT+1 2024, which will culminate in the year 2024, the 100th anniversary of our founding. This management vision, which is the driving force behind the KPP Group Way, is to achieve our goals through three successive three-year plans. The Group has po- sitioned the first medium-term management plan from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018 as the period for business structural reform. During this period, the Company re- structured its overseas business, reformed its person- nel system, and strengthened its corporate governance, and successfully listed our shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), which was our long-time ambition. The second medi- um-term management plan, which began in fiscal 2019, is positioned as a business development phase, and we are implementing an inorganic strategy mainly through overseas M&As. The third medium-term man- agement plan is the period for business completion, aiming to develop the Group into one of the world’s largest paper-related distribution companies as we mark the 100th anniversary of founding.
In the last two years, our inorganic strategy has de- livered significant results as a pivotal element of our Long-term Management Vision GIFT+1 2024. Follow- ing the acquisition of Spicers, the second-largest pa- per distributor in Australia, in July 2019, Antalis, the top paper distributor in Europe, joined the KPP Group in July 2020. Spicers has offices in 12 cities in
Australia and New Zealand, has 11 distribution cen- ters, and in March 2020 acquired Australia’s third-larg- est paper distributor, Direct Paper. Antalis operates more than 100 offices and distribution bases in Eu- rope, South America, Asia, and China.
With the addition of these companies to the Group, the Group’s overseas sales ratio is expected to ex- ceed 50% in the future. In addition, the gross profit margin of our overseas business will rise from 6% to nearly 15% due to a change in the business mix. Fur- thermore, we will have some of the world’s leading brand owners as customers, which will transform the Group into a company that has a different corporate profile from the one in the past.
Growth Strategy of the Group
The Group supplies pulp and recovered paper, which are raw material for papermaking, along with the sales of paper and paperboard products. The world’s pro- duction of paper and paperboard is approximately 400 million tons, but considering the added value generated from the base paper, the pulp and paper industry a huge market. In 2019, Japan’s market size was approximately 25.30 million tons, merely account- ing for slightly more than 6% of the global market, and we expect the Japanese market to shrink further due to factors such as a decline in the total population and the advancement of aging society with falling birth rates. Therefore, as a means to secure sustainable

growth of the Group, expanding our business into global markets such as emerging countries and devel- oping countries, which are more than a dozen times larger than Japan and have latent demand in paper and paperboard, has become an important task for us to pursue in our growth strategy. The listing of our shares on the First Section of TSE in 2018 was a steppingstone to this end.
Our expansion into global markets basically adopts M&As with a view to maximizing synergies with our

existing overseas business locations. At the same time, we gain many benefits from building a global supply chain. The Group believes that the paper dis- tribution industry will shift from an era of domestic re- organization to an era of reorganization across the world. The Group will ride this trend and grow into a stronger and more distinctive company.
For the Asian market, we will group India+ASEAN regions as one market, and invest the management resources of Spicers, Antalis, and KPP into the market

Messages from the Management
    to develop the Group into a company with a strong presence centered on the paper business, the pack- aging business, and the visual communication busi- ness. For the Chinese market, we will pursue business growth through Keishin Papers Trade (Shanghai) and Antalis (Shanghai). We also position the developing sub-Saharan and other African markets as promising markets for the Group to pursue in the future.
Until now, the Group’s overseas business has been centered on the trading business, and has grown by harnessing its two strengths: the advantage of high- end Japan brand products with high added value and the function of adjusting the balance of domestic sup- ply and demand. In the 2000s, however, price compe- tition became the norm due to the remarkable rise of China and the commoditization of paper, and trade-centric growth is beginning to fade. Therefore, when considering our overseas strategies in the fu- ture, it will be important for us to develop a hybrid business model. We shall take up business portfolio reforms being pursued by paper distributors in Europe and the United States as well as localization through local production and consumption in emerging coun- tries, and incorporate the trading business to bridge paper supplies of net exporter countries and net im- porter countries.
What We Aim for by M&As
In the background of our ongoing efforts to promote an inorganic strategy is the fact that our two major
businesses, the wholesale paper and paperboard business in domestic locations and the overseas trad- ing business have lost momentum, and the develop- ment of a new business model underpinned by regional and product strategies has become a press- ing issue for us. Because of the limitations of our management resources, inorganic growth has become an important management task. M&A is one of the most effective methods in our inorganic strategy, and we are focusing in particular on the acquisition of overseas paper distributors and converters. While the Group’s position ranges upstream and midstream as a trading company, conducting M&As is our effort in the downstream operations to further expand the Group’s business scale to become a leader in the industry as well as to gain and retain end users. Antalis, the ac- quiree through the largest M&A for the Group, is a leading company in Europe, serving the world’s lead- ing brand owners through its packaging business and visual communication business, and has six design centers in Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands.
The merit of a growth strategy taken through M&As is that we can save time with money, but it also comes with risks. At the Group, the Business Strategy Office founded in 2019 and directly reporting to the CEO is responsible for controlling the entire M&A process from the initial examination stage up to post-merger integration, with a dedicated team of finest personnel managing all projects. Moreover, we have developed the guidelines Standard Procedures for Strategic In- vestment designed to standardize the steps taken in M&A processes to prevent the office members from
relying on their personal experiences and intuitions in these processes. All investment projects are carefully evaluated by the Investment Committee in terms of both opportunity and risk, and decisions are ultimately made through close examination by outside directors.
Sustainability Strategy
The words ESG and SDGs seem to have been famil- iarized in Japan. Recently, however, as seen in the term “SDG-washing*,” there are cases in which only the 17 goals in SDGs and relevance to the business are stated with little substance. The Group defined “+1 (plus one)” of the management vision GIFT+1* as en- vironmental initiatives, and aims to conduct business on the premise of reducing the environmental impact. Specifically, we are developing a new paper recovery system called ecomo series*, and supplying recovered paper to papermaking companies as raw materials by organizing a nationwide network of recovered paper wholesalers. In other words, the fact that our core do- mestic business is built on a recycling-based business of recovering paper and selling products is one of the strengths of the Group.
Regarding governance, we have worked to strengthen our governance system by, for example, shifting to a company with an audit committee in 2015 and increasing the number of independent outside di- rectors to four in 2019. As we continue to expand globally, importance will increase for group gover- nance and compliance serving as its foundation. In Japan, inappropriate sales activities at a major finan- cial institution, noncompliance by a major real estate agent and other problems surfaced last year, and sub- stantially impaired the corporate value of the compa- nies involved. As we strive to further strengthen our business activities overseas, we need to draw a les- son from these incidents and ensure that the concept of group governance is fully inculcated within the Group. While putting in place an internal control sys- tem within the Group is a must, it is essential that we have our philosophy and visions shared across the Group and identify the dos and don’ts for each work- place. Governance has no bounds or perfection. We just have to repeat simple and steady improvements in accordance with changes emerging across the Group.

Talents the Group is Looking For
The Group is currently striving to achieve our long- term management vision towards the goal of 2024 as the 100th anniversary of its founding. At the same time, we must consider what kind of talents are need- ed to help us lay the foundation for the next 100 years. What the Group needs to do is to procure glob- al talents with a broad perspective underpinned by well-rounded education and knowledge as well as specialized knowledge in our industry. I look forward to seeing excellent management personnel emerging from overseas group companies regardless of nation- ality in the future.
In addition, we encourage Group employees who take on roles at the heart of management to become a “T-shaped employee” with deep expertise and a broad perspective and to take e-learning courses of- fered as part of the Group’s employee training pro- gram. Recently, EdTech* is rapidly evolving partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, creating an environment where motivated workers can easily acquire skills with less time and hassle than before. In addition, as a re- sult of overseas M&As, Group employees now com- prise approximately 1,000 Japanese and more than 4,500 foreign employees, making English or other for- eign languages a necessity for work. On top of that, in order to create new value through innovation, we also need to have good judgement backed by first-hand experience gained in the field. Moreover, I look for- ward to seeing the Group turning into a stronger orga- nization where employees from diverse backgrounds, of different languages and with various character traits ranging from sharp-witted to peace-loving, work to- gether to produce the best possible results while mu- tually respecting each other’s unique skills such as the ability to make a breakthrough and coordination skills.
Positions in the Group are open to all Group em- ployees. We hope to fulfill the expectations of our many stakeholders who support the KPP Group by bringing out the engagement and high performance of our employees around the world.

Messages from the Management
   Message from New President
I succeeded Madoka Tanabe, currently Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, and became President of the KPP Group in July 2020. My mission as President is to steadily promote the long-term management vision GIFT+1 2024 to mark the 100th anniversary of our founding in 2024, and lay the foundation for the century beyond that. Specifically, we aim to restructure domestic operations, carry out operational and logistics reforms, and build a core system. I am taking office as President when we are timewise half way through GIFT+1 2024, our long-term management vision launched in fiscal 2016. We have successfully listed our shares on the First Section of TSE in 2018, and have been making steady progress by successively adding leading overseas paper distributors to the KPP Group in 2019 and 2020. However, the spread of COVID-19 has forced businesses in and out of Japan to adjust to “the new normal” this fiscal year, further accelerating the ongoing digitization trend. Amid rapid changes in the social situation, we are restructuring our business to achieve our long-term management vision. I would appreciate your guidance and support in my efforts.

Review of Fiscal 2019 and Trends in This Year
In fiscal 2019, the Japanese economy declined due to the effects of the consumption tax hike and natural di- sasters, despite some favorable factors such as the boom of inbound demand from foreign visitors. The global economy has also receded worldwide due to the heightened uncertainty brought about by the U.S.-China conflict and sluggish growth in trade and investment. In the domestic market of the pulp and paper industry, the evolution of information technology has been promoting paper-free operations, and the focus of demand for paper is shifting from graphic pa- per for printing and publishing purposes to packaging paper for packaging materials applications. Looking at the overseas markets, developed countries are show- ing trends similar to those of the domestic market. On the other hand, in emerging countries, demand for pulp is increasing due to the expansion of the house- hold paper and sanitary paper markets, and demand for recovered paper, the raw material for paperboard, is also rising. Furthermore, in response to the problem of marine plastic pollution, petroleum-based plastic products have come under increased scrutiny and, as a result, paper resources which are biomass-based have begun to attract public attention. Under these circumstances, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Group achieved net sales of 381,397 million yen, a decrease of 0.9% year on year, operating in- come of 1,850 million yen, a decrease of 18.9%, and ordinary income of 2,194 million yen, a decrease of 12.9%.
With the COVID-19 crisis showing no sight of con- tainment this fiscal year, the pulp and paper industry is experiencing unprecedented hardship since a state of emergency was declared in April 2020. In the graphic paper field, demand decreased for paper-me- dia advertising, and also for printing and communica- tion paper due to growing remote work arrangements. In the packaging paper field, there has been a sharp decline in demand for packaging paper for souvenirs, which had been sustained by inbound demand from foreign visitors. However, there are signs of recovery in demand as measures to deal with COVID-19 have begun to penetrate society and a series of economic measures have been taken by the government.
Important Points of the Second Medium-term Management Plan
COVID-19 is a major issue affecting all nations around the world, which has also brought a significant impact
on trends in the pulp and paper market and caused a dramatic decline in demand for printing and communi- cation paper and other graphic paper. There is no prospect of an end to the spread of COVID-19. After the so-called “new normal” lifestyle takes root, con- ventional business models may become obsolete. Pa- permakers are shifting their production lines from paper to paperboard in a large scale across the world, and in Japan as well, shipment volume of paperboard began to exceed that of paper in 2020. To overcome these significant changes in the environment, we have identified the following three points as critical areas to focus on in the ongoing second medium-term man- agement plan.
Firstly, we need to focus on global strategy. Initially, we planned to gradually increase our overseas sales ratio toward the goal year. However, in light of the im- pact of the rapid digitization and the declining birth- rate and aging population, we put an inorganic strategy to full operation last year, and expect the overseas sales ratio to approach 50% in the future. In order to lead the pulp and paper industry as one of the world’s leading paper distributors in the future, the whole Group needs to join forces to solve problems and challenges.
Secondly, we must focus on developing and com- mercializing closed-cycle services and biomass power plant operation support systems as part of our solu- tions business. Closed Recycle Service is a new ser- vice for ecomo series of recycling systems promoted by the Group. Specifically, this system involves the in- tegrated management of the recycling process in which we sell paperboard base paper to users, recov- er used paperboard boxes made from the base paper, and return the paperboard as recovered paper to pa- permaking companies to be used as raw materials. This is an initiative that can only be realized by a trad- ing company with networks both upstream and down- stream, and I am proud that it is also an exemplary case of practicing the concept of circular economy.
In the solutions business, we are also promoting the development and commercialization of a biomass power plant operation support system called BMeco- mo. This is an operation control system that deploys IoT and AI, and has been in full-scale operation since April 2020. We hope to expand our horizons not only in Japan but also to overseas markets including India and ASEAN countries where the biomass power gen- eration business is being promoted.
Thirdly, we will focus on the pulp business. In the domestic sanitary paper field, demand is expected to rise in the “new normal” environment, and we will strengthen sales in this field mainly through stepping up sales to household papermaking companies. Also in emerging countries, the market for household and

Messages from the Management
sanitary paper including tissue paper, paper towels and diapers is expected to expand. In addition to pro- viding paper for papermaking purposes, the industry is also promoting the development and commercial- ization of new materials such as cellulose nanofiber besides conventional rayon. With an eye on these do- mestic and overseas demands, the Group would like to find a path to thrive as a global supplier.
Restructuring of Domestic Business
In order to restructure our domestic business, it is es- sential for us to reduce the 3Ms (Muri (unreasonable), Muda (wasteful), Mura (uneven)) of existing businesses in Japan, and realize low-cost organizational opera- tions with an efficient work style without overtime. Thereby, we shall provide valuable services in a shrinking market for paper for graphic applications and become competitive enough to expand our share. To this end, we launched the Operational Reform Proj- ect this year. At the same time, we are promoting lo- gistic reforms spearheaded by our Logistics Strategy Office in order to improve the efficiency of logistics operations across the Company and to ensure that we fulfill our customers’ needs in a timely manner.
Another point that we are focusing on is the estab- lishment of a company-wide cross-sectional organiza- tion. Last year, we launched Green Biz Project. Under this project, all employees across the Group have been working to develop and distribute products that
help resolve the marine plastic pollution problem. We need to change our organizational structure so that we can leverage our nationwide network for functions such as logistics and purchasing by shifting our busi- ness structure from a vertical one, where businesses are conducted separately by division, to a cross-divi- sional organization. We intend to build an organization that can cater to a variety of customers by adapting to the needs of the world, not by vertical divisions but by horizontal lines. In addition, as one of the Group synergies, we are considering incorporating the pack- age solutions business and visual communication business promoted by new Group companies Spicers and Antalis into the Japanese market to provide ser- vices with higher value.
Digital Transformation
These days, it is not an overstatement to say that dig- ital transformation (DX) is the key to a company’s suc- cess. The KPP Group has therefore developed the IT medium-term plan and is systematically promoting wider use of IT across the Group. To make a fresh start, we reviewed and restarted the building of the new core system, which is the foundation of our digi- tal transformation. In order to connect the entire Group horizontally in the future and enable free and flexible use of data within the Group, we cannot do away with building this new core system. We are de- termined to get this done through the united efforts of
all Group employees. In preparation for the develop- ment of the new core system, we have significantly reinforced our IT division in recent years through on- going recruitment of external candidates with exper- tise and assigning highly capable employees with field experience and insight to the division.
Role of Paper in Digital Society
As mentioned so far, the advent of a digital society has had both positive and negative effects on the pulp and paper industry. Printing and publishing papers belong to a product category that has suffered severe damage from the digitization of society, but no matter how much IT adoption and diffusion will progress in the future, printing and publishing papers will never cease to exist. Recently, advances in digital technolo- gy have made it extremely easy for people to create and diffuse fake news. Conversely, facts may be con- cealed by others as the inconvenient truth through control of the Internet. Under these circumstances, I believe that the role played by paper-based media will become increasingly more critical.
In addition, flyers and publications have continued to decline due to the impact of digitization. Recently, however, cross-media marketing, which maximizes the effect of advertising by combining multiple media such as paper and digital media, has become the mainstream, and this trend has made the public real- ize the importance of paper media once again.
Cross-media marketing uses traditional media such as magazines, newspapers, flyers, television, and radio, as well as social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Experiments targeting companies also show that in- cluding paper-based direct mails makes a marketing campaign more effective than the one only using email and other digital means. The symbiotic relationship between analog media such as paper and digital me- dia may become stronger in the future.
To Our Stakeholders
In Japan, over 60% of paper is made using recovered paper as raw material, and the rest are mainly from planted forests and thinned timber. Therefore, the pa- per industry in Japan is regarded as a role model in recycling. The Group is committed to be a provider of value to society by establishing a recycling system for materials centered on paper resources. As expressed in our management philosophy, we will keep striving to meet societal demands by contributing to the reali- zation of a recycling-oriented society and promoting education, culture, and industry. In closing, I appreci- ate the continued support of our shareholders, inves- tors and all of our other valued stakeholders.

Net sales in Southeast Asia decreased year on year due to factors such as the stagnant market, declining demand, and smaller sales volume caused by our move to narrow down buyers. In East Asia, net sales grew year on year thanks to an increase in sales of coated paper and paperboard in Hong Kong and an increase in exports of containerboard. Net sales in China grew slightly year on year due to a significant increase in the sales volume of uncoated woodfree paper and coated paper, although the Chinese market continued softening from the second half of the previous year as a result of the U.S.-China trade friction.

In the office building market of major cities throughout Japan, the demand for of- fice space in the existing buildings remained strong thanks to relocations to larger offices and increases in floor space within the same buildings. In addition, many new buildings enjoyed a high occupancy rate. As a result, the average vacancy rate remained low, reinforcing the upward trend of rents.
Under these circumstances, the KPP Group maintained high occupancy rates including in its mainstay KPP Yaesu Building, and increased rent income by revis- ing rent and taking other measures.

ecomo Closed Recycle Service
Forms of closed recycling depend on the customer’s business content, business format and needs. As a profes- sional in paper distribution, the Group provides customized solutions including proposals and development of recycling schemes that are sustainable, rational and feasible, based on a thorough understanding of our cus- tomers’ businesses, products, services, and requirements.

  BMecomo
In addition to solar power, wind power and geo- thermal power, biomass power generation has become widely recognized as a method of gen- erating electricity from renewable energy. The KPP Group offers an operation support system aimed to help operation control, facilities man- agement and business administration of biomass power plants by utilizing advanced technologies such as AI and IoT.
  Green Biz Project
  Marine pollution from plastic waste has become a major problem worldwide. In Japan, however, more and more companies are now using paper straws and paper bags in place of plastic ones, particularly in the retail and restaurant industries, helping accelerate moves to reduce environmental impact. At the Group, a company-wide team mainly comprising younger employees launched Green Biz Project to help resolve the marine plastic pollu- tion problem. The team is working to develop and distribute alternative materials and products that consider vari- ous viewpoints such as promotion of paper solutions, reduction of plastic use and introduction of bio plastics.
Operational Reform Project
To become a company that is highly competitive and capable of sustainable growth in the global environment, we need to reduce 3Ms of Muri (unreasonable), Muda (wasteful), Mura (uneven) in our businesses in Japan, and real- ize low-cost organizational operations through efficient work practices. To this end, we launched the Operational Reform Project this year, and as its first stage, we are working on tasks such as examining the Group’s existing work processes and promoting an even distribution of workload.
What is ecomo?
ecomo is an exemplary initiative under the Group’s totally recycling-oriented business model. ecomo means “eco” and “to bring” (mottekuru in Japa- nese) and expresses the idea of “eco + model (in other words, a new eco model)”.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, net sales in the wholesale pulp and pa- per, domestic locations reached 290,738 million yen (down 6.9% year on year) and segment income came to 4,088 million yen (down 10.5% year on year). There is a growing trend in the pulp and paper industry in Japan, wherein paper demand is shifting from graphic paper, used for newspaper and commercial printing, to packaging paper. In the ongoing second medium-term management plan, we are working on strengthening the earnings structure of the paper and paperboard business from both sides of the business spectrum: reducing nega- tive effects by streamlining business processes and logistics and increasing pos- itive effects through developing high value added products by demonstrating the power of imagination and creativity*. The Green Biz Project, a companywide project for development and distribution of products that contribute to the solu- tion of the marine plastic pollution problem, is starting to produce results, such as the paper-based clear folder, one of its first products to be commercialized. While the field of paper raw material depends on market conditions to a certain extent, we will continue to increase the handling of recovered pulp and paper, and further expand the totally recycling-oriented business model. The solutions business has added ecomo Closed Recycle Service and BMecomo to the Group’s ecomo series*. We will continue to proactively work on solving environ- mental and social issues so as to protect the global environment while striving to enrich peoples’ lives and leave no one behind.

In Focus Messages from Group Companies Spicers (Joined the KPP Group in 2019)
A year after joining the KPP group, here’s another message from David Martin CEO and Director.
Q1. Looking back on the year since joining the KPP Group
A: Spicers and KPP have worked closely in defining the opportunities for our profitable growth together, and the progress has been strong. Our acquisition and integration of Direct Paper in March, 2020 has been very successful, helping deliver a profit in a very challenging year. We have similar opportunities planned to ensure the strong growth of our business.
Q2. About synergistic effect with KPP
A: The synergies of supply potential and new products to market is where most synergies can be felt. Spicers making the most of supply and growth alternatives has been especially beneficial. DaiEi operating from the same office has also provided a synergy for the group on costs.
Q3. About future development
A: We are investing further in Sign & Display, Packaging and Food Services segments and we can see the mix of our business shifting quickly towards products we did not have in our range 2 years ago. We all need to be dynamic in a changing market and searching for new sectors to serve, and new products to deliver, must be our focus for us to prosper into the future.
Antalis (Joined the KPP Group in 2020)
Antalis S.A. was founded in 2000 through the merger and spin-off of 40 distributors specializing in paper and visual communication affiliated with the papermaking compa- ny, Arjowiggins Group.
Today, Antalis is a leading paper distributor that offers packaging and visual commu- nication solutions in 39 countries in Europe, South America and Asia. The strengths of our company lie in its wide and diverse range of products and solutions, having many experts who have vast knowledge of customization and their specialized fields as our employees, and offering advanced and innovative logistics services through 117 distri-
bution centers throughout the world.
For instance, our six packaging design
centers offer more than 10,000 tailor-made packaging solutions per year, with a quick turnaround, by conducting research and design processes utilizing 2D and 3D software.
Joining the KPP Group is an important strategic step for us. Tak- ing this step will allow us to strengthen our company’s profitability through synergetic effects of businesses between the two compa- nies in the future even during the global economic crisis caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. As a member of the KPP Group, we will create more new value than competitors on both sales and pur- chase fronts.

 Basic Policies for the Overseas Business
1 Promoting Inorganic Growth
Expand business domains through acquisition of external management resources
Acquire paper wholesalers overseas (Spicers Limited of Australia, Antalis S.A. of France, etc.)
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, net sales in the wholesale pulp and pa- per, overseas locations came to 89,446 million yen (up 25.1% year on year) and segment income was 179 million yen (up 495.0% year on year). While our struc- tural reforms of the overseas business have started bearing fruit in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, and made it possible for the segment to record profits, Spicers Limited, which joined the Group in 2019, significantly contributed to earnings in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. In the second medium-term management plan, which is in its second year, in addition to Spicers, we will ex- pand globally together with Antalis S.A., a new Group member. Both Spicers and Antalis have strengths in the inventory-carrying business, package solutions, and visual communication fields. Based on these strengths, we aim to develop businesses with higher added value by leveraging our sales network that covers about 60 countries around the world. The inorganic strategy brought about sig- nificant qualitative and quantitative changes to our Group’s overseas businesses. In the future, we would like to revitalize the business between overseas-based locations, shifting from trade business of exporting from Japan. In addition to this, we will turn our business model into the one focused on direct sales to fields further downstream.

Sustainability Management
Of the three layers of the KPP Group Way comprising the Management Philosophy, the Guidelines for Corporate Conduct, and the Management Vision, we have set sustainable growth as a goal of the Management Philosophy. The Guidelines for Corporate Conduct requires compliance with laws and regulations and the Management Vi- sion includes elements that underpin sustainability management such as Trust and “ + 1” for Environment. While ESG investments have gained traction in recent years, the KPP Group has long been placing emphasis on cor- porate social responsibility (CSR) and incorporating the concept of sustainability such as the sustainability of the environment and society. As we are moving into an era where solving social problems will directly lead to a company’s growth, the KPP Group will continue its efforts to achieve the goals of Working Towards the Realiza- tion of a Sustainable Society, Realizing a Society where Everyone Can Excel, and Developing a Sound Business Foundation based on the KPP Group Way.
Based on our management philosophy of achieving a recycling-oriented society, the KPP Group strives to im- prove our corporate value by helping resolve social issues through our business activities such as material recy- cling and thermal recycling to work towards the realization of a sustainable society. To maintain sustainable business activities, the CSR Committee establishes tasks themed environment, society, governance, and other issues, to turn the PDCA cycle and address them.

 Working Towards the Realization of a Sustainable Society
  Management Approach
As an initiative dubbed Green KPP, the KPP Group pro- motes a totally recycling-oriented business model to build a sustainable society and strives to develop and distribute products that will help solve the marine plastic pollution problem across the board. We implement all activities for reducing our environmental impact under the PDCA cycle based on the environmental management system (EMS) created pursuant to ISO 14001. Furthermore, we have in- cluded SDGs and other issues as external challenges from this fiscal year and are striving to make improvement through the EMS.

Contributing to Sustainable Forest Management
Along with increasing environmental awareness comes greater demand for forest-certified paper produced from properly managed forests. Forest certification systems are a kind of environmental labelling system whereby a certification label is at- tached to timber and other wood products produced from properly managed forests in order to manage them appropriately in all stages of production, processing, and distribution and to promote the sustainable use and preservation of forests. These labels are now often seen in our daily lives. We have acquired from the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC) and the Pro- gramme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) the Chain-of-Custody (CoC) certifications which certify that we identify and separately manage forest-certified paper from other paper during the processing and distribution stages.

Members of the Project exchange opinions ac- tively from various perspectives about topics such as the development and distribution of new products and materials and the building of new business models. The Project’s achievement is growing including the market launch of a paper-based clear folder jointly developed with a major stationery maker in the first year of the Project. The Project is set to expand its activities by making full use of the KPP Group’s sales, procurement, and processing networks.

 Human Resources Initiatives
 Management Approach
The KPP Group considers that employees are the most important asset of a trading company and that an environment which lets them fully un- leash their potential provides the very foundation for sustainable growth. The Human Resources Committee comprising our top executives investi- gates, proposes, and makes decisions on matters related to our organi- zation and human resources in order to develop transparent hiring and performance evaluation systems. Further, the Occupational Safety Com- mittee focuses on improving the workplace environment based on the Guidelines for Corporate Conduct to enable all our employees to work safely with peace of mind. In addition, our human resources division regu- larly conducts employee satisfaction surveys and utilizes the survey re- sults to create a fulfilling workplace environment.
Promoting Diversity
Diversity & Inclusion
and improving work hours appropriately by grasping the actual status of overtime work carried out by our employees and ensuring the implementation of No Overtime Day once or twice a week. Through these measures, we aim to review work contents and identify problems for further improvement in management and help enhance employees’ life satisfaction further. We also offer a certain number of days of special paid leaves to employees who have been working for the Company for a certain number of years as an opportunity for refreshing the mind and body and maintenance and enhancement of health as well as for self-development and boosting the morale.
Strengthening of Health Management
We offer annual health checkups for all employees so that they can continue working in good mental and physical conditions. For employees who are 30 years old and above, we offer health checkups for lifestyle-related diseases and offer advice on healthcare based on their test results. As part of our initiatives for employees’ health, we also hold mental health courses for employees, and the Company’s industrial physicians tour the head office once a month to ask the employees’ about their health status in a system to prevent issues before they occur.

Each one of our employees contribute to the creation of a vibrant corporate culture. We believe that it is important to build a system which encourages all employees to work with motivation and allows them to contribute to the sustainable devel- opment of the Company. To this end, we have introduced a system to fairly evaluate employees who have produced results by optimally utilizing their abilities and skills. To boost employees’ motivation while transforming their awareness and ac- tions, the system provides them with accurate feedback to increase transparency, fairness, and satisfaction of evaluation and offers opportunities not only for the pursuit of achievement but also improvement in both individual abilities and corpo- rate activities.

Enhancement of Measures Including Childcare Leave
We strive to develop an environment in which employees can work without worries while striking a good work-life balance by offering programs that allow our employees to choose different work styles that suit their individual circumstances and needs, including those for leave of absence and shorter working hours for childcare or nursing care. Moreover, in an effort to support the asset formation and lifestyle of each of its employees, the Company maintains various asset formation sys- tems, a stock ownership plan, and recreational facilities. To address the practice of long work hours (overtime), an issue that must be resolved from the viewpoints of productivity improvement and health care management, we focus on managing
Education and Training System for Human Resource Development
Based on the idea that corporate power boils down to the comprehensive strength of the frontline, we have introduced e-learning programs to support employees’ self-de- velopment to maximize individual capability and draw out the ability to flexibly respond to new economic situations and business environments. Our aim in human resource development is to allow individual employees to demonstrate their potential to the maximum so that all employees propel corporate activities on their own initiative. Per- sonnel development starts with new employee training and encourages employees’ autonomous growth through education corresponding to each step such as on-the- job training in the frontline and training by rank. We also encourage employees to par- ticipate in training for improving their specialized skills.

 Initiatives for Local Communities
  Basic Approach
The KPP Group proactively engages in local community-based activities to fulfill its role as a good corporate citizen. Based on the Group’s Guidelines for Corporate Conduct, we will strive to return profit to society through our corporate activities and widely contribute to the development of community and society.
Working with local kindergartens
Every year, KPP subsidiary Narumiya Kami-shoji Co., Ltd. which produces Sendai’s Tanabata decorations, displays them at the entrance of our head office as an opportunity for local residents to actually see its activities.
In 2019, children of the local Pocket Land Akashicho Nursery School and the Akashi Kindergarten again visited our head office and enjoyed viewing the Tanabata bamboo decorations, wrote their wishes on the tanzaku papers and tied them to the bamboo trees. During Halloween, kinder- garten children in costumes visited our office and our em- ployees treated them to Halloween candy. These are some of the increasing opportunities for exchange.
Papermaking class at Miyanomori Elementary School, Higashi-Matsushima City
The Group endorses the Great East Japan Earthquake reconstruction project promoted by the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust. As part of this, we support the cultivation and harvesting of raw materials for Japanese paper and Japanese paper- making lessons at the Miyanomori Elementary School. In 2020, the Group once again invited Mr. Rogier Uitenboogaart, an artist of Japanese handmade paper with ties to the Trust, as a lecturer of the Japanese papermaking workshop. The stu- dents collected kozo (paper mulberry) and mitsumata (Oriental paper bush) planted in the forest at the back of the school building and used them as raw materials for the Japanese paper along with plants and seaweed of Higashi-Matsushima. Through the experience of making their original Japanese paper, students familiarized themselves with traditional Japanese paper and learned about their own living environment. The Group received a letter of gratitude from Miyanomori Elementary School for the educational activity.

   Support for the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust
Since 2015, the KPP Group has been supporting the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust. It is an organization focused on facilitating people’s under- standing of the intrinsic roles of forests through activities to conserve forests, which are the main resource of paper. The Trust also protects and nurtures healthy forests which is the habitat for various forms of life, and promotes research and restoration of satoyama, a symbiosis model of humans and nature. The 7th KPP General Exhibition featured a lecture by Mr. C.W. Nicol, who passed away in April 2020, and introduced the activities of the Trust to many visitors.
TSUNAGU GALLERY
At the entrance on the first floor of our head office, works of art and paper products featured in our public relations magazine TSUNAGU are displayed, providing a space for communication that visiting business partners and lo- cal residents can freely enjoy. In its 10th installation, we exhibited Receipt Art by modern artist Mr. VIKI. Receipt Art is a work of drawings on receipts that makes use of the characteristic of thermal paper that turns black when heated. The 11th installation featured paper textile works by artist Ms. Naoko Senoo. Paper textile is fabric woven using yarn spun from Japanese paper. The textile has the warmth inherent to natural materials.
     Cosponsoring the Environment Athletes Organization
The Organization dispatches athletes to elementary schools in each area to provide extracurricular lessons about the importance of clean water, air, and the earth while enjoying sports. In fiscal 2019, the athletes held baseball and running classes for school children of an elementary school in Chuo-ku, To- kyo, where the KPP Group’s head office is located. At the environmental classes that followed, the children learned that an environment blessed with clean air and water is indispensable for playing sports. The KPP Group co- sponsors the activities of the Organization in support of their concept of offer- ing environmental education and realizing social contribution through sport.

 Messages from Outside Directors
We asked our outside directors about future challenges in raising corporate value.
               April 1983 April 1983 April 1990 June 2014 June 2015
I have been involved in the management of the KPP Group as outside corporate auditor since 2014 and as an outside director serving as an Audit and Supervisory Committee Member thereafter. One of the significant changes the KPP Group has undergone recently is becoming a publicly listed company. This has substantially raised the Company’s social credibility. I feel that the changes brought about by becoming a listed company is more an issue of how the economic community sees the KPP Group, rather than how the KPP Group and its employees see themselves. I hope that not only people involved in the management but also all employ- ees perform their daily duties, bearing in mind that each one is a member of a listed company and they are responsible for living up to the expectations of society, and acting in a disci- plined and proper manner so as not to lose the trust of soci- ety.
The next point to note is that sales of paper, the core of the KPP Group’s business, had already been on a downward trend due to factors such as declining demand and was again hit hard by stagnation of economic activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a further decline in busi- ness performance. Another point is that the structure of the Group’s overseas operations is undergoing a significant change after the acquisition of Spicers in Australian and An- talis in France. In addition, there are issues in China and Hong Kong that require us to substantially change our busi- ness coverage and the nature of transactions there. In such a transitional phase when the world trends post-COVID-19 remains uncertain, and the foundation and mechanism of economic society itself are expected to undergo major changes, it is necessary for businesses to enter a new do- main flexibly and bravely without holding on to conventional business practices.

(As of June 30, 2020)
In this sense, the Company will not be able to grow just by conducting its business activities based on the traditional governance structure. In order to ensure future profitability, I believe that the Company needs to eagerly develop frontier business domains based on new ideas that are unlike any other traditional concepts.
KPP Group is faced with the need to rebuild its core sys- tem. Replacing the core system means that the Group will no longer be able to do business in the same way as it did before. Transformation is also required in that employees will have to change themselves to adapt to more streamlined and faster processing under the new system.
I believe KPP will see a bright future only after addressing all the issues mentioned above. As an outside director and Audit and Supervisory Committee Member, I intend to active- ly express my views on decision-making for entering new domains, not withholding nays when needs must, and re- questing updates on matters of concern. I strive to engage in the management of the KPP Group so that it will transform itself and take a more appropriate and reasonable direction.
I’d like to ask employees of the Group to flexibly respond to drastic changes in society and bravely establish a robust beachhead in a new market in order to lay the foundation and improve the business structure for the KPP Group to continue growing as it moves toward its 100th anniversary and across the century beyond that.

I have been engaged in active discussions at the Board of Directors meetings over the past year based on my experience in sales and business management at a general trading firm and a chemicals manufacturer. In Japan, the Company’s mainstay market, demand is on the decline, and KPP has had to strive to retain businesses in a defensive stance and has yet to take effective measures to improve profitability. In the over- seas market, the Company rapidly expanded its business through large-scale acquisitions of Spicers and Antalis in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and made them its subsidiary. It is important for KPP to successfully integrate these com- panies with different management systems, and use appro- priate governance. At the same time, KPP needs to urgently address the significant fall in demand caused by COVID-19 and the issue of bad debt from Samson Paper Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong. To achieve the long-term management vision GIFT+1 2024 in addition to tackling the issues above, not only will I engage in supervising business execution but also discussion on these management issues as an outside direc- tor to contribute to the KPP Group’s sustainable growth and thus improve its corporate value.
In recent years, KPP has expanded its global share through M&As of overseas firms. The Board of Directors spent much time on discussions about this issue. Amid declining demand for printing and communication paper, KPP needs to urgent- ly reform its business portfolio. The M&A projects conducted are expected to deliver benefits in the form of know-how of the overseas companies on high-value businesses with high growth rate and profitability.
As for key factors for a successful post-merger integra- tion, the Company should establish a management system capable of gaining higher synergetic effects within the Group, improve operational efficiency by harnessing IT, and enhance governance to a level appropriate for a global company. On a more practical note, success will also depend on how KPP will exert its planning and execution skills to enable its front- line workers to understand know-how newly acquired through the M&A and tailor them into products matching the needs of local customers so as to offer value to them. I think that we should monitor the progress of these tasks over the medium- and long-term to achieve sustainable growth of the entire Group in the future.

 Corporate Governance
The KPP Group has prioritized the construction and continual enhancement of corporate governance systems in order to ful- fill the mandate we have received from our stakeholders—including shareholders, customers, business partners, local com- munities, and employees—which is to deliver sustainable growth and mid- to long-term improvement of its corporate value.
In June 2015, we shifted our governance structure to that of a company with an audit committee, moving toward man- agement with greater transparency and improved mobility. Our Audit and Supervisory Committee, of which outside direc- tors comprise a majority, performs auditing and supervision of the legality and appropriateness of business execution. Also, we employ an executive officer system in which directors, who are members of the Board of Directors, handle deci- sion-making and supervision functions while executive officers handle business execution functions. Through this we have clearly differentiated management decision-making and supervisory functions from business execution functions.

Corporate Governance
The KPP Group has constructed a corporate governance system to ensure that decision-making is conducted in a trans- parent, fair, expeditious, and decisive manner with a balance between management supervision and business execution.

  Board of Directors
Ten directors, including four outside directors, make determinations on important management matters and provide supervision on business exe- cution. In order to achieve sustainable growth and mid- to long-term im- provement of corporate value, we are taking advantage of the abundant business experience of our internal directors, as well as the practical and specialized perspectives of our outside directors, working toward the real- ization of appropriate decision-making and management supervision.

 Officer Compensation
Basic Policy Regarding Compensation for Directors, etc.
1. The structure of compensation for directors, etc., takes into account not only their short term business achievements but also their contribu- tions to increasing corporate value. The value they have provided will also be shared with shareholders.
2. The amounts of compensation for directors, etc., are determined in consideration of a balance of various factors such as their achieve- ments and industry trends.
3. The amount of compensation is determined by the board of directors, with pertinent participation and advice from independent outside direc- tors, within the scope of total remuneration determined at General Shareholders’ Meetings.
Compensation Structure
1. Compensation for directors (not including outside directors, or directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members) consists of three categories: the “basic compensation,” “bonuses” and “perfor- mance-linked stock-based compensation.”
2. Compensation for outside directors and directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members, however, consists of the “basic com- pensation” only.
 Audit and Supervisory Committee
The three Audit and Supervisory Committee members with voting rights in the Board of Directors—including two outside directors— work to verify the circumstances and operating conditions of gover- nance, as well as to optimize the functioning of the Board of Directors. Audit and Supervisory Committee members who are employed full- time attend important meetings and offer auditing and supervision of the directors’ performance, including providing their opinions on man- agement in general, or on individual matters, from a fair and impartial standpoint. Further, Audit and Supervisory Committee members hold briefing sessions on a regular basis with the Internal Audit Office, which serves as the internal audit department, and provide instructions as necessary in response to reports on internal control assessment re- garding internal audits and financial reporting. They also coordinate with the Accounting Auditor on a regular basis and receive reports on the progress of audits, and proactively offer opinions and exchange in- formation as needed.
15
Number of meetings in fiscal 2019
Based on compensation limits for directors (excluding those who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members) and directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members that were approved by a resolution of the 144th Ordinary General Sharehold- ers’ Meeting held on June 28, 2018, KPP has established the total amount of compensation, etc., for each category of officer, the total amount of compensation, etc. by type, and number of applicable officers during fiscal 2019 as follows:
 Management Committee
The Company has set up the Management Committee to supplement the Board of Directors. The Committee is made up of the internal Di- rectors of the Board (excluding Audit and Supervisory Committee members), and Executive Officers ranked Managing Executive Officers and above, to discuss business challenges more promptly and in greater detail.

The compensation, etc. paid above includes the amounts of compensation for one Audit and Supervisory Board member (not an Outside Director) and two outside officers for the period they held their positions during the fiscal year under review.
Outside Directors
KPP considers securing managerial independence to be of great importance for the protection of general shareholders. Accordingly, we have formulated our own Criteria for Assessing the Independence of Outside Directors.
At present, we have appointed four independent outside directors.
4/10 (as of June 30, 2020)
  CSR Committee
We have established a CSR Committee chaired by the Chairman & CEO to improve the transparency and reliability of our business activi- ties. It has five subcommittees: the Compliance Committee, Risk Management Committee, Environmental Management Committee, Occupational Safety Committee, and Information Security Committee, which consider various issues and offer proposals for improvement.
 Business Execution Structure
We have introduced an executive officer system in order to enhance the decision-making and supervisory functions of the Board of Direc- tors, as well as to streamline and expedite business execution. Desig- nated duties are performed under the instruction and supervision of the Director of the Board (President & Executive Officer).

Roles of Independent Outside Directors
KPP’s independent outside directors have several primary roles. One is to provide as-needed verification and evaluation of manage- ment performance and the status of activities undertaken by the management team with reference to the management strategy and management plan determined by the Board of Directors. They also judge the propriety and announce their findings of entrust- ing management of KPP to the current management team from a viewpoint considering shareholders’ common interests.
Mr. Yano has held officer positions along with experience in overseas business for many years at operating companies (trading companies and manufacturers). We deemed him to be well-qualified as an outside director whose advice on KPP’s management and supervision of our business execution will be beneficial due to his abundant experience with M&A, post-merger integration (PMI), business reorganization, and restructuring.
Ms. Sagiya has held officer positions along with experience in the business sector at the forefront of the IT industry. We deemed her to be well-qualified as an outside director whose advice on KPP’s management and supervision of our business execution will be beneficial due to her specialized perspective in promoting and expanding the introduction of IT, such as digital transformation.
Mr. Kobayashi is a certified public accountant and tax accountant, and he possesses considerable knowledge in finance, taxation and accounting. We deemed him to be well-qualified as an outside director and Audit and Supervisory Committee member based on his abundant business experience and achievements.
Mr. Nagashima is qualified as a lawyer, possessing considerable knowledge in corporate law and other areas. We deemed him to be well- qualified as an outside director and Audit and Supervisory Committee member based on his abundant business experience and achievements.
Analysis and Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ Efficiency
The KPP Group has analyzed and evaluated the Board of Directors’ efficiency in order to improve the functioning of the Board of Directors as described below:
CSR Organizational Structure
            In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as in the prior fiscal year, the KPP Group cooperated with an outside organiza- tion to survey all directors, shared the survey results and deliberated on the findings at a meeting of the Board of Direc- tors. As a result, the evaluation was made that, the Board of Directors’ efficiency was sufficiently ensured as a whole.
An issue was raised on how agendas were set for Board meetings in the analysis and evaluation conducted in the prior fiscal year. To secure sufficient time to deliberate on topics of greater importance, we are making efforts such as streamlining the agenda content and meeting materials by analyzing agendas and time spent on each item at past Board meetings. However, it was pointed out that there is still room for improvement in areas such as discussion priori- ties and time allocation including continuing the review of criteria for agenda to be submitted. We will continue efforts to improve the Board of Directors and strive to ensure higher efficiency.
 CSR Committee
The KPP Group established a CSR Committee in 2013. It is chaired by the Chairman & CEO and has the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of its subcommittees as members. The CSR Committee receives annual reports and informa- tion on the status of activities by its subcommittees—the Compliance Committee, Risk Management Committee, Environmental Management Committee, Occupational Safety Committee, and Information Security Committee— and considers topics for improvement on an as-needed
basis, working to improve and energize CSR activities comprehensively. In the event that a serious situation were to occur regarding compliance with laws and regulations, the Chairman & CEO would undertake himself appropriate disclosure of information to society and demonstrate ac- countability by working to promptly resolve the issue. Also striving to identify the cause and prevent recurrence of the issue, he would clarify where authority and responsibility lies, and respond rigorously without excluding himself.
Compliance Committee
• Themes for the fiscal year under review: Ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and company rules by embed- ding an awareness of the importance of compliance.
• Activities in the fiscal year under review: Provide ongoing training for employees to raise their awareness of com- pliance, including education on the prevention of insider trading.

  In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Group’s busi- ness results in the first year of the second medium-term management plan were net sales of 381,397 million yen (down 0.9% year on year), operating income of 1,850 million yen (down 18.9% year on year), ordinary income of 2,194 million yen (down 12.9% year on year), and profit attributable to owners of parent of 1,232 million yen (down 50.7% year on year). The equity ratio was 24.9%, slightly below our tar- get of 25%.
In the second medium-term management plan, we are committed to the inorganic strategy, one of the pillars of our growth strategy, particularly cross-border M&As. We have al- ready added major paper distributors, namely Spicers in Australia and Antalis in Europe to the Group, expecting them
Total assets and equity ratio
to significantly contribute to the bottom line of the overseas business.
The KPP Group’s basic stance on capital policy is to seek to improve corporate value and provide stable returns to shareholders. With regard to dividends, we strive to deliver stable and sustained returns to shareholders, targeting basi- cally a dividend payout ratio of 30% or more. Looking ahead, we will strive to increase corporate value over the long term by striking a balance among investments in the inorganic strategy, securing financial soundness, and stable sharehold- er dividends. In the next fiscal year, we expect the overseas business to account for about 50% of net sales, and are committed to further strengthening Group governance.

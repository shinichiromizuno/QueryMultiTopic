The Group endorses the Great East Japan Earthquake reconstruction project promoted by the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust. As part of this, we support the cultivation and harvesting of raw materials for Japanese paper and Japanese paper- making lessons at the Miyanomori Elementary School. In 2020, the Group once again invited Mr. Rogier Uitenboogaart, an artist of Japanese handmade paper with ties to the Trust, as a lecturer of the Japanese papermaking workshop. The stu- dents collected kozo (paper mulberry) and mitsumata (Oriental paper bush) planted in the forest at the back of the school building and used them as raw materials for the Japanese paper along with plants and seaweed of Higashi-Matsushima. Through the experience of making their original Japanese paper, students familiarized themselves with traditional Japanese paper and learned about their own living environment. The Group received a letter of gratitude from Miyanomori Elementary School for the educational activity.

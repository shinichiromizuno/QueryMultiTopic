Corporate Governance Basic Philosophy
KOKUSAI PULP & PAPER CO., LTD. views the establishment of corporate governance and its sustained improvement as important business challenges for responding to the mandate of stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business acquaintances, local community members and employees, and for achieving sustainable growth and enhancing the corporate value in the medium- and long-term.
To make its management more transparent and agile, we made the change to a company with an audit and supervisory committee in June 2015. The Audit and Supervisory Committee, in which Outside Directors of the Board make up the majority, audits and supervises the legality and appropriateness of the way in which we conduct business. In addition, we adopted an executive officer system under which Directors of the Board, who make up the Board of Directors, handle the decision-making and supervisory functions, and Executive Officers perform business execution functions. Through these reforms, we clarified where decision-making and supervisory functions and business execution functions lie within our management organization.

reports. In regards to cooperation with the external accounting auditor, members also actively exchange opinions and information based on reports on the progress of implemented audits with the external accounting auditor on a regular basis and when needed.

Actions toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*
Since fiscal 2018, the Company has been referring to the SDGs in an effort to identify goals in a close relationship with its business, and to fulfill these goals.
Compliance Committee
Themes for the fiscal year under review: Sustained compliance with laws, internal regulations (to ensure full awareness of the importance of compliance)
Activities in the fiscal year under review: The Compliance Committee has been established for two purposes. One is to continuously provide education to prevent insider trading and other training to raise employees’ compliance awareness. The other is to ensure corporate management with a focus on trust. It is working to improve the structure and to maintain and upgrade its effectiveness. It also updates manuals for complying with a wide range of business-related laws and ordinances and with internal regulations, and provides regular compliance training to all employees.
We have set up a whistleblowing hotline to encourage personnel to promptly report any actions that may violate laws, regulations or corporate ethics so that prompt response action may be taken. Those who contact or submit a report through this hotline will not be subjected to disadvantageous treatment.
Should any serious situation related to compliance emerge, the CEO will work to solve problems promptly in person and fulfill the responsibility to properly disclose information and provide explanations to the public. While striving to find the causes and prevent recurrence, the CEO will clarify the authorities and responsibilities and take strict action against those responsible for it, including him- or herself.
* The SDGs are the goals adopted
by the United Nations summit in September 2015 that the whole world should endeavor to meet by 2030.

Production of shrink barrier nylon film for casing
A film printing plant of Chengdu Xinguofu Packaging Material Co., Ltd., a joint venture of KPP, Fuji Tokushu Shigyo Co., Ltd. and New Hope Liuhe Food Holdings Limited in Sichuan, China, has been completed. The joint venture is a flexible packaging manufacturer that makes the most of KPPâ€™s global sourcing channels, good customers of New Hope Liuhe Food Holdings in China, and the environmentally-friendly technology of Fuji Tokushu Shigyo. The joint venture will provide eco-friendly, high value-added products, such as shrink barrier nylon film for casing, thus accelerating the development of the flexible packaging business. Providing products in China as well as neighboring countries, including rapidly growing ASEAN countries, is being considered.
Real Estate Leasing
The office building market in major cities in Japan is seeing the average vacancy rate decreasing after strong demand for office spaces in terms of floor expansion in buildings and relocation to attain larger spaces. The average rent is on a slight upward trend. Under these circumstances, our Group maintains a high operation rate of its buildings for lease, including the mainstay KPP Yaesu Building. However, rental income was down after some of the real estate properties owned were sold off.

Paperboard plant in the Shandong province in China
Growing paperboard -related transactions in the Asian market
  While the considerable recovery of domestic demand is unlikely, it will be important in the future to further step up the overseas business. One of the actions for doing so is an investment in Universal Pulp & Paper (Shandong) Co., Ltd. (UPP-SD). It is an equity-method affiliate operating a paperboard plant in the Chinese province of Shandong. We anticipate the growth of paperboard related transactions in the Asian market through sales of UPP-SD products in China, the delivery of recovered paper as material to the plant and a function as an export agency for the products.

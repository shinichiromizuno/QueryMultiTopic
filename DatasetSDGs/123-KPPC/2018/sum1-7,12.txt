   There are many different types of paper, including newsprint, printing and communication paper and packaging paper. Paper is widely used for media, including books, newspapers, advertisements, and flyers, and for packaging materials, including paper bags and wrapping paper. For the fiscal year under review, a change in the demand structure led to the contraction of the publication printing market and a shift of advertising to electronic media. Consequently, sales tumbled from the previous fiscal year.
Paperboard consists mainly of cardboard base paper and paperboard for paper containers. Cardboard is indispensable for carrying of a range of goods. Used for the outer boxes of confectionery and cosmetics, Duplex Board and Art Card are also included. For the fiscal year under review, sales rose from the previous fiscal year after the strong growth of cardboard base paper for food applications and an increase in sales channels.
Secondary processed paper includes secondary processed communication paper and secondary processed self-adhesive tack paper with adhesive on the reverse side of the paper. More specifically, thermal paper for receipts and fax paper, which produces color when heat is applied, tack paper with adhesive on the back side that is used as labels and stickers, and carbonless paper for duplicate slips come under this category. For the fiscal year under review, sales were almost unchanged from the preceding fiscal year.
Pulp is a papermaking material made from fibers extracted mainly from wood. Recovered paper primarily consists of used newspapers, cardboard, and magazines. Fibers can be extracted from them for use as papermaking materials. For the fiscal year under review, sales surged from the previous fiscal year. This was due to brisk sales of recovered paper in Japan, growing demand for pulp, particularly for imported pulp, and an increase in the unit price.
Other products include chemical products, machinery and materials, functional paper, and other related products, etc. More specifically, they are a variety of materials and products for daily living, including packaging films and trays for food, synthetic paper that hardly tears and is resistant to water and is used mainly for posters and ballot paper, and base paper for paper packages for beverages. For the fiscal year under review, sales rose from the preceding fiscal year as a result of increased sales of base paper for paper packages for beverages.

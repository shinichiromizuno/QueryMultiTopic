To All Stakeholders
On June 26, 2018, Kokusai Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd. (KPP) was listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our customers, business partners, shareholders and all other stakeholders for their support. Since the company was founded in 1924, KPP has continued to grow by developing its business with a focus on paper and peripheral materials. At present, the group company has eighteen consolidated subsidiaries, twelve affiliated companies, and around one thousand employees. Of course, we do not consider the stock market listing our goal; rather, it is the starting point for the next stage. To respond to the expectations of a larger circle of stakeholders, we aim to create new value through our business operations and to contribute to building the affluent society of the future. We hope to continue to benefit from the constant support and understanding of shareholders and investors as well as all other stakeholders.
Results for FY ending March 31, 2018
In 2017, the domestic economy continued to expand against the backdrop of a worldwide economic boom and the depreciation of the yen. It was a year when robust steps were taken toward a recovery from deflation with real GDP registering its eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth in December 2017. Meanwhile, despite geopolitical risks including the issues with North Korea and Iran, the world economy showed a trend toward genuine economic recovery for the first time since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The consolidated results for Kokusai Pulp & Paper Group as of the end of March 2018 saw a rise in both income and profit with net sales of 377,700 million yen, operating income of 2,300 million yen—a year-on-year increase of 29.2%—and profits of 3000 million yen, up 77.0% year on year. Final net income for the year was 2,400 million yen. We reached the first stage of business restructuring at overseas bases with results improving after bottoming out in 2016. In the future, we plan to further strengthen the corporate culture and to create new value that is unique to the company.
Toward the GIFT+1 2024 Long-term Management Vision
The hundredth anniversary in fiscal 2024 is a milestone on the path toward sustainable development outlined in the long-term management vision for the KPP Group launched in fiscal 2016. Aiming to strengthen the foundations of the domestic business and to establish a comprehensive recycling-oriented corporation, we have identified three terms with a medium to long-term
perspective as steps toward developing the business with a focus on the booming Asian market. The first term, which covers the three years from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, is the period for business structure reforms when we strengthen the foundations of our business by rearranging the business portfolio. As well as introducing specific responses to stronger corporate governance, core systems innovation, and personnel systems reform, we have realized the long-awaited dream of a stock market listing, expanded our sphere of operations, and taken the first steps on the path to diversifying revenue sources. The following three-year term from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021 is the period for business development when we aim to strengthen the paper, paperboard, and pulp business as well as the packaging materials business, promote the comprehensive recycling business, and establish a solutions business. This is the term for developing priority strategies on a platform strengthened through structural reform.
The three-year term from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 is the business completion period when we complete operations ahead of the company milestone, i.e., the one hundredth anniversary of the company (2024), and when we build the KPP Group that will continue to operate for another one hundred years.

 Current Situation and KPP Group Strategy
Existing Businesses in Japan
In Japan, the decline in graphic paper continues. The demand for cardboard and paper container packaging held firm, but even so, the overall demand for paper and paperboard in Japan is sluggish. In terms of the quantities of paper and paperboard handled in Japan, we are among the best. We strive to maintain diversity in supply sources, which is a forte of KPP, sales routes including wholesalers specializing in detailed small lot sales (secondary wholesalers), other organizations and functions, as well as transaction volumes revolving around a broad customer base including clients who
 06 / KPP INTEGRATED REPORT 2018
KPP INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 / 07

 are major users. Believing in the potential of paper and aggregating information inside and outside the company, we harness what we refer to as the power of imagination and creativity to present proposals to customers. We are convinced that improving the imagination and creativity of each employee is the engine that will strengthen our business in the future. We intend to closely guard the existing domestic businesses and to boost our revenue base by continuing to streamline logistics.
Furthering the Overseas Business
Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, paper and paperboard consumption has grown for seven consecutive years even after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The driving force is the Asian market. Growth is focused on paperboard and household paper with corrugated board increasing at record levels following the explosive growth in e-commerce. For example, in Japan the annual consumption of paper per capita is approximately 210 kilograms, whereas it is about 13 kilograms in India. In the Asia-Pacific region where potential demand is high, we plan to carefully uncover locally integrated demand and to stimulate the markets.
Boosting Total Package Solutions
While the demand for graphic paper is decreasing, there is a steady demand for paper and paperboard used for packaging and transportation. There are many different types of packaging including cardboard boxes for outer packaging to transport merchandise, paperboard for inner packaging, wrapping paper and film for packaging merchandise, and labels for transportation information or to enhance the brand value of merchandise. All of these are a part of packaging. In conventional transactions, suppliers provide either outer or inner packaging, but with our abundant sources of paper and peripheral materials, we are creating total package solutions to facilitate a one-stop shop that can accommodate the wishes of brand owners. Total package solutions are an important theme for overseas expansion. In cooperation with The New Hope Group, the largest foodstuffs group in China, we have built a film printing and processing plant in Chengdu, Sichuan province, using the most advanced environmental technologies from Japan to make packaging for sausages consumed in China. In Shandong province, our operating company has also invested in a manufacturer of corrugated board, which is expanding production on the back of the explosive growth in e-commerce.
Aiming for the Recycling-Oriented Society
At KPP our strengths include a robust network of procurement, clients, and wholesalers in Japan and overseas. In our capacity as dealers for paper manufacturers we can also provide an abundance of information, but our particular forte is the recycling- oriented business model promoted by KPP.
One of the management philosophies of KPP is to realize a recycling-oriented society and to widely contribute to the promotion of education, culture, and industry. The recycling-oriented society contributes to environmental conservation by reusing and making effective use of limited resources. The raw material for paper is pulp from forests under appropriate management (for example, by replanting). The paper is processed and delivered to the consumer in the form of books, bags, boxes and other familiar products that are essential to daily life. It is possible to collect end- of-life paper products to recycle the raw materials for reuse. The greater the flow of recyclable material into the product life cycle, the more we save on precious resources. It is our aim at KPP to operate a business that will realize such a recycling-oriented society.
KPP is an industry leader with sales of approximately 2.13 million tons of paper and paperboard in Japan on a non-consolidated basis. On the other hand, we are also industry leaders in recovery as we collect approximately 1.31 million tons of paper and paperboard in circulation. In short, KPP collects approximately 60% of its product sales for recycling. In that sense, KPP plays a part in paper recycling in Japan. As a company looking to expand recycling, we also promote the ecomo model for used paper recycling.
In addition to paper recycling, we have launched a business for reusing thermal energy generated when burning waste. In this business model, we provide biomass power stations with waste material to use as fuel such as scrap wood and untapped wood, or palm kernel shells and walnut shells generated overseas. The recycling of paper is part of material recycling while providing biomass fuel is part of thermal recycling. In the future, we plan to expand both material recycling and thermal recycling.
The Solutions Business
The solutions business expands business opportunities by proposing solutions to issues. It is a business area that will form part of sustainable development at KPP in the future.
As I already mentioned, KPP is a supplier of biomass fuel, but in 2016, we also invested in a power company where we accumulate combustion data to develop software that will optimize combustion controls using AI. As the caloric value of biomass fuel varies depending on the type, the expectation is that safe and stable combustion control will result in more efficient power generation.
Aiming to resolve issues with the rapidly aging population in urban settings, KPP also supports comprehensive care systems in the community. At present, the average number of hospital inpatient days per capita in Japan is nearly four times as high as overseas. The government is strengthening policies to expand systems for providing healthcare in the home. In April 2017, KPP established HOKAN TOKYO BUSINESS SERVICE CO., LTD. to systematize and back up administrative work at visiting nurse stations, which are indispensable to home healthcare.
We are promoting these solutions businesses as our contribution to society and as a means of addressing environmental issues with a view to collaboration with our existing business of selling paper, peripheral materials, and raw materials.
A Valued and Trusted Corporation
Newly listed on the stock market, KPP is now at a stage where we make every effort to ensure high value and to obtain the trust of all stakeholders. We are particularly aware of the importance of improving corporate governance, compliance, risk management and other management tasks that are at the heart of trust. After the introduction of a system of executive officers to strengthen internal controls and optimize operations, we made the shift to a company with an audit committee in June 2015 to improve agility and to realize a higher degree of transparency in management. As well as striving to boost corporate value by means of ESG management, KPP aims to contribute to society as a corporate citizen. We believe it is necessary to achieve a deeper understanding of the company through the appropriate disclosure of information to shareholders and other stakeholders through IR activities.
Aiming to Create New Value Together with Society
For sustainable growth, I believe it is important for the corporation to foster and promote businesses, and to ascertain next-generation primary revenue sources from a long-term perspective. It is also necessary to take prompt measures to accurately understand the shifts in the turning points of the worldwide economy and social structures.
In Japan, paper has traditionally had an important role in the culture. From the internationally renowned washi to Western paper, which has expanded in step with the modern paper manufacturing industry since the Meiji period, paper has served as a medium for information. With the expansion of e-commerce, growth continues in the packaging field, which includes cardboard and paper containers. Sanitary paper also continues to expand due to inbound demand. Ocean pollution has focused attention on controls on plastic straws and containers, and paper products are now subject to reconsideration. I believe that paper has an important role to play and that its potential for expansion is boundless. As a corporation dealing in paper and peripheral materials, we would like more people to be aware of the good qualities of paper. I believe it is also necessary to develop understanding of the business at KPP.

TOPICS
  At present,
our Group mainly operates two solutions businesses.
Community Comprehensive Care System Solutions Business
HOKAN TOKYO BUSINESS SERVICE CO., LTD
This business is defined as a business for social contribution based on the measures of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for encouraging the construction of community comprehensive care systems to address Japan’s aging population problem. It provides support for the launch of home visit nursing businesses and for operation after the launch in a bid to bolster the business of selling related sanitary and other products.
Biomass Power Generation Optimization Solutions Business
Matsusaka Wood Biomass Power Plant
This power plant makes effective use of unused forestry resources, chiefly from Mie Prefecture, to contribute to the local production of electricity for local consumption. It has a special boiler that is compatible with fuel chips made from bark, roots and other poorly combustible materials and operates a business model with a focus on such materials.
   There are many different types of paper, including newsprint, printing and communication paper and packaging paper. Paper is widely used for media, including books, newspapers, advertisements, and flyers, and for packaging materials, including paper bags and wrapping paper. For the fiscal year under review, a change in the demand structure led to the contraction of the publication printing market and a shift of advertising to electronic media. Consequently, sales tumbled from the previous fiscal year.
Paperboard consists mainly of cardboard base paper and paperboard for paper containers. Cardboard is indispensable for carrying of a range of goods. Used for the outer boxes of confectionery and cosmetics, Duplex Board and Art Card are also included. For the fiscal year under review, sales rose from the previous fiscal year after the strong growth of cardboard base paper for food applications and an increase in sales channels.
Secondary processed paper includes secondary processed communication paper and secondary processed self-adhesive tack paper with adhesive on the reverse side of the paper. More specifically, thermal paper for receipts and fax paper, which produces color when heat is applied, tack paper with adhesive on the back side that is used as labels and stickers, and carbonless paper for duplicate slips come under this category. For the fiscal year under review, sales were almost unchanged from the preceding fiscal year.
Pulp is a papermaking material made from fibers extracted mainly from wood. Recovered paper primarily consists of used newspapers, cardboard, and magazines. Fibers can be extracted from them for use as papermaking materials. For the fiscal year under review, sales surged from the previous fiscal year. This was due to brisk sales of recovered paper in Japan, growing demand for pulp, particularly for imported pulp, and an increase in the unit price.
Other products include chemical products, machinery and materials, functional paper, and other related products, etc. More specifically, they are a variety of materials and products for daily living, including packaging films and trays for food, synthetic paper that hardly tears and is resistant to water and is used mainly for posters and ballot paper, and base paper for paper packages for beverages. For the fiscal year under review, sales rose from the preceding fiscal year as a result of increased sales of base paper for paper packages for beverages.

Real Estate Leasing
The office building market in major cities in Japan is seeing the average vacancy rate decreasing after strong demand for office spaces in terms of floor expansion in buildings and relocation to attain larger spaces. The average rent is on a slight upward trend. Under these circumstances, our Group maintains a high operation rate of its buildings for lease, including the mainstay KPP Yaesu Building. However, rental income was down after some of the real estate properties owned were sold off.

Paperboard plant in the Shandong province in China
Growing paperboard -related transactions in the Asian market
  While the considerable recovery of domestic demand is unlikely, it will be important in the future to further step up the overseas business. One of the actions for doing so is an investment in Universal Pulp & Paper (Shandong) Co., Ltd. (UPP-SD). It is an equity-method affiliate operating a paperboard plant in the Chinese province of Shandong. We anticipate the growth of paperboard related transactions in the Asian market through sales of UPP-SD products in China, the delivery of recovered paper as material to the plant and a function as an export agency for the products.

Environmental Management
We construct, manage, operate and improve our system in accordance with the ISO 14001 environmental management standard. On the basis of the Environmental Policy, which is a commitment made by our management team, we have established an environmental management system in a bid to enhance environmental performance in line with business through the examination and evaluation of activities and results in separate departments. Whether the system is effective is checked in our annual internal audits as well as in the annual examination performed by an outside organization. Since acquiring ISO 14001 certification in 2002, we have been keeping ourselves certified in line with its updates.
Initiatives to Reduce the Environmental Impact
As a business operator using energy beyond a certain level prescribed in the Act on Rationalizing Energy Use, we fall under the scope of specified business operators and special consigners. We are aiming to reduce the environmental impact of our operations in a sustained manner.
 Scope of Certification Application
Registration Number: JP18/071544 Audit Organization: SGS Japan Inc. Scope of Application: Sales for paper, pulp, recovered paper, films, their peripheral materials and related machines
Bases under the Scope of Application: Tokyo Head Office, Kansai Branch, Kyoto Sales Department of Kansai Branch, Chubu Branch, Kyushu Branch, Sendai Sales Department of Kita Nihon Branch and Sapporo Sales Department of Kita Nihon Branch
Logistics Initiatives
KPP is designated as a specified cosigner, a business with a high annual volume of freight transportation consigned in association with its business activities. We take measures and monitor the results regarding the reduction of energy consumption per basic unit by at least 1% on an annual average basis as requested by the Japanese national government with a view to the continuous reduction of the environmental impact of logistical operations. We continued implementing major priority measures including improving the ratio of direct transport, integrating stock and distribution facilities, and optimizing stock locations for reducing transport distances to delivery destinations. For fiscal 2017, our energy consumption per basic unit increased by 0.8% year on year, while our overall CO2 emissions from transport fell by 2.2% year on year. The annual reduction rate in energy consumption per basic unit averaged 2.4% in the past five years.
Initiatives as a Business Operator
KPP is designated as a specified business, which refers to a business operator whose total annual electricity and other energy consumption is 1,500 kiloliters or more in crude oil equivalents. We have been taking initiatives aimed at lowering energy consumption per basic unit by 1% on an annual average basis since 2013. For fiscal 2017, our energy consumption per basic unit dropped by 37.1% year on year, and our overall CO2 emissions also fell by 34.5% year on year. This was possibly due to the sale of some of the properties we owned. The annual reduction rate in energy consumption per basic unit averaged 13.6% in the past five years.

 Solving Environmental Issues through its Businesses
Aiming to Become a Comprehensive Recycling-Oriented Company
With a view to increasing thermal recycling
We are pushing ahead with the business of selling woodchips, pellets and other fuels for biomass power generation. For this purpose, we have invested in Biomass Power Technologies Inc., a company operating a biomass power generation business based in the city of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture in September 2016. From the standpoint of a supplier, we are accumulating expertise in the renewable energy business and combustion data together with this power generating company. With a view to ensuring proper combustion in boilers and other equipment, we will concurrently undertake development efforts aimed at optimizing combustion management with the application of AI technologies. As a result, we will make a greater contribution in the area of thermal recycling as well.
From this point on, we will expand the thermal recycling business through which we supply fuels based on wood resources and the like in addition to the paper-to-paper material recycling business through which we offer recovered paper and other recycled materials. We hope to strengthen our position as a comprehensive recycling-oriented company by expanding these two recycling circles.
The Company’s basic stance is to make an environmental contribution in line with its business. We promote sales of products from materials that are confirmed as being compliant, and we work to expand business with material recycling
and thermal recycling with a view to evolving into a comprehensive recycling- oriented company. We regard all these actions as environmental contributions that lead to the future of our planet.
  Responsible Use of Wood Resources
Checking the compliance of raw materials is vital for sales of paper materials as well as paper products. Connected to the supply chain, we aspire to supply products made of materials that are confirmed as being compliant from both an environmental and a social perspective, and to provide customers with greater reassurance. Forest certification programs encourage the continuous operation of forests around the world by combining appropriate forest management with the management of raw materials and products in the entire supply chain, from processing to distribution. We have acquired Chain of Custody certification, which accredits processing and distribution, from two leading forest certification authorities, namely the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and we are positively promoting sales of forest certified pulp and paper.
The mark of responsible forestry
Paper Raw Material Business
Processes through which goods manufactured with forest resources as base materials reach consumers correspond to arteries when we liken them to the flow of blood. The processes through which consumed recovered paper is collected, transported and recycled into paper raw materials correspond to veins. We must ensure that goods circulate actively through these arteries and veins without stagnation in order to sustain a sound society through the conservation of resources and the reduction of waste. We play the role of the heart that governs the flows through arteries and veins. We sell approximately 2,130 thousand tons* of paper and paperboard and collect and sell around 1,310 thousand tons* of recovered paper each year. These figures are among the highest in Japan.

Ecomo Business to Expand the Recycling Circle
The name of our business model, ecomo, reflects the concept of bringing (mottekuru in Japanese) eco. Ecomo is one of our businesses aimed at promoting the effective use of renewable resources. Town ecomo, one of our ecomo projects, is a system that enables users to bring old newspapers and magazines to recovered paper collection boxes installed in locations such as Supermarket etc.when they go shopping there, and receive shopping points that can be used at the stores in exchange for the waste based on its weight. Town ecomo makes recovered paper collection less burdensome for local governments. In addition, it is attracting attention as a new system that connects recovered paper, which has previously been incinerated because of the inability of community-based waste collection services to deal with it, with the circle of recycling. Town ecomo recycling boxes have been installed in 441 stores throughout Japan as of July 31, 2018. They contribute to local residents’ care for the environment. We also collect confidential documents in offices
through special recycling
boxes installed there, and
shred these documents
and reduce their volume
with consideration given to
security aspects through
office ecomo, another
of our ecomo programs
aimed at recycling these
documents safety and
reliably.

Joint organization of a Japanese papermaking lesson with the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust
We have been providing support to the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust since 2015. On February 27, 2018, we jointly organized a Japanese papermaking lesson with the trust at Miyanomori Elementary School in the city of Higashimatsushima in Miyagi Prefecture. Mr. Rogier Uitenboogaar, an artist of Japanese paper craft, was invited to give a lecture. During the lesson, the children made Japanese paper mixed with fallen leaves from the forest and local seaweed from kozo and mitsumata trees planted in the forest at the
back of the school building in March 2016. The lesson provided them with an opportunity to learn about the importance of the natural environment as well as the fun of papermaking.
              TSUNAGU GALLERY
At the entrance on the first floor of our head office, there is a gallery that is open for viewing to business partners and the public. It serves as a space for exchanges, displaying artworks and paper products featured in the TSUNAGU magazine. In fiscal 2017, it held a total of four exhibitions, including one featuring 3D artworks produced from newsprint paper by Ms. Chie Hitotsuyama.

 Corporate Governance Basic Philosophy
KOKUSAI PULP & PAPER CO., LTD. views the establishment of corporate governance and its sustained improvement as important business challenges for responding to the mandate of stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business acquaintances, local community members and employees, and for achieving sustainable growth and enhancing the corporate value in the medium- and long-term.
To make its management more transparent and agile, we made the change to a company with an audit and supervisory committee in June 2015. The Audit and Supervisory Committee, in which Outside Directors of the Board make up the majority, audits and supervises the legality and appropriateness of the way in which we conduct business. In addition, we adopted an executive officer system under which Directors of the Board, who make up the Board of Directors, handle the decision-making and supervisory functions, and Executive Officers perform business execution functions. Through these reforms, we clarified where decision-making and supervisory functions and business execution functions lie within our management organization.

Actions toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*
Since fiscal 2018, the Company has been referring to the SDGs in an effort to identify goals in a close relationship with its business, and to fulfill these goals.
Compliance Committee
Themes for the fiscal year under review: Sustained compliance with laws, internal regulations (to ensure full awareness of the importance of compliance)
Activities in the fiscal year under review: The Compliance Committee has been established for two purposes. One is to continuously provide education to prevent insider trading and other training to raise employees’ compliance awareness. The other is to ensure corporate management with a focus on trust. It is working to improve the structure and to maintain and upgrade its effectiveness. It also updates manuals for complying with a wide range of business-related laws and ordinances and with internal regulations, and provides regular compliance training to all employees.
We have set up a whistleblowing hotline to encourage personnel to promptly report any actions that may violate laws, regulations or corporate ethics so that prompt response action may be taken. Those who contact or submit a report through this hotline will not be subjected to disadvantageous treatment.
Should any serious situation related to compliance emerge, the CEO will work to solve problems promptly in person and fulfill the responsibility to properly disclose information and provide explanations to the public. While striving to find the causes and prevent recurrence, the CEO will clarify the authorities and responsibilities and take strict action against those responsible for it, including him- or herself.
* The SDGs are the goals adopted
by the United Nations summit in September 2015 that the whole world should endeavor to meet by 2030.

 Financial Analysis
Summary of Business Circumstances and Financial Results
Summary of Status of Business Performance, Etc.
The summary of the status of financial standing, business performance and cash flows (hereinafter referred to as “business performance, etc.”) of the Group (KPP and its consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates) for the consolidated fiscal year under review is as follows.
(1) Status of financial standing and business performance
For the consolidated fiscal year under review, Japan enjoyed continued eco- nomic expansion driven by exports against the backdrop of the booming global economy and the underlying trend of the weak yen, and contin- ued to make sure-footed progress toward an exit from deflation, giv- en positive growth in real GDP for the eighth consecutive quarter up to December 2017. In January 2018, the unemployment rate also fell to 2.4% for the first time in 24 years and nine months, and the employment situation improved continuously. However, industries such as accommodation and food services and transport and postal mail faced a serious labor shortage. The fourth Abe Cabinet, which was inaugurated in November 2017, announced that the government would fully mobilize policies including taxes and budgets, with “human resources development revolution” and “productivity revolution” as two wheels of a cart. Of them, the productivity revolution has set the reforms of the industrial structure through IoT, big data and artificial intelligence as key initiatives, and the creation of new business opportunities is therefore expected. Meanwhile, the global economy is facing geopolitical risks such as the North Korean and Syrian issues, but it experienced a full-fledged eco- nomic recovery for the first time after the financial crisis in 2007 - 2008. In the United States, while the impact of the protectionist trade policy was a concern, the growth rate of real GDP remained high, reaching 2.6% (the term from October to December in 2017). In addition, because the Trump administration decided on the largest-ever tax cut of 1.5 trillion dollars at the end of last year, domestic investments and the employment situation improved further. With the global economic recovery including Europe, China and emerging countries as a backdrop, the Japanese economy remained firm, particularly in the export sector.
In the domestic paper and pulp industry, paper consumption continued to fall below the preceding year’s level due to structural changes following the contraction and aging of the population and a decline in the birth rate, along with a shift of publications and advertisements to electronic media. However, the expansion of the e-commerce market was a driving force behind demand for cardboard, and the consumption of paper- board increased from the preceding year. Demand for sanitary paper also remained relatively firm by capturing inbound demand and others, in addition to solid demand as daily necessities. It is also a concern in the domestic paper and pulp industry that the labor shortage will have an impact on corporate earnings through higher freight charges.
Under these circumstances, the Group’s financial results for the con- solidated fiscal year under review were as follows. Net sales stood at 377,714 million yen, representing a 3.0% increase year on year; operating income was 2,362 million yen, representing a 129.2% rise year on year; ordinary income was 3,086 million yen, enjoying a 177.0% increase year on year; and profit attributable to owners of parent was 2,433 million yen, representing a 9.9% rise year on year.
Financial results by business segment are as follows.
<Domestic Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper>
In the paper sector, both sales value and volume declined year on year due to factors such as the contraction of the publication and printing market, reflecting changes in the demand structure, and a shift of advertisements to electronic media. In the paperboard sector, sales value increased thanks to solid growth in food applications and the expansion of sales channels. In the papermaking material sector, domestic sales of recovered paper remained firm, and sales value increased year on year. Pulp saw a year- on-year increase in both sales value and volume due to the contribution of rising prices, in addition to growth in demand for imported pulp.
As a result, net sales in the Domestic Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment came to 309,670 million yen (down 0.1% year on year), and segment income stood at 4,521 million yen (up 14.1% year on year). <Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper>
In the Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment, net sales remained low because sales of coated paper and copying paper as well
as special paper for Brazil were stagnant due to reasons such as a price problem and difficulty in securing the volume at suppliers, while exports of corrugated board increased in the United States. In Southeast Asia, the performance of trade items of some Japanese manufacturers was strong, but sales grew at a sluggish pace due to an unsuccessful bid on pulp because we did not come to terms with the price, in addition to slower growth. In East Asia, sales to major customers were strong, and sales of products in general, including coated paper and paperboard, increased in Hong Kong. In China, sales of high-quality paper, coated paper and paperboard also rose. In Australia, sales increased due to a rise in the trade of high-quality paper and copying paper.
As a result, net sales in the Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment rose to 66,810 million yen (up 21.0% year on year), and there was a segment loss of 91 million yen (compared with a segment loss of 108 million yen in the previous fiscal year).
<Real Estate Leasing>
In the office building market in major cities across Japan, the average vacancy rate was on a downward trend against the backdrop of solid demand for offices, including the expansion of floor space inside buildings and relocations for extensions. The average rent also remained on a moderate upward trend.
Under these circumstances, the Group maintained high occupancy in tenant buildings including its mainstay property “KPP Yaesu Building,” but rent income declined due to the sale of certain properties owned. As a result, net sales in the Real Estate Leasing segment amounted to 1,233 million yen (down 19.8% year on year), and segment income came to 561 million yen (down 17.8% year on year).
(2) Cash flow status
As of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review, cash and cash equivalents (hereinafter collectively referred to as “cash”) increased 1,843 million yen from a year earlier, to 4,135 million yen, due to increases in profit before income taxes and notes and accounts payable – trade and a net increase in commercial papers, which offset the purchase of prop- erty, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
The following describes the status of the individual cash flows for the consolidated fiscal year under review and the underlying factors.
(Cash flows from operating activities)
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to 4,019 million yen (net cash provided of 1,114 million yen in the previous fiscal year). This was mainly attributable to cash provided by increases in notes and ac- counts payable – trade and profit before income taxes, which offset cash used for an increase in inventories at domestic bases.
(Cash flows from investing activities)
Net cash used in investing activities totaled 7,920 million yen (net cash provided of 5,596 million yen in the previous fiscal year). This was mainly attributable to cash used for the acquisition of the KPP Head Office to reduce expenses, the acquisition of Toda Butsuryu Center based on our logistics strategy and investment in internal mission-critical systems. (Cash flows from financing activities)
Net cash provided by financing activities was 5,760 million yen (net cash used of 6,791 million yen in the previous fiscal year). This was mainly attributable to financing using short-term loans payable and commercial papers after taking into account financing through capital increase in the following consolidated fiscal year in order to cover net cash used in investing activities.
Financial Standing and Business Performance
Details of recognition, analysis and review from the manager’s perspective
Details of recognition, analysis and review of the status of business per- formance of the Group from the manager’s perspective are as follows. Forward-looking statements in the text are our judgments as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review.
(1) Significant Accounting Policies and Estimation
The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in ac- cordance with the accounting standards that are generally regarded as fair and appropriate in Japan. Matters requiring accounting estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are estimated on the basis of actual past data and by employing other reasonable methods. However, estimates involve uncertainties specific to the data
and methods used, and thus the actual results may differ from the estimates. The Group understands that the important accounting policies specified below have a significant impact on key judgments and estimates made in the preparation of the financial statements.
(a) Allowance for doubtful accounts
In preparation for possible losses due to the inability to collect receiv- ables, the Group posts an estimated amount of uncollectible receiv- ables as an allowance for doubtful accounts, taking into consid- eration the collectability of individual specific receivables, with concern given to the failure to collect in accordance with the rate of actually uncollectible general receivables in the past.
(b) Impairment of investment securities
The Group holds shares of certain customers to maintain and strength- en good business relationships with them. For securities with market val- ue, impairment processing is conducted for those with a non-temporary decline in investment value by more than 30%. For securities without market value, impairment processing is conducted for those for which net assets per share of the company concerned contracted by at least 50% of their book value, based on the assumption that its financial results are unlikely to recover.
(c) Impairment of goodwill
If it is determined that there are signs of impairment of goodwill, the Group will determine whether the impairment should be recognized. If there is a change in the situation of business that the Group has acquired in a transaction in which goodwill was recognized, an impairment loss may be required to be recorded.
(d) Deferred tax assets
The Group rationally estimates its future taxable income. If it judges that it will be unable to collect all or part of the deferred tax assets, the income figures may change due to the accrual of deferred tax assets.

Net sales in the consolidated fiscal year under review increased 10,936 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 377,714 million yen (up 3.0% year on year). Net sales by segment are stated in “Summary of Status of Business Performance, Etc., (1) Status of financial standing and business performance.”
(Gross profit)
Gross profit in the consolidated fiscal year under review increased 893 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 22,008 million yen (up 4.2% year on year). The gross profit margin also rose 0.07 percentage point from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 5.8%, mainly due to the contribution of a rise in the profit margin of pulp and recovered paper. (Operating income)
Selling, general and administrative expenses declined 438 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 19,645 million yen (down 2.2% year on year), due to a fall in the provision of an allowance for doubtful accounts in the Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment, despite increases in selling expenses and employees’ salaries and allowances.
As a result, operating income in the consolidated fiscal year under review increased 1,331 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 2,362 million yen (up 129.2% year on year).
(Ordinary income)
Non-operating income in the consolidated fiscal year under review in- creased 318 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 1,363 million yen (up 30.4% year on year), mainly due to the recording of foreign exchange gains reflecting the appreciation of the yen and the reversal of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Non-operating expenses declined 322 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 640 million yen (down 33.5% year on year), mainly due to the turning of foreign exchange losses recorded in the previous consolidated fiscal year into foreign exchange gains and a fall in the share of loss of entities accounted for using the equity method. As a result, ordinary income in the consolidated fiscal year under review increased 1,972 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 3,086 million yen (up 177.0% year on year).
(Profit before income taxes)
Extraordinary income in the consolidated fiscal year under review de- creased 2,634 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 623 million yen (down 80.9% year on year), mainly due to the recording of a 2,773 million yen gain on sales of non-current assets and a 483 million yen gain on sales of investment securities in the previous consolidated fiscal year, despite the sale of Kasugai Souko based on our logistics strategy. Extraordinary losses declined 803 million yen from the previous con- solidated fiscal year, to 71 million yen (down 91.9% year on year), due to the recording of a 588 million yen loss on sales of non-current assets in the previous consolidated fiscal year.
As a result, profit before income taxes in the consolidated fiscal year under review rose 141 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year, to 3,639 million yen (up 4.0% year on year).
(b) Analysis of financial standing
(Assets)
Total assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review stood at 198,632 million yen, an increase of 14,386 million yen from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was mainly attributable to an increase in property, plant and equipment as a result of acquiring the KPP Head Office to reduce expenses and Toda Butsuryu Center based on our logistics strategy and an increase in intangible assets due to investments in internal mission-critical systems.
(Liabilities)
Total liabilities came to 150,937 million yen, an increase of 10,736 million yen from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was chiefly due to an increase in interest-bearing debt resulting from loans payable and commercial papers, as well as an increase in notes and accounts payable - trade.
(Net assets)
Net assets were 47,694 million yen, up 3,650 million yen from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year, and the equity ratio was 23.9%, rising 0.1 percentage point from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was mainly attributable to an increase in retained earnings, a rise in valuation difference on available-for-sale securities reflecting rising share prices, and an increase in remeasurements of defined benefits plans resulting from a rise in the market value of pension assets. (c) Financial resources for capital and liquidity of funds of the Group
The major components of demand for operating funds of the Group are recurring operating funds and operating expenses such as selling, general and administrative expenses. Capital needs for investment are derived mainly from the purchase of non-current assets and investments in software. The basic policy of the Group is to stably secure liquidity and the source of funds necessary for business operation. Short-term operat- ing funds are basically financed by shareholders’ equity, short-term loans from financial institutions and commercial papers, and funds for investment are basically financed by long-term loans from financial institutions.
The Company’s shares were listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on June 26, 2018. Of the proceeds of 2,212 million yen from the issuance of new shares, 851 million yen is to be used for capital investment related to internal mission-critical systems, while the remaining amount is to be appropriated for the repayment of loans from financial institutions.
The balance of loans payable and commercial papers at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review was 49,693 million yen. The bal- ance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review was 4,135 million yen.
(d) Objective indicators to determine the achievement
status of management policies, management strategies and management targets
Placing emphasis on ROA and ROE as management indicators, the Group is working to realize efficient management. In the consolidated fis- cal year under review, ROA and ROE were 1.3% and 5.3%, respectively.
Capital Policy
Under its basic capital policy, the Group strives to achieve a medi- um-term increase in corporate value and deliver stable returns to share- holders. To improve its outside ratings and stabilize its financial stand- ing, the Group will endeavor to attain an equity rate of 25% at an early
                 34 / KPP INTEGRATED REPORT 2018
KPP INTEGRATED REPORT 2018 / 35

 Financial Analysis
stage. Meanwhile, it will define ROA as a key management indicator, and achieve the optimal capital portfolio by boosting asset efficiency. The Company will also aim to increase ROE to a level higher than the cost of shareholders’ equity and ensure a payout ratio of 30%.
Business Risks and Other Risks
The following describes examples of business and other risks that may affect the Group’s financial results and standing.
It should be noted that the matters relating to the future in the descrip- tions here reflect judgments of the Group as of the date of June 28, 2018. They do not include all the risks that may arise in the future.
(1) Dependency on principal business partners
Oji Holdings Corporation and Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd. are among the Company’s major shareholders and among the principal suppliers of paper and paper boards, which are the Group’s mainstay products. The total amount of purchases from these two groups for the consolidated fiscal year made up 47.1% of the Group’s total purchases. At this time, the Company has basic agreements with these com- panies under which they are designated dealers, and plans to continu- ously expand transactions with them. However, if any significant problem should arise in supplying goods from their groups to the Company for some reason, it may affect the Group’s business expansion, financial standing, and financial results.
(2) Impact of commodity market conditions
The purchase prices of the Group’s mainstay products such as paper and paper boards are subject to the influence of worldwide demand for their raw materials, such as pulp, chips, and recovered paper, and to trends in crude oil and other fuel prices. A significant rise in these prices will affect the purchase prices of products. The Group constantly conducts price negotiations with suppliers in an attempt to ensure appropriate profits, but its financial standing and results may be affected depending on whether or to what extent the selling prices take into consideration the changes in material prices.
(3) Reorganization of distribution in the paper and pulp industry
The paper industry is heavily susceptible to economic trends and con- sumer trends. In view of the shrinking population and shift towards pa- per-free operations, the domestic market is expected to contract even further. For this reason, there is a possibility that further reorganization of distributors may occur. The Group has already been responding to the industry reorganization by means of mergers and acquisitions and other methods. While it will continue to adopt a flexible approach in the future, changes in market circumstances that exceed the Group’s assumptions or any merger or acquisition that fails to produce the effect expected by the Group may affect its financial standing and results.
(4) Manufacturers’ orientation towards direct sales
Faced with harsh economic circumstances, an increasing number of cor- porate users of paper products are actively working to cost cuts. The Group is also making efforts to reduce distribution costs and other costs to maintain its business relationships with corporate users. However, in recent years, paper manufacturers are becoming more and more oriented towards direct sales. This trend is especially evident in the area of industrial paper. In this environment, it is possible that users to which the Group sells products may shift to doing direct transactions with manufacturers. The financial position and results of the Group could be affected if the increase in these cases occurs at a pace faster than what it expects.
(5) Foreign exchange rate fluctuation risks
The paper and public wholesale business at overseas bases, which is one of the business segments of the Group, sells products in many dif- ferent countries, particularly in Asia and the Americas. Net sales of the Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment in the consolidated fiscal year under review made up 17.7% of consolidated net sales.
The Group also sells papers and paperboard, recovered papers ex- ported from Japan. The price competition of these products overseas has been affected by currency exchange rate. The process of preparing consolidated financial statements involves converting the sales and ex- penses in the local currencies of different countries into the yen so that they can be posted in the statements. During this process, the figures are affected by the foreign exchange rates at the time they are converted into the Japanese currency. The Group employs various means to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, such as bringing foreign exchange
forward. However, fluctuations in exchange rates that are greater than the Group expects may affect its financial standing and results.
(6) Interest rate fluctuation risks
The Group procures its operating funds chiefly by borrowing from fi- nancial institutions and by issuing commercial paper. It endeavors to min- imize the impact of interest rate fluctuations by procuring funds through the introduction of long-term loans at fixed interest rates and interest rate swapping. However, fluctuations in interest rates that are greater than what the Group expects may affect its financial standing and results. For reference, the balance of loans payable and commercial paper amounted to 49,693 million yen as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review, accounting for 25.0% of all assets.
(7) Country risks
The Group engages in sales in many different countries around the world, particularly in Asia and the Americas. The pulp and paper wholesale busi- ness at overseas bases contributed to 17.7% of consolidated net sales for the consolidated fiscal year under review. In these countries, business activities may be constrained by legislative amendments, rapidly rising personnel costs, diplomatic issues, and other factors. The pulp and paper market is heavily reliant on economic trends, consumption trends and oth- er factors in the countries and regions where the business is operated. The Group has taken out an insurance policy for trade accounts receiv- able in its overseas business, and it works tirelessly to collect information on the countries in which it operates in order to minimize these risks. Should these risks become more noticeable, however, they could af- fect its financial position and results.
In the 142nd and 143rd consolidated fiscal years, business partners in China, Hong Kong and elsewhere recorded very large provisions for al- lowances for doubtful accounts, and Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper ultimately posted a segment loss. In the China business, the procedures for liquidation of Kokusai Pulp & Paper (China) Co., Ltd., the financial position of which deteriorated mainly because of the provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts mentioned above, are underway. If any unexpected loss occurs in the process of liquidation, it may affect the Group’s financial standing and results.
(8) Credit risks concerning customers
In the Group’s sales transactions, many of our customers are adopting the practice of credit sales and bill collection. Asia accounts for a large percentage in the Overseas Bases Wholesale Pulp and Paper segment. In light of these circumstances, the Group holds regular credit review meetings for all overseas bases and holds a meeting for the managers of overseas bases once a year to thoroughly manage individual customers. In addition, the Group works to avert credit risks by formulating regulations and manuals to prevent uncollectible receivables from arising, and regularly examines these risks in accordance with the regulations, etc. Even so, the Group’s financial standing and results may be affected, pro- vided that uncollectible receivables exceed the level it anticipated as a result of the deterioration in the credit status of some customers. The Group’s major customer in Asia is Samson Paper Holdings Ltd. (herein- after referred to as “Samson Paper Holdings Group”), which is listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, and the balance of accounts receivable-trade from the Samson Paper Holdings Group at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review was 14,639 million yen.
(9) Liabilities for retirement grants
The Group employs a defined benefits pension plan, a retirement lump- sum grants program, and a defined contribution pension plan. The ex- penses and liabilities for retirement grants under these plans are cal- culated in accordance with the discount rate and other preconditions defined in actuarial calculation and the expected long-term management gains ratio for pension assets. In addition, a stock trust is adopted as part of the pension assets. Therefore, the Group’s financial standing and results may be affected in the event of a decline in the discount rate, a deteriorating investment yield, and a decline in the market price of shares included in the trust.
(10) Risk of fluctuations in the market prices of shares owned
Most of the shares owned by the Group are those of suppliers, cor- porate customers, financial institutions with which it does business, and other companies with which it enjoys close business relationships. The Group’s financial position and results may be affected if the price of any of these shares changes due to stock market conditions and the financial results of the company concerned.
(11) Risks of new business investments
The Group makes investments, including the establishment of a new company and the acquisition of existing companies, to expand business opportunities and strengthen its existing businesses. In April 2017, the Group invested 190 million yen in Hokan Tokyo Business Service Co., Ltd., which supports the start-up and operation of the home-visit nursing care business. In this investment, the Group bears the risk of not being able to collect the invested funds, the risk of generating an additional loss if the Group withdraws from the business, and the risk of not generating income as planned.
To manage these risks, the Group has decided to fully discuss the profit- ability of investments at the Investment Committee and regularly checks the management status of investees and progress in the plan and makes a report to the Board of Directors. However, it is difficult to completely avoid the risk of generating an additional loss and the risk of not making a profit as planned, and there is a possibility that the financial standing and business performance of the Group will be affected by changes in the operating environment and withdrawal from a project.
(12) Risks related to investments in China
The Company has two manufacturing companies in China to which the equity method is applied. The amount of investment to be accounted for using the equity method in the MISSION SKY GROUP LIMITED Group, which manufactures and sells corrugated board through a joint venture with the Samson Paper Holdings Group, was 3,992 million yen at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review, of which the amount of goodwill was 1,441 million yen. With respect to the investment business in China, an in-house management reporting line has been created, and the department in charge monitors the progress of business performance and the investment plan on a quarterly basis. If a significant deviation from the business plan arises due to an unexpected change in the situation due to a sudden change in the operating environment, and if a loss arises in an equity-method affiliate, it will be recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company according to its ownership ratio. This could have an impact on the financial standing and business performance of the Group.
(13) Impact of real estate market conditions and other factors
In order to stabilize its revenue base, the Group engages in the real es- tate leasing business using the real estate it owns. However, the Group’s financial standing and results may be affected if the value or rent of the real estate it owns declines as a result of changes in the real estate mar- ket conditions. For reference, the ratio of real estate leased to total assets was 8.2% as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review. (14) Relationship with major shareholder
In March 1979, Oji Paper Co., Ltd. and Nippon Pulp Industry Co., Ltd., both of which held shares in the Company, merged. As a result, Oji Paper as the surviving company held 24.3% of the voting rights in the Compa- ny. As of the date of June 28, 2018, Oji Holdings, which shifted to a hold- ing company structure and changed its company name to Oji Holdings Corporation, owns 18.7% of the voting rights in the Company, including an indirect ownership component. Since the Company was established in 1924, Oji Holdings and its group companies (hereinafter referred to as “the Oji Group”) have been its principal supply destinations and have been dealing continuously with the Company under the same terms and conditions as those applicable to other paper manufacturers which the Company’s supplies.
As of the date of June 28, 2018, there are no officers or employees serving both the Oji Group and the Group, and the two Groups have no personnel on loan from each other. In addition, there are no items requiring prior approval from the Oji Group in the Group’s managerial decision-making. The Group’s management is therefore independent. If the Oji Group changes its management policy or strategy in the future, however, it may affect the Group’s business activities.
(15) Use of funds
With regard to the use of funds raised by capital increase through public stock offering conducted on June 26, 2018, we plan to appropriate them for capital investment related to internal mission-critical systems and the repayment of loans. However, there is a possibility that the expected investment effect will not be obtained even if the funds raised are used as planned. In addition, there is also a possibility that an unexpected increase in expenses due to a delay in capital investment will have an impact on the financial standing and business performance of the Group
if such an increase arises. The Group anticipates an increase in expenses including the burdens of amortization and depreciation after the comple- tion of capital investment related to internal mission-critical systems.
Business environment and issues to be addressed
The issues the Group has set out to tackle are stepping up its over- seas expansion, reforming its business portfolio through the launch of new businesses, achieving a high level of transparency in governance, and securing and nurturing staff members. It will make active efforts to address each of these issues.
(1) Stepping up overseas expansion
The Group places particular emphasis on globalization in its long-term man- agement plan “GIFT+1 2024.” Because domestic demand for printing and communication paper, the Group’s mainstay products, still remains sluggish, the Group is stepping up its overseas expansion to diversify profit opportunities.
Above all, the Group regards expansion in growth markets such as Chi- na, Southeast Asia and India as a challenge, and is currently promoting localization and the expansion of operations. In particular, given that solid demand for packaging-related products is expected along with economic growth, the Group is focusing on the area of total packages, including chemical and other products in addition to paper and paperboard. In China, the Group has already invested in the flexible packaging and printing business to increase its competitiveness by introducing advanced technologies of Japan that satisfy the environmental regulations in China. In India, the Group is also preparing for the establishment of a new company for the purpose of rebuilding business there. To continuously seek investment opportunities in Asia, the Group has reorganized its structure by establishing the Global Business Administration Division in the Global Business Headquarters in June 2017 so that the sales and administrative functions will be able to act in a mobilized and integrated manner.
(2) Launching new businesses
In June 2017, the Investments for the Future Strategy 2017 that aims to realize “Society 5.0” was approved by the Japanese Cabinet. To become a company that will keep creating value even in the forthcoming new society by leveraging AI, IoT and robots, the Group is currently moving ahead with three projects by advancing into the area of the soft service industry based on system development as the next growth strategy. The first one is the “Thermal Management Logistics Solutions Project,” which aims to develop a temperature sensor that can be printed on labels. The second one is the “Biomass Power Generation Optimization System Solutions Project,” which aims to develop software that will optimize combustion efficiency and lead to sales. The third one is the “Community Comprehensive Care Solutions Project,” which started in April 2017. Through these solutions projects, the Group will contribute to the realization of “Society 5.0.”
(3) Achieving a high level of transparency in governance
Placing emphasis on the Corporate Governance Code for the sustainable growth of the Company and the medium- to long-term enhancement of its corporate value, the Group is preparing to introduce new systems to further enhance governance. The Group is also strengthening its governance overseas by restructuring DAIEI AUSTRALASIA PTY LTD and DAIEI PAPERS (S) PTE LTD under the control of KPP ASIA-PACIFIC PTE. LTD., the Asia regional headquarters, and placing DAIEI PAPERS BRAZIL LTDA. under the direct control of the KPP Head Office. In addition, the Group is bolstering the management system of overseas corporations by continuously holding global credit meetings for overseas subsidiaries and providing workshops for local managers.
(4) Nurturing and securing staff members
To further promote diversity, the Group is continuously striving to di- versify human resources and is working on the mid-career employment of global human resources in Japan and overseas and the employment of female managerial workers with a view to appointing them to management posts in the future. The Group is also promoting operational efficiency that will lead to work style reform in the internal reform project that commenced in April 2017. In addition, the Group is cultivating T-type human resources with a high level of expertise based on broad knowledge that are able to respond to the new environment called “Society 5.0” by making active use of e-learning.

     Cover Design
The Group aims to help build a recycling-oriented society by advocating a totally recycling-oriented business model that includes a mechanism for circulating paper produced by forests as a precious resource. This idea was visually incorporated in the cover design.
The circle expresses the image of both material recycling, wherein paper that has fulfilled its function is collected as recovered paper and then transformed into paper again, and thermal recycling, in which resources such as waste and unused material generate energy as fuel for biomass power generation. In addition, the gradation of flow from the periphery toward the center expresses that resources, such as paper and biomass fuel collected from every field of life, are incorporated in the circulation structure.

 President’s Message
“The KPP Group is capturing global market growth while building a system for the recycling of paper products—biomass resources. Our aim is to achieve sustainable growth to mark the 100th anniversary of our founding in 2024, and for the next century.”
Kokusai Pulp & Paper Co., Ltd., founded in 1924, is a company with a rich history.
Since the beginning, we have continued to respond to changing business conditions and contribute to society. In 2018, the Company was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), entering a new phase. We will continue to create new value and respond to societal demands.
External Environment and Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2019
Since Donald Trump became President of the United States in 2017, the trade imbalance issue has taken center stage, and safeguards were invoked in 2018, for the first time in 16 years. In 2019, friction between the U.S. and China intensified as both countries increased the number of products subject to tariffs, and they are still unable to find common ground. This political and economic dispute has even affected the science and technology related to the next-generation 5G telecommunication standard, and the global economic collaborative framework is fraying. Even the pulp and paper industry has been substantially impacted by these world events.
China, which boasts the world’s largest paper and paperboard market, experienced a significant slowdown in 2018, with production down 6.2% year on year, and consumption down 4.2%. Furthermore, China’s tightening environmental regulations have restricted imports of solid waste, and since December 2018, recovered paper cannot be exported to China and is thus in surplus as prices continue to fall. The Group’s Paper Raw Material Sales Division has also been affected by the declining performance of both pulp and recovered paper.
On the other hand, the domestic paper and paperboard business was relatively strong. With the decline of graphic paper sales in Europe and the United States, shifts toward producing paperboard and household paper in paper machines, and toward paper disposal, are progressing, and Japan is finally addressing structural reforms. Furthermore, there was an immediate tightening of Japan’s supply and demand, as some paper manufacturers were victimized by heavy rainfall in the Chugoku region in July 2018. This led to a shortage of paper supply caused by continued machine trouble. However, we were able
to raise the price for container board twice, and the paper and paperboard market in Japan is on the road to improvement.
Given this backdrop, the Group’s consolidated net sales increased 1.9% year on year to 384,900 million yen, operating income decreased 3.5% to 2,200 million yen, ordinary income declined 18.4% to 2,500 million yen, and net income increased 2.6% to 2,400 million yen. Not only did sales and profits increase in the domestic segment, one that we shall continue to focus on, but the overseas segment also contributed to earnings on a consolidated basis due to the results of structural reforms and other factors. This positions us to take a great leap forward toward achieving the long-term management vision GIFT+1 2024.

President’s Message
Review of the First Medium-Term Management Plan
The Group has established the long-term management vision GIFT+1 2024 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founding and has positioned the first medium-term management plan, which began in fiscal 2016, as the period for business structural reform. During this period, the Company restructured its overseas business, reformed its personnel system, and worked to introduce a new core system. The Company solidified its business foundation centered on these four factors and capped it all off with a public listing. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, we achieved our goal of listing on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Accordingly, the challenges we tackled under the first medium-term management plan have largely been met, and we are now prepared for the next stage.
Important Trends in the Pulp and Paper Industry
There are three important trends in the pulp and paper industry. First, with the evolution of IT technology, a digital society has emerged and paper demand is changing from graphic paper—newspaper publishing and commercial printing applications—to packaging paper and packaging material applications. Second, there is a shift from petroleum-based products to biomass-based products. Marine plastic pollution is now being recognized as a global problem, and since petroleum-based products are being increasingly condemned, biomass-based paper resources will continue to attract even more attention in terms of sustainable growth.
Third is the post-China global market. The Chinese economy has been growing rapidly for 20 years, which has boosted the size of the global pulp and paper market. However, factors such as the end of the period of rapid economic growth and trade disputes between the U.S. and China are leading to a market shift toward production and demand in Southeast Asia. As I mentioned above, China’s paper production and consumption substantially decreased in 2018. This is the first time since the start of Chinese economic reform that China’s pulp and paper industry has performed poorly compared to our previous fiscal year. We will shift our target to the Southeast Asian market, but its size and growth potential is limited, so we will continue to shift to India and Africa, taking a long-term
view. To summarize, the shift in demand from graphic to packaging paper, the shift from petroleum-based plastic to biomass-based paper, and the shift in production and consumption to post-China markets are the three key trends in the pulp and paper industry.
Demographic Changes and the Pulp and Paper Industry
The pulp and paper market is said to have a relatively high correlation with macro indicators such as total population and per capita GDP, but grouping the world’s countries and regions based on GDP and population factors, and then looking at the consumption of paper and paperboard, shows that there are substantial differences across regions. Although the world’s population was just over 7.6 billion in 2017, world paper consumption was about 420 million tons, about 55 kilograms per capita. The population of developed countries, including Europe and the United States, was about 1.2 billion, but 200 million tons of paper was consumed, or about 150 kilograms per capita. Next, China, with a population of about 1.4 billion, consumed more than 110 million tons, or about 80 kilograms per capita. India, with about 1.3 billion people, the second largest population after China, and the continent of Africa, with about 1.2 billion people, represent about 2.5 billion people. India’s consumption is only about 10 kilograms per capita. Certain countries in Africa, such as the Republic of South Africa, have relatively developed economies, but the average for the entire continent of Africa is approximately 10 kilograms per capita, like India.
If we group world regions on the basis of paper consumption in this way, we can generally see that there is a 150-kilogram group, an 80-kilogram group, and a 10-kilogram group. At present, it is possible to imagine that the per capita paper consumption of countries in the 10-kilogram group will increase up to nearly 50 kilograms, the same level as the world average. As seen from the above, from a global and long-term perspective, the outlook for the global pulp and paper market is by no means gloomy, but rather positive. Furthermore, demand for packaging due to the expansion of the e-commerce market and demand for household paper in developing countries are also increasing. The Group’s long-term strategy is to stay in step with the growth of specific products in particular regions of the world, to acquire paper distributors strong in those regions, and thereby remake the map of the industry.
Regions to Focus on for Global Expansion
Over the past 20 years, China has grown nearly fivefold on a GDP basis; we are also looking into whether other countries could achieve similar economic growth. China is reaching the end of its period of rapid economic growth, but it will be some time before we see India or African nations emerge as the next center of consumption, and meanwhile the world economy is about to plateau. ASEAN countries are likely to be the next market to blossom. For now, the Group will focus on China and ASEAN while also developing the Indian market. As the next stage, we can also expect the African market to develop. To enter the African market, we are considering having a base in Europe that would be turned into a beachhead.
Impact of E-Commerce Market Expansion on the Pulp and Paper Industry
New technologies such as IoT and AI are changing the
structure of society around the world, but above all, the
emergence of the e-commerce giant Amazon has led to
the collapse of the so-called “category killer” in the retail
business. Brick-and-mortar stores were hit hard by the
development of e-commerce in the B-to-C 1 market, but if
we only look at its impact on the pulp and paper industry,
there were also positive aspects. In other words, with
e-commerce, books and clothing that had been sold in
large quantities via retail outlets are now delivered directly
to homes without passing through stores. As a result, the
demand for packaging materials such as cardboard and
packaging paper is growing rapidly which, in turn, has
been highly advantageous to the pulp and paper industry.
1. Acronym for “Business-to-Consumer,” referring to transactions between businesses and consumers.
Solving Marine Plastic Pollution and Other Environmental Problems
As environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) receive increasing global attention, the problem of marine plastic pollution was taken up at the G20 Summit held in Osaka, Japan in June 2019. In my view, the global trend of environmental concern is not going to
slow down. The use of plastic straws and bags is beginning to be regulated worldwide. The development of paper products and biodegradable plastics is progressing as an alternative to conventional plastic products, but the Group aspires not only to sell paper and film mother rolls, but also to venture into product development in collaboration with manufacturers. However, not all of the functions of plastic, such as strength and durability, can be replaced with paper materials, so I also want our firm to contribute to the closed-loop recycling of plastic products.
For example, we have been continuously collecting about 60% of the products we sell using various methods, including the “ecomo” series, our proprietary recovered paper recycling system. However, leveraging this knowledge, we will also put plastic products on the Group’s recycling platform.
In addition, oil-based gravure printing is commonly used in Japan for printing on plastic films such as flexible and light packaging. However, this method generates organic chemicals called VOCs and creates air pollution problems. Hoping to popularize water-based gravure printing, an environmentally friendly printing method, the Group is also considering a partnership with a company that is a pioneer in this area, and transferring know-how to machine printing plants in Chengdu, China in which the Company is investing.

ESG Initiatives
In recent years, ESG performance has been gaining prominence as a required component for the sustainable growth of companies. Responding to two laws in Japan, the Law for the Promotion of Utilization of Recyclable Resources2 and the Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society3, the Group has long been committed to contributing to the environment through its business and has created a recycling-oriented business model of selling paper and paperboard and collecting used paper, making ours one of the largest such operations in Japan. This initiative has grown to become the Group’s mainstay business and is consistent with current world trends.
The process of selling raw paper, collecting the used paper and paperboard as recovered paper, and returning it to its raw material state is called material recycling. The Group is also working on biomass power generation— thermal recycling—in which thinned or unused wood is turned into a heat source. We want to continue to contribute to reducing environmental impact by making full use of the benefits that forests provide via both material
and thermal recycling, and by further developing our recycling business model.

3. Recyclable Resources and the Fundamental Plan for Establishing a
Sound Material-Cycle Society, enforced in 2001
Second Medium-Term Management Plan Started in Fiscal 2019
The second medium-term management plan contains three key strategies. The first is a global strategy focused on the Asia-Pacific region. Up to now, the Group’s overseas business has grown based on the business of trade. However, the expansion of the global paper industry calls for a transformation of business that is locally rooted. With a “glocal” approach, which means to think globally and act locally, the Group will strive to localize its overseas business, including mergers and acquisitions, while monitoring trends in the global pulp and paper industry. As part of that, we finalized the acquisition of Spicers Limited. in Australia this July. This is the Group’s first cross-border M&A move, and we will move forward carefully with the post-merger integration.
The second strategy of the second medium-term management plan is the development of biomass power plant operation support systems, which we have positioned as a driver of our solution business. The Group has also invested in the biomass power generation business, but it also analyzes data obtained from that business and has developed a system that will help optimize combustion efficiency. We hope to expand our horizons to overseas markets so that we can sell this system not only in Japan, but also in ASEAN countries and India, where the biomass power generation business is advancing.
The third strategy under the plan addresses the pulp business. In the future, we expect that pulp, a fiber derived from biomass, will be used not only in papermaking, but also in the practical application of rayon used in clothing and cellulose nanofiber, a new material. In addition, the market for sanitary paper towels and diapers, sanitary products, toilet paper, tissue paper, and other products is also expanding. As a global pulp supplier, we want to capture this latent demand.
Our M&A Approach
In today’s rapidly changing world, it is not easy for a single company to capture the global market. We are in an age in which an ecosystem that includes collaboration with other companies is used to solve issues of new market development, logistics reform, and new service creation. Further, on top of organic growth, which is based on existing management resources, we will add inorganic growth through M&A, and through these two methods, we will achieve continuous expansion. Listing on the stock exchange in 2018 has increased the Group’s stability, so we want to focus on inorganic growth, which has not been a strength so far, and invest in management resources. M&A strategy is the most common way to do this.
As previously stated, in the first medium-term management plan, we improved the balance sheet and created a solid business foundation. In the second medium-term management plan, the point is to improve our profitability, which is to say, increase our earning power. To increase our earning power, we must secure business profits by investing in growth markets, but the question of how to balance debt and equity under our capital policy is a major management challenge.
Conclusion
The KPP Group was founded in 1924 and boasts a 94- year history. Considering its history and size, the Group was a late-bloomer in listing on the first section of the TSE. Investors often asked me why we chose to list the KPP Group, given our stable management. But when I consider the business environment in the pulp and paper industry, it is entirely clear to me that, if we had stayed where we were, we would not have been able to see a path to the future. To maintain our growth as we head toward our 100th anniversary in 2024 and for the century beyond that, we had to move to the next stage with a public listing. The Group has gained a number of new options as a result of the listing, but one thing has not changed: our determination to keep providing value to society based on our core business. This we will do by building a recycling system that circulates various materials, focused mainly on paper resources, and by distributing paper materials one of the solutions for global environmental conservation and today’s phenomena of information overload. As expressed in our management philosophy, we will continue to meet societal demands by contributing to the realization of a recycling-oriented society and promoting education, culture, and industry. In closing, let me ask for the continued support of our shareholders, investors, and all of our other valued stakeholders.

 Message from Overall Sales & Marketing Head Domestic Wholesale Pulp and Paper, Domestic Locations
We will preserve the eternal art of paper, respond to market needs, develop the domestic business, and seek stable growth.
Overseas Wholesale Pulp and Paper, Overseas Locations
With the goal of taking on the expanding global market and becoming Asia’s No. 1 paper wholesale company, we will seek high growth by expanding business in each country.
 Tadashi Kurihara
Director of the Board
Senior Managing Executive Officer Overall Sales & Marketing
Head of the National Sales Headquarters
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, net sales in the wholesale pulp and paper, domestic locations came to 312,301 million yen (up 0.8% year on year) and segment income was 4,567 million yen (up 1.0% year on year). In the second medium- term management plan, taking into account the decline in demand for printing and communication paper, the core of our existing business, we will increase our market share by demonstrating the power of imagination and creativity. In the paperboard market, where demand is expected to grow, we want to gain an accurate understanding of end- user needs and leverage our trading company capabilities to increase our presence.
The trend that the Group needs to pay attention to over the medium- to
long-term is the problem of marine plastic pollution. In recent years, the move toward deplasticization has become a global trend, but we have launched a companywide project to offer solutions from both paper products and biodegradable plastic use perspectives. In the field of paper raw materials, we will increase the amount of recovered paper and pulp we handle, and further expand the totally recycling-oriented business model. Meanwhile, we are also working on new solutions, such as the development of an operation support system for biomass power plants. In the shrinking domestic pulp and paper market, we seek to achieve sustainable growth by focusing on solving social issues.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, net sales in the wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations were 71,474 million yen (up 7.0% year on year), and segment income was 30 million yen (compared with a segment loss of 91 million yen in the corresponding period of the previous year). In the second medium-term management plan, we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, especially East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Oceania, where high demand is expected. Spicers Limited, whose strengths are in the labeling, packaging, and sign and display businesses, mainly in Oceania, became a wholly owned subsidiary in July 2019, and further expand our market share.

     Aiming to Improve Profitability by Leveraging Synergies between the KPP Group and Spicers
 In July 2019, KPP acquired a 100% stake in Spicers Limited, a paper distributor dealing in paper, paperboard and other packaging materials in Australia and New Zealand. This took place under our second medium-term management plan, “Business Development Period,” which started in April 2019 and accelerated business expansion and M&A in the Asia-Pacific region. Thus, the acquisition of Spicers is the first step in executing our strategy.
Spicers operates eight branches in Australia and four in New Zealand, and is a leading wholesale company in the field of commercial printing. The firm operates in diverse other fields such as labels, signs & displays, and architecture. It also has efficient employees who have expert knowledge and high technical capability in their respective fields.
Meanwhile, Spicers has entered the potentially expanding sign & display market, while focusing on wrapping and packaging products. It also has a strong position in the wine label and copying paper industries.
David Martin, CEO and Director of Spicers, had this to say about joining the KPP Group: “Spicers is a solution-oriented company founded in 1896 and has advocated Accountability, Integrity, Collaboration, and Dynamism as our Company values. All of our staff have helped each other to achieve our goals. I think Spicers and the KPP Group share a common sense of value and commitment to our customers in our drive to succeed. From now and on, Spicers will work as a member of the KPP Group, which shares our ideas and aims to improve profitability.”

    Despite the continuing impact of the shift to paper-free operations caused by the spread of electronic media, declining advertising costs for paper media due to cost reductions at compa- nies, and slumping newspaper and publishing markets, sales remained steady due to higher exports and the addition of the newly established Kikyoya Kami-shoji Co., Ltd. to the Group.
    With the continuing expansion of the e-commerce market, sales increased due to higher exports, sales of container board to end-users, and rising unit sales prices.
    While sales of thermal paper increased, net sales decreased on declining sales for label and seal applications.
    Sales of recovered paper decreased due to higher inventories in Japan accompanying China’s import restrictions, and a decline in prices. Pulp sales increased on high prices and strong sales, mainly for imported products.
Net sales increased due to higher machine sales as well as an increase in the volume of biomass materials handled by the biomass power generation business, in which we have an equity stake.

The office building market in major cities in Japan is seeing the average vacancy rate decreasing after strong demand for office space in terms of floor expansion in buildings and relocation to attain larger spaces. The average rent is on a slight upward trend. Under these circumstances, our Group maintains a high operation rate of its buildings for lease, including the mainstay KPP Yaesu Building. However, rental income was down after some of the real estate properties owned were sold off.

Joined the Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance
Recently, there have been calls for global efforts to solve the problem of marine plastic waste, an emerging global issue. The Clean Ocean Material Alliance (CLOMA*) was founded to address this issue, and KPP joined this alliance.
In solving the problem of marine plastic waste, it is important that we contribute to SDGs achievement without disparaging the benefits that plastic bestows to people’s lives. CLOMA Principles have been established as ideals to be shared and we are reviewing and implementing the five key actions CLOMA has set.
As a trading company that specializes in paper, the KPP Group will leverage the business network it has developed over the years and pursue initiatives to achieve clean oceans.
* CLOMA was founded on January 18, 2019 to promote the sustainable use of plastic and develop and introduce alternative materials, and accelerate innovation through public-private partnerships with the aim of solving the problem of marine plastic pollution. According to the CLOMA website, 250 companies and organizations had joined CLOMA as of August 9, 2019.
Participated in the Plastics Smart Forum
Plastic that flows into the sea through rivers in large volume and is not recovered remains in the sea for long periods, so there are concerns about environmental pollution on a global scale. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of the Environment of Japan has been conducting the “Plastics Smart” campaign since October 2018 to support and broaden the efforts that various bodies including individuals, companies, organizations, and governments can take from their respective positions.
In accordance with the campaign’s purpose, the Group participated in the forum. Further, at the “2nd Promotional Goods Expo (Spring),” we displayed environmentally friendly promotional products and materials and recorded examples of environmentally friendly promotional activities. These activities are also presented on the Ministry of the Environment’s special website.

 Aiming to Become a Totally Recycling-Oriented Enterprise
The KPP Group’s basic stance is to make an environmental contribution appropriate for its business. We promote sales of products from materials that are confirmed compliant, and we work to expand business with material recycling and thermal recycling with a view to evolving into a totally recycling- oriented enterprise. We regard all these actions as environmental contributions that help build a better future for the planet.
Contributing to Sustainable Forest Management
Along with increasing environmental awareness comes greater demand for forest-certified paper produced from properly managed forests.
Forest certification schemes encourage consumers to buy environmentally friendly products by facilitating the proper management and labeling of forests and forest materials at the production, processing, and distribution stages. We have acquired FSC® and PEFC certification to go with our Chain-of-Custody (CoC) certification for the separating and managing of forest-certified paper so that it is not mixed with other paper during the processing and distribution stages.

Achieving a recycling-oriented society is stated in the Group’s management philosophy. ecomo is an exemplary business for achieving this. ecomo means “eco” and “to bring” (mottekuru in Japanese) and expresses the idea of “eco + model” (in other words, a new eco model).
Town ecomo is a system for collecting and recycling used paper from households. Special collection boxes are installed at local supermarkets, retail stores, and other locations. Consumers bring old newspapers and magazines with them when they go shopping and put them in these boxes, and KPP collects them. Some stores give points that can be used at the stores in exchange for the used paper based on its weight. Town ecomo recycling boxes have been installed in 436 stores in Japan as of July 31, 2019.

Material Recycling: Paper Raw Materials
Paper consumed in various products including newspapers, magazines, copy paper, and wrapping paper is collected, then it is de-inked and bleached, thus becoming a raw material that is transformed into paper again. Using recovered paper not only saves valuable forest resources, but also helps reduce waste. Paper recycling is an environmentally friendly societal mechanism.
We collect recovered paper through our nationwide network and supply recovered paper as a recycled material to paper manufacturers, and the quantity is top class in Japan.
boxes. After shredding the paper at its confidential document processing facility, water and electric heat are used to erase information and reduce volume, and the paper is then recycled. The confidential document processing system is secure and environmentally friendly.
Thermal Recycling
In addition to recycling paper, the Group is working on supplying biomass fuel such as scrap wood and unused wood as well as developing an operation support system uses plant IoT technology for biomass power plants. In September 2016, we invested in Biomass Power Technologies Inc., a company operating a biomass power generation business based in the city of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture. Through these efforts, we seek to achieve a recycling-oriented society that utilizes unused resources and revitalizes local industry.

Based on the KPP Group’s management philosophy—“Pursuing the happiness of the employees and their families and aiming to become a company that is trusted by its shareholders, customers, suppliers, and communities”— we have created an environment where employees can perform to their full potential. Further, to build positive relationships with various stakeholders, we will keep striving to ensure that employees and their families can work and live with security, with the goal of being a company trusted by society.
A Company Open to the Community
We will fulfill our role as a good corporate citizen by proactively engaging in locally based activities.
Support for the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust
Since 2015, the Group has endorsed the Great East Japan Earthquake reconstruction project promoted by the C.W. Nicol Afan Woodland Trust. As part of this, the Trust supports the cultivation and harvesting of raw materials for Japanese paper and Japanese papermaking lessons at the Miyanomori Elementary School.
The Japanese papermaking experience class, started in 2016, was held for the third time in 2018. Mr. Rogier Uitenboogaar, an artist of handmade Japanese paper, was invited as an instructor for third graders. In the class, each student created their own original Japanese paper made with plants and seaweed from Higashi-Matsushima City, Miyagi Prefecture. The students collected kozo (paper mulberry) and mitsumata (Oriental paper bush) planted in the forest at the back of the school building three years ago and used them as the raw materials for the Japanese paper. The children learned about the appeal of Japanese paper and the environment they live in through the making of the paper.
TSUNAGU GALLERY
At the entrance on the first floor of our head office, works of art and paper products featured in our public relations magazine TSUNAGU are displayed, providing a space for communication that visiting business partners and local residents can freely enjoy.
In fiscal 2018, we exhibited the Japanese paper artwork of Mr. Rogier Uitenboogaart, an artist of Japanese handmade paper. In addition, Mr. Uitenboogaart has created original handmade paper using kozo and mitsumata planted on the roof garden of our head office building. In 2019, we marked the fifth year of his Japanese papermaking exhibition and we will continue this handmade Japanese papermaking to mark the 100th anniversary of our founding in 2024.
Support for the Environment Athletes Organization
We have been supporting the Environment Athletes Organization’s objective of offering environmental education and realizing its social contribution with sports as its focus. The Organization is dispatching athletes to elementary schools in each area to provide extracurricular lessons about the importance of clean water, air, and the earth while enjoying sports.
In fiscal 2018, the athletes held classes on baseball and running for elementary school children in Setagaya-ku, Tokyo. At subsequent environmental classes, the children learned that an environment blessed with clean air and water is indispensable for playing sports. As part of its contribution to the local community, the Group will continue to support the Organization and communicate the importance of the natural environment to children, who represent the future.
Participation in a Rooftop Greening Project in Ginza
In 2010, the Group planted greenery on the roof of KPP’s head office as part of its CSR activities. Employee volunteers are using this garden to grow vegetables and fruits throughout the year. The Ginza Honey Bee Project, the initiative of an NPO that we’ve participated in since 2015, is promoting rooftop greening, in which sweet potatoes cultivated on rooftops are used as part of the ingredients for brewing shochu distilled liquor. Sweet potatoes grown on the rooftops were harvested and provided to this project in fiscal 2018 as well.
Support for the Japan Rugby Football Union
KPP endorses the Scrum Japan Program sponsored by the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), and has supported it since 2015. The Union seeks to train the next generation of capable individuals through rugby. Its objectives are to popularize rugby among young people and beginners, assist extracurricular activities at elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, and link those activities with the training of individuals able to work successfully in various fields in the future. We hope to contribute to the development of a healthy and vibrant society through the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan.
Working with Local Kindergartens
Every year, KPP subsidiary Narumiya Kami-shoji Co., Ltd. which produces Sendai’s Tanabata decorations, displays them at the entrance of our head office as an opportunity for local residents to actually see its activities.
In 2018, the local Pocket Land Akashicho Nursery School and the Akashi Kindergarten visited our head office and viewed the Tanabata bamboo and the pieces of paper tied to it, on which people’s wishes are written. During Halloween, kindergarten children in costumes came to the office and our employees treated them to Halloween candy. Thus, the opportunities for interaction are gradually increasing.

Cooperating with Employees
The Company is convinced that human resources are the most important asset for a trading company. We have created workplaces where individual employees can display their capabilities and carry out their duties in high spirits.
Diversity Promotion and Initiatives
Under its Diversity Promotion Policies, the Group respects the gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, religion, and social status of each employee, and has established a system that permits all employees to play active roles.
To secure diverse human resources, we are strengthening recruitment from overseas universities and external recruitment of mid-career executives at overseas bases.
■ Promoting Women’s Career Advancement
In the three-year period from 2016 to 2018, we have addressed the issues raised in the Plan of Action for Promoting Women’s Career Advancement, but in fiscal 2018, the percentage of women in the workforce and the percentage of women in management positions remained low at 37.2% and 2.8%, respectively (both figures are for non-consolidated).
In 2019, we formulated a new Plan of Action for Promoting Women’s Career Advancement. We will take steps to provide a work environment in which women can play active roles.
Promoting Work-Life Balance
We offer programs that permit many different work styles that match a range of circumstances and wishes of individual employees, including those for a leave of absence and shorter working hours for childcare and nursing care purposes. We have established a No Overtime Day in each department and are working to raise labor productivity by reducing long working hours and promoting work-life balance.
In addition, the saved leave system was partially revised. In the past, saved leave was a special paid leave that could be saved for up to 10 days out of annual paid leave that will be terminated at the end of the fiscal year, and can only be used when an employee suffers personal injury or illness. In order to achieve a balance between family and employee health support, and childcare and nursing care as part of our work style reforms, in May 2018, we expanded the scope to include the employee and their spouse, parents, and children. It can now be used for medical nursing and nursing care (including assistance and escort during hospital visits) as well. We will continue to create an environment where employees can work with peace of mind while balancing work and family life.
In addition, we have introduced a job return system as part of our efforts to revitalize human resource utilization and support for work-life balance.

Staff Recruitment and Development
We are enhancing our training system for the internal and external training of each class of employee, including training for new employees, on-the-job training from longer-serving colleagues in the workplace, training for employees who have been promoted, and training for section, general, and headquarter managers.
To assist the independent career planning of employees, the Company has introduced a personnel system that provides multiple career paths according to positions and duties. In addition, we support MBA study and believe that each employee is the driving force for corporate growth. Further, we are actively developing human resources, and have introduced e-learning to enable employees to take classes from home for self-study.

 I’m working in an environment where every day I’m treated kindly by those around me. At first, there were many things I didn’t know about working in Japan, but since I work and live with Japanese people on a daily basis, I’m getting used to it. In today’s diverse world, it’s important that everyone work without preconceptions about nationality and understand that we are all citizens of one planet.

I have used staggered work hours since last spring so I could take my child to daycare. My child was often already asleep by the time I returned home from work, but thanks to the staggered work hours, I now have the opportunity to interact with my child on weekdays. This valuable system allows me to participate actively in childcare as a father. I’m very grateful for the understanding and cooperation I have received from people on my team while using this system.

  Plan of Action for Promoting Women’s Career
Advancement
We have not yet achieved our plan of action for the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2019, except for some targets, since the percentage of women on the main career track remains low. In the plan of action that extends from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2022, we have made an issue of this point and have set a target for improvement.
• Challenges Facing the Company
Because of the low percentage of women on the main career track, there is a low percentage of women in managerial positions
Target 1: Maintain the percentage of women among new
main career track hires at 20% or more.
Target 2: Increase the percentage of women on the main
career track to over 11%.

 Corporate Governance
KPP Group has prioritized the construction and continual enhancement of corporate governance systems in order to fulfill the mandate we have received from our stakeholders—including shareholders, customers, business partners, local communities, and employees—which is to deliver sustainable growth and mid- to long-term improvement of business value.
In June 2015, we shifted our governance structure to that of a “company with an audit committee,” moving toward management with greater transparency and improved mobility. Our Audit and Supervisory Committee, of which outside directors comprise a majority, performs auditing and supervision of the legality and appropriateness of business execution. Also, we employ an executive officer system in which directors, who are constituent members of the Board of Directors, handle decision-making and supervision functions while executive officers handle business execution functions. Through this we have clearly differentiated management decision-making and supervisory functions from business execution functions.
Board of Directors
Ten directors, including four outside directors, make determinations on important management matters and provide supervision on business execution. In order to achieve sustainable growth and mid- to long- term improvement of business value, we are taking advantage of the abundant business experience of our internal directors, as well as the practical and specialized perspectives of our outside directors, working toward the realization of pertinent decision-making and management supervision.
Audit and Supervisory Committee
The three Audit and Supervisory Committee members with voting rights in the Board of Directors—including two outside directors—work to verify the circumstances and operating conditions of governance, as well as to optimize the functioning of the Board of Directors. Audit and Supervisory Committee members who are employed full-time attend important meetings and offer auditing and supervision of the Directors’ performance, including proffering their opinions on management as a whole, or on individual matters, from a fair and impartial standpoint. Further, members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee hold briefing sessions on a regular basis with the Internal Audit Office, which serves as the internal audit department, and provide instructions as the occasion demands in response to internal control assessment reports in connection with internal audits and financial reports. They also coordinate with the Account Auditor on a regular basis and, as needed, receive reports on the progress of audits, and proactively offer opinions and exchange information.

 Corporate Governance
KPP Group has constructed a corporate governance system to ensure that decision-making is conducted in a transparent, fair, expeditious, and decisive manner with a balance between management supervision and business execution.
■ Roles of Independent Outside Directors
KPPʼs independent outside directors have several primary roles. One is to provide as-needed verification and evaluation of management performance and the status of activities undertaken by the management team with reference to the management strategy and management plan determined by the Board of Directors. They also judge the propriety of entrusting management of KPP to the current management team from a viewpoint considering shareholdersʼ common interests. Finally, they announce their findings.
The names and reasons for appointment for independent outside directors are shown below.
Officer Compensation
■ Basic Policy Regarding Compensation for Directors, etc.
1. The structure of compensation for directors, etc., takes into account not only their short term business achievements but also their contributions to increasing corporate value. The value they have provided will also
be shared with shareholders.
2. The amounts of compensation for directors, etc., are
determined in consideration of a balance of various
factors such as their achievements and industry trends.
3. The amount of compensation is determined by the board of directors, with pertinent participation and advice from independent outside directors, within the scope of total remuneration determined at General
Shareholders’ Meetings.

Mr. Kobayashi is a certified public accountant and tax accountant, and he possesses considerable knowledge of finance, taxation and accounting. We deemed him to be well-qualified as an outside director and member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee on the basis of his abundant business experience and achievements.

 In order to analyze and evaluate the Board of Directors’ efficiency, KPP Group cooperated with an outside organization to survey all directors, and then deliberated on the findings, having shared the results with the Board of Directors. As a result, the evaluation was made that, on the whole, the Board of Directors’ efficiency was being ensured to satisfaction.
Still, as a future issue, in order to further demonstrate the Board of Directors’ monitoring and supervisory functions, opinions were raised regarding the need to consider establishing topics to be discussed by the Board to ensure time to deliberate on topics of greater importance. Going forward, we will improve on the necessary considerations and strive to ensure higher efficiency.

CSR Committee
KPP Group established a CSR Committee in 2013. It is chaired by the President and has as members the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of its subcommittees. The CSR Committee receives annual reports and information on the status of activities by its subcommittees—the Compliance Committee, Risk Management Committee, Environmental Management Committee, and Occupational Safety Committee—and considers topics for improvement on an as-needed basis, working to improve and energize CSR activities comprehensively. In the event that a serious situation were to occur regarding compliance with laws and regulations, the President would himself undertake appropriate disclosure of information to society and demonstrate accountability by working to promptly resolve the issue. Also striving to identify the cause and prevent recurrence of the issue, he would clarify where authority and responsibility lies, and respond rigorously without excepting himself.

Changes in KPP Group Governance
I have been involved in the management of the KPP Group as an auditor for about ten years, since 2005, and as an outside director for about four years, since 2015. When the Company formed an audit and supervisory committee in 2015, outside directors exercised voting rights at board of directors’ meetings, and three changes in governance occurred. The first change was that board of directors’ discussions were revitalized. With the participation of outside directors in discussions, the awareness of all directors changed. Second, in order to deepen outside directors’ understanding of the agenda, the person in charge provides an opportunity to explain before discussing important matters. Third, when it is difficult to obtain a collective opinion, we can now deliberate continuously without rushing to a conclusion, ensuring there is time for a thorough review. In this way, discussions at the board of directors meeting are now conducted carefully, which has helped strengthen the governance of the KPP Group.
Future Role of Outside Directors
Outside directors are expected to provide audit and supervisory functions over executive officers, and to provide management advice. Now, under our system, there are four outside directors, two of whom are Audit and Supervisory Committee members, and two of whom are not. The newly appointed outside directors
Tatsushi Yano

     will conduct their work in such a manner as to enhance the corporate value of the KPP Group by both fulfilling their management functions and, with the Audit and Supervisory Committee members, performing the audit functions.
Aiming to Increase Corporate Value
There are short-term and medium- to long-term challenges for the KPP Group in order for it to increase its corporate value. The short-term challenge is to ensure that the post-merger integration of Spicers Limited (Spicers), the largest-ever investment by the KPP Group, is conducted reliably. Since Spicers can contribute to the bottom line as a member of the KPP Group, we believe the market’s evaluation of KPP will rise even higher. Next, a medium- to long-term challenge is to steadily execute our management plan based on GIFT+1 2024, our long- term management vision.
Although GIFT+1 2024 divides the period through 2024 into three stages, the second medium-term management plan, which is positioned as a business development period, began this year. We seek to aggressively develop business during the business development period but, as Directors of the Board and Members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, we want to determine in a level-headed manner whether such a plan is feasible and sustainable.

For 32 years I worked in the chemical division of a general trading company, and 12 years in a chemical manufacturing company. During this time, I gained experience not only in trading businesses but also in establishing, operating and managing overseas manufacturing business companies and sales companies. I hope to use this experience to proactively express my views to the executive management from the standpoint of an outside director, based on my viewpoint and analysis. The KPP Group has entered its second medium-term management plan, which is the business development period of the long-term management vision GIFT+1 2024 for the year 2024. The Group is taking on new challenges and is at a crossroads of major changes and developments. During that process, establishing compliance, ensuring transparency, reforming work styles, enhancing internal controls, and sharing the interests of stakeholders has become important. I will provide advice that contributes to the continuous growth of the KPP Group, as well as management oversight of execution, so that governance can be managed.

One of the roles expected of outside directors is to provide advice from the standpoint of promoting the sustainable growth of the Company and raising corporate value over the medium- to long-term, based on their insight into management policies and management improvement. For more than 30 years, I have worked in the field of sales and marketing at a foreign-affiliated IT company, and I have seen numerous examples of companies transforming their businesses through the strategic use of IT. From early on, I worked to promote diversity and work-style reform. While taking advantage of this experience, as an outside director, I would like to contribute to the management team’s decision-making by posing frank questions, communicating necessary but unpleasant information as well as approval, as the situation warrants. As part of its growth strategy, the Group is working to strengthen overseas business through mergers and acquisitions. Regarding the status of strategic measures for future growth, the communication with stakeholders will become even more important in the future.

While ensuring financial soundness,
we will continue to invest in future growth and increase corporate value.
 Ichiro Akamatsu
Director of the Board
Senior Managing Executive Officer Head of Corporate Administration Headquarters
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the Groupʼs business results in the final year of the first medium- term management plan were sales of 384,973 million yen (up 1.9% year on year), operating income was 2,280 million yen (down 3.5% year on year) ordinary income was 2,518 million yen (down 18.4% year on year), and profit attributable to owners of the parent was 2,497 million yen (up 2.6% year on year). The equity ratio was 26.2%, surpassing our immediate target of 25%.
In the second medium-term management plan, the expansion of our M&A strategy is one of the pillars of our growth strategy. We will achieve earning power by leveraging our financial base,
which was made stronger by the first medium-term management plan, and using it in our investment strategy. On the other hand, under its basic capital policy, the Group strives to increase corporate value and deliver stable returns to shareholders. To stabilize its financial standing, the Group will work to maintain an equity ratio of 25%.
The Group was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2018 and has further accelerated its growth. Looking ahead, we will increase long- term corporate value by striking a balance among investments in global growth strategies, including M&A, financial soundness, and the stable distribution of dividends.

 Financial Analysis
Business Environment and Performance Overview Overview of the circumstances of operating results, etc.
The following provides an overview of the circumstances of the financial position, operating results and cash flow (“operating results, etc.” hereinafter) of the KPP Group (KPP, consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method) in the consolidated fiscal year under review.
I. Financial condition and operating results
With Japan’s economy being pulled along by the robust US economy in the term under review, corporate earnings reached the highest level to date. Among factors contributing to a boost in plant and equipment investment were consumer spending levels, encouraged by a favorable employment environment, efforts to make technological innovations, and labor-saving investment efforts made in response to an increased sense of labor shortage. On the whole, the trend was of steady growth with underlying strength.
To take a look at the world economy, in the US there was a steady rise in consumer spending due to the major increase in corporate earnings from sweeping tax cuts and the higher employment rate from the favorable employment environment. With the unemployment rate remaining low at around 3%, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) raised interest rates four times during the year. In China, there was a downturn in the economic growth rate influenced by the enactment of deleveraging begun in earnest and trade conflicts between China and the US. In Europe, while there has been concern about political disorder among European governments with the UK’s Brexit (withdrawal from the EU), Italy’s economic issues and so on, against the backdrop of the favorable environment regarding employment and income, consumer spending and government consumption expenditure contributed to a positive outcome. In developing nations, India experienced a decline in the real GDP growth rate for three consecutive quarters with the curbing of government expenditures and decelerated consumer spending, yet still maintained a high rate of growth at the mid-6% level; others such as Brazil and Russia trended low.
In the domestic Japanese pulp and paper industry, with the further acceleration of the rate of digitization seen in the IT and advertising sectors, demand for, chiefly, magazines, flyers, and catalogues has been stagnant, and the consumption of paper has continued to fall from one year to the next. With paperboard, however, a trend to use simple or minimal packaging in conjunction with corporate cost-cutting was observed, although there was an increase in the demand for cardboard in conjunction with the expansion of the e-commerce market, and there was growth in comparison with the previous year.
Under such circumstances, in the term under review the KPP Group achieved consolidated sales of ¥384.973 billion (up 1.9% year on year), operating income of ¥2.280 billion (down 3.5% year on year), ordinary income of ¥2.518 billion (down 18.4% year on year) and ¥2.497 billion in profit attributable to owners of parent (up 2.6% year on year).
Performance by segment was as follows.
Wholesale pulp and paper, domestic locations
In the paper sector, in conjunction with changes in the structure of demand, publications were subject to decreased demand, but due to an increase in exports, sales remained steady. In the paperboard sector, a rise in unit sales prices along with sales promotions targeting end users contributed to increased sales. In the paper raw materials sector, due to the weakening of prices caused by the increase in recovered paper inventory within Japan, in conjunction with import restrictions enacted by China, a decrease was seen in both volume and revenue. For pulp, prices remained high and sales trended favorably, particularly of imports, which led to an increase in both volume and revenue.
As a result, sales in wholesale pulp and paper, domestic locations, reached ¥312.301 billion (up 0.8% year on year) with a segment margin of ¥4.567 billion (up 1.0% year on year).
Wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations
In the US, as a result of a favorable trend in sales of imported coated papers, sales on the whole increased. In Southeast Asia, sales were sluggish due to decreased demand for paper media intended for advertising purposes, stronger restrictions on recovered paper imports, and a drop in competitive advantage in conjunction with falling prices for recovered paper from Europe and the Americas. In East Asia, sales to principal clients were favorable, with a considerable increase in sales totals for both coated papers and paperboard, particularly in Hong Kong. In China, however, with trade restrictions on recovered paper
being enacted due to trade conflicts between China and the US, sales on the whole remained roughly flat despite considerably increased sales of container board. In Australia, while pre-established business was sluggish, sales remained roughly level due to the acquisition of new business revolving around functional paper.
As a result, sales in wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations, reached ¥71.474 billion (up 7.0% year on year) with a segment margin of ¥30 million (compared with a segment loss of ¥91 million in the corresponding period of the previous year).
Real estate rental business
In the market for office buildings in major cities throughout Japan, there was a downward trend in average vacancy rates due to a tendency for office expansion that was observed, including relocating for the purpose of expansion, internal floorspace expansion and opening detached sub-offices. Furthermore, against the backdrop of the decrease in vacancies, average rental costs also trended upward.
Amid such circumstances, the KPP Group maintained a high occupancy rate, particularly on the basis of a key holding, the KPP Yaesu Building. However, rental revenue decreased due to the sell-off of partially-owned real estate to increase asset efficiency.
As a result, sales in the real estate rental business reached ¥1.197 billion (down 2.9% year on year), with a segment margin of ¥599 million (up 6.9% year on year).
II. Cash flows
There were ¥2.838 billion in cash and cash equivalents (hereinafter, “funds”) at the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review, down ¥1.296 billion in comparison with the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was primarily due to net income before taxes and other adjustments, revenue from the issuance of shares, and funds provided by through the period-end decrease in inventories, etc., being allocated to the net decrease in both short-term loans and commercial paper. The circumstances of each of the different cash flows in the term under review, along with related factors, are as follows.
Cash flow from business activities
Funds provided by through business activities totaled ¥4.217 billion (compared with ¥4.019 billion in the previous fiscal year) due primarily to factors such as a reduction of inventories and the acquisition of net income before taxes and other adjustments.
Cash flow from investment activities
Funds provided by through investment activities totaled ¥1.130 billion (compared with ¥7.920 billion used in the previous fiscal year). This is primarily due to revenue from the sales of tangible and intangible fixed assets.
Cash flow from financing activities
Funds used in financing activities totaled ¥6.623 billion (compared with ¥5.760 billion provided by in the previous fiscal year). This is due to the allocation of revenue from the issuance of shares, etc., being allocated to short-term loans taken out for working capital, etc., and the repayment of commercial paper.
Financial Condition and Operating Results
Details of recognition, analysis and investigation from managers’ perspectives
The details of recognition, analysis and investigation from managers’ perspectives with regard to the circumstances of the Groups’ operating results are as described below.
Items regarding the future contained here were determined as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year under review.
I. Principal accounting policies and estimates
The KPP Group’s consolidated financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with standards of accounting generally accepted as fair and valid in Japan. With regard to items for which accounting estimates were needed in drawing up these consolidated financial statements, estimates were made according to past results or other reasonable methods. However, due to the uncertainties that characterize estimates, actual results may vary.
It is the consideration of the KPP Group that the principal accounting policies listed below considerably affect the Group’s principal determinations and estimates in drawing up the consolidated financial statements.
(a) Allowances for bad debts
In order to provide for losses on uncollectible receivables, the KPP Group records allowances for bad debts regarding estimated uncollectible amounts, taking into consideration collectability with regard to specific debts, such as doubtful accounts receivable on an individual basis, on the basis of the historical bad debt ratio with regard to general accounts receivable.
(b) Impairment of investment securities
In order to maintain and strengthen favorable business relations with business partners, the KPP Group holds business partners’ shares. With regard to securities that have market value, impairment is recorded in the event that the investment value drops by over 30% and this is determined not to be temporary. Furthermore, with regard to securities that are not appraised at market value, impairment is recorded in the event that the net assets per share of the company’s stock drops below the book value by 50% or more and has no possibility of recovering its performance.
(c) Impairment of goodwill
In the event it has been determined that there are indications of impairment with regard to goodwill, the KPP Group makes determinations on the recognition of impairment. In the event there have been changes in the circumstances of the business acquired in the transaction for which goodwill was recognized, it may be necessary to record an impairment loss.
(d) Deferred tax assets
The KPP Group makes rational estimates of future taxable income. In the event that deferred tax assets are determined to be unrecoverable in the future in part of in full, reversal of deferred tax assets may cause fluctuation in earnings.
II. Details of recognition, analysis and investigation regarding the circumstances of operating results, etc. in the current consolidated fiscal year
(a) Analysis of operating results
(Sales)
Sales in the consolidated fiscal year under review were ¥7.258 billion higher than the previous consolidated fiscal year, at ¥384.973 billion (up 1.9% year on year). Details of sales by segment are listed in the following section of Annual Securities Report:
#2. Business conditions 3. Analysis of the financial condition, operating results and cash flows by managers (1) Outline of the circumstances of operating results, etc. I. Circumstances of the financial condition and operating results
(Gross profit)
Gross profit in the term under review increased ¥56 million over the previous consolidated fiscal year, at ¥22.064 billion (up 0.3% year on year). Also, the ratio of gross profit to net sales decreased 0.10 points from the previous fiscal year at 5.7% due to reduced profit margins primarily on paperboard, pulp and film.
(Operating income)
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the term under review increased ¥138 million year on year to ¥19.783 billion (up 0.7%). This was due to the fact that, although cutting retirement benefit expenses and logistics expenses reduced sales-related expenses, investment costs for research and development, overseas mergers and acquisitions, etc., rose.
As a result of the above, operating income in the current consolidated fiscal year was down ¥82 million year on year to ¥2.280 billion (down 3.5%).
(Ordinary income)
Due to the fact that the foreign exchange gain recorded in the previous consolidated fiscal year became a loss in the term under review, non- operating income in the term under review decreased ¥104 million in comparison with the previous consolidated fiscal year, at ¥1.259 billion (down 7.6%). Due to factors such as the recording of a foreign exchange loss as well as increased loan interest and equity-method investment losses at overseas consolidated subsidiaries, non-operating expenses increased ¥381 million year on year to ¥1.021 billion (up 59.6%).
As a result of the above, ordinary income in the term under review decreased ¥567 million year on year to ¥2.518 billion (down 18.4%).
(Net income before taxes and other adjustments)
Due to selling off the former site of the Kyushu Branch Office as well as investment securities, extraordinary gains in the term under review increased ¥1.001 billion year on year to ¥1.625 billion (up 160.6%).
Due to recording impairment of goodwill and appraised losses in investment securities, extraordinary losses increased ¥115 million year on year to ¥186 million (up 162.0%).
As a result of the above, net income before taxes and other adjustments in the current consolidated fiscal year increased ¥318 million year on year to ¥3.957 billion (up 8.7%).
(b) Analysis of the financial condition
(Assets)
Total assets stood at ¥191.610 billion at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year, ¥6.555 billion below the end of the previous fiscal year. This was primarily due to the fact that a number of decreases exceeded the increase in plant and equipment investment such as software that was undertaken in the current consolidated fiscal year. These included a decrease in inventories due to reduction of inventories on consignment, a decrease in cash and deposits in conjunction with the repayment of loans, and a decrease in investment securities in conjunction with a decline in stock prices of listed shares. (Liabilities)
Liabilities stood at ¥141.384 billion, down ¥9.086 billion year on year. This was primarily due to a reduction in interest-bearing liabilities, such as loans and commercial paper.
(Net assets)
Net assets stood at ¥50.225 billion, up ¥2.530 billion year on year. The capital adequacy ratio was 26.2%, up 2.2 points year on year. This was primarily due to an increase in capital and capital reserves in conjunction with an increase in capital through public offering and third- party allocation of shares along with an increase in earned surplus in conjunction with the posting of a profit.
(c) Regarding the liquidity of the Group’s capital resources and funds
Chief among the Group’s working capital demands are operating expenses such as current working capital and selling, general and administrative expenses. Investing activities such as research and development, mergers and acquisitions, purchases of software, etc., are also being carried out in the current consolidated fiscal year.
The fundamental policy of the Group is to make stable securement of the liquidity and funding sources necessary for business operations. For short-term working capital, equity capital along with short-term loans and commercial paper from financial institutions form the basis, and for funds procurement for the purpose of investing, long-term loans from financial institutions.
On June 26, 2018, KPP’s stock was listed in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. With regard to the proceeds of ¥2.561 billion gained from the issuance of new shares, KPP has engaged in plant and equipment investment related to the company’s internal core system and plans to continue further with investments. Furthermore, the remainder of procured funds are to be allocated to repaying loans from financial institutions.
The remainder of loans and commercial paper at the end of the fiscal year under review totaled ¥41.357 billion. Also, the remainder of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the term under review totaled ¥2.838 billion.
(d) Regarding objective criteria for the purpose of determining the status of achievement for management objectives
The KPP Group places an emphasis on ROA and ROE as management indicators and is making efforts to achieve efficient management. In the consolidated fiscal year under review, KPP achieved ROA of 1.3% and ROE of 5.1%.
Capital Policy
KPP’s fundamental policy with regard to capital policy is to seek to improve corporate value on a medium- to long-term basis and provide stable returns to shareholders. KPP strives to achieve a 25% capital adequacy ratio at an early stage in order to improve external ratings with the aim of stabilization of the financial foundation. At the same time, KPP will realize an optimal capital structure by striving to increase asset efficiency with ROA as a vital management indicator. KPP also aims for the ROE to exceed the cost of shareholders’ equity as well as for a dividend payout of 30%.

 Financial Analysis
Risks in Business, etc.
The following describe examples of risks in business that could possibly impact the Group’s operating results and financial condition.
Items pertaining to the future contained herein reflect determinations made by the KPP Group as of June 27, 2019. They do not encompass all possible future risks.
(1) Dependence on chief clients
Group companies Oji Holdings Corporation and Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd., KPP’s principal shareholders, are the primary suppliers of the Group’s principal products, paper and paperboard. The purchase amount of supplies provided by these two companies in the current consolidated fiscal year totaled 46.2% of all supply purchases made.
KPP is presently entered into a basic exclusivity contract with both companies, and it is the KPP Group’s policy to continually expand its business with them. However, if the supply of products from the two- company group to KPP were to be severely impeded by a natural disaster or other occurrence, the KPP Group’s development of business, financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(2) Influence of commodity markets
Purchase prices for products such as paper and paperboard, the KPP Group’s principal products, are influenced by the global demand for raw materials such as pulp, woodchips, and recovered paper, as well as trends in prices for fuel such as crude oil. Accordingly, if there were to be a major rise in these prices, it would impact the supply prices for such products. In order to ensure reasonable profits, the KPP Group continuously carries out price negotiations with customers. However, depending upon the circumstances of higher costs influencing selling prices, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(3) Distributional restructuring in the pulp and paper industries
The market for pulp and paper is greatly influenced by economic trends, consumer spending trends. Also, further shrinkage of the domestic market is projected in Japan due to factors such as the declining population and the paperless trend. In conjunction with this, there is a possibility that distribution companies will undergo further restructuring. It has been the policy of the KPP Group to respond to industry restructuring (due to factors such as mergers and acquisitions) with flexibility. However, if the market environment were to undergo unanticipated changes, or if mergers and acquisitions were to fail to meet the level of effectiveness anticipated by the Group, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(4) Makers’ trend toward direct sales
In the midst of a challenging economic environment, there is an increasing tendency for companies using paper products to proactively pursue cost-cutting measures. In response, the KPP Group has likewise enacted corporate efforts such as cutting distribution costs while striving to maintain business relations. However, in recent years there has been a trend by various paper manufacturers to pursue direct sales. This tendency has become particularly strong in sectors handling industrial-use papers and functional materials. In such situations, users who are the Group’s customers may choose to transact directly with manufacturers. If these transactions were to increase beyond the level anticipated by the Group, its financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(5) Foreign exchange rate fluctuation
The KPP Group makes sales in countries throughout the world, with a focus on Asia and the US, in the wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations, the Group’s business classification. Sales in the overseas- based wholesaling of paper, pulp, etc. in the current consolidated fiscal year made up 18.6% of consolidated sales.
The Group also makes export sales of paper, paperboard, recovered paper, etc. from Japan, and the price competitiveness these products have overseas is influenced by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
In the preparation of consolidated financial statements, when sales, totals, expenses, etc. are in various countries’ local currency denominations, they are converted into Japanese yen (JPY) for calculation; as such, they are influenced by the foreign exchange rate at the time the conversions are made. The KPP Group strives to keep the impact of fluctuations to a minimum by means of forward exchange
transactions, etc. However, if an unanticipated level of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates were to occur, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(6) Interest rate fluctuation
The KPP Group procures working capital chiefly through loans from financial institutions and the issuance of commercial paper. The KPP Group strives to keep the impact of interest rate fluctuations to a minimum by procuring long-term (fixed-rate) loans, incorporating interest rate swaps, etc. However, if an unanticipated level of fluctuation in interest rates were to occur, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted. The balance of loans and commercial paper at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year came to ¥41.357 billion. This corresponds to 21.6% of total assets.
(7) Country trends
The KPP Group makes sales in countries throughout the world, with a focus on Asia and the US, with sales in the wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations, in the current consolidated fiscal year making up 18.6% of consolidated sales. Yet in these various countries, factors such as legal changes, surges in labor costs and diplomatic issues can inhibit business activities. The market for pulp and paper is also greatly influenced by economic trends, consumer spending trends, and so on, in countries or regions where business development is carried out. The KPP Group strives to keep these risks to a minimum via insurance for accounts receivable in overseas business, conducting thorough research regarding relevant countries, etc., but if these risks were to occur, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
In the 142nd consolidated fiscal year, as well as the 143rd, large allowances were recorded for bad debts, mainly from clients in China and Hong Kong, and these were recorded as segmental losses. In KPP’s business in China, liquidation proceedings are being pursued for KOKUSAI PULP & PAPER (CHINA) Co., Ltd., whose financial condition had deteriorated, with allowances for bad debts having been one of the primary factors. If an unanticipated loss were to occur in the liquidation process, however, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(8) Client credit
In the KPP Group’s sales transactions, a growing number of clients are adopting the practices of credit sales and note collection. Also, current circumstances are such that in the KPP Group’s wholesale pulp and paper, overseas locations, the “Asia” region represents a large percentage. In light of such circumstances, the KPP Group strives to avoid credit risk by holding credit review meetings on a regular basis for all overseas-based locations, holding annual meetings with personnel in charge of management at overseas locations, and implementing thorough individual client management. However, if clients’ credit standings were to deteriorate and unrecoverable receivables were to increase beyond the anticipated level, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted. Accounts receivable to the Group at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed Samson Paper Holdings Ltd. (“Samson Paper Holdings Group” hereinafter), which is the KPP Group’s principal customer in the “Asia” district, totaled ¥15.988 billion.
(9) Retirement benefit obligations
The KPP Group utilizes defined benefit, lump-sum retirement allowance, and defined-contribution pension systems. The retirement benefit expenses and retirement benefit obligations that arise in conjunction with this are calculated on the basis of preconditions established through actuarial calculations such as the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets. The Group also employs stock trust for a portion of pension assets. Accordingly, if the discount rate were to fall, investment returns deteriorate, or the market value of entrusted stock fall, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(10) Market value fluctuations in stock held
Of stock held by the KPP Group, more than half comprises stock in firms with which the Group has close business ties, such as supplier firms, customer firms, and financial institutions. However, if the prices of relevant stock were to fluctuate due to factors such as stock market trends or relevant firms’ performance, the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted.
(11) New business investment
In order to expand business opportunities, bolster existing business, and so on, the KPP Group makes investments in the establishment of new companies, the acquisition of existing companies, etc. In April 2017, the Group invested ¥190 million in Hokan Tokyo Business Service Co., Ltd., which provides support for home-visit nursing service business startup and operation. This investment bears certain risks, such as additional losses being incurred if invested funds were to become unrecoverable or be withdrawn, or projected earnings were to fail to materialize. There is also the possibility that funds appropriated to research and development activities could be unrecoverable due to a change in circumstances.
To manage these risks, the KPP Group is taking the following measures: operating an investment committee, carrying out sufficient deliberations regarding the profitability of investments, making verifications on a regular basis of places of investments’ operating conditions, monitoring the progress of projections, etc., and making reports to the Board of Directors. However, it is difficult to completely avoid the risk of additional losses as well as the risk that profit will not increase as planned. In conjunction with changes in the business environment, withdrawals from the projects, and so on, these risks could impact the Group’s financial condition and operating results.
(12) Chinese investments
The KPP Group has two equity-method manufacturing affiliates in China. Investments in the Mission Sky Group Limited Group, which deals with the production and sales of container board, in an equity- method merger with the Samson Paper Holdings Group, totaled ¥3.622 billion at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year, including goodwill totaling ¥1.178 billion. With regard to business projects involving Chinese investment, management reports are produced internally, and the progress of operating results and investment projections are monitored quarterly by responsible departments. If losses were to be incurred by equity-method affiliates and these losses diverged significantly from business projections due to unanticipated changes in circumstances (factors such as sudden changes in the business environment), they would be recorded in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with KPP’s equity ratio, and this could impact the Group’s financial condition and operating results.
(13) Influence of the real estate market, etc.
The KPP Group is engaged in a real estate rental business utilizing owned properties, with stabilization of the revenue base as the objective. However, if the real estate market were to incur fluctuations and the prices or rental rates of real estate owned by the Group were to fall, this could impact the Group’s financial condition and operating results. Rental real estate accounted for 8.3% of total assets at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year.
(14) Relations with major shareholders
Through a March 1979 merger between Oji Paper Co., Ltd. and Nippon Pulp Industry Co., Ltd., both of which had been major shareholders, 24.3% of shareholder voting rights in KPP went to Oji Paper Co., Ltd. (the surviving company). Oji Holdings Corporation (a change in trade name from Oji Paper Co., Ltd. when the holding company structure was adopted) is no longer an affiliated company as a result of an increase in the total number of issued shares due to a public offering conducted on June 26, 2018. As a result of the decrease in the company’s equity ratio, it was then no longer considered an “other affiliated company.”
At the end of the current consolidated fiscal year, the company held 17% of shareholder voting rights (inclusive of indirect ownership). While KPP has continuously conducted business with the company and its group companies (“Oji Group” hereinafter) since its establishment in 1924, it now conducts business with the Oji Group under the same conditions as other paper manufacturers who are KPP suppliers.
Furthermore, the KPP Group and Oji Group share no common officers or employees, and do not receive one another’s seconded employees. In addition, the KPP Group conducts independent management; no matters in management decision-making require the Oji Group’s prior approval. However, if the Oji Group’s management policy or strategies were to be revised in the future, the KPP Group’s business activities could be impacted.
(15) Application of funds
Regarding the application of funds procured by means of an increase in capital through public offering implemented by KPP in the current consolidated fiscal year and the third-party allocation of shares, such funds were allocated to plant and equipment investment that is related to the company’s internal core system and to the repayment of loans. However, if this investment were to fail to produce the anticipated results, or unanticipated increased costs were to be incurred due to delays in the plant and equipment investment, etc., the Group’s financial condition and operating results could be impacted. Increased expenses, including depreciation burden, are expected subsequent to the completion of plant and equipment investment related to the company’s internal core system.
Management Environment and Challenges
The KPP Group is addressing issues including: promoting overseas business, expanding packaging material business, establishing and developing new business, and enhancing corporate governance.
(i) Promotion of overseas business
From its “GIFT+1 2024” vision for long-term management, the Group places particular emphasis on “Globalization.” While domestically in Japan demand for printing paper and communication paper in particular continues to be stagnant, globally levels of paper and paperboard consumption continue to rise. In the Asia-Pacific region market in particular, characterized by a high degree of potential demand, the Group aims to work in an integrated manner with regional locations to stimulate demand and to diversify revenue streams. In the 2019 fiscal year, KPP acquired 100% of the issued shares of the Spicers Limited, a firm listed on the Australian Stock Exchange which engages in wholesaling of paper, packaging materials, paper-related products, etc., and plans, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition to enhancing its sign display business, the company is devoting energy to labels and packaging products, and possesses strength in markets for wine labels and copying paper.
(ii) Expansion of packaging material business
While demand for printing and writing paper is decreasing, demand for packaging-type paper and paperboard is trending favorably in conjunction with the expansion of e-commerce and inbound demand. Also, with the trend toward deplasticization spreading globally in response to the problem of marine plastics pollution, major fast fashion retailers are switching to paper shopping bags and so on, providing evidence of a tangible global switch-over to paper. Under such circumstances, the KPP Group will strengthen efforts to meet demands related to deplasticization and share information with international organizations, research organizations, manufacturers and users through the Group’s participation in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry-sponsored Japan Clean Ocean Material Alliance and the Ministry of the Environment-sponsored Plastics Smart Forum.
(iii) Establishment and development of a new business
The KPP Group regards the Solutions Business, a new business undertaking for the Group, to be a sector that will play a role in future sustainable development, expanding opportunities for business by making proposals to solve issues. KPP has become a biomass fuel supplier, and the biomass power plant operational support system KPP is working to develop is expected to lead to improved operating efficiency. In the solutions business, KPP looks to coordinate with existing business in sales of paper, raw and peripheral materials, and is advancing its business activities in response to environmental issues and as social contributions. Furthermore, in order to build IT infrastructure appropriate for this age of digital transformation that can change people’s lives in a positive way, KPP will engage in framework construction.
(iv) Strengthening of corporate governance
Having been listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on June 26, 2018, KPP is moving forward with efforts to strengthen corporate governance in compliance with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, seeking to earn still higher levels of confidence and valuation from stakeholders. The KPP Group plans to facilitate a deeper understanding of KPP through the proper disclosure of information to stakeholders by way of IR activities and so on, improving corporate value through ESG management and making social contributions.

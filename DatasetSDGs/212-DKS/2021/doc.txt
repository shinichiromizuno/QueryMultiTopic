 DKS Report 2021 Editorial Policy
In 2016, the DKS Group began to publish its integrated annual report (DKS Report), which added information about the Company’s finances and management strategy to what had been in its Environmental and Social Report. From 2017, we referred to the International Integrated Reporting Framework promoted by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which became part of the Value Reporting Foundation in a June 2021 merger.
We are continuously publishing an English-language edition. As our business activities become increasingly international in nature, we aim to communicate to all our stakeholders including those outside Japan. Starting with the disclosure of environmental, social and governance (ESG), and nonfinancial information associated with DKS’s sustainable growth, we will also convey management’s vision, business results, growth strategy, capital policy and other information.
In this Report, by visualizing those “invisible assets” that raise corporate value, we attempt to describe the Company’s current conditions and its journey to the future, so as to be able to inform the readers of the creation of value across the short, medium and long terms. Looking to the future, we will use the DKS Report as a communication tool with all our stakeholders.
Please refer to our official website for detailed information about the financial and nonfinancial information of the DKS Group.

  1909–1950s
Founded as an Oil Agent Manufacturer, Aimed to Become a Comprehensive Chemical Industry Manufacturer
Founded in 1909 based on the “Dai-ichi Kogyo Spirit,” the Company developed and sold the silkworm cocoon unwinding agent, a chemical for spinning waste cocoons. The Company responded to textile industry needs by developing and selling a number of textile oil agents using sulfation and compounding technologies.
In 1915, the Company introduced the first domestically produced soap, Gembu Marseille Soap, into the textile industrial soap market, which had been completely dependent on imported soap. The Company strengthened efforts to expand into household products such as shampoo and laundry and bath soap, which provided a breakthrough contribution to business performance during wartime and postwar turmoil.
With the development of the textile industry, the Company established a position as a textile oil agent manufacturer. During this period, the Company developed the nonionic surfactant NOIGEN, the cationic surfactant CATIOGEN, and various progenitors for other surfactants, setting the stage for its rise to the top of the industry.
1960s
Establishing a Foundation for Future Growth
In the 1960s, against the backdrop of intensifying price competition in industrial fields, the Company expanded the scope of and diversified its industrial products. In anticipation of the future potential of the polyurethane market—positioned as a downstream sector within the petrochemical industry—the Company commenced its polyether business. Moreover, the Company launched one business after another that would serve as a foundation for the future, including flame retardants and sucrose fatty acid esters.
1980s–1990s
Becoming a Leading Highly Functional Chemical Products Company
In the transition to high-value-added products, the Company enhanced research and development in the priority areas of “Resources and Energy,” “Electronics and IT,” “Food, Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics” and new materials. The Company developed various highly functional surfactants and polyurethane products. In aiming to become a leader in highly functional

 Dai-ichi Kogyo (DKS) Spirit and DKS Mottoes
The Dai-ichi Kogyo (DKS) Spirit states that “We must demonstrate the
traditional spirit of the Japanese people—the Yamato spirit—in our industry, always realize coexistence and co-prosperity between ourselves and others based on the concept of service, and maintain sincerity to contribute to the prosperity of the nation, society and mankind.” Sincere efforts to manifest this spirit continue to be passed down through our three Company Mottoes: “Quality First,” “Cost Reduction” and “R&D Efforts.”
 Source of Original Technologies
During the post-World War I recession, the Company constructed laboratories in 1918, research incentives were stipulated in 1919 and “inventor award provisions” were enacted one after another in 1920 to encourage the creation of new products. The Company created superior new products and patents and strove to conduct research. In 2002, the Company implemented a patent incentive system ahead of other companies, contributing to the development and creation of new businesses such as the current life sciences business.

chemicals, the Company began collaborating with other industries as a way of addressing new needs. Moreover, the Company developed nonionic surfactants with a low environmental impact in collaboration with an overseas manufacturer.
2000s
Qualitative Change and Second Renaissance
Since 2004, the Company has constructed a business portfolio for a highly profitable structure and promoted the development and expansion of new businesses with high added value. With electronic and IT materials as the next generation of business pillars, the Company began to take steps to transition from a traditional surfactant company to a leading industrial chemical supplier. In 2009, the 100th anniversary of our founding, the Company started a six-year management plan with the aim of qualitative change and promoted the transition to a business division system, management infrastructure development and non- petrochemicals, thereby strengthening our financial position.
In 2015, the Company formulated a five-year plan for new value
creation, and in the same year, the new Kasumi Plant was constructed in Yokkaichi of Mie Prefecture, as a mother factory with the aim of integrating production, sales and development functions, preparing the foundation for a second renaissance.
Life Sciences Business Launched,
Full-Scale Shift to DREAM Businesses
With its full-scale entry into the life sciences business in 2018, the Company acquired Biococoon Laboratories, Inc. and Ikeda Yakusou Co., Ltd. as wholly owned subsidiaries. As an initiative that links achieving healthy longevity and revitalizing communities, the life sciences business has, along with the environment/energy, and IT and electronics materials fields, become part of the foundation on which the Company is focused for creating a better future.
    A Corporate Culture of Respect for Quality
As early as 1922, uniform product standards were developed and the
division of duties clearly stated that research staff were responsible for quality checks. In 1951, a quality management committee was established to cultivate a corporate culture of respect for quality and engage in organizational development. In the 1960s, QC circles were actively developed at plants across Japan led by young engineers, and in 1974, these activities were unified, and together with research efforts DKS established a reputation as a technology company.
 Uni-Top Strategy and Inspiring/Inspired Partners
At the Kasumi Plant, under the Uni-Top strategy (providing unique
products that do not pursue scale), the Company has promoted efforts with “business partners who provide a mutual spark,” whom we call inspiring/inspired partners. As the profitability of special nonionic surfactants and radcure resin materials is on the rise, they are expected to be growth drivers for achieving our numerical targets in fiscal 2024.

By enhancing manufacturing capital, we aim for the efficient use and sustainable management of natural resources, and a broad reduction in waste volume by preventing, reducing, recycling and reusing waste. Intellectual capital: As our vision for 2030, we announced as part of our medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, our goal of becoming a “technology developer pursuing progress and innovation.” Through this, we will strive to boost our ratio of R&D spending to net sales from the 4% range to the 5% range, so that we can deliver products and services with new value. In the life sciences business in particular, we will support economic development and the good health and well-being of people in order to contribute to expanding the technological innovation cited in SDGs 3 and 9.
Human capital: Based on the plans laid out in FELIZ 115, we will adopt a performance evaluation system that rewards contributions to the Company as we continue employee

happiness-based management in order to help boost employee enthusiasm and satisfaction. By doing so, we aim to contribute to SDG 3. Additionally, as an outcome of efforts toward human assets, we will further promote diversity and emphasize a higher rate of profit sharing with employees. Social capital: We will strive for regional revitalization and local community revitalization, which are important social issues in Japan, and we would like to achieve collaborative value creation through strong ties with municipalities. Within this effort, sericulture innovation is one important activity (see p. 39). We think it possible to contribute to SDGs 8 and 17 by establishing effective public-private-civic partnerships. Natural capital: Responding to the 2050 carbon neutral goal (CN2050) and reducing energy consumption are urgent challenges. Also, as a form of future value creation, we will promote mulberry tree planting with municipalities as we expand our life sciences business. Increasing the number of trees and effectively utilizing mulberry trees as well as silkworms can lead to CO2 reductions and contribute to
SDG 7.

DKS’s Identity
Materiality
ESG Basic Policy
We are confronted with a broad range of issues, from environmental problems such as global warming, resource depletion and a crisis of biodiversity to an increasing population that causes food resource and energy problems amid rapid globalization and an increasingly information-based society. We look to take on these challenges and to protect our environment and way of life while improving safety and levels of comfort. To do these things, we believe that “chemistry provides a solution” and shall contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society.
Important Issue Identification Process
At DKS, we are identifying materiality, tackling important issues from a long-term perspective in management. Based on existing social issues and our corporate philosophy, we have identified seven important themes from the two perspectives of their significance to DKS and our stakeholders. At the same time, we have specified the materiality of challenges toward addressing these themes. In the identification of that materiality, we have referenced the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*, ISO 26000, and other global guidelines, given the important demands the international society places on DKS as we work to advance business globally.
*At the UN Sustainable Development Summit held in September 2015, there were 17 SDGs adopted to find solutions to issues the world is facing.

16 DKS REPORT 2021
 
Reflecting on FY2020 in the Wake of COVID-19
 The year 2021 looks to be an historic time. The Tokyo Olympics was an international festival with mixed support given the COVID-19 pandemic. I would like to express my deepest respect to the all-out effort of the athletes and the event staff in supporting Japan, as host country, who decided to hold the Olympic games. There were many amazing displays, but I was particularly impressed by Japan‘s victory in mixed doubles table tennis, defeating an impregnable opponent and winning Japan’s first-ever gold medal in table tennis. I was touched by the words of IOC President Thomas Bach at the closing ceremony, “Thank you, Tokyo! Thank you, Japan!” Furthermore, I was inspired by the song, Hoshimeguri no Uta (Star-Circling Song), at the end of the ceremony. The line “Sora-no meguri-no meate” meaning “our guide to the sky,” is a reference to the North Star, which is indispensable for voyagers. I reflected on this star’s importance as an unchanging “guide” for people.
A year ago, in my CEO message I said, “COVID-19 has shut down economic activity, prompting humans to think again that the source of value might be analog after all.” Our Uni- Top strategy, which focuses on unique products that do not pursue scale, is a strategy that concentrates our intangible assets and boosts the value of DKS. The Olympics came to a close while COVID-19 infections reached record levels and we found ourselves in the fifth wave of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, historically unprecedented rainfall had struck the Kyushu region and areas across Japan. Reports indicate that the cause is rising ocean temperatures from global warming. As the first year of our medium-term management plan “FELIZ 115,” 2020 was a year for us to ascertain the suitability of our planned initiatives.
First, I would like to look back on fiscal 2020, then second, introduce our “path to value creators,” and third, our next management plan, SMART 2030. FELIZ 115 is a five-year plan
with a final-year target of net sales of ¥85 billion and operating income of ¥10 billion. In the first one to two years, we laid plans to strengthen our footing, while in the third, fourth, and fifth years, we will focus on accelerating growth, including reaping results from capital investments. Last fiscal year, in the throes of COVID-19, our performance was basically in line with the plan. In terms of quantitative results, while we were close to -4% versus the same period the previous fiscal year, operating income and ordinary income outperformed our estimates from the beginning of the year. This was the result of comprehensive strength in production, sales, and R&D from our reorganization, for the first time in 12 years, into a headquarters system last fiscal year. Profitability rose in areas we refer to as ACTUAL (existing) businesses as of the end of fiscal 2015.
This was the result of concerted effort to improve profitability by focusing closely on our customers. In 5G-related projects in our NEXT (peripheral) businesses, the first year saw stagnation from U.S.-China friction, but we have information suggesting that the field will recover in the latter half of fiscal 2021. The NYSE’s Dow Jones Industrial Average has been on the rise and topped $35,000. I think that the bedrock strength of U.S. companies is their national culture and character, which is different from Japan. The overseas economy, including China, Europe, and Taiwan, has also improved. Although we are still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic with no sign of an end, we forecast a high level of net sales and income from a business portfolio that is showing clear improvement. Risks of fluctuations in fiscal 2021 include rising prices for naphtha and related raw materials. I am confident that we can overcome this situation through the efforts that the production department has embarked on to minimize costs, as well as effort by the sales department, whose confidence is buoyed by performance results.
The Path to Value Creators: Turning Non-Financial Assets into Financial Results
 I believe it is our mission to create value that makes our four groups of stakeholders surrounding the Company feel “happy” (“feliz” is the Spanish word for happy). We made a matrix that shows what kind of value we are creating using FELIZ as an acronym, starting with “F” (for future) and ending with “Z” (for Z-FLAG, connoting “challenge”). We arranged this into five slogans categorized for each stakeholder and made a 20-item list: 4 stakeholders 5 letters (F-E-L-I-Z).
We are proceeding to arrive ahead of schedule at meeting the qualitative targets outlined in the management plan. With regard to value creation, the Octopus Model separates capital into financial and non-financial groupings. It is important to have comprehensive strength to take capital, which is considered to be non-financial and lacking in form,
and make it financial capital that is tangible. Looking back on the five-year management plan’s first year, which was spent entirely caught up in the turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic, I made a declaration: we will march forward down the path to value creators. The three pillars of our year-two focus measures are, first, a new system and personnel, second, launching new businesses, and third, establishing the life sciences business.
In 2020, the year FELIZ 115 kicked off, we took the business division system that we adopted 12 years prior and transitioned it into a headquarters system with production, sales, R&D, and administration headquarters. The objective, from an overall, optimum perspective, was to drive progress for individually optimized results under the new system. The

production headquarters created a concise outline of production costs, which boosted their mindset toward profit- oriented plants. This mindset includes a more entrenched awareness of managing activity in a data-driven, quantitative manner. The Sales Headquarters has thoroughly transitioned from being product-centric to being customer-centric. The Administration Headquarters has started efforts to strengthen management by digital transformation (DX), green transformation (GX), and AI utilization. Additionally, in terms of human resources, we endeavored to implement personnel system reforms that reward employee contributions. We coordinated with the labor union and launched a trial run of the system in April 2021.
Also, from April 2021, the R&D headquarters adopted a new system that leads to results by carrying out on-site verification using DKS’s technical map. The technical map, sorted and organized from the perspective of product portfolio management (PPM), plots DKS’s fields of technology on a graph, using a scale of one to five, with “superiority” on the x-axis and “future merit” on the y-axis. Suppose, for example, that there is technology field “A.” It receives a “5” if it has superiority in the chemical industry, a “3” if it is on par, and a “1” if it is inferior. After doing the same regarding its future merit, the field falls in one of the four categories in the graph. Does it fall in the category of “cash cow” or “dog”? Or, is it a “problem child” or a “star”? Based on the plot distribution, we moved to the next step.
We checked the validity of our allocation of research personnel addressing each of our current themes. When comparing the positioning indicated by “superiority” and “future merit” versus the current assignment of personnel, the executives in charge were astonished to see the weak current lineup. We also performed one more analysis. This addressed themes with superiority/future merit and relationships with future customers. We are building a research framework linked with PPM and promising customers. We are ensuring consistency with the customer- centric focus of the Sales Headquarters and tying this in with the portfolio creation targeted by the DKS Group overall. This is the new R&D system that we launched in April 2021. Similarly, we established new departments to promote the ideas of management of technology (MOT) and materials informatics (MI). Starting this fiscal year, we will cement this

system in place and then work to meet our targets in years 3, 4, and 5 of our five-year management plan. This constitutes the first of 2021’s three pillars.
The second pillar, which is the launch of new businesses, involves product development that listens to market needs. We narrowed down by half the themes arranged on the technical map. Next, we allocated personnel in relation to superiority, future merit, and customer-centrism. We have strengthened our relationships with customers, universities, and municipalities, which has led to early results starting to emerge from laboratories and new prototype development. Projects for research efficiency and productivity are progressing in parallel with DX activities. Going forward, further investment will be needed to meet our 2025 and 2030 targets. We are striving to raise total assets from ¥85.0 billion to ¥135.0 billion and will consider whether to pursue capital expenditures or M&A in order to increase total assets for growth. Deciding how to narrow our investment themes is a true management challenge, but also a challenge for our R&D Department as well.
The third pillar of our focus measures is establishing the life sciences business. Biococoon Laboratories, Inc. is tackling the challenge of dementia, which is a major obstacle for the human race. We have spent many years working to produce purely domestic medical fungus (Isaria Japonica), which we think holds possibilities for new progress in the field of cognitive neuroscience. We published a paper in January of this year in the U.S. academic journal PLOS ONE. Dr. Alois Alzheimer argued in 1906 that dementia is caused by cellular inflammation due to amyloid beta proteins. To date, major global pharmaceutical manufacturers have tried to develop treatments that prevent inflammation by eliminating amyloid beta proteins, but these efforts have ended in failure. Research fellow Dr. SUZUKI Koichi of Biococoon Laboratories has taken a broader look beyond the conventional target of nerve cells and focused on neuron-supporting glial cells. “Naturido,” a newly discovered useful component from medical fungus (Isaria Japonica), was tested in vitro on cell cultures and showed the ability not only to promote growth of neurons, but also to suppress their glial cell inflammation and to enhance astrocyte proliferation. Furthermore, in animal trials, we confirmed that brain function improved in mice fed Naturido. The research results that Naturido influences glia-neuron interactions
 
 appears to offer a new approach to improving brain function. 20 years ago, there were 6,500 DKS shareholders. On the
stock exchange, our market capitalization was around ¥10 billion, with an unimpressive trading volume. We strove to improve our corporate strength and started publicity and PR campaigns in 2015. Our market capitalization briefly crossed ¥50 billion but recently is trending steadily around ¥35 billion. We have been calmly making structural adjustments ahead of the Tokyo Stock Exchange market segment reorganization planned for April 2022. Changes also took place with our shareholders, with the number of individual shareholders temporarily decreasing to a number around 3,100. However, after the publication of research in an international academic
journal in late January of 2021, that number rose by nearly 1,000 and we now have close to 4,000 individual shareholders. My aim is to grow the net sales of the life sciences business to ¥10 billion in 2025. For our life science business, we already have a consolidated workforce of 75 personnel. We have been a B-to-B enterprise that manufactures intermediary materials as our industrial products since 1973, when DKS entered what we call our Renaissance period. The life sciences business is a B-to-C enterprise targeting individual consumers as we sell products such as “foods with functional claims” related to dementia. This is the second Renaissance period of our Company. We will strive to make this new personal- lifestyle business one-third of our overall business by 2030.
SDGs for the Millennial Capital City of Kyoto and the Steps to Move on “After COVID-19”
 Ikezu, bubuzuke, ichigensan. These words express the distinctiveness of Kyoto, the millennial capital city. Kyoto has a cityscape that is extremely rare in the world. The grid structure was learned from Chang’an, the capital of the ancient Chinese T’ang dynasty, but it left Kyoto without defensive walls. I have never seen any city like it in my experience visiting 60 countries. I think of the “walls” defending wall-less Kyoto as internal walls of protective knowledge. The roundabout words and phrases in the Kyoto dialect are important barriers. Ikezu is sometimes translated as “mean,” though that is going a bit far. Ikezu means to express one’s true thoughts without putting them into direct words. It is similar to the phrase “black humor” in English. Bubuzuke. This word also appears in rakugo comedy sketches. It is an indirect, euphemistic way of urging consideration. This is something like offering a certain kind of food as a gentle sign that it is time for you to leave. Then, there is ichigensan. It is the opposite of “regular patron,” and in English is like the word “stranger” (in the sense of “first- time visitor”). Kyoto has been called the city of tradition and
change. In Japan, and certainly in the world, it has unique local qualities.
Kyoto’s famous Kiyomizudera gave me the opportunity to see first-hand this COVID-19 pandemic. My thought was that this new coronavirus, which brought a pause to the crowds for the first time in history, was confronting us with a leap-in-the- dark moment. Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, a famous military commander of the early Heian period who is said to have built Kiyomizudera, was a man who saw the beginning of Kyoto, the millennial capital city. Wanting to know more about Tamuramaro, I went to Kiyomizudera. I was shocked at what I saw. The temple has an expansive parking area that is usually packed with hundreds of vehicles, but on this day, there was not a single one. Even when climbing the hill to the temple, I saw no one. This must have been the first time for such a phenomenon since the temple was founded. With no one in sight, I stood on the balcony of Kiyomizudera, famous for the saying in Japan, “To leap off the balcony of Kiyomizudera,” meaning “to make a bold decision.” I trembled from my fear of heights on the 17-meter platform
DKS REPORT 2021 19

DKS REPORT 2021
DKS’s Value Creation
Message from the CEO
and refrained from taking my own proverbial leap off the stage. Firmly checking each step on the way down the stairs, my mind wandered to the historical events concerning Tamuramaro. His conquest of the northern Tohoku region is like our SDGs. Why did Emperor Konin appoint Tamuramaro lieutenant of the Inner Palace Guards? And why did Emperor Kanmu later order Tamuramaro to lead a military campaign on the north? I think there are three reasons and they are all linked to the SDGs. The first reason was to procure funds for moving the capital city, which was then in Nara, to Kyoto. The northern Tohoku region, including what is now Iwate prefecture, was rich in gold and silver. It was a sustainable source of capital. The second reason was to control all of Japan and develop Kyoto into a 1,000-year capital city. And, third, above all else, was governance (though in this case, through the act of conquest). These objectives were SDGs.
Biococoon Laboratories, Inc. is located in Iwate prefecture and Dr. Suzuki, founder of the laboratory, is an admirer of the famous northerner and novelist, MIYAZAWA Kenji. Miyazawa’s song, Hoshimeguri no Uta (Star-Circling Song), was part of the Tokyo Olympics’ closing ceremony. In the lyrics, Miyazawa takes children on a tour of the constellations, from Scorpio to Ursa Minor, ending with the North Star, our ever-steady guide in the night sky. He was a remarkable man of encyclopedic knowledge whose writing delved into the questions of, “What is life?” and, “What is happiness?” Some of my favorite words of his are, “The ever-incomplete is complete.” We keep trying and trying but do not reach the end. The state of being incomplete is actually a kind of completion in itself. It seems to me that Miyazawa was seeking the completeness of the incomplete. A little while after the closing ceremony, I read The Undefeated, a book by Miyazawa’s contemporary, SAWAKI Kotaro. Why do athletes devote themselves to competition? The book tells the life stories of six people, among them boxers and runners, pushing toward their boundless dreams. The book keeps asking, “What is true happiness?” At Kiyomizudera, I thought of our pursuit of FELIZ 115. And I thought further. Karl Marx has written about
topics relevant to the SDGs. The three key phrases are humanism, planned economy, and national self-determination.
The objective of the SDGs is a sustainable society. In human terms, this means living a long life. The word humanism, which I came across in school as one of Marx’s assertions, has at its heart sustainability so that humans may go on living. The “D” of SDGs is development—planned economy. Natural resources will run out at some point. We must use them conscientiously and help them last as long as possible. Then, there is “G” for governance—democratic decision making to strive toward our goals. This is precisely national self-determination and democracy. Both Tamuramaro in the 8th century and Marx in the 19th century were transcending time periods and arguing for SDGs.
At Kiyomizudera, my thoughts were of our next medium- term management plan to succeed FELIZ 115, tentatively named “SMART 2030.” It is part of our steps toward moving on after the COVID-19 pandemic. The “S” in SMART stands more for “survival” than “sustainable.” The “M” represents our corporate “mission” to remain for the long term. The “A” stands for “action,” which is a must. The “R” stands for “reliable.” And, the “T” is for “turn” because “transformation” sounds too formal and the nuance we prefer is that of “turning.” For employees, this means “turning” stronger. Our Company Credo of “contributing to the nation and society through industry” and our three Company Mottoes of “Quality First,” “Cost Reduction,” and “R&D Efforts” are distilled into “SMART 2030.” Of the three or so steps for moving on after COVID-19, the first is our approach to the tightened Corporate Governance Code of Japan. For example, the Code requires setting up corporate committees for addressing issues such as a succession plan and executive remuneration. We will carry out these projects in a manner well suited to our organization. Specifically, this means establishing an Advisory Board comprised of outside officers and myself as the DKS representative. At meetings, I listen to the input of members outside the Company on
 
executive remuneration. Although we have not disclosed it publicly, DKS’s remuneration scheme is simple and clear. With regard to remuneration, succession plans, and the like, we emphasize an objective perspective. Every six months, succession candidates are evaluated by outside directors on a five-point scale.
The second step for moving on after COVID-19 is regional revitalization. Silkworms are the only insect living in coexistence with humans. What that means is that without humans, silkworms would not be able to proliferate. Antheraea yamamai are not this way, but humans are required in order to make silk. In the past, 3.4 million households were making silk, while today it is 350 households. We signed a comprehensive partnership agreement with Yabu City of Hyogo Prefecture, which has been designated a strategic agricultural zone. We are making effort to take concrete steps toward contributing to carbon neutrality by 2050. We will develop cooperative efforts between Iwate, Tokushima, Okayama, and other regions with large company think tanks. For this, we established a dedicated office in the Tokyo
Headquarters. The third step for moving on after COVID-19 is “people.” Retirement age at DKS is 60 years old, although we are not very particular about mandatory retirement. If an employee is healthy, motivated, and able to produce results, the person’s age is not an issue. Since we started publicity and PR activities, there has been a major shift in the personnel joining DKS. Over and above the shift in talent and performance, there has been a change in people’s countenance and posture. Last fiscal year, one-third of new young employees were keenly motivated individuals who had majored in biological science-related fields. We have informed the labor union of how much profit we share with workers. Before we distribute profit to shareholders, we first take care of employees. After that comes capital expenditures. Then, the remainder is allocated as returns to shareholders. When I explained this at the General Meeting of Shareholders, an attendee later said to me, “That was awfully bold of you to admit at the meeting!” When I asked, “How so?” the shareholder smiled and said, “Oh, it was reassuring actually.”
“WARP” Speed into Becoming a Smart Chemical Partner
 Tokyo is called the “Eastern Capital” because it is situated to the east of Kyoto, which was the capital city for more than 1,000 years. Tokyo is now the capital city of Japan even though there was never an official declaration of transfer from Kyoto. Similarly, there is no law stipulating Tokyo as the capital city. Emperor Meiji exited the west gate of Nijo Castle (Kyoto) and proceeded to Edo Castle (Tokyo). Although the emperor resides where the seat of government is located, the people of Kyoto still consider the emperor to be temporarily “in absentia.” The imperial departure sent a tremor through Kyoto. In Japan at that time, Tokyo was the largest city, with one million people. Second was Kyoto with 350,000, then Osaka with 250,000. The imperial “visit” to Tokyo, however, led to further emigration as 100,000 people left Kyoto and lowered its population to 250,000.
The first Governor of Kyoto Prefecture, NAGATANI Nobuatsu, realized the crisis. If the exodus continued, the millennial capital city of Kyoto would fall into stagnation. Nagatani lobbied the new government with his recovery policies, which were implemented. One of those policies was for Kyoto to host Japan’s first World Expo. Kyoto’s Okazaki District was the location of this first international event in Japan, and also the host site for the 2019 Japan Industrial Safety and Health Exhibition. One of the attractions of the World Expo was the Miyako Odori, a dance performance (then and still now) held in April by geisha and maiko (female Japanese performers) in Kyoto’s Gion district celebrating the arrival of spring. Another policy of Nagatani was to establish an institution called Seimi-kyoku, in part a transliteration of the Dutch word chemie for “chemistry,” and Nagatani’s
proposal was for a Chemical Science Agency. Seimi-kyoku was the forerunner to Kyoto University, founded in 1870, and Japan’s full-fledged chemical industry got its start in Kyoto. ONO Mohei, one of the founders of DKS, was a businessman who came to Kyoto from Yamagata with his sights set on this burgeoning industry.
The term “warp” is well-known in science fiction for referring to instantaneous movement. DKS launched a “WARP Force” project team in the life sciences business. We will prepare by investigating the layout of the “foods with functional claims” market and then integrate our capital resources. Then, if an opportunity presents itself, we will move at “warp” speed. I understood the meaning of the past year when I stood on the balcony of Kiyomizudera. At that temple (a calm within the COVID-19 storm) with a stone monument to Aterui, Tamuramaro’s worthy opponent, I thought of chemistry. DX and the online revolution moving with it are accelerating chemistry’s value creation. We will leverage our Uni-Top strategy—recognized for its uniqueness—to take DKS’s corner of Japan’s chemical industry that emerged from Kyoto and move it into warp speed. This is the path that DKS is following—the path to value creators.

5. TRAIN: systematic human resources training = fostering personnel to pursue ‘leaps’ (coordinating with consulting companies)
        Review
The initial year saw lingering impacts from the financial crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. With revenues growing over the next two years, however, DKS successfully achieved a target of the plan by recording final-fiscal-year (fiscal year ended March 2012) consolidated net sales of ¥56.2 billion. In contrast, the Company was unable to reach the plan’s final-fiscal-year operating income target due to sharp demand drops and ongoing high raw materials prices.
Although DKS aimed to increase net sales from ¥56.2 billion to ¥60 billion, the fiscal year ended March 2015 (the final year of the plan) ended with net sales at ¥55.5 billion, below the target because of delays in investment to raise production in core businesses and stagnation in the solar cell field. On the other hand, DKS achieved its operating margin target given record- high operating income, ordinary income, and net income.
On the quantitative side, sales were revised downward in the third year of the plan due to an extreme slump in solar cell sales, which had been expected to grow, but the operating income target was left unchanged, and in the first half of the plan reached a record high for the third consecutive year. After that, however, rising production costs for 5G materials, which far exceeded expectations, insufficient response to soaring raw material prices, and the COVID-19 pandemic led to operating income of ¥4.1 billion in fiscal 2019, the final year of the plan, unfortunately resulting in our falling short of the targets. The 20 items in the matrix, which are qualitative elements, have all launched or are in progress. As a result, our view is that the foundation for creating the future has been laid according to plan.
       Successes
• Increased business divisions’ profits by instilling a profitability mind-set
• Launched and promoted the Human Resources Development Project aimed at instilling an awareness of management in all departments
• Upgraded the management infrastructure (e.g., commenced introducing a new ERP system) for the future
• Maintained a healthy balance sheet (increased the capital adequacy ratio)
• Made new investments for growth (made Yokkaichi Chemical a wholly owned subsidiary) to expand business fields, purchased land, began preparation for a new plant
• Expanded business peripheral areas (NEXT) and efforts to create new businesses (DREAM)
• Focused on business development with new capital investment and R&D expenses
• Changed the balance sheet composition and increased total assets 1.3 times compared with the end of the final year of the previous plan
• Brought life sciences-related Biococoon Laboratories Inc. and Ikeda Yakusou Co., Ltd. into the Group
• Laid the foundation for realizing business income and profits commensurate with total assets, including up-front investment in new businesses
       Issues
Improve the corporate culture to bring a profitability mind-set to the forefront
Realize a balance in three areas (Balance sheet / business portfolio / human resources)
Maintain a robust and healthy balance sheet to increase earnings
1. Insufficient precision in market forecasting
2. Delays in reorganizing unprofitable businesses
3. Vague customer countermeasures (selection & concentration)
4. Negative effects of the business division system

Future Financial Strategies/Shareholder Returns
  In “FELIZ 115,” our medium-term management plan that started last fiscal year, we are aiming to maximize the use of total assets resulting from systematic capital expenditures, while also growing net sales and achieving an asset turnover ratio of 1.0 times in the fiscal year ending March 2025. At the same time, we will need strategies that emphasize capital efficiency so that ROIC can exceed our added-value target for weighted average cost of capital (WACC). On the financial front, we intend to continue optimizing the cost of shareholders’ equity and implement financial and capital policies to support TSR that exceeds this cost of equity.
In addition to our ROIC target, our financial goals include: 1) realize an ROE of 10.0% or higher in the fiscal year ending
March 2025, 2) stably increase the P/B ratio by 1.0 times or more by maintaining ROE above the cost of shareholders’ equity in each fiscal year of the plan, 3) ensure financial discipline while reducing the cost of capital to a reasonable level using moderate leverage and 4) achieve sustainable growth in addition to stable dividends. We will consider optimizing the cost of capital through flexible shareholder return measures that also include share buybacks. Moreover, in terms of M&A as part of growth investment, we will select investment projects for which ROIC exceeds the cost of capital and aim for a strategy emphasizing PMI (post-merger integration) that contributes to greater corporate value over the medium to long term.

 DKS’s Growth Strategy 1: Innovation
 Special Feature
The Technology of DKS—Interview with the CTO
DKS’s technological strength is that we go beyond simply providing materials and the ability to customize the function and performance of products in line with customer requirements as we make proposals based on the ideal product combination. CTO YAMAJI Naoki spoke with MIYANAGA Masayoshi, Tokyo University of Science Graduate School professor, on DKS’s technological capabilities.
What Supports DKS’s Technology?
  Miyanaga Could you give us a concise explanation of the “technology tree,” the technical road map (see p. 30) of DKS’s technology?
Yamaji The trunk of our technology tree is surfactants, which most of us encounter in daily life as detergents. This is technology for binding, dispersing, and removing substances like debris, oil, dirt, and dust that do not dissolve or come off our hands with just water. This category includes combinations of technologies as well. If you look at our products for use in battery cells, for example, we have technology that derives from surfactant/interface technology that can add functionality and mix together substances that normally do not blend.
Similarly, our urethanization technology utilizes surfactant technology. For example, there are products that blend functional inorganic materials to create heat discharging properties needed for uses such as in circuit boards and around automobile sensors. There is also urethane technology for civil engineering used in material for rock hardening agents that prevent the collapse of tunnels, etc., while a quintessential flame retardation technology is flame retardant that makes plastics less flammable. Ionic liquid is used in antistatic agents for liquid crystal films. It is not an overstatement to say that all of these fundamentally come from surface chemistry, which deserves credit for the broad scope of our technology tree.
Essentially, “interface” refers to the border area between two materials with different properties. Lithium-ion batteries are a straightforward example. Surface technology is necessary to create functionality by evenly dispersing active materials and cathode materials. This employs CMC and cellulose nanofibers utilizing cellulose modification technology. These products contribute to dispersing cathode materials, anode materials, carbon, and the like. Surface technologies are what not only remove dirt, but also can be useful in many applications.
Miyanaga As a specialty chemical manufacturer, which technologies do you see as most important?
Yamaji DKS has diverse and wide-ranging technologies. Other surfactant manufacturers possess similar technologies, but I think we have the expertise to know how to combine technologies to create functionality and differentiation. We, and other companies as well, are taking pains to create functionality while utilizing various technologies. Consequently, what leads to uniqueness at DKS are the combinations of technologies that we make until we ultimately create functionality. We try to emphasize combinations that have even the slightest advantage and solve issues for the market and for customers. There are some cases in which we synthesize or formulate materials.
Miyanaga Please tell us about “open innovation initiatives,” such as joint research with universities and efforts to gather information from external sources.
Yamaji We recognize that we must accelerate our technology accumulation in the life sciences field, which we need to grow in the future. Currently, while working on joint development with universities, we are proceeding to dispatch personnel to some universities. New discoveries—such as, learning that we can use a certain technology for a certain application—are vital. We have found that having researchers visit universities and discuss technologies while interacting with other companies and graduate research laboratories is extremely important and is an opportunity to transform the
We will meet all types of industry needs with our unique knowledge and technology.

 awareness of researchers. While there are technologies born from open innovation, there are also more than a few ways in which this innovation contributes to fostering human resources.
Going forward, we would particularly like to invest in personnel in the life sciences field. Life sciences is a very wide- ranging field. Through M&A, we have already welcomed Biococoon Laboratories, Inc. and Ikeda Yakusou Co., Ltd. into the DKS Group as we aim to broaden and deepen our scope of this business field. Since hurdles are especially high for pharmaceutical products, we are first targeting the area of
health supplements and subcategories of pharmaceutical products.
Keeping in mind our Company Credo of “contributing to the nation and society through industry,” we think that an issue for society will be health span, focusing on how to live long, healthy lives as the greying of society progresses in the future. We believe that Biococoon Laboratories’ I. Japonica- Bombyx Fungus is a start in that direction, while Ikeda Yakusou’s Sudachin is also a way to contribute to solving social issues through our life sciences business.
A New Organizational Structure
  Miyanaga In April 2021, DKS established a new organizational structure for R&D. What is the objective of reforming this structure?
Yamaji One of the most significant changes to our R&D framework was making the R&D Department the “R&D Company Department.” The reason for newly establishing the R&D Company Department came from our belief that divisions developing products need to be fully involved in the first stages of development, continuing through to profit management. If the focus is only on gross profit, it is difficult to judge whether a product ultimately brings a net profit, or to what degree it contributes to the Company’s operating income. At present, we have a visual perspective of gross profit for products that may end up in the red, but we want to pursue clarity on operating income and the future cash flow that a product can produce.
We also newly established the MOT Planning Department and MI Promotion Department. MOT (Management of Technology) aims for technology profit management in our operations. Meanwhile, MI (Materials Informatics) mainly focuses on DX and AI initiatives. To date, there have been aspects of our approach that pursued research through our researchers’ experience and intuition. However, we would like to, for example, use AI to input parameters so that a computer can suggest the necessary data and then research can be efficiently performed without the involvement of researchers. In proceeding with MI initiatives, all of the data must be taught to the AI, which means that publicly available research papers, etc. are input in order to make the system capable of judgment. It looks like it will take two to three years to complete this, but we expect it to be a meaningful way to boost the efficiency of R&D.
 Contributing to Society through Technological Capabilities
  Miyanaga In pursuing R&D, please tell us about your thoughts on demands for ESG and the SDGs, in addition to the challenges you would like to undertake in your medium- to long-term growth strategies.
Yamaji First, with regard to the theme of a decarbonized society, we are pushing initiatives forward in the life sciences business. We are allying with government agencies to plant mulberry trees as a way of reusing tracts of unused farmland, with the aim of reducing CO2, creating regional employment opportunities, productively utilizing abandoned fields, and offering meaningful activities for the elderly. This project will help with the stable procurement of raw materials for our product, I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, and, by engaging in sericulture in these local areas, we should also be able to contribute to carbon neutrality and regional revitalization.
With regard to medium- to long-term strategies, we are dedicated to developing electronics material-related projects, including battery cell materials. While DKS is not able to carry out large-scale development, batteries are continuing to diversify in various fields beyond automobiles. It takes approximately the same amount of battery development effort to pursue applications for automobiles as well as for other fields. We aim to promote development in areas where volumes are not huge, but where added value can be delivered. Outside of automobiles, batteries are used in increasingly diverse and familiar areas such as electronic assistive devices and mobile phones. Since each area has its own characteristics, it is difficult for major battery manufacturers to apply equal effort to all of them. We see this as a business opportunity for DKS.

Interface/surface control technology
A variety of applications can be achieved with surfactants, for example, emulsification, dispersion, solubilization, wetting/penetration, surface/ interface tension control, foaming/defoaming and surface modification. The primary applications of surfactants are emulsification and dispersion for mixing together substances that normally do not mix together. For example, although water and oils will separate after being mixed, adding a surfactant as an intermediate between water and oils enables the creation of stable emulsion. When washing dishes to which oil residue has adhered, the surfactant is first absorbed into the oil residue, where it reduces the interface tension between the oil and dishwashing liquid. Next, it enters between the oil residue and dishware via wetting/penetration. Finally, oil residue is separated from the dishware through physical force such as washing by hand. The residue is adsorbed into the micelles formed by the surfactant and then dispersed throughout the liquid, which prevents re-adherence of the residue. Moreover, improving the wettability of paint and adding various functionality (e.g., leveling,1 water/oil repellent, antifouling,
lubricity) can be included as types of technology for surface modification and interface control. For example, fluoropolymers are widely used in water- and oil-repellent agents for textiles. Our Company is working to develop PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid)-free fluoropolymers through the synthesis of various surfactants and the use of application technology. This makes it possible to respond to needs for surface/interface control, which had been difficult to achieve using conventional surfactants. See p.34

  Urethanization technology
This technology synthesizes a urethane resin that is a polymer compound possessing urethane bonds in the main framework of the molecular structure. Through diverse combinations of the raw materials polyisocyanate and polyol, it is possible to change the type and length of the structural chain and to change the structure of both ends, thus creating a variety of physical properties. This makes it possible to create substances such as elastic urethane rubber and urethane elastomer, as well as soft/hard urethane foam in conjunction with foaming reaction. By utilizing these properties, these substances can be used in products such as cushioning, thermal insulation, molding and coating materials. In addition, waterborne urethane resin can be obtained by emulsifying urethane resin. Our Company’s products can be broadly divided into nonreactive and reactive. Nonreactive waterborne urethane resin is an emulsion product of urethane resin. Reactive waterborne urethane resin is produced by using a blocking agent to protect the terminal isocyanate groups generated by the reaction between polyisocyanate and polyol and emulsification. Reactive waterborne urethane resin is composed of the two basic structures of a soft segment and a hard segment, and it undergoes quasi-crystallization during the resin molding process. Consequently, it combines flexibility, toughness and elasticity and possesses superior solvent resistance and adhesion. Because the material combines safety and high functionality, it is used in a wide range of processes such as film, metal, paper and textile.
Cellulose modification technology
This technology synthesizes anionic water-soluble polymers with cellulose as the main raw material. The CMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) synthesized via this technology can be used in various applications by changing the length of the molecular chain and by the addition of quantities of the carboxymethyl group. CMC is easily dissolved in either cold or hot water and becomes a viscous liquid that is colorless and transparent. It has an extensive record of use as a thickening stabilizer in general, and other uses include as a binding agent for fish feed and pesticides. CMC is also known for functioning as a high-performance dispersion stabilizer. It is applied to products seeking an even higher level of functionality, for example, as a binder for lithium-ion battery cathode paste.

Sucrose esterification technology
This technology is used to obtain sucrose fatty acid esters (SEs), a non- ionic surfactant where natural sucrose is part of the hydrophilic group and higher fatty acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid are part of the lipophilic group. The high safety of SEs is recognized by international organizations (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives), and SEs are approved as a food additive in Japan since 1959. In addition to food products, SEs are used in a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Examples include emulsifiers, viscosity modifiers, anti-aging agents for starches and texture modifiers. Synthesis methods of SEs can be broadly divided into an esterification reaction method that uses fatty acid chlorides and fatty acid anhydrides, a transesterification method with lower alcohol esters of fatty acids and an enzyme method using enzymes such as lipase as the catalyst.
Cellulose nanofiberization technology
This technology is used to create the new material cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) by chemically or physically treating the naturally derived cellulose fibers to reduce the fiber width to a nano meter size.
Our Company’s CNFs are exceptional for their extremely fine fiber width on the single nano level. This fineness is achieved via chemical modification processing. Furthermore, by utilizing its exceptional
Application Technologies
Nano-dispersion technology
This technology stably mixes immiscible substances to bring out the diverse power inherent in materials. This technology is expected to support dispersants that enable dispersion in the nano range, various dispersion methods, and applicability to a wide range of materials such as inorganic powder, organic powder and oil. Nano materials can be broadly divided into carbon materials (e.g., fullerene,4 nano tubes, nano fibers, graphene5), metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper) and metal oxides (e.g., silica, titania, zirconia), all of which possess diverse characteristics. This technology disperses these nano materials into mediums such as water, organic solvents and resins. However, as the particle size of substances is reduced to nano size, the impact of the Van der Waals force6 becomes stronger, resulting in problems such as particles being prone to agglomeration and a decrease in transparency. Interface control is required to prevent agglomeration.

Radiation curing technology
This technology instantly dries and cures coatings and paints of radiation-curable resin compounds by irradiating them with ultraviolet (UV) rays or electron beams (EBs). The technology is also called radcure (UV/EB curing). Radcure technology is used in a wide range of diverse fields due to its ability to conserve resources and energy and reduce environmental load. This technology is utilized in our urethane oligomer, and its uses include clear coatings for construction materials and furnishings; anti-rust coatings for metal; resistance materials such as semiconductors, dry film and LCD displays; coatings for items such as mobile phones, optical fibers, plastics and paper; printing ink; plate-making materials; and adhesives. Our Company’s monomers are made from the raw material alcohol using EO precision-addition technology. We offer a full lineup of products with added functionality (e.g., high hardness, low viscosity, low curling).

characteristics such as viscosity behavior, emulsification and dispersion stability effect, our CNFs can be used in products such as cosmetics and general industrial products.
Emulsion polymerization technology
This technology conducts polymerization2 by using surfactants to emulsify in water the monomers that do not dissolve in water. This enables synthesis of high molecular weight polymers that cannot be obtained via bulk polymerization or solution polymerization. Furthermore, because the polymer system is surrounded by water, it is easy to remove polymerization heat and perform stable temperature management. A polymerizable surfactant is a type of surfactant that possesses a radical polymerizable group3. It is used as an emulsifier for emulsion polymerization. Through copolymerization with monomers during the process of the emulsion polymerization, it improves the mechanical stability, chemical stability, freezing/thawing stability and foaming property of polymer dispersion, and improves the water resistance of the polymer film.

silicon and/or antimony to/in polymer materials to make them flame- retardant by a chemical reaction and bonding resulting from it. Recently, out of consideration for the environment, attention is being placed on the use of inorganic compounds such as hydrated metal compounds (Mg hydroxide, Al hydroxide) and nano-composites7 (MMT8, CNT9). Flame retardants are broadly divided into halogenated and halogen-free products that are based on phosphorus or inorganic substances. Halogenated flame retardants have superior flame- retarding efficiency and therefore are most widely used as flame retardants for plastics. Our Company’s products are brominated flame retardants that give sufficient flame retardancy with a small amount of use. Moreover, the products interfere little with the superior properties of plastic, namely, heat resistance, heat stability, UV stability, workability, mechanical strength and electrical properties. The products are capable of satisfying requirements for the flame retarding of plastics, which are increasingly diverse and have increasingly advanced functions.

  Discovery of “Naturido,” a new useful component for improving brain function
Our Group company Biococoon Laboratories, Inc. has researched the medical fungus (Isaria Japonica) grown on domestic silkworms (Bombyx mori) obtained by utilizing sericulture technology and discovered a novel, useful component called “Naturido” that improves brain function, as
noted in research results published in PLOS ONE (neuroscience), an
 international interdisciplinary journal.
The paper shows how Naturido not only promotes growth of
neurons, but also acts on neuron-supporting glial cells, enhancing astrocyte proliferation and suppressing inflammation. Research focused on glia-neuron interaction and investigated a new strategy to improving brain function. The results indicated that Naturido is a new candidate for improving functions affected by dementia. Currently, the DKS Group is conducting clinical trials and accumulating data targeting patients with mild cognitive impairment, as well as dementia patients. Through the life sciences business, we will continue striving to solve social issues in an aging society with a declining birthrate.

DKS’s Growth Strategy 1: Innovation
Business Activities Report
     Surfactants
1
 Segment Outline
Since the Company’s founding in 1909, the surfactants segment has provided core technologies that have supported DKS for more than 100 years. DKS surfactants provide high added value in a wide variety of fields and applications, including soap and detergents, IT and electronics, rubber and plastics, paints and color materials, and energy through their emulsifying, dispersing, solubilizing, penetrating, wetting, foaming and defoaming, and surface modifying functions. In recent years, we have also been promoting the development of products that are compatible with the globally increasing consideration for the environment. We currently develop and manufacture these products with petrochemicals and oils/fats as key raw materials primarily at the Yokkaichi Branch (the Chitose and Kasumi Plants), the Shiga Branch, and Yokkaichi Chemical Company Limited.
3
 IT and electronics materials  Soaps and detergents
 Paints and coloring materials
2
   Business Environment
This segment is leveraged by the Company’s many years of experience and accumulated technologies. The industrial fields in which the growth of reactive surfactants can be expected in the years to come include the paints and coatings field as well as adhesives. On the other hand, there are various competitors in this business, such as domestic manufacturers of detergents and emulsifying and dispersing agents. However, our abundant lineup of products has enabled us to introduce optimal products that meet customer needs, while we are able to conceive high-value- added products through our unique development approach. Going beyond simply providing materials, we work closely with customers to find solutions to their problems.
 Initiatives
Amid the global rise in environmentalism, we have been pursuing in recent years research and development on highly biodegradable, environmentally friendly products that do not cause water pollution.
We are also striving to expand sales of products for IT and electronics material applications.
 Strengths
The typical function of surfactants is to clean (i.e., dirt removal), which is represented in soap, a well-known item. Surfactants act on the surface of substances that do not mix, such as oil and water, and display emulsification and dispersion actions to remove dirt. Recently, however, the functions that the Company’s customers require for surfactants have evolved beyond simply cleaning to more sophisticated and unique applications that reflect the advancement of the industry. The surfactant synthesis, analysis, and evaluation technology developed over our more than 110-year history has enabled the Company to provide performance and functions tailored to customer needs through our numerous product lines and combinations.
 Achievements and Issues
During the fiscal year ended March 2021, net sales in this segment fell sharply overall.
In Japan, sales for IT and electronics applications were robust, but sales for machinery and metal applications, as well as textile applications, were sluggish, and sales for rubber and plastic applications fell sharply. Furthermore, occupancy rates declined in the hotel linen market due to the stay-at-home trend and restrictions on movement in order to suppress COVID-19 infections, leading to the sharp fall in industrial-use soap and detergent applications.
Overseas, sales for paints and color material applications were firm, but sales for textile and rubber and plastic applications were sluggish.
Going forward, we will reinforce our Uni-Top strategy and continue dedicating effort toward delivering customized products that meet customer needs.
Issues facing this segment are as follows.
 Declining earnings and lower relative value for DKS’s products
due to intensifying market competition in soaps and detergent
applications
 Delays in developing markets for environmentally friendly
products
 Growth Strategy (medium- to long-term focus businesses)
Having developed, based on Japanese technology, a reactive surfactant that, after demonstrating its function as a surfactant improves water resistance and other characteristics, the Company is focusing on expanding its market. Concrete measures include the following.

With more than 70 years of experience in cellulose polymers (CMC) using pulp, and more than 50 years of experience in sucrose fatty acid esters (SE) using sugar, the Company has a long history in product development and is developing markets based on the basic and applied technologies accumulated to date. Among these, SEs are highly characteristic as an edible surfactant, and DKS is one of only a handful of companies worldwide producing them. SEs are used as an emulsifier for oil/ fat and cream and as a texture modifier, for example, in cookies and snack foods.
 Achievements and Issues
During the fiscal year ended March 2021, sales in this business fell sharply overall.
In Japan, sales of cellulose polymers for energy and environmental applications, as well as pharmaceutical applications, remained sluggish, while SEs for food applications also performed sluggishly.
Overseas, sales of SEs for personal care (cosmetics) applications remained sluggish, while sales for food applications fell sharply.
Issues facing this business are as follows.
 Expanding sales channels in the CNF business
 Further developing energy applications
 Expanding into the field of high-value-added SEs
 Growth Strategy (medium- to long-term focus businesses)
Judging from demographic trends, indications are that major Japanese market growth looks unlikely. However, while maintaining our current customer base, we will strive to secure stable sales and profitability in Japan. As growth fields, we will also continue to unlock new customers and aim to improve lifestyle comfort by expanding sales and providing highly functional products centered on, for example, overseas food and personal care applications. Concrete measures include the following.

 Segment Outline
The functional materials segment provides technologies and materials contributing to advanced performance, including resins used in daily necessities, as well as IT and electronics materials often used in personal computers, smartphones, and home electronics. Some of the segment’s products include plastic flame retardants, antistatic agents, lubricants, anticlouding agents to reduce film and resin clouding, antioxidants suppressing oxidation degradation in a variety of materials, and radiation-curable monomers and oligomers using radcure (UV- or EB-curing) technology. The waterborne polyurethanes being developed since 1973 are used in wood and plastic paints, metal and paper coating agents, film and wood adhesives, and paper/fiber binding.
These products are manufactured at the Yokkaichi Branch (the Chitose and Kasumi Plants) and the Ohgata Branch.
3
 IT and electronics materials  Flame retardants for plastics  Film materials
2
   Business Environment
While many urethane resins are based on organic solvents, DKS is also researching and developing waterborne polyurethanes, in which the polyurethanes are dispersed in water, largely in reaction to rapidly growing demand for safer water systems as society places increased importance on environmental concerns. In addition to being safe for the environment and people, we believe these products are likely to see increased demand thanks to their ability to allow high-performance finishing in a variety of applications, including paper and metal processing, as well as film processability. Given the global trend away from organic solvents, this is a product group on which we are focusing our energies.
The target markets for this business show a strong potential for growth and are in areas both in Japan and overseas in which DKS can demonstrate its strengths. While competitors include electronics materials manufacturers and overseas flame-retardant manufacturers, the Company looks to secure growth through its innovative technologies and proposal capabilities.
 Initiatives
DKS monomers are highly functional alcohol-based products using ethylene oxide (EO) addition technology, which results in low curl, low viscosity, and enhanced hardness. Our B-to-B-to-C business model focuses on a cooperative relationship with our inspiring/ inspired partners to develop innovative one-of-a-kind products.
Additionally, we are building a solutions-oriented materials delivery framework for film materials.
 Strengths
The technology used in radiation-curable monomers and oligomers is called “radcure technology”, in which a resin composition such as paint is instantaneously dried and cured by irradiating it with ultraviolet light (UV) or an electron beam (EB). Radcure technology is widely used in several applications across a variety of fields to conserve resources and energy and to reduce environmental impact. Applications include the clear paint used in building materials and furniture; anti-corrosive paint for metals; resist materials for semiconductors, dry films and LCDs; and
coating agents for mobile phones, optical fibers, plastics, and paper. Brominated flame retardants are more stable and highly flame resistant than phosphorous- or inorganic-based flame retardants when dealing with materials like rubber and plastics.
 Achievements and Issues
During the fiscal year ended March 2021, net sales in this segment were generally strong.
In Japan, there was sluggishness in the sales of brominated flame retardants used in rubber and plastics applications but significant growth in sales of radiation-curable monomers and oligomers for IT and electronics applications.
Overseas, sales for radiation-curable monomers and oligomers were firm for IT and electronics materials, accompanied also by strong sales for flame retardants for rubber and plastics.
The DKS brominated flame retardant’s raw material is sourced from a global bromine production site, and because the raw material price can fluctuate based on bromine market conditions, it is important for DKS to maintain proper controls on product prices.
Issues facing this business are as follows.

   Business Environment
The lithium-ion batteries (LiB) used in electric vehicles generally employ lithium phosphate as an electrolyte and an organic solvent as an electrolytic solution. However, because there is a risk of organic solvents igniting, manufacturers have been careful to incorporate safety measures, including adding in flame retardants. We have developed an ionic liquid that remains in that state at 100°C and below, has no vapor pressure and is nonflammable, and because it is highly safe and has high ion conductivity, we are developing electrolyte applications for lithium-ion batteries and capacitors. These kinds of liquids are also attracting attention as next generation materials in the energy device field and as green solvents for reducing environmental impacts. Through these products and efforts, the segment is playing an important role in making all our lives safer and more comfortable.
While the improving technological capabilities of countries in Asia, including China, are a threat, we believe growth is possible by offering our proprietary technologies, R&D capabilities, and solid quality.
 Initiatives
DKS is focused on advancing business activity at subsidiary companies using its innovative technologies. The Company’s surface chemistry, which is its core technology, is used in the mixing techniques of resins and ceramic powders or organic materials and metal powders.
Furthermore, we have considered pursuing manufacturing and sales of products for solar cell applications in China, a market where further future growth is forecast in solar cells. With the objective of expanding DKS’s earnings for these products in the China market, we plan to establish a local Chinese subsidiary and target the manufacture and sale of products inside China for their domestic solar cell manufacturers.
 Strengths
DKS can conduct mixing operations under special conditions and
with a high level of viscosity thanks to its detailed know-how in
the process. Compound technology is one of our key strengths, allowing us to provide specific materials that meet the needs of our customers.
One example is conductive pastes, which have precious metals as the main raw material and are made with inorganic fillers and soluble binders. Conductive pastes improve functionality in the electronic devices and components used in solar cells, automobiles, smartphones, LEDs, office equipment, and medical equipment. Materials for ceramic and metal powder injection molding are used to produce small and difficult-to-process complex three-dimensional ceramics and metal parts. They often are used in electronic devices such as smartphones, precision components such as watches and medical equipment, and automotive and optical communication components. The segment also can provide powder injection molding compounds made by precisely mixing raw material powder, binder, and dispersant. Another of our strengths can be found in lithium-ion batteries, where we handle everything from materials research and development to the manufacture of prototype lithium batteries.
 Achievements and Issues
Generally, there was significant growth in net sales in this segment in the fiscal year ended March 2021.
There was significant expansion in sales of ionic liquids for display applications and in sales of conductive pastes for solar cells. Issues facing this business are as follows.

Japonica-Bombyx Fungus and Sudachin as “foods with functional claims.” Additionally, we are proceeding with development of general-use food products, carbonated beverages, and alcoholic products using I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus and Sudachin.
 Strengths
In December 2019, a new manufacturing plant for I. Japonica- Bombyx Fungus, was completed at Biococoon Laboratories in the town of Tanagura, Fukushima Prefecture. Having acquired HACCP certification, we have further enhanced our quality control systems to manufacture and provide consumers with safe and reliable health food products.
Ikeda Yakusou manufactures and provides safe and reliable products. The company also undertakes contract manufacturing business for products related to drug substances and foods based on high-quality powdering technologies. Also, able to handle chemical products, Ikeda Yakusou can provide products with various levels of performance and functions that match customers’ requests.
 Achievements and Issues
During the fiscal year ended March 2021, net sales in this business segment were generally strong.
The contract manufacturing business, such as pharmaceutical raw materials and health foods produced by concentrating and powdering extracts from natural products, remained firm.
Issues facing this business are as follows.
 Establish the B-to-C business and quickly generate earnings  Expand new contract manufacturing business
 Growth Strategy (medium- to long-term focus businesses)
Aiming for medium- to long-term growth and early generation of earnings, we established the Life Sciences Supervisory Department (under direct supervision by the Company CEO) in April 2021. Currently, the department is taking steps to submit “foods with functional claims” applications for Naturido, discovered from I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, and Sudachin, a substance extracted from the peels of sudachi (citrus fruit) with benefits against diabetes and obesity.
The department is also engaging in a 100-million mulberry tree planting campaign as part of efforts toward contributing to regional communities. Sericulture offers the benefits of CO2 reduction, new regional employment opportunities for seniors seeking meaningful work and stable income, as well as a secure supply chain for materials of I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus. These benefits contribute to a longer cycle of healthy lifespan for society. Concrete measures include the following.
 Promoting SDGs by revitalizing local communities through sericulture (Sericulture Innovation)
 Developing health foods and general-use food products (and later, pharmaceutical products) using I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, Naturido, and Sudachin

DKS’s Growth Strategy 2: Sustainability
Human Resource Management
Human capital is the most important asset for DKS, and we aim to maintain talented human resources and diversity based on the idea of valuing people. We recognize the growth of employees to be the driving force for the development of the Company, leading to a wide range of enhancements in corporate value.
Respecting Human Rights and Diversity: Promoting Diversity, Human Resource Development and Education
        Human Resource Philosophy Respect for Humanity
Our fundamental human resource philosophy is rooted in the idea that our people are our assets and must be nurtured and treasured.
Our basic understanding is that the growth of our people will support the growth of the Company. The employees are supposed to actively play their roles in each workplace; learn, grow and exhibit their capabilities; and try to fulfill themselves. This way, we believe that they become the power of prosperity of the Company and the source to make it eternal.
The Company also supports the maintaining and improving of employee health, which forms a cornerstone of individual employee self-fulfillment.
Human Resource Development Policies
1. Development of Professional Workers
We aim to train professional human resources who have high market value and can work on their own initiative.
1) People possessing advanced, specialized skills
2) People who recognize and achieve their roles and goals 3) People who raise and solve issues themselves
4) People who demonstrate leadership in the workplace
2. Development of Autonomous Personnel
Switch to human resources able to work on their own initiative through their own motivation
In our medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, which we launched in April 2020, we announced SDGs/ESG-based management objectives of “promoting the active participation of women” and “creating employment.” As priority measures for strengthening our business foundation, we are pursuing these as part of our project for strengthening appropriate resource management and revising evaluation systems.
Work-Style Reforms
 Work-Life Balance
DKS takes the initiative in activities supporting a balance between work and family. In terms of systems, we introduced a telecommuting system in fiscal 2019 and a flextime system in fiscal 2020, and are working to reform the personnel system to improve employee productivity and realize diverse work styles.
Promotion of Employee Participation and Advancement
Having set up an Employee Participation and Advancement Promotion Committee chaired by a senior management member, we are aiming for a human resource group capable of successfully contributing to improvements in Company performance. We are creating environments in which we can maximize the abilities of diverse employees, including women, seniors, people with disabilities, non-Japanese employees and members of the LGBT community, and enable them to take an active part in our Company.
 Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement In addition to environments that facilitate female employees
in working for many years, we will maintain work environments that enable women to develop their careers and implement measures aimed at having 10.0% or more of managerial positions occupied by women. As of March 31, 2021, this figure was 8.8%, and in fiscal 2020, we welcomed our first female executive officer.
Furthermore, as we ensure that all of our work environments are conducive to the active participation of females, we started hiring new female technical college graduates at manufacturing sites from fiscal 2019 and are currently continuing a steady pace of hiring.
 Retiree Reemployment System
In reemploying all applicants as Senior Challenge Staff, we
conduct monozukuri (manufacturing) by handing down senior employees’ techniques and skills that make the best use of the experience they have accumulated over many years.
 Employment of People with Disabilities
We believe that the most important thing about working
alongside people with disabilities is that it offers diversity, which brings lessons with it. We established a dedicated organization for employees with disabilities. While we work to maximize their aptitudes and talents, we are striving to raise our ratio of employees with disabilities by creating an environment conducive to their professional participation.
Efforts to Prevent Harassment
We are trying to prevent harassment through, for example, educational programs in hierarchical training courses (including employees in managerial positions). Several persons are selected as contacts, even from outside the Personnel Department, so that anyone can easily find someone to talk to and get advice from. Moreover, whistleblower portals inside and outside the Company, as well as an external Employee Assistance Program (EAP), are in place.

Human Resource Development and Education Programs
The three pillars of our human resource development and education programs are in-house on-the-job training, external education to learn skills and abilities, and support for self- development. In recent years, we have focused on enhancing our brother/sister program (a backup support system) aimed at a 0% attrition rate for new employees, while also focusing on the development of human resources able to handle digital transformation (DX) targeting the realization of disruptive innovation utilizing data and IT technologies. We have created DX learning opportunities for new employees, specially selected employees, and those who show an interest as we work to bring all staff onto our digital platform. In fiscal 2020, approximately 30% of employees received the training.
DKS is united in focusing attention on human resource training in other areas as well, including by bolstering our support for employees aiming to improve their own abilities, be it through the acquisition of qualifications, or correspondence learning (employees finishing courses with distinction have all fees covered by DKS).
 
   Concept of Health and Productivity Management
Healthy Company Declaration: Regarding its employees as Company assets, DKS will strive to maintain and improve their health.

We also acquired the highest health management rating from the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) for the fourth consecutive year. Going forward, assessments of Company efforts through the eyes of
external organizations will continue to lead to further enhancements in corporate value.
Targets, Activities and
Outcomes
Based on our Healthy Company Declaration, DKS strives to maintain and improve the health of its employees, and at the same time, stipulates guidelines for employee health activities and promotes Company-wide health maintenance. The employee health guidelines consist of five items aimed at improving productivity and enhancing corporate value through the maintenance and improvement of employee health. In recent years, we are strengthening initiatives to prevent smoking and efforts toward supporting the health of those not yet confronting lifestyle diseases. With regard to supporting the latter category of employees, from fiscal 2019, we started holding a walk-a-thon that uses an app that tries to encourage lasting exercise habits. In fiscal 2020, approximately 60% of employees took part. Of the participants, approximately 70% showed an inclination to continue exercising after the event.
The statistic indicating the rate of regular exercise rose from 16% in fiscal 2017 to 22% in fiscal 2020.
Happiness-based management
“Employee happiness-based management” is part of the goals of “FELIZ 115,” and we are pursuing the following three KPIs in order to target sustainable growth.

  Strategies and Initiatives
Based on the medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, we formulated a medium-term environmental plan for fiscal 2020–2024 and are striving for energy efficiency, GHG reductions, and waste product reductions. At the same time, in January 2021, we have launched a team for planning Green Transformation (GX) strategies in order to contribute to achieving a sustainable society as efforts toward decarbonization spread worldwide. With this team, we
GX Strategy Targets
devised long-term GX strategies for moving toward carbon neutrality in 2030 and out to 2050, and we also made a road map based on these strategies. Starting in fiscal 2021, we have been shifting to a forecasting and analysis approach that is informed by these strategies. As we strengthen our current initiatives, we will also expand our targets to initiatives that take the broader society into consideration.

 Improvement of corporate value

DKS’s Growth Strategy 2: Sustainability
Discussion between Outside Directors
The importance of outside directors is increasing by the year, as they work to ensure transparent, fair and objective decision-making. Two DKS outside directors exchanged their opinions on the effectiveness of DKS’s corporate governance as well as the Company’s growth strategies and potential.
(This conversation took place July 2021)
Q: Now that “FELIZ 115” has entered its second year, what has been the progress so far, and what do you think will be necessary for meeting fiscal 2024 targets?
Taniguchi Since the first one to two years of the plan are for solidifying the foundation, the points which need improvement must be continuously worked on with the support of employees. The trial run for the Company’s newly designed personnel system was launched in April this year. In this second year of the plan, it will be important to examine how to broadly roll out the new system and drum up support from employees. To date, the Company has had what could be called poor equality. An environment conducive to comfortable work for employees is important for company development and this “comfortable environment” includes freedom and the ability to work with peace of mind. At the same time, it is important to have fair evaluations and a compensation scheme based on those evaluations. I believe that being recognized for one’s diligent effort would improve the quality of work for the majority of employees.
Aoki As far as the progress of FELIZ 115, the market is watching closely to see if DKS can meet the targets of net sales of ¥85 billion and income of ¥10 billion, and we are pursuing business with that sharp focus. Major initiatives for boosting income include continuously improving the weak points of the Company’s existing businesses and carefully reviewing areas that are not contributing to DKS.
DKS is also moving forward with reforms to organization- wide sales activities. However, there are different levels of needs according to each customer group. The needs of people in management and core departments affect the operations of the entire company, but they do not always provide specific standards and features of the product they want. They come to us and say, “I would like to do such and such,” which means, “What expertise does DKS have to make that happen?” On the other hand, procurement departments have clear details of the kinds of products they are in a quest for, due to their needs for low-prices and quick services. They give these requests not only to DKS, but to our competition as well, so even if we win the order, we cannot expect a fat margin. I feel like I have the best understanding of FELIZ 115, which expresses the CEO’s ambition. Each department manager is requested to show active top-level diplomacy.
Q: What are your thoughts on employee happiness-based management?
Taniguchi There was a significant amount of debate on the Board of Directors when incorporating employee happiness-based management in the medium-term management plan. Initially, there were heated discussions in terms of “what would be the numerical targets?” and “how do we measure the degree of happiness?” Also, “Do the targets include non-financial indicators such as the utilization rate for annual paid leave, the ratio of female employees, and the hiring rate for people with disabilities?” The attrition rate at DKS is extraordinarily low. Basically, I think that the foundation of employee happiness is a system that allows everyone to enjoy their work and that helps them feel eager to come to work each day and do their best.
Aoki The key to happiness-based management is the definition of happiness, which is different for each person. A researcher, for example, may aspire to earn an award at an international symposium, while an employee of a company may only desire to work fixed hours at the office and receive a steady income. There are individual differences in happiness. However, the moments that generally make people feel the greatest happiness are when we achieve something. That is why, if the Company engages in initiatives that give employees a sense of satisfaction, it will lead to happiness- based management. I think that it is important for supervisors

Q: Please give us your evaluations of current ESG/SDGs initiatives of DKS.
Aoki As a manufacturer, DKS can directly contribute to lowering energy consumption and CO2 emissions, and lowering waste that leaves our plants. I think that instilling these types of efforts throughout the Group is the most important thing. Also, I expect benefits just from updating aging facilities, creating operation plans that avoid using electricity at night, and rearranging work shifts.
Taniguchi Aside from environmental matters, I hope that we continue to place emphasis on measures to prevent occupational accidents. It is important to instill a safety mindset not only in manufacturing processes, but in the Company’s management as well. In particular, since DKS has many older plants, it is essential to run them as safe, danger- free facilities by ensuring constant maintenance and tidying surroundings. I think that this type of effort will contribute to the SDGs.
Q: Japan’s Corporate Governance (CG) Code has been revised. What do you think of DKS’s initiatives as expectations grow for stronger governance?
Aoki With regard to the CG Code, some of its principles and content are fairly abstract and there are many items that do not clearly specify “comply,” nor do they “explain” standards. So, in our most recent Corporate Governance Report, we “explain“ DKS’s current status with regard to 10 of the corporate governance principles. At the outset, the CG Code of Japan was based on a U.S.-styled way of thinking. As the U.S. faced scandals over fraudulent accounting, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed, after which it was adopted in Japan as J-SOX. However, the governance structure between the U.S. and Japan is different. Whereas management teams in the U.S. possess extraordinary authority, Japan’s management authority is not especially strong. The issue in Japan tends rather to be with non-HQ business sites acting too much on their own, which means there is a need for governance that prevents this frontline issue.
The question is, what should outside directors do in this regard? At once- or twice-monthly Board of Directors meetings, we receive reports, but even if we ask questions or make suggestions, there is no guarantee that the information that comes back is correct. I think it is useless to simply make suggestions or rely on management monitoring functions. In my case, I think it is my responsibility to change DKS by actually going into the frontline and giving detailed advice on the mindset toward business, business models, processes, and the like. The organization will not change if we outside directors only watch and check things from the outside. Nothing happens in the conference room. The frontlines are where things happen. If we go there directly and offer guidance, that will support on-site governance.
Taniguchi The Board of Directors understands that some items in the Company’s Corporate Governance Report are so-called “explanatory”. There will be no development for the Company or happiness for the employees if there is no explanation of the type of governance that closely fits DKS’s characteristics (that is, even with regard to the CG Code, explain DKS’s individual circumstances), clarify the issues to tackle going forward, and then execute on those points. Chairman CEO Sakamoto has stated at the General Meeting of Shareholders that “employees are of utmost importance.” I think that the origin of prosperity for the Company lies in enabling these cherished employees to pursue a sense of happiness. My wish is that when we reach the year 2050, we will be able to hear the words, “DKS flourished because we implemented employee happiness-based management.”

DKS’s Growth Strategy 2: Sustainability
Organizational Resilience
DKS has established an appropriate corporate governance system for sustainable growth and improvement of corporate value over the medium to long term and strives to ensure thorough compliance and risk management. Even if the organization becomes exposed to various changes in the outside environment and risks, to achieve sustainable growth and social contributions DKS aims to be an organization that is conscious of resilience and flexibility in addition to sustainability and growth.
DKS’s Framework Supporting Sustainable Growth
The corporate philosophy around which the Company forms the basis of its actions is indicated in our Company Credo, Company Mottoes, and Code of Corporate Ethics. These are also outlined in our Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees.
With the selection of five focus SDGs Sustainable Development Goals and the promotion of health-based company management covered in our new medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, on October 1, 2020 we revised our Code of Corporate Ethics and Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees and made these known both internally and externally.
       Strategies and Initiatives
Digital Society Initiatives
 Preventative maintenance leveraging DX
Our project for increasing contributions from older plants is one of the priority measures of medium-term management plan FELIZ 115. The depreciation period has ended for aging plants constructed in the Showa period (1926-1989). Therefore, if these plants stay in operation and produce products continuously, it could be said that these plants have earnings power that leads to profit just by selling products.
Consequently, it is important for us to find ways to keep these fully depreciated plants operating without interruption. At the same time, the machinery and equipment (pumps, tanks, etc.) of these plants have aged and bring the risk of declining performance and breakdowns.
One form of DX at production sites is preventative maintenance we perform that discovers early signs of machinery and equipment malfunction. Since this enables preemptive measures before an incident occurs—and thereby allows us to minimize production interruptions, we are strategically implementing repairs and maintenance in parallel with our stage-one “smart” Production Headquarters changes that include profit generation through production efficiency improvements. Specifically, this includes sensors that constantly monitor machinery and equipment for sounds and vibrations during operation and help us visualize minute fluctuations that are difficult for a human technician to detect.
Using a smartphone (existing infrastructure) to gather noise data on equipment being monitored by sensors
Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate Branding
In our medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, we have set a target of 10 billion yen in annual net sales in the life sciences business.
One of our strategies for reaching this target is to strengthen corporate branding, so we are aiming to further boost corporate value and presence of DKS.
In order to increase recognition of DKS among the general public, our specific initiatives have included posting information on social media sites and other activities, such as opening limited-time pop-up shops in JR Kyoto Isetan and similar department stores. Additionally, we are collaborating with prestigious companies in Kyoto to develop original products such as general foods, soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages using the DKS Group’s unique technologies and materials.

 Establishing a Compliance Structure
Since the Compliance Control Committee was established in 2004, the Company has been continuously engaged in the building and maintenance of our compliance system, as well as in activities to instill compliance practices in our employees. Recognizing that compliance activities are indispensable for continuing as a sound company, we will further strengthen our activities in the years to come.
   Corporate Philosophy
The corporate philosophy around which the Company forms the basis of its actions is indicated in our Company Credo, Company Mottoes, and Code of Corporate Ethics. These are also outlined in our Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees.
With the selection of five focus SDGs and the promotion of health and productivity management covered in our medium- term management plan FELIZ 115, we revised our Code of Corporate Ethics and Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees on October 1, 2020 and made these known both internally and externally.
Additionally, in order to instill our corporate philosophy among employees, we posted it in various places inside our offices and published a Compliance Manga Case Book detailing issues that tend to arise in everyday work situations. This book, which was distributed to all employees, uses an approachable (manga illustrated) format to convey its information. Furthermore, our e-learning program for all employees explains and tests participants on our corporate philosophy as part of efforts to deepen everyone’s
Compliance System
Compliance Control Committee
The Compliance Control Committee is charged with establishing and maintaining the Company’s compliance system. Since its establishment in 2004, the Compliance Control Committee has been continuously engaged in building the compliance system, implementing educational activities to entrench compliance practices in our employees and conducting surveys to ensure understanding of the compliance system.
Corporate Ethics Month
The Compliance Control Committee has designated October every year to be Corporate Ethics Month and conducts activities during the month, including educational activities and the dissemination of information, centered on a particular theme.
The theme for fiscal 2020 was the revised Code of Corporate Ethics and the confirmation and implementation of the Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees. In each department, we reiterated the basics of the Code
understanding of the philosophy and to offer a valuable reference for making judgments in day-to-day tasks.
 Code of Corporate Ethics
To establish corporate ethics that contribute to putting the Company policies into practice, we established a six-item set of principles as the Code of Corporate Ethics and adhere to the word and spirit of all laws and regulations, as well as international rules. We also respect the culture and customs of each country and region where we practice our business activities and declare that we will act with social common sense.
Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees
Regarding the six-item set of principles established as the Code of Corporate Ethics, we broke down the content as to what kind of behavior is actually required, clearly state the guidelines for the actions of officers and employees (including seconded and contract employees, as well as temporary employees) and declare that these guidelines will be implemented as a code of conduct.
      of Corporate Ethics, and department members deliberated on specific actions to take. Additionally, we gathered case studies from each department on compliance-related questions in everyday work tasks.
Compliance Manga Case Book
Whistleblower Hotlines
DKS has established whistleblower internal and external hotlines where employees can consult on and report possible violations to established laws and regulations. Instructions on using the hotlines are always available internally, such as on the Company intranet.
Compliance Awareness Survey
We conduct a Compliance Awareness Survey for all employees each December with the aim of accurately understanding the effects from activities aimed at further instilling compliance practices. Based on employee awareness of key issues, we use the results to determine initiatives for the following fiscal year.
The fiscal year ended March 2021 was the 16th consecutive year the Company has implemented the Compliance Awareness Survey.
The survey assessed respondents’ understanding of the revised Code of Corporate Ethics and Declaration of Action by Officers and Employees as well as each department’s achievement of these measures, and awareness of the whistleblower hotlines.
The survey posed questions about areas of policy that employees would like to see improved in the future and many requests were made reflecting current conditions regarding workplace environments and working from home.
Please see the data on p. 70 for survey results.

Strengthening Risk Management
Diverse and increasingly complex, the corporate risks surrounding the Company could result in adverse impacts on the Company itself, as well as on employees, shareholders, customers, and local communities. We position risk management as an important management issue and are taking steps to prevent potential risks and the spread of risks that have already manifested.
    Risk Management System
To address the Group risks and systematically promote activities, we have established a Risk Management Control Committee that meets on a regular basis and is composed of representatives of each department, with an operating executive officer serving as the chairperson.
The Risk Management Control Committee’s objective is to appropriately manage and set countermeasures for potential risks that may interfere with our achievement of business targets. The activities of the committee are carried out following the PDCA cycle, based on the basic process of risk assessment, risk response, monitoring, and review.
In Japan and overseas, the Company and its subsidiaries are working to maintain and strengthen crisis management systems so that we can communicate risk crisis information as soon as possible, ascertain the situation, and take appropriate measures. To deal with potential and/or evident risks, we have taken several steps, including establishing and maintaining Risk Management Procedures, Product Liability (PL) Prevention and Management Procedures, and
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
BCP is an abbreviation for Business Continuity Plan, which allows a company to maintain critical operations without suspending plans when it is affected by an unforeseen natural disaster such as an earthquake. Even if business activities are unavoidably interrupted, the BCP focuses on restarting important functions within the recovery time objective and minimizing the risks involved in interrupted operations.
We have created BCPs for a large-scale earthquake and the outbreak of a highly virulent H1N1-type influenza, and we are regularly reviewing and updating these plans.
Disaster Preparedness
There has been an increasing prevalence of natural disasters such as earthquakes and water damage from torrential rain, as
Initiatives to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19
The Risk Management Control Committee has been using our intranet and other means to inform all employees of the Company’s countermeasures to COVID-19, which spread worldwide in 2020. These countermeasures focus on the policies of the central government and local municipal governments, as well as work styles that take into account the level of infections. Primary measures being implemented* are: prohibiting (in principle) overseas business trips, establishing strategies to address domestic business trips, creating standard practices for responding when someone has a confirmed infection or close-contact exposure,
Information Security Rules.
In fiscal 2020, we reassessed our risk management criteria
and process for sharing information when an impactful event occurs, while we also extended and revised our BCP for handling earthquakes.
We utilized our e-learning platform to educate employees on the concept of business continuity management as an aspect of risk management for addressing business interruptions, which allowed us to emphasize the importance of this concept to employees.

well as extended heat waves and heavy snowfall accompanying abnormal weather patterns. We are proceeding to implement and strengthen appropriate measures for these types of risks to human life and business activities.

Overall Efficacy of the Board of Directors
Every year, all officers (directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) carry out self-evaluations based on a questionnaire prepared by the Office of the Board of Directors (Secretary Department). The Office of the Board of Directors tallies these questionnaire results, which are analyzed and evaluated by outside officers and full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Last fiscal year, outside officers and full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members made a general determination that the operation of the Board of Directors is appropriate and effective, and the evaluators provided opinions that will facilitate further elevation of this effectiveness. The Board is striving to make on-going improvements that take these opinions into account.

  Appointment and Dismissal of the CEO and the CEO Succession Plan
Regarding the appointment of the CEO, the outgoing CEO proposes a candidate for successor who shall be resolved after thorough deliberation by the Board of Directors, which includes three independent outside directors. If the CEO is not sufficiently fulfilling his role, or if there is a reason to dismiss the CEO, the Board of Directors will deliberate and resolve the dismissal.
In addition, succession planning for the CEO is the most important matter for the survival of the Company, thus it is critical to identify actual and potential capabilities of management. The succession plan is the exclusive property of the CEO, who is familiar with all aspects of the Company. DKS believes it is desirable to hear the opinions of outside officers regarding the qualities and aptitude of successors, thus our successor training committee and our Advisory Board, which include outside officers as members, provide opportunities to appropriately incorporate the advice and participation of outside directors.
Establishment of an Advisory Board
The Company voluntarily established an Advisory Board as a supplementary body with the goal of improving the fairness, objectivity, and transparency of the decision-making process of the Board of Directors.
Reasons for Selection of Outside Directors
Establishing the Advisory Board ensures appropriate opportunities for outside officers to participate in and provide advice on CEO successor selection, officer remuneration, and the like.
The Advisory Board is comprised of the Chairman CEO, six outside officers, a majority of whom are independent, and one outside expert. The Board is chaired by an independent outside director.
Role of the Advisory Board
The Board reviews, deliberates, and advises the Board of Directors on the following:
(1) Matters related to overall management
(2) Matters related to selecting director candidates, including
representative directors
(3) Matters related to plans for training Company director

DKS REPORT 2021
Calculation method
Monthly remuneration is set based on the size of the role tasked to each director and their position.
Targets for indicators related to performance-linked remuneration in the fiscal year under review were to exceed consolidated net sales of ¥59.5 billion, consolidated ordinary income of ¥4.1 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow above ¥3.2 billion in fiscal 2018. In the previous fiscal year,
which the performance-linked remuneration for the current fiscal year is subject to, consolidated sales increased to ¥61.4 billion and consolidated ordinary income decreased to ¥3.5 billion. In addition, consolidated operating cash flow increased by ¥3.7 billion.
1) Fixed remuneration
Company performance in the previous fiscal year is evaluated once each year, with the departments each director is in charge of evaluated twice each year; then, the amount of remuneration is calculated and increased or decreased within a certain range.
DKS introduced a transfer-restricted stock remuneration system, with decisions as to the specific allocation of monetary remuneration to be paid for the granting of transfer-restricted shares based on the size of the role tasked to each director and their position.
At the 153th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2017, a resolution determined the amount of stock remuneration be set at ¥100 million per annum (¥6 million or less per annum for outside directors; this does not include the salary of employees who concurrently serve as directors), with 100,000 shares as the maximum number of common shares to be issued or disposed of per annum. All of the above are drawn up by the CEO and remitted and paid upon resolution by the Board of Directors.
     At the 154th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 26, 2018, a resolution determined that monthly remuneration for directors be set at ¥30 million (¥360 million per annum, with outside director remuneration set at ¥3 million per month). This does not include the salary of employees who concurrently serve as directors.
 Audit & Supervisory Board Member Remuneration
Audit & Supervisory Board Member remuneration is composed of 1) fixed remuneration and 2) stock remuneration based on the appropriateness of audits conducted and the role played in promoting shareholder interests.
Regarding stock remuneration, DKS introduced a transfer-restricted stock remuneration system, and determines the amount of monetary remuneration to be paid for granting transfer-restricted shares suitable for the role of an Audit & Supervisory Board Member entrusted by shareholders.
At the 153th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2017, a resolution set maximum stock compensation at ¥20 million per annum, with 20,000 shares as the total number of common shares of the Company to be issued or disposed of per annum. All the above are determined and remitted after consultation with Audit & Supervisory Board Members.

Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
Disclosing the necessary corporate information in a timely and appropriate manner, the Company attaches importance to occasions for communicating with the wide range of people concerned. While actively conducting dialogues with its many investors, the Company has been able to seize opportunities for dialogue involving stories about its creation of value. The Company arranges regular large and small meetings with investors so that the CEO can communicate with investors in his own words. In addition, with regard to explaining financial performance and business scope, the personnel in charge of IR meet directly with investors. With this integrated report serving as a tool for constructive dialogue, we are working to improve corporate value, including mutual understanding.
 Frequent questions from stakeholders
Q Could you give us an overview of the medium- term management plan and your progress on it?
A In April 2020, we launched our five-year management plan, FELIZ 115. Focused on the social environment of 2030, it is a framework for transforming into a company that will persist for the next 100 years. Our Company Credo, “Contributing to the nation and society through industry” is everlasting. The medium-term management plan is positioned in order to chart a course to raising corporate value and reaching consolidated net sales of ¥100 billion. Our general review of the first year of the plan is as follows:
(1) We carried out a portfolio review, including improving
profitability and withdrawing from certain projects, and we
reorganized our business structure.
(2) We brought on line Plant #4 in the Yokkaichi Branch Kasumi
Plant, enabling greater production capacity to handle demand.
(3) We established the Life Sciences Business Headquarters (under
direct supervision of the president ), aiming for life sciences business on the scale of ¥10 billion in 2025.
(4) In order to start and build out new businesses, we revamped our R&D organization to place priority on profitability.
(5) We proactively hired non-Japanese employees and strove to promote diversity.
Please see the “Investor Relations” tab on our website for details on our medium-term management plan (in Japanese only).

Dialogue with Institutional Investors and Analysts
Every year, we hold briefing sessions and small-group meetings with institutional investors covering the full-year and first-half periods, in June and December respectively. In fiscal 2020, we made maximum effort to address COVID-19 and therefore reduced the size of these gatherings, which were held in a hall adjoining Tokyo Station. With the impact of the state of emergency declaration and priority measures to prevent spread of the
infection, attendees were
more inclined to follow
stay-at-home
recommendations and
there were only 58
participants (which was
fewer than last year).
Dialogue with Individual Shareholders and Investors
We held our 157th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders and management briefing at the RIHGA Royal Hotel Kyoto on Friday, June 25, 2021. Subsequently, on Friday, July 2, we held another management briefing in Tokyo. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, there were more attendees than the previous year and participants provided us with candid input.
Q What products are your growth drivers?
A Currently, special nonionic surfactants, rock hardening agents, radiation-curable resin materials, flame retardants, and electronic device materials are our growth drivers. Rock hardening agents are used to prevent tunnel collapse during tunnel digging, while flame retardants are used to make plastic materials and home insulation materials less flammable. Due to the increased time people are spending at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand has grown for antistatic agents used for liquid crystal film in TVs, personal computers, and similar devices.
Q What is your philosophy on shareholder returns?
A While keeping our dividend consistent with internal reserves necessary for future business development, our policy is to maintain a stable long-term dividend for shareholders. Additionally, we adopted a shareholder benefit program in fiscal 2019. In proportion to the number of shares held, this fiscal year’s benefit program provided shareholders with I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus and Sudachin manufactured by the DKS Group.
Please see the “Investor Relations” tab on our website for details on the (consolidated) dividend payout ratio (in Japanese only).

Shareholder Survey Results
This section presents some of the results of shareholders’ responses to our survey. On survey questions related to IR activities, interest was higher than last year with regard to “Website improvements” and “Briefing sessions for retail investors,” due to there being an increase in the number of individual shareholders. There was also an approximate 20% increase year-on-year in the number of survey cards completed. We thank everyone for their valuable and extensive feedback.
Going forward, we will devise approaches to conveying DKS’s management policies and business direction in the clearest manner possible.

Fundamental Knowledge of Surfactants
Generally, an “interface” refers to the border area between two materials of different states of solid, liquid or gas. A surface active agent, or surfactant, is a term for a chemical that exhibits functions and improves the performance of these interfaces.
  Basic Structure of Surfactants
Surfactants have a unique chemical structure that has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Using this structure, surfactants can achieve a variety of effects such as emulsification, dispersion, foaming, and adsorption by weakening surface tension or forming molecular aggregates or micelles (spheres). When surfactants are dissolved in water and the result is a low-concentration solution, their molecules can easily gather and assemble on the interface (surface) of
the solution through a phenomenon called “adsorption.” If the surfactant concentration is increased, the surfactants form molecular aggregates or micelles (spheres) when they reach what is called “critical micelle concentration” (see illustrations “c” and “d” below). Once micelles have formed, if you add non-water-soluble oil to the solution, the oil can be encircled (solubilized) by the micelles so that from the outside, it looks like the oil has dissolved in the water.

  Surfactant Types
Surfactants have four main structural types based on the functions they are designed to achieve. Of these four types, three are ionic surfactants that transform into electrolytic dissociation ions (atoms or groups of atoms bearing an electrical charge) when dissolved in water, and the remaining type is nonionic surfactants, which do not form ions. The
three ionic surfactants are further subdivided based on the type of ion they form in water: anionic (or negative ion) surfactants, cationic (or positive ion) surfactants, and amphoteric (containing both positive and negative ions) surfactants.
Main applications

  Main Actions and Applications
Mixes water and oil and makes an emulsion. Makes a uniform dispersion with fine particles floating on the water surface.
Spreads agrochemicals thin and uniform on the leaf surfaces.
Evenly disperses dyestuff and finishing agents on textiles and leathers.
Takes in air bubbles in water and stabilizes. Prevents foaming.
Moistens the surface between the fabric and the dirt, then penetrates this interface and strips away the dirt. It also emulsifies and disperses the dirt in order to remove it.
Creates soft fabric with gentle feel on the skin. Improves the smoothness of yarns in the spinning and/or knitting process.
Prevents static electricity generation by making the surfaces smooth. Makes static electricity easier to escape by forming a water-absorptive coating on the surface.
Adheres to the metal surface and forms a coat to prevent oxygen (air) and water from contacting the metal and causing rust.
Makes the dyestuff gradually be absorbed by the textiles and brings about uniform dyeing.
A positively charged surfactant is absorbed to negatively charged bacteria, destroys the cells and sterilizes.

  Applications
                               Environmental Impact of Surfactants
Most domestic wastewater that contains surfactants is collected and treated at public sewage treatment plants and released to the environment, although some may be released directly to rivers, oceans, or land.
Because surfactants are biodegradable, even if released into the environment they eventually degrade to carbon
dioxide and water by bacteria. To preserve the natural environment, products with high biodegradability are being developed and proactively used in Japan.

On Publishing the DKS Report 2021
This issue marks the sixth time that the DKS Group has published its integrated annual report since the initial report in fiscal year 2016. This is an important report that explains the value creation of DKS to all of our stakeholders, and its objective is to take a medium- to long-term perspective while providing accessible explanations of our current condition and growth strategies for the future.
As the first year of our medium-term management plan FELIZ 115, 2020 was a year for us to verify the suitability of our initiatives. We solidified our footing to face down the economic shock of COVID-19. We also reshuffled personnel to match our new R&D structure. “Feliz” means “happy” in Spanish. FELIZ 115 expresses our wish to support human happiness through chemistry. We discovered Naturido, a new, useful component that demonstrates possibilities for improving brain function from medical fungus (Isaria Japonica). A paper related to this research was published in a U.S. interdisciplinary journal on January 27, 2021. As we establish the life sciences business, we will focus on brand strategies deserving of the Company name.
Editor’s Note
The notion of value covered in this integrated report refers to something created in relationship with stakeholders. We have charted a path as value creators leveraging a strategic perspective focused on the future. As the CEO, I would like to put my name behind the veracity and appropriateness of the content of this report. Going forward, we will strive to further improve our Company’s disclosure and transparency. I would be grateful to hear your frank and constructive feedback.
September 2021 Chairman CEO
SAKAMOTO Takashi
     The Company’s integrated annual report is now in its sixth issue and this year marks the second year of our medium-term management plan FELIZ 115.
Amid the increasing severity of spreading COVID-19 infections, we have tried in various ways to explain to stakeholders the DKS value creation story based on our Uni-Top strategy, which strives for unique products that do not pursue scale. With the prolonged duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also rethought the identification of important risks, opportunities, and materiality in order to ensure value creation. For the first time, we have included a close-up
 look at R&D, which is positioned as a critical priority for DKS. Through an interview with the CTO, we strove to elucidate the Company’s technological capabilities and strategies.
We also sought to cooperate with the production company to improve the report’s
appearance and structure, showcasing the content in a more enhanced way. It is our hope that this integrated report will serve to deepen dialogue with our stakeholders.
We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all parties concerned for their cooperation in the editing of this report. We also welcome frank opinions from readers as we prepare for the next fiscal year’s publication.

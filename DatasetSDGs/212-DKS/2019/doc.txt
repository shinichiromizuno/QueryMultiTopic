   About the DKS Group
The History of Chemistry Provides Industry Events
  S 1900
With the advent of World War I, the spinning industry undergoes dramatic growth. Textile goods exceed 50% of Japanese exports.
Founding to Establishment of Business Base
1909 SILKREELER cocoon unwinding agent (chemical agents for spinning)
1915 Gembu Marseille Soap (industrial soap for textile)
Cocoon unwinding agents were developed at the start of the 1900s to address the need for a method to spin waste cocoons while leaving as much of the sericin in place as possible, which had been a challenge for the spinning industry.
Following the start of World War I, the Company introduced Gembu Marseille Soap, the first industrial soap for textiles made in Japan, and supported the development of the textile industry.

Following World War I, the industry undergoes a period of modernization, during which time the textile industry sees an accelerating shift from natural fibers to synthetic alternatives.
Expands Business Scope and Modernizes Operations
1934 MONOGEN higher alcohol-based detergent 1950 CELLOGEN synthetic thickener
Along with the development of the textile industry, the Company developed many types of soaps and textile oil agents, thereby establishing its position as a textile oil agent manufacturer.
Upon entering Japan’s period of rapid economic growth, the petrochemical industry begins to transition to domestic production and stronger international competitiveness.
Strengthening and Renaissance
1969 PYROGUARD flame retardant for plastics
1970 DK ESTER food emulsifier
Against the backdrop of intensifying price competition in industrial fields, the Company expanded the scope of and diversified its industrial products. In anticipation of the future potential of the polyurethane market―positioned as a downstream sector within the petrochemical industry―the Company commenced its polyether business. Moreover, the Company launched one business after another that would serve as a foundation for the future, including flame retardants and sucrose fatty acid esters.

1978
Capital participation in Chin Yee Chemical Industries, Co., Ltd., in Taiwan accompanying the textile industry's shift to Southeast Asia
         During this period, the Company developed the nonionic surfactant NOIGEN, the cationic surfactant CATIOGEN and various progenitors for other surfactants, setting the stage for its rise to the top of the industry.

   Calls of“Yo-i Ya Sa-”
at Miyako Odori Festival
Spring comes to new Reiwa era, dawning of a period of harmony and governance
  Review of fiscal 2018, the final year of the Heisei era
Capital investment prioritized to increase capital productivity
The fiscal year ended March 2019 almost coincided with the end of the 30-year Heisei era, which the print media describes with expressions of upheaval and turbulence. I would like to mention three memorable events: the bursting of the bubble economy as described in Japan as Number One, the end of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of China, and economic transformation due to advances in electronic equipment capacity and processing speed. Most economic changes are attributable to the speed at which they occur.
I would like to chart the course of what was then Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd.̶we have been known as DKS only since 2013̶through the 30 years of the Heisei era. As a result of management and operational failures that arose at the time the economic bubble burst, a period of sluggish performance continued for more than a quarter of a century. We used the Lehman Brothers crisis of September 2008 as an opportunity to rid ourselves of a negative legacy. In April 2009, the 100th anniversary of our founding, we launched the future-oriented“CHANGE100 Plan.”We systematically executed measures to change our profit structure. Yokkaichi Chemical Co., Ltd., became a wholly owned subsidiary, and we established a future base by purchasing new land and building plants.
When the CHANGE100 Plan was completed, we labeled existing businesses as ACTUAL businesses, improvement businesses NEXT businesses and new businesses DREAM businesses. The current
management plan, REACT1000, commenced with the introduction of NEXT peripheral businesses and the launch of completely new DREAM businesses. Our aim was to transform ourselves into a company that can withstand and survive any upheavals and turbulence.
Our focus areas are environment and energy, electronics and IT, as well as the life sciences. We are constructing new plants related to these focus areas in the Kasumi area of Yokkaichi City, Mie Prefecture, and undertaking manufacturing. The goal is a return on invested capital (ROIC) of more than two times the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Estimates for the fiscal year ended March 2019 exceeded the target value, and the collection period was shortened. From a protracted business downturn, DKS converted to a structure that enabled stable growth during the 30-year period of the Heisei era. The NEXT businesses are contributing significantly to profits.
As a new business, we had been seeking to enter the life sciences field related to human health. While endeavoring to gather information, I met a professor who had been pursuing ways to prevent the onset or improve the early diagnosis of dementia for nearly 30 years. His results were being commercialized as a university-initiated venture. The substances that had proven effective in mouse experiments were related to silkworms. Since Dai-ichi Kogyo Seiyaku (today’s DKS) was founded on a surfactant for unraveling silkworm cocoons, we came to a mutual understanding, including a regional economic revitalization plan. This venture happily decided to join our group.
Ikeda Yakusou Co., Ltd., was a manufacturer of functional foods that possessed the technology to extract this specific substance and had acquired GMP1 certification, which is essential for pharmaceuticals. After repeated negotiations, we decided to acquire all the shares of Ikeda Yakusou. Along with health

supplements, we considered the formulation business to be two halves driving a life sciences whole. Fields such as CMO2 and CDMO3 in the development and manufacturing contract business support drug discovery in the pharmaceutical industry. In the years to come, we will work to realize a DREAM business through collaborations with venture companies and M&A with a view to entering this business.

Progress and assessment of the REACT1000 Management Plan
Road to sustainable growth established in the turbulent Heisei era
Based on the results from the previous CHANGE100 Plan, under which we had promoted structural reform, we launched the current plan in April 2015. The sales target had to be revised at the midway point due to deterioration in the business environment of, for example, the solar panel sector, which had attracted high expectations. Amid the growing uncertainty of the economy due to the U.S.-China trade war, the fiscal year ended March 2019 was our second highest in terms of business performance with higher sales despite lower profits. We have left the operating income target for the final year of the plan as ¥6.0 billion, unchanged from the initial target. However, that target could be difficult to achieve due to high raw material costs, an increase in R&D costs and capital investment depreciation. The burden of R&D expenses and capital investment is not insignificant, however, that forms the basis for future growth and will proceed as planned.
The situation in the global economy is increasing in its severity, the main contributory factors being the U.S.-China trade war, uncertainty surrounding the European economy and geopolitical risks. We decided to focus on improving profits in unprofitable sectors while expanding our profitable NEXT businesses. In the fiscal year ending March 2020, we aim for operating income of ¥5.1 billion, which would exceed the record achieved in the fiscal year ended March 2018. Our plan calls for a total of ¥12.0 billion to be invested in electronic materials and life sciences over the next three years, including new investments in 5G fields for next-generation communications. Increasing total assets to ¥76.0 billion will provide the potential for sales growth.
Although the financial figures will not reach our targets, we have finished initial work on the non-financial issues set out under the five-year plan. Items for improving corporate value are listed in a matrix in relation to the four stakeholders surrounding the Company. These total 20 items, the five indicators derived from the acronym REACT times their relationships to the four stakeholders. For example, one of the relationships with shareholders is
“change from undervalued stock to growth stock.”The price-to-book ratio (PBR) has increased from 0.6x to 1x, and the price-earnings ratio (PER) has increased from 8x to 15x. What requires explanation is the international strategy. We selected EXPORT as the“E”in REACT and decided to improve the overseas sales ratio.
The securities report shows exports as a percentage of net sales classified by region. We had targeted an increase from 15% to 20% and achieved 17%. The thinking behind our international strategy is to make products that are valued globally before expanding overseas. In the era of the yen’s appreciation toward the ¥70/$1 range, we issued a statement to the municipalities declaring our intention to build a plant in Japan. That was the new plant in Mie Prefecture. As globalization advances, the exports of business partners using our products is increasing. The sales of our products overseas including those of partners has increased from 35% to 51% over the past four years.
Under our REACT1000 plan, we are engaging in management that is conscious of the need to build a foundation for sustainable and stable growth, which remains the mission of all companies. As we live in an era of upheaval and turbulence, a business model that can survive change is demanded. From the last century to the beginning of this century, the crux of DKS’s business operations had been high-quality manufacturing. I think that people will buy our products if they are good. We are living in a world in which the capacity and processing capability of electronic devices have advanced dramatically, and it is a world in which the planet’s space and time have been reduced and shortened.
We are strengthening relationships with leading companies that are at the forefront of the product markets. At the same time, we are seeking models to create products that can only be supplied to those business partners, for example, collaborations with inspiring/inspired partners who spark off each other. The starting point of this model is not products but rather a customer focus. On the new 100,000-m2 site at Kasumi, we started phasing in our fourth plant. The new plant’s four products are only being offered to inspiring/inspired partners. These accounted for more than 40% of our total operating income for the fiscal year ended March 2019.

    Reiwa, beautiful happiness created by harmony and governance
graceful. On the day the new era was announced,
I interpreted rei as governance and wa as harmony.
If pronounced as Spanish, rey va, the meaning of a king going comes to mind. I find it an appropriate name for an era in which Japan is embarking on a new voyage̶an era of growth and harmony through new collaborations and solid corporate governance.
The thing that came to mind when envisaging REACT1000 was that we had entered the dimension of consumer-to-business (C2B) flows. They are different from the 20th century B2B (business-to-business transactions) and B2C (business-to-consumer transactions) market flows. We, a chemical materials manufacturer, believe that our survival lies in developing products that address the new trend of needs, or rather, wants, of C = consumer.
We will achieve this by strengthening our collaborations with inspiring/inspired partners who are familiar with the market.
A good balance between the ACTUAL (our existing businesses), the NEXT (our peripheral businesses) and the DREAM (our new businesses). The four stakeholders such as employees, shareholders, business partners and society. Operating these beautiful harmonies with appropriate governance, we consider Reiwa as a symbol of stable growth. We started the NEXT investment of ¥4.8 billion for 5G communication circuit board materials in August. The Formulation Development Promotion Office launched in April and the Quality Assurance Office, which is under the direct control of the president, has commenced operations.
Our next future-oriented plan: FELIZ 115
Creating corporate value starts with sound dialogue
While looking back on the current management plan, I reviewed the policies of the U.S. President. I interpret the trade war using my own judgment and prejudices. The Chinese economy that overtook Japan, which was the second largest in the world in terms of gross domestic product, was judged to be expansive in scale based on the 20th century model. In other words, it takes time to become an advanced country. President Trump’s current tariff policy deals a significant blow to the traditional Chinese economy. Am I the only one who sees this feud as being of benefit to Japan? We view this as an opportunity for us as a chemical manufacturer in Japan.
I think we achieved structural changes during past four years under the REACT plan. There were four
Our Company and others: A business model that combines our
and their technologies
Spring in Kyoto starts with the Miyako Odori Festival. This year, it was the eight picturesque sights entitled Miyogawari (Imperial Succession) and Kabuki no Irodori (Celebration of Kabuki) that offered good wishes upon the arrival of a new era. As a result of the capital’s relocation to Tokyo at the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, a mood of stagnation existed in Kyoto. Two opportunities were created to dispel thoughts of that situation and raise a sense of excitement. The governor of newly formed Kyoto Prefecture proposed the first exhibition in Japan, in which the Miyako Odori show was held to attract visitors. The Inoue Ryu Kyoto dance form was introduced at the festival and is now directed by the fifth generation of its practitioners.
Also, a national education institution was formed called the Seimikyoku, in part a transliteration of the Dutch word chemie (chemistry). There having been no Japanese-language equivalent to the word when chemie was brought to Japan in the latter part of the Edo period (1603–1867), an academic specializing in the Netherlands named KAWAMOTO Komin devised the word kagaku (chemistry) from the two kanji characters meaning
“transformation”and“discipline.”Established in 1869, the Osaka Seimikyoku later became Kyoto University, and the Kyoto Seimikyoku, established in 1870, was the dawn of the Japanese chemical industry. The chemical industry began with the import trade of synthetic indigo, which was invented by the German company BASF.
A cornerstone of Japanese industry during the era when new industries were being encouraged was the export of silk goods. A venture company that started with the manufacture of an unwinding agent, called soap today, used to unravel and wash the silkworm cocoons, the raw material for silk yarn, was what is now known as DKS. The synthetic indigo imported into Japan in 1898 through Yamada Ichirobei Shoten (now Yamada Kasei Co., Ltd.) is mentioned in publications of BASF. Later, we obtained a recipe for surfactants, the origin of our technologies from this agency that has continued for more than 200 years. I consider Reiwa as the start of a new era that will compare favorably with the Meiji era (1868–1912).
Previously chosen from Chinese origins, on this occasion the era name is associated with Manyoshu, Japan’s oldest anthology of poems. Historically, the meaning implied by rei was auspicious and that of wa was

questions at last year’s general meeting of shareholders. The last question was“There is the word‘first,’but is Mr. Sakamoto’s‘first’the shareholders or the employees?”I answered without hesitation.“Employees come first.”The questioner nodded. At an opportunity to talk one-to-one with shareholders after the general meeting, one participant said that“a lot was affirmed in front of your shareholders. It gave me great pleasure.”I was glad to hear those words.
Abbreviated as SDGs, the Sustainable Development Goals are UN targets for 2030. The form that DKS will take in 2030 already has been determined. Five years prior to that, in 2025, we aim for net sales of ¥85.0 billion and operating income of ¥10.0 billion, as well as sales in the life sciences business of ¥10.0 billion. In 2030, with net sales of ¥135.0 billion and operating income of ¥18.0 billion, the ACTUAL, NEXT and DREAM businesses should each account for a third of total sales. The plan is to substantially expand the high-profitability NEXT businesses and utilize that cash to invest in DREAM businesses, thereby laying the foundation for the future.
In conjunction with our financial goals, we will work to improve corporate value with an emphasis on quality in the non-financial aspects of our operations. We call this approach FELIZ 115, feliz meaning happy in Spanish. As we will be marking our 115th anniversary in the fiscal year ending March 2025, we will practice happiness management. The letters of FELIZ stand for FUTURE, ENVIRONMENT, LIFE, INNOVATION and Z-FLAG. Signifying the determination to face challenges, at the beginning of a new era, the latter is the signal flag adopted by the Japanese that was hoisted prior to a naval battle that took place in the Sea of Japan during the Meiji era.
A good relationship with the four stakeholders surrounding the Company is a constant theme, but what are the five components of FELIZ for employees, shareholders, business partners and society? Our employees will voice and share their opinions in discussions about the next management plan to be formulated in the current fiscal year. The themes for shareholders already have been selected: future = growth stock; environment = ESG index; life = longevity stock; innovation = market capitalization of ¥50.0 billion and the challenge = posting record profits.
The 17 SDGs are incorporated into the DKS Credo, the DKS Mottoes and the company song. We have selected five SDGs that DKS will make a conscious effort to address: 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages; 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation; 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns; and 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. The production of I. Japonica- Bombyx Fungus (Cordyceps sinensis) supplied by sericulture farmers will form an initiative directly linked to regional revitalization.
 16 DKS REPORT 2019
Oiwaiyasu,“Full of happiness, Uni-Top” Increasing our earning power,
heading out into the world for a better future
On May 1, 2019, the day the new emperor acceded to the throne, we raised a celebratory glass as a toast with those who have a connection to Yamada Ichirobei Shoten. Oiwaiyasu is the Kyoto dialect equivalent of itadakimasu, the expression of gratitude uttered before a meal. If 1869, when the Seimikyoku was established in Japan, is taken as the first year of chemistry, this year marks the 150th anniversary. Back then, the Seimikyoku provided an opportunity to bring about the innovation called industrial revitalization through chemistry in Kyoto, which had been a city of a thousand years of history and tradition. The three-day Japan Industrial Safety and Health Association (JISHA) conference will be held for the 78th time, but for the first time in Kyoto, on October 23, in the first year of the new Reiwa era. This major event, held once a year by the JISHA, will be attended by more than 10,000 people from all over the country, and around 250 companies plan to make presentations at side meetings. As the head of a chemical manufacturer, I serve as the chairperson of the

  Kyoto Labor Standards Association, which is co-hosting the conference. As the representative of a company that has received the White 500 health management certification from the government for two successive years, it is my firm intention to attend. Junko Koshino, the leading Japanese fashion designer, will give a special speech entitled“Words I Got from Mom.”She is a diversity pioneer who wrote the“My Personal History”column in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun in August. We believe that work-style reform is synonymous with improving labor productivity and capital efficiency. It is also beauty created by harmony and governance.
On my desk I have a book entitled Wage Labor and Capital by Karl Marx. In my youth, while attending a Shorinji kempo martial art dojo, I studied economics. I always keep in mind three key concepts to be achieved in my own style: humanism, planned economy and peoples’right to self-determination (from Marx’s Das Kapital). My interpretation is that we equally have basic human rights, should utilize limited resources systematically and should value what we rely on. I view this as a starting point for the employee-first concept and the basis of earning power. Intellectual and human resources are among the elements related to productivity that enhance value.
Research-and-development (R&D) expenses are an indicator of intellectual resources, and labor’s share of income is used for human resources. We are aiming for an increase in our R&D expenses to sales ratio by 1.0 percentage point to more than 5% and for labor’s share of income to increase 3 percentage points to 70%. This affects research and manufacturing personnel and we intend to raise the happiness level of our employees. In the NEXT and DREAM businesses, a key human resource development tool is on-the-job training (OJT). From the next fiscal year, we will separate the management and
executive functions. The board of directors will consist of nine directors including two representative officers, directors in charge of production, sales, research and management and three outside directors, the goal being to make quick decisions. A Successor Training Committee made up of outside directors also will be established.
I think that“the power to earn = NEXT (intellectual + human resources) × Inspiring/Inspired Partners.”The NEXT and DREAM businesses cover our focus fields of the environment and energy, electronics and IT, as well as life sciences. We supply each product to inspiring/inspired partners that are leading international companies. The intellectual and human resources involved are working on developments that anticipate the future of our business partners. In the case of the circuit board materials for 5G communication, for example, we have decided that our next investment will be double the amount of the first investment four years after plant construction. Construction began in August 2019 and will be completed in June 2020. We will strive for stable and continuous operation at a high level of business.
The Company’s annual slogan for 2019 is“Full of Happiness, Uni-Top.”This reconfirms the image of the Company as top-rated in terms of its uniqueness and as aiming for happiness management. Our strength is the technology that we have cultivated in our 110-year history, starting with the surfactant used to unravel silkworm cocoons. I believe that it is our mission to make the most of this strength and continue to develop, from Kyoto to the world and into the future. As a Uni-Top company, we are continuing along the path of creating a company that is widely known in the international community. We are grateful for the ongoing understanding of our shareholders, business partners and social stakeholders.
    Entering the manufacturing smartification era
 Who are our Inspiring/Inspired Partners?
Having purchased 100,000 m2 of industrial land in the third industrial complex in Kasumi in the city of Yokkaichi and positioned the plant as a mother plant (a complex base that provides new product prototyping and fulfills R&D functions), we commenced operations in 2015. Based on the trust of the senior management of“business partners who provide a mutual spark,”whom we call inspiring/inspired partners, we manufacture exclusive products using technologies that have been honed between the R&D and sales departments of both companies. These Uni-Top (small but unique) products account for most of the Kasumi Plant’s output.
Kasumi Plant, Yokkaichi Branch
Plant No. 1’s operations cover electronic materials as well as civil engineering and construction materials, No. 2 produces special nonionic surfactants, No. 3 manufactures functional polyurethane products and No. 4, which is currently under construction, will produce materials for electronics. Based on the ACTUAL businesses (existing products), the NEXT businesses (application of existing products and peripheral products) at the Kasumi Plant have grown to account for 40–50% of operating income.
We aim to achieve further growth toward 2030 by launching a new NEXT business in line with the C2B era to create products that are required by the final customer market.

In the final year of the plan (FY2009), business conditions became severe, characterized mainly by declining demand and falling sales prices amid surging raw material naphtha prices caused by high crude oil prices and the subsequent global recession triggered by the financial crisis in the United States. Against this backdrop, DKS undertook such initiatives as boosting sales of core products, developing new markets in growing fields that include IT and the environment, focusing on developing new materials, continually revising prices, and cutting operating expenses and other costs. Despite these efforts, the Company’s earnings fell below the plan’s targets.

 Plan Outline
 The initial year saw the impact of the financial crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. With revenues growing over the next two years, however, DKS successfully achieved a target of the plan by recording final fiscal year (fiscal year ended March 2012) consolidated net sales of ¥56.2 billion. In contrast, the Company was unable to reach the plan’s operating income target due to operating income decreasing in the final fiscal year amid sharp demand drops and ongoing high raw resources prices.

  Although DKS aimed to increase net sales from ¥56.2 billion the previous fiscal year to ¥60 billion, the fiscal year ended March 2015, the final year of the plan, ended with consolidated net sales at ¥55.5 billion, below the target because of delays in investment to raise production in core businesses and stagnation in the solar cell field. On the other hand, DKS achieved its operating margin target given record-high operating income, ordinary income and net income. While missing its quantitative targets, DKS saw success in qualitative terms.

Risks and Opportunities
Identifying Significant Risks at DKS
 In terms of risk management, the Company established a Risk Management Control Committee as a systematic response and formulates activity plans, reviews activities, identifies risks and examines countermeasures. (Please refer to page 47.)
Based on the results of such activities, in producing the DKS Report 2019 we identified risks from the viewpoint of information that is of great importance to the Company’s stakeholders, namely in terms of materiality (significance). The procedure for extracting that information is set out below.

     Risks That Lead to Opportunities
 An event that can damage the broad value of a company, risk can also lead to opportunities. DKS considers risks in a segregated manner: the avoidance of risk and the formulation of strategies in
cases where corporate value can be increased by responding well to risk. The Company would like to practice management that can respond appropriately to risks in order to achieve sustainable growth.
■ Example of Potential Risk: Naphtha Price Hikes
The domestic price of naphtha, the main raw material for our products, rose to more than ¥70,000 per kiloliter in the fourth quarter of 2014. It then fell to around ¥31,000 in mid-2016 and stands at a level just above ¥40,000 in 2019. Measures against naphtha price fluctuations might include risk hedging using derivatives, including futures and foreign exchange rates, but they are only partially effective.
Increases in costs due to such raw material fluctuations could lead to pressure on profits, the burden of
Overview of Significant Risks
price hike negotiations and even the loss of customers. On the other hand, the contact points with customers during price hike negotiations, and the gathering of detailed information, give rise to opportunities to acquire new orders by replacement with new materials. If we can present more advantageous transaction conditions for customers compared to other companies in the same industry, it could lead to an increase in market share. This is one example of how we can seize risk-associated opportunities.
 The table on the opposite page summarizes the significant risks (11 items) to which DKS is exposed and outlines the impact of and responses to those risks as well as the accompanying opportunities created by them.

Impacts from Risks
Profits come under pressure from cost price increases
Time taken for price hike activities to maintain profit margin
Decline in market share, lost ground due to price hikes (transfer to another company in the same industry)
Inability to control prices
Business continuity plan (BCP) measures become necessary Time taken, costs incurred in customer follow-up
Cost of small-lot product processing becomes expensive, cost competitiveness declines
Time taken in research, sales and rectifying problems due to a variety of products
Profitability declines in single-material sales for surfactants due to inferiority in terms of cost relative to overseas competitors and major manufacturers who specialize in bulk manufacturing
Decrease in profit margin due to the sales composition ratio being weighted toward inexpensive products
Concerns about losing competitiveness in domestic and overseas markets
Concerns about patent infringements overseas
Necessity to maintain regulatory conformance should there be legal revisions to, for example, the Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc.
Associated sequence of work takes time starting with contacting customers supplied, proposals of alternative products, performance evaluations, 4M (man, machine, material and manufacturing method) changes, revision of standards, etc.
Cost, time and labor involved in replacement work due to a large number of varieties
In the fine chemical fields, such as energy-related, pharmaceuticals and foods, a higher level of quality control is required than with industrial chemicals, and know-how is necessary for that.
Due to our long company history, some facilities are becoming obsolete.
As they would not bring about enough profit to meet new capital investment, products for which the Company is uncertain as to their business continuity would be manufactured at those aging (and less efficient) facilities.
The scale of facilities is not matching the production volume due to decline in sales. Decreased efficiency and concern for quality problems due to small-lot production.
Rise of product unit cost due to production cost leads to lowering of price competitiveness.
Leak of confidential information due to virus or internal management error
Responses to Risks and Opportunities
Increased contacts with customers through price hike activities will increase opportunities for replacement with new materials and proposals for new themes.
If more price competitive than other companies in the same industry in a similar environment, market share could increase.
There is no need for fixed costs, giving rise to predominance at times of economic downturns.
Costs can be reduced by searching for inexpensive raw materials.
Information on each industry is easily obtainable due to having customers in every field.
Possessing a lineup of products that can be used in each field enables a variety of formulation proposals by combining them
Improve competitiveness by promoting the Uni-Top strategy, which does not pursue volume.
Promotion of a differentiation strategy through cost reductions, formulation sales proposals, Japanese quality, customizing
Cooperation and alliances with overseas companies Enhancement of a patent strategy
Should the same thing happen with another company’s product, it can be regarded as an opportunity to replace it with a DKS product.
Utilization of GMP-certified Ikeda Yakusou in the life sciences field
Utilization of the Kibi Plant as a fine chemical facility specializing in the life sciences and energy-related fields

Future Financial Strategies/Shareholder Returns
 Under REACT1000, our current five-year management plan, we have set“maintaining and enhancing an appropriate ROE level”as a management policy. In addition, as an action point we are promising all our shareholders a change from comparative value stock to growth stock. For our financial strategy going forward, while supporting medium- to long-term growth, we would like to implement measures to optimize the cost of equity.
Because we are a chemical manufacturer, continuous investments in plant and equipment, as well as R&D expenditures, are indispensable for achieving medium- to long-term growth. While maintaining continuing financial discipline, we are therefore investing for growth, and the main source of that investment will be internal reserves and interest-bearing debt. In addition, we believe an important option will be to conduct policy flexibly, such as
making capital increases for growth or financially strategic acquisitions of treasury stock, based on our financial situation and stock market trends.
Specifically, we will 1) steadily raise PBR to 1 or above by improving and maintaining ROE to a level above the cost of equity, 2) maintain financial discipline and bring about a reduction in the cost of capital to an appropriate level by using moderate leverage, and 3) aim for sustainable dividend growth and optimize the cost of capital through flexible shareholder return measures in conjunction with share buybacks.
Moreover, in terms of M&A as part of growth investment, we will select investment projects for which ROIC exceeds the capital cost and aim for PMI (post-merger integration) that contributes to greater corporate value over the medium to long term.

Since the Company’s founding in 1909, the surfactants segment has provided core technologies that have supported DKS for more than 100 years. DKS surfactants provide high added value in a wide variety fields and applications including soap and detergent, IT, electronics, rubber and plastics, paints and color materials, and energy through their emulsifying, dispersing, solubilizing, penetrating, wetting, foaming and defoaming, and surface modifying functions. We currently develop and manufacture these products with petrochemicals and oils/fats as key raw materials primarily at the Yokkaichi Branch, the Shiga Branch and Yokkaichi Chemical Company Limited.
A review of the fiscal year ended March 2019 and our outlook for the future
During the fiscal year ended March 2019, this segment saw strong net sales overall.
In Japan, sales fell significantly for soap and detergent applications, were low for toiletry applications and slightly weak for machinery and metal applications. Sales were solid for rubber and plastic applications and strong for IT and electronics applications. Overseas, sales were slightly weak for textile applications but grew for paints and color material applications.
Looking ahead, we will focus on providing products customized to meet customer needs in accordance with the Uni-Top strategy.
3/2015 3/2016 3/2017 3/2018 3/2019 The strengths of DKS and the main functions of
the business
The typical function of surfactants is to clean (i.e., dirt
removal), which is represented in the well-known item “soap.”Surfactants act on the surface of substances
that do not mix such as oil and water and display emulsification and dispersion actions to remove dirt.
Recently, however, the functions that the Company’s customers require for surfactants have evolved beyond simply cleaning to more sophisticated and unique applications that reflect the advancement of the industry.
The surfactant synthesis, analysis and evaluation technology developed over its more than 110-year history has enabled the Company to provide performance and functions tailored to customer needs through its numerous product lines and combinations.
Relationship between the segment and society
This segment leverages our many years of experience and accumulated technologies. Our abundant lineup of products has enabled us to introduce optimal products that meet customer needs, while we are able to conceive high-value-added products through our unique development approach. Going beyond simply providing materials, we work closely with customers to find solutions to their problems.
Amid the global rise in environmentalism, we have been pursuing in recent years research and development on highly biodegradable, eco-friendly products that do not cause water pollution.

The strengths of DKS and the main functions of the business
With more than 65 years of experience in cellulose polymers using pulp and more than 50 years of experience in sucrose fatty acid esters using sugar, the Company has a long history in product development and is developing markets based on the basic and application technologies accumulated to date. Among these, sucrose fatty acid esters are highly characteristic as an edible surfactant and DKS is one of only a handful of companies worldwide producing them. Sucrose fatty acid esters are used as an emulsifier for oil/fat and cream as well as an agent to improve food texture, such as giving cookies their crispy texture. Recently, we have established technologies to produce cellulose nanofibers (CNF), using nanotechnology to make very fine natural cellulose fibers, a new material that is attracting attention mainly for its use in personal care and general industrial applications. This is accomplished by leveraging CNF’s characteristic viscosity and emulsifying, dispersing and stabilizing properties.
Relationship between the segment and society
This segment targets industrial fields that place an emphasis on safety such as food, personal care products and pharmaceuticals as end products that are placed in the mouth, come into contact with skin and stimulate the five senses. With demographic trends indicating that major Japanese market growth looks unlikely, the Company will focus on overseas expansion while maintaining its current customer base.
DKS recently has gotten involved with I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, a health food product that could help address the rise in dementia patients, a social issue taking hold in Japan. Currently, clinical trials are under way aimed at receiving permission to label this product as a food with functional claims. We will pursue research and development to extend people’s healthy lives that reflects the spirit of the DKS Credo:
The Amenity Materials segment provides materials and peripheral application technologies necessary for a comfortable living environment. The Company provides materials suitable to the products of customers in a wide range of industries including foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, toiletries, fisheries/livestock, textiles, pulp/paper, civil engineering, agrochemicals and agro-materials. As part of our entry into the new life sciences business, in July 2018 we acquired Biococoon Laboratories, Inc., and Ikeda Yakusou Co., Ltd., to produce I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus and Sudachin (sudachi peel extract), respectively.
In addition to core-technology surfactants, DKS manufactures products made from natural raw materials, including sugar and pulp, at the Shiga and Ohgata branches in line with the Company’s commitment to preserving the environment. The Company also produces health food products at the Biococoon Laboratories’Tanagura Plant and the Ikeda Yakusou facility in Tokushima Prefecture.
A review of the fiscal year ended March 2019
and our outlook for the future
During the fiscal year ended March 2019, this segment saw overall growth in net sales.
Although sales in Japan for cellulose polymer for feed applications were somewhat sluggish, sales were solid for pharmaceutical applications and grew for energy and environmental applications. Sales for sucrose fatty acid esters for food applications remained solid.
Overseas, sales were weak for cellulose polymers for food applications but were strong for sucrose fatty acid esters for personal care applications, while food application-related sales rose.
In the life sciences business, a new plant located in Tanagura,
Fukushima Prefecture, will be completed in the autumn of 2019 and
will manufacture I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, which is made with
only pure domestic ingredients. We have obtained HACCP*
certification and enhanced our quality control systems to provide
consumers with safe and reliable health food products.
*HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point): A food sanitation management method that was developed to ensure the safety of food used in the U.S. space program in the 1960s.

applications mainly for transportation equipment, civil engineering projects and electronic materials. With the recent diversification of electric appliances and the incorporation of IT in automobiles, electronic components are being used under increasingly severe conditions. Meanwhile, the need for lightweight, compact and integrated electronic components has increased, while components now need to be protected from physical and chemical effects to maintain strength and ensure durability. Lightweight, strong urethane resin plays a key role in this area. The Company’s electric insulation materials̶which feature a superior balance of insulation, heat-resistant and flame-retardant properties̶have a wide range of uses, from home appliance to transportation equipment components, to meet the exacting needs of customers.
In addition, our rock hardening agents for tunnel construction have a broad array of uses that include public roads and railways while boasting a high market share based on their safety and performance.
We will conduct employee training at the safety training center located at the Kasumi Plant, where these products are manufactured, with the aim of generating Group-wide synergies.
Relationship between the segment and society
The Kasumi Plant located in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, began operations in December 2015 after construction went as planned and serves as a mother plant that accounts for one-third of the 100,000-m2 site area. Rock hardening agents manufactured at the plant #1 are indispensable materials for tunnel construction, including roads and railways. These products are contributing to infrastructure projects that make people’s lives more convenient. In June 2019, the plant #3 was completed and manufactures functional polyurethane resin. Against this backdrop, we will redouble our initiatives with inspiring/inspired partners.
Based on our Uni-Top strategy, we will pursue the development of materials by combining cutting-edge facilities and application technologies that meet customer needs and are in tune with the times.
The segment provides polyurethane materials and industrial materials, including paints, adhesives, civil engineering and construction materials, and electric insulation materials. The Company possesses technologies used to manufacture high-elasticity urethane rubber and urethane elastomers as well as soft/rigid urethane foams. The Company leverages these properties to provide a variety of high-performance urethane products for a wide array of industries and applications that include cushioning, thermal insulation, molding and painting materials.
Rock hardening agents used for mountain tunnel projects such as roads and railways are an essential product for infrastructure upgrading. The Company’s products play a role in maintaining safety in environments where one misstep can put people’s lives in jeopardy.
With petrochemicals as the mainstay raw materials in the segment, the products are mainly manufactured at the Yokkaichi Branch.
A review of the fiscal year ended March 2019 and our outlook for the future
During the fiscal year ended March 2019, net sales for this segment were slightly weak overall.
Sales remained strong for functional urethane with IT and electronics applications and solid for synthetic lubricants that are eco-friendly and in line with HFC regulations but fell sharply for civil engineering chemicals.
Rock hardening agent sales are expected to grow as construction for the Linear Chuo Shinkansen project proceeds.
The strengths of DKS and the main functions of the business
The Company’s urethane materials are used mainly in civil engineering and construction, painting materials, adhesives and electric insulation materials, with the overriding priority of ensuring people’s safety through

The Functional Materials segment provides technologies and materials contributing to advanced performance, including resins used in daily necessities, as well as IT and electronic materials often used in personal computers, smartphones and home electronics. Some of the segment’s products include plastic flame retardants, antistatic agents, lubricants, anticlouding agents to reduce film and resin clouding, antioxidants suppressing oxidation degradation in a variety of materials, and radiation-curable monomers and oligomers using radcure (UV or EB curing) technology. The waterborne polyurethanes being developed since 1973 are used in wood and plastic paints, metal and paper coating agents, film and wood adhesives, and paper/fiber binding.
These products are manufactured at the Ohgata and Yokkaichi branches (Chitose and Kasumi Plant).
A review of the fiscal year ended March 2019 and our outlook for the future
During the fiscal year ended March 2019, the segment saw a substantial expansion in sales. In Japan and overseas, there was notable growth in radiation-curable monomers and oligomers for IT and electronics applications, as well as strong growth in flame retardants used in rubber and plastics applications. For flame retardants, it is important to note that pricing is set in line with bromine market conditions. On the other hand, the expansion in radiation-curable monomers and oligomers represents a success story in our cooperation with our inspiring/inspired partners.
The strengths of DKS and the main functions of the business
The technology used in radiation-curable monomers and oligomers is called radcure technology, in which a resin composition such as paint is instantaneously dried and cured by irradiating it with ultraviolet light (UV) or an electron beam (EB). Radcure technology is widely used in several applications across a
673

variety of fields to conserve resources and energy and to reduce environmental impact. Applications include the clear paint used in building materials and furniture; anticorrosive paint for metals; resist materials for semiconductors, dry films and LCDs; and coating agents for mobile phones, optical fibers, plastics and paper. DKS monomers are highly functional alcohol-based products using ethylene oxide (EO) addition technology, which results in low curl, low viscosity and enhanced hardness. Our B2B2C business model focuses on a cooperative relationship with our inspiring/inspired partners to develop innovative one-of-a-kind products. The DKS brominated flame retardant’s raw material is sourced from a global bromine production site, and because the raw material price can fluctuate based on bromine market conditions, it is important for DKS to maintain proper controls on product prices. Brominated flame retardants exhibit greater stability and stronger flame retardancy for rubber and plastic materials than do phosphorus and inorganic flame retardants.
Relationship between the segment and society
While many urethane resins are based on organic solvents, DKS also is researching and developing waterborne polyurethanes in which the polyurethanes are dispersed in water, largely in reaction to rapidly growing demand for safer water systems as society places an increased importance on environmental concerns. In addition to being safe for the environment and people, we believe these products are likely to see increased demand thanks to their ability to allow high-performance finishing in a variety of applications, including paper and metal processing, as well as film processability. Given the global trend away from organic solvents, this is one of the product groups on which we are focusing our energies.
Target markets for this business show a strong potential for growth and are in areas both in Japan and overseas in which DKS can demonstrate its strengths. While competitors include electronic materials manufacturers and overseas flame retardant manufacturers, the Company looks to secure growth through its innovative technologies and proposal capabilities.
DKS launched construction of a new radiation-curable monomers and oligomers plant in August 2019, with completion currently targeted for June 2020.

As the information society continues to advance, as evidenced by the rapid spread of the Internet and smartphones, the electronic device materials segment is focused on developing and supplying ion-conductive polymers, ionic liquids, ceramic materials and lithium-ion battery materials, as well as conductive pastes for solar cells, We dissolved Elexcel Corporation last year and moved the former company’s operations to the R&D Headquarters, with a corresponding shift to an organizational system specializing in the research and development of lithium-ion battery materials. We intend to further develop our innovative technologies in each area of operation, while also promoting R&D in line with the trends of the times. Mainstay products in the electronic device materials segment are produced at subsidiary companies Kyoto Elex and Dai-ichi Ceramo.
A review of the fiscal year ended March 2019 and our outlook for the future
Sales in this segment in the fiscal year ended March 2019 were generally sluggish.
Despite an expansion in sales of conductive pastes for solar cells, sales of injection molding pellets were generally weak. One threat to the segment is the improvement in technological abilities in countries throughout Asia, including China. However, by developing new markets and building firm relationships with customers based on the B2B2C business model, we intend to offer added value that cannot be beaten by cost competitiveness alone.
The strengths of DKS and the main functions of the business
DKS is focused on advancing business activity at subsidiary companies using its innovative technologies. The Company’s surface chemistry, which is its core technology, is used in the mixing techniques of resins and ceramic powders or organic materials and metal powders. DKS can conduct mixing operations

 under special conditions and with a high level of viscosity thanks to its detailed know-how in the process. Compound technology is one of our key strengths, allowing us to provide specific materials that meet the needs of our customers. One example is conductive pastes, which have precious metals as the main raw material and are made with inorganic fillers and soluble binders. Conductive pastes improve functionality in the electronic devices and components used in solar cells, automobiles, smartphones, LEDs, office equipment and medical equipment. Materials for ceramic and metal powder injection molding are used to produce small and difficult-to-process complex three-dimensional ceramics and metal parts. They often are used in electronic devices such as smartphones, precision components such as watches and medical equipment, and automotive and optical communication components. The segment also can provide powder injection molding compounds made by precisely mixing raw material powder, binder, and dispersant.
Another one of our strengths can be found in lithium-ion batteries, where we handle everything from materials research and development to the manufacture of prototype lithium batteries.
Relationship between the segment and society
The lithium-ion batteries (LiB) used in electric vehicles generally employ lithium phosphate as an electrolyte and an organic solvent as an electrolytic solution. However, because there is a risk of organic solvents igniting, manufacturers have been careful to incorporate safety measures, including adding in flame retardants. We have developed an ionic liquid that remains in that state at 100°C and below, has no vapor pressure and is nonflammable, and because it is highly safe and has high ion conductivity, we are developing electrolyte applications for lithium-ion batteries and capacitors. These kinds of liquids are also attracting attention as next-generation materials in the energy device field and as green solvents for reducing environmental impacts. Through these products and efforts, the segment is playing an important role in making all our lives safer and more comfortable. While the improving technological capabilities of countries in Asia, including China, are a threat, we believe growth is possible by offering our proprietary technologies, R&D capabilities and solid quality.

Pursuing breakthrough developments in connection
with the human brain through I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus
It has been said that we use only about 10% of our brain, leaving us with enormous potential. However, is it possible to develop our brains to resist the onset of dementia, or even to outperform AI? Biococoon Laboratories has revealed that an original hot water extract of I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus has proven able to completely eliminate damage in the hippocampal tissue
of senescence-accelerated mice. The research suggests the potential that more than 20% of the human brain can be used. In an environment in which there is no cure-all treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, in humans, we are promoting research and development in I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus, which could serve as a critical innovation in an aging society.

  Substances that can repair damaged hippocampal tissue in senescence-accelerated mice as a welcome addition to an aging society
 Figure 1 shows ophiocordyceps sinensis fungi harvested from a natural environment in a parasitic state with a moth, with the I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus manufactured through infestation of silkworm pupae after expelling silk during sericulture.
The first stage of the experiment involves normally aging mice and senescence-accelerated mice drinking water, with observation of the hippocampal tissues permitted through Holzer’s staining. The senescence-accelerated mice are used as the model for dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, and while no abnormal tissue was observed in the normally aging mice, the senescence-accelerated mice exhibited a gliopathic reaction, with what appears to be a fibrous lesion (lower section of Figure 2). In another experiment, the senescence-accelerated mice showed a greater deterioration in memory than did the normally aging mice. The senescence-accelerated mice are then given a hot water extract of I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus in low (5 mg/kg) and high (25 mg/kg) concentrations. Surprisingly, at the low concentration there were only a few fibrous scratches and at the high concentration they were not observed at all. Further memory experiments

showed memory in the senescence-accelerated mice restored to the level of normally aging mice. In other words, it appears that I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus could serve to repair hippocampus damage and promote the improvement of memory.1 As a result of the experiment with mice, human testing was advanced, with indications of an increase in acetylcholine2 in the brain from the ingestion of I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus.3
The mechanism by which I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus repairs the hippocampus is highly distinct and different from the functional foods expected to contribute to enhanced cognitive function and currently available dementia treatments (see Table 1). We target further clarification of the ability of I. Japonica-Bombyx Fungus to repair the hippocampal tissue through a combination of DKS know-how in chemicals and the life sciences expertise of Biococoon Laboratories. If the restorative properties to the hippocampal tissue can be clarified, it would suggest not only the potential for functional foods and pharmaceutical candidates for cognitive improvement but also the formation of a material that could allow humans to use 20% or more of their brain in the near future.

 Compliance with Chemical Substance Laws and Regulations
 With the goal of obtaining the latest information and enacting management measures to ensure compliance, we continue to monitor trends in not only domestic laws such as the Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc., the Industrial Safety and Health Law, the Food Hygiene Law, and the Poisonous and Deleterious
Substances Control Law but also the Export Trade Control Order in regard to products for export, and overseas laws and regulations, including those dealing with conflict minerals and rules regarding the registration of chemical substances. We also focus on the sharing of information by using groupware to transmit outlines of revisions to laws and regulations.
Provision of Product and Technical Information
 Our products are utilized in a variety of industrial fields, and we provide product and technical information tailored to the characteristics of each product and service. We always respond to requests and inquiries from our customers quickly, adequately and in good faith. We also provide information on hazardous materials to ensure safe handling, including that relative to product properties, applicable laws and regulations, transportation, handling methods and emergency measures by means of safety data sheets (SDS). We provide information using chemSHERPA, an information transfer scheme for chemicals contained within products throughout the supply chain. We also promote product labeling and issue
SDS related to compliance with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) and compliance with local regulations for exports to the United States, Europe and Asia. We have continuously updated our SDS and labeling to remain in compliance with the revised Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc., and the Industrial Safety and Health Law, as well as the Poisonous and Deleterious Substances Control Law. When introducing our products, we not only focus on close communication with our customers through daily business meetings but also disseminate information through brochures and technical documents.
Efforts to Reduce Complaints/Nonconforming Products
 Because we position quality-related nonconformity (complaints/deviation) as an important issue for securing quality, we check any appearance of nonconformity, determine the cause and verify the corrective action and its effectiveness to prevent reoccurrence. We also attempt to handle any product complaints we have received quickly, adequately and in good faith. Information on complaints and nonconformity is managed centrally via the Company’s intranet, and we implement appropriate measures to prevent any similar recurrences of nonconformity by the
involvement of peer groups. In addition to our efforts aimed at preventing the reoccurrence of nonconformity, we conducted a review of our system and made improvements, the priority issue being to respond to our customers with speed and the appropriate measures whenever such an event occurs. In the years to come, we will continue to strive to improve customer satisfaction by focusing on being imaginative and creative while promoting ongoing efforts to reduce nonconformity and prevent any recurrence should an incident arise.

     Human Resource Management
Securing Superior Human Resources, Ensuring Diversity
Human Resource Development Policies
1. Development of Professional Workers
We aim to train professional human resources who have high market value and can work on their own initiative.
(1) People possessing advanced, specialized skills
(2) People who recognize and achieve their roles and goals (3) People who raise and solve issues themselves
(4) People who demonstrate leadership in the workplace
2. Development of Autonomous Personnel
Switch to human resources able to work on their own initiative through their own motivation
Promotion Committee chaired by a senior management member, we are aiming for a human resource group capable of successfully contributing to improvements in Company performance. We are creating environments in which we can maximize the abilities of diverse employees, including women, seniors, people with disabilities and members of the LGBT community, and enable them to take an active part in our Company.
● Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement In addition to environments that facilitate women in working for many years, we will maintain work environments that enable women to develop their careers and implement measures aimed at having 10.0% or more of managerial positions occupied by women. As of the end of April 2019, the ratio had risen to 8.9% compared with 6.8% as of the end of April 2018. We also have created environments in which women can play active roles in all workplaces, and women have been active at manufacturing sites since FY2019.
● Retiree Reemployment System
In reemploying all applicants as“senior challenge staff,”we conduct monozukuri (manufacturing) by handing down the techniques and skills that make the best use of the experience they have accumulated over many years.
● Employment of People with Disabilities
We appreciate the aptitudes of people with disabilities and are actively working to create opportunities for them to demonstrate their abilities.
▶Education Courses
Education programs for our employees are supported by three
pillars: in-house on-the-job training, external education to learn skills and abilities, and assisting self-development. In recent years, we have focused on joint training with other companies to nurture next-generation leaders and enhancing our brother/sister program (reinforcement of a backup support system for new employees) aimed at having a new employee leaving rate of 0% three years after joining the Company. The Company is focusing its attention on human resource
  Human Resource Philosophy
 Respect for Humanity
Our fundamental human resource philosophy is rooted in the idea that our people are our assets and must be nurtured and treasured.
Our basic understanding is that the growth of our people will support the growth of the Company. The employees are supposed to actively play their roles in each workplace; learn, grow and exhibit their capabilities; and try to fulfill themselves. This way, we believe that they become the power of prosperity of the Company and the source to make it eternal.
The Company also supports the maintaining and improving of employee health, which form a cornerstone of individual employee self-fulfillment.
Respect for Human Rights and Diversity
▶Efforts to Prevent Harassment
We are trying to prevent harassment through, for example,
educational programs in hierarchical training courses. Several persons are selected as contacts, even from outside the Personnel Department, so that anyone can easily find someone to talk to and get advice from, and in addition, whistleblower portals inside and outside the Company are in place.
▶Work-Style Reforms
● Work-Life Balance
Since the Company’s Chairman and CEO, SAKAMOTO Takashi, is concurrently serving as the chairperson of the Kyoto Labor Standards Association, we are taking the initiative to support activities that balance work and family life. For FY2018, the actual ratio of annual paid leave taken was 68.5%. From FY2019, we will introduce the taking of annual leave in hourly increments and, in the years to come, promote initiatives toward achieving 70%, which is the Cabinet Office’s target. There has been an increase in men taking childcare leave in recent years. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, 57% of those using childcare leave were men.
● Introduction of Telecommuting System
We are introducing a telecommuting system from the current fiscal year. We are reforming the human resource system to improve work productivity and realize diverse work styles.
▶Promotion of Employee Participation and Advancement Having set up an Employee Participation and Advancement
Human Resource Development/Education
▶Global Human Resource Development We are undertaking a variety of projects based on the DKS Group’s globalization strategy.
The efforts on which we are focusing involve conducting three types of training: global mind-set training to make young employees more overseas-aware from an early stage; cross-cultural understanding and skills training sessions for mid-level employees; and in-house, selective training involving visits to subsidiaries geared toward employees with high global awareness.
In addition, we have opened an in-house language school and are actively recruiting non-Japanese nationals. We will continue to accelerate the globalization of the
DKS Group.

Efforts in Healthy Company Management
For the second successive year, DKS was recognized as a White 500 Organization, receiving certification from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) as an outstanding entity engaging in health and productivity management. Four of our subsidiaries also received certification.
We also acquired the highest health management rating from the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) for the second consecutive year.
The purpose of acquiring the ratings is to assess Company efforts through the eyes of external organizations, which could lead to further improvements in corporate value in the years to come.
Internal Communications
▶Holding of“Festa”
We hold festa, which are festivals for each region, to promote
the good health of employees and their families and broad exchanges. Elaborately planned events, such as a mochi-pounding festival, a bowling tournament, a tuna filleting show and chartering a sightseeing boat on the Uji River are useful in facilitating active inter-departmental and intergenerational communications.
▶Health Management Initiatives
The Company’s health checkup participation rate, the re-checkup
participation rate, the health guidance implementation rate and the stress check rate all stand at 100%. We support daily exercise with morning calisthenics and the holding of walking events and provide nutritious and well-balanced meals at canteens. We encourage measures to prevent passive smoking, educate all employees on how best to prevent lifestyle-related diseases, provide fully Company-subsidized influenza vaccinations while subsidizing the cost of breast cancer screening, dental screening and treatments to quit smoking. The Company has established internal and external contact centers for mental and physical issues, extending acceptance to family members such as parents. We provide mental health education for all our employees and for employees who work long hours, and we have established interviews with occupational physicians that exceed the statutory requirements. Health measures for employees are planned, implemented, and investigated at meetings attended by management, as we believe the enhanced health of our employees bolsters the overall strength of the Company.
▶Information Transmission inside the Company
Publishing the in-house newsletter“DKSCOM”every other month, our Public & Investor Relations Department works to instill the management policies and visions, as well as to foster communications within the Company. Feedback is also taken into consideration in planning the newsletters so that information can be disseminated and clearly understood by all employees in a timely fashion.

Global Warming Prevention (Energy Saving)
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, energy consumption in the DKS Group amounted to 25,900 KL, a 1.0% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year, however, the energy consumption per unit worsened 1.6%, which means that we were not able to achieve our fiscal year targets. This is mainly due to only the slight decrease in energy consumption while the production volume decreased. We
recorded 52,900 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a 1.9% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year, but a 26.1% reduction compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, meaning that the third year of the five-year target was not reached. We will continue to work to improve the efficiency of our energy use toward the achievement of our five-year targets.

Proper Management of Chemical Substances
The DKS Group had a total of 65 notification substances under the PRTR Law in FY2018. The total amount of emissions was 61.0 tons, which resulted in a 12.6-ton (26.1%) increase compared with the previous year. The breakdown was 60.4 tons to air, 0.59 tons to water and none to land.
In FY2018, the amount of waste transfer recorded was 207.4 tons, a
61.6-ton (22.9%) reduction compared with the previous fiscal year due to the use of recycled solvents and changes in the variety configuration. We will advance improvements in production processes and the introduction of recovery equipment, while continuing to make efforts to reduce the emissions/discharge of PRTR substances into the environment.

   Reducing Emissions of Environmental Impact Substances
 Air Pollution Prevention
Compared with the previous fiscal year, the DKS Group’s air-pollutant emissions in FY2018 showed a 9.0%, 50.0% and 57.3% decrease in SOx, NOx and dust emissions, respectively.
We will move ahead with facility improvements and studies of operational methods with the aim of making further energy-efficiency enhancements.
Water Pollution Prevention
In FY2018, the DKS Group recorded 4,177,000 cubic meters in the amount of water discharge, a 5.6% decrease compared with the previous year, and 27.3 tons of COD emissions, a year-on-year increase of 3.9%. We will continue to make efforts to reduce the water discharge and COD emission amounts by, for example, conducting reviews of our production processes and optimizing the operation methods at our effluent treatment facilities.

disposal amount was 1,044 tons, representing 101 tons year-on-year decrease. One contributory factor was that part of the sludge generated at the new facility was now recycled. For that reason, the final disposal rate was 4.8%, an improvement (decrease) of 0.7 percentage point compared with the previous fiscal year. In the year ahead, we will move ahead with a review of our sludge recycling and work to reduce the final disposal amount.

Important Issue 5
     Responsibility as a Global Company
Corporate Governance
Basic Concept
  We are operating the business based on our Company Credo“contributing to the nation and society through industry”along with our three Company Mottoes̶“Quality F i r s t , ”“ C o s t R e d u c t i o n ” a n d “ R & D E f f o r t s , ” w h i c h w e r e t h e founders’spirit. To aim for the establishment of a manage- ment base that can gain and maintain the trust of society, as well as to conduct transparent and fair corporate activities that are rooted in corporate social responsibility (CSR), we pursue higher governance as management policy and position it as one of our most important tasks. As a specific measure to achieve this, the DKS Board of
Directors passed a resolution establishing a basic policy for our internal control system in May 2006.
Through these practices, we will strengthen our
m a n a g e m e n t b a s e s o t h a t w e c a n e a r n h i g h t r u s t f r o m a l l stakeholders, including our customers and society. We also believe it is important to conduct corporate activities with transparency and fairness rooted in CSR.
For an overview of corporate governance at DKS, please refer to page 27 and the following pages in our Securities Report for FY2018 at the following URL (Japanese only):
▶ https://www.dks-web.co.jp/ir/img/annual_security_report_ h31_3.pdf
Status of Our Response to the CG Code
We hereby provide the reasons for not implementing the following 10 principles as part of our compliance with the Corporate Governance Code.
▶Corporate Governance Code Principles for which DKS is Not in Compliance and the Reasons for Non-Compliance
[Supplementary Principle 1-2-4]
Given that the shareholding ratio for overseas investors at DKS is only about 12%, we have determined that it is not necessary to provide an English translation of the Notice of Convocation at this time. To make it easier for overseas investors to exercise their voting rights, we will consider providing an English translation when the shareholding ratio for overseas investors exceeds 20%.
[Principle 1-4. Cross-Shareholdings]
DKS maintains cross-shareholdings for the purpose of strengthening its relationships with its business partners. Our holdings are verified based on risks and returns from a medium- to long-term perspective and continually reviewed based on suitability of ownership, considering the purpose of ownership, the rationality of investment and the investment amount. Voting rights on cross-shareholdings are exercised in consideration of whether the given proposal will contribute to enhanced medium- to long-term corporate and shareholder value for the DKS Group and the investee company.
[Principle 2-6. Roles of Corporate Pension Funds as Asset Owners]
DKS has introduced a“defined benefit-type corporate pension plan”and a“defined contribution-type corporate pension plan.”We have established“pension rules”for the“defined benefit-type corporate pension plan”and in accordance with our basic policy have defined an optimal asset composition ratio and appointed a management agency we believe best suited for stable pension management over the medium to long term. With the goal of ensuring proper management, we regularly request from this agency reports on operational policies and the status of assets. We ensure that there is no conflict of interest between the beneficiary and the Company by entrusting individual investment decisions and the exercise of voting rights to the asset management agency.
The corporate pension plans are designed to ensure low operating risk and appropriate management, with the latter achieved through regular communication with the specialized asset management agency. We accordingly believe there is little need for DKS to actively recruit and maintain human resources specializing in pension asset management.
[Supplementary Principle 4-1-3]
The succession planning for the CEO and other top executives remains a most important matter for company continuity, and it is important to carefully judge evident and potential management ability. Succession planning is a matter solely for the chief executive officer, who is familiar with the inner workings of the Company. DKS plans to establish and operate a successor development committee with outside executives as members, as we believe it is important to listen to the opinions of our outside directors in regard to the qualities and attributes of potential candidates.
[Supplementary Principle 4-10-1]
The three independent outside directors do not constitute a majority on the DKS Board of Directors. However, in addition to monthly Board of Directors meetings, external executive officers hold meetings every other month and one“free meeting”is held for external directors and representative directors each year. These meetings allow the sharing of information regarding the state of the Company and current management issues, as well as communication and coordina- tion with management and cooperation with the auditors and audit & supervisory board members. In addition, the indepen- dent outside directors provide advice and commentary on important matters, including nominations and remuneration, at the outside directors’meetings. We therefore believe it is not necessary at this time to establish independent committees such as a nomination committee or a remuneration committee.
[Principle 4-11. Preconditions for Board and Audit and Supervisory Board Effectiveness]
The Board of Directors is composed of company employees with knowledge and experience in a variety of fields, including sales, production, research, purchasing, logistics, planning, accounting and finance, and human resources and management, as well as those with management experience overseas. Those from outside the company have a wealth of experience and special- ized knowledge from working in life insurance companies, as well as in manufacturing companies operating in domains separate from those of DKS, and government agencies focused on working conditions and occupational health and safety. We believe diversity, including that relative to gender, still shows room for improvement, though any person who is recognized as having the proper qualifications will be considered as a candidate for the Board of Directors. On the whole, we believe the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board are well-versed with the business and have achieved a level of diversity and effectiveness with functional financial checks.
 44 DKS REPORT 2019

   [Supplementary Principle 4-11-3]
Verification of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors is conducted on an annual basis, with self-assessments by all directors and auditors based on questions prepared by the Secretary's Office of the Board of Directors. The replies are collected by the Secretary's Office, where they are then analyzed and given an
Executive Remuneration
▶Director Remuneration
Director remuneration consists of 1) fixed remuneration, 2) performance-linked remuneration to provide incentives and 3) stock-linked compensation to accentuate the sharing of value with shareholders. However, remuneration for outside directors consists of 1) fixed remuneration and 2) stock-linked compensation.
Fixed Remuneration
Fixed remuneration is set based on the scope of operations for which each director is responsible, as well as his or her position, and is paid on a monthly basis.
Performance-Linked Remuneration
Based on an annual performance evaluation of the Company as a whole in the previous fiscal year, and performance evaluations of the division of which each director is in charge that are conducted twice a year, performance-linked remuneration factors in consolidated sales, recurring profit and operating cash flow, with the allocation as a set position-based percentage of the whole.
Stock-Linked Remuneration
Having introduced restricted stock-linked compensation based on the scope of operations for which each director is responsible in his or her position, we set specific allocations for the monetary compensation that provides a bonus for the granting of shares with restriction on transfer.

assessment by the outside executives and full-time auditors. In the previous fiscal year, the outside executives and full-time auditors found the Board of Directors' effectiveness to be at a generally appropriate level, with the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole deemed as sufficient. DKS does not disclose a summary of the analysis or evaluations results.
Of the above, as determined by resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 25, 2019, 1) fixed remuneration and 2) performance-linked remuneration are set to a maximum amount of ¥30 million per month (equating to ¥360 million per annum, which does not include the wage salaries of individuals serving concurrently as employees and executives). As determined by resolution of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2017, 3) stock-linked compensation is set to a maximum of ¥100 million per annum (of which the portion for outside directors shall be ¥6 million or less per year, and which does not include the wage salaries of individuals serving concurrently as employees and executives). In addition, the total number of shares of common stock that the Company will thus issue or dispose of is to be up to a maximum of 100,000 shares per annum.
Having been drafted by the representative directors, all the above is paid upon the passing of a resolution by the Board of Directors.
▶Audit & Supervisory Board Member Remuneration
Audit & Supervisory Board member remuneration consists of 1) fixed remuneration and 2) stock remuneration based on audits conducted and the role played in promoting shareholder interests.

Compliance
Corporate Philosophy
The corporate philosophy around which the Company forms the basis of its actions is indicated in our Company credo, Company mottoes and Code of Corporate Ethics. These are also outlined in our Declaration of Action by Board Members and Employees. We post these in-house so that all employees can always act with them in mind, and we provide a pocket-sized Corporate Philosophy Handbook to all Company employees. The Company also conducts e-learning activities explaining our philosophy, with tests given to confirm understanding.
▶Code of Corporate Ethics
To establish corporate ethics that contribute to putting the Company policies into practice, we established a six-item set of principles as the Code of Corporate Ethics and adhere to the word and spirit of all laws and regulations, as well as international rules. We also respect the culture and customs of each country and region where we conduct our business activities and declare that we will act with social common sense.
Compliance in Practice
▶Compliance Control Committee
The Compliance Control Committee is charged with establishing and maintaining the Company’s compliance system.
Since its establishment in 2004, the Compliance Control Committee has been continuously engaged in building the compliance system, implementing educational activities to entrench compliance practices in our employees and conducting surveys to ensure understanding of the compliance system.
▶Corporate Ethics Month
The Compliance Control Committee has designated October every year to be Corporate Ethics Month and conducts activities during the month, including educational activities and the dissemination of information, centered on a particular theme. The theme for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, was employees confirming and following company rules. Activities focused on the importance of conducting business with a full understanding of the rules, with the Committee reviewing all established rules and regulations for deficiencies and subsequent revisions.
▶Whistleblower Hotlines
DKS has established whistleblower hotlines where employees can consult on and report possible violations to established laws and regulations.
While the Company already had an internal hotline, DKS in 2016 established an external hotline as well, with instructions on use distributed internally, including through the Company intranet.
▶Declaration of Action by Board Members and Employees
Regarding the six-item set of principles established as the Code of Corporate Ethics, we broke down the content as to what kind of behavior is actually required, clearly state the guidelines for the actions of executives and employees (including seconded and contract employees, as well as temporary employees) and declare that these guidelines will be implemented as a code of conduct.
Basic Concept
  Since the Compliance Control Committee was established in 2004, our Company has been continuously engaged in the building and maintenance of our compliance system, as well as in activities to instill compliance practices in our employees. Recognizing that compliance activities are indispensable for continuing as a sound company, we will further strengthen our activities in the years to come.
    46 DKS REPORT 2019
Corporate philosophy handbook
Code of Corporate Ethics
 ▶Compliance Awareness Survey
We conduct a Compliance Awareness Survey for all employees each December with the aim of accurately understanding the effects from activities aimed at further instilling compliance practices. Based on employee awareness of key issues, we use the results to determine initiatives for next year.
The fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, was the 14th consecutive year the Company has implemented the Awareness Survey.
Initially, internal awareness was rather low, and the response rate for the survey was only about 76% for the Company as a whole. However, improved penetration and the ongoing activities contributed to a response rate of 99% for the 14th survey.
The survey contains the same fixed questions each time, focuses on issues deemed important for that year and confirms the results from that year’s Corporate Ethics Month.

We intend to continue to raise awareness of compliance and strengthen our activities aimed at ensuring that employees comply with all laws and regulations.

   Risk Management (Risks and Responses to Them)
Basic Concept
  Diverse and becoming more complex, the corporate risks surrounding the Company could result in increased adverse impacts on the Company itself, as well as on employees, shareholders, customers and local communities. We position risk management as an important management issue and are taking steps to prevent potential risks and prevent the spread of risks that have already manifested.
Risk Management
To address Group risk, we have established a Risk Management Control Committee that meets on a regular basis and is composed of representatives of each department, with the director in charge serving as the chairperson.
With a focus on developing and standardizing the risk management system, the Committee determines an action plan and reviews results, identifying potential risks and considering countermeasures.
In Japan and overseas, the Company and its subsidiaries are working to operate and maintain crisis management systems on a daily basis so that we can communicate risk crisis information as soon as possible, ascertain the situation and take appropriate measures. To deal with potential and/or evident risks, we have taken several steps, including establishing and maintaining Risk Management Procedures, Product Liability (PL) Prevention and Management Procedures and Information Security Rules.
Major initiatives implemented in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, included the extraction of risks and implementation of countermeasures in each department, the implementation of measures to prevent information leakages and notifications to overseas travelers through groupware calling attention to these leaks.
We believe it is important for employees to understand concepts such as“risk management,”“crisis management”and
“business continuity management”(focusing on responding to interruptions in business) and to view the establishment of activities entrenching these concepts as vitally important.
With renewed recognition, we will promote further management education, including e-learning, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020.
  Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Countermeasures
 BCP is an abbreviation for Business Continuity Plan, which allows a company to maintain critical operations when it is affected by an unforeseen natural disaster such as an earthquake. Even if business activities are unavoidably interrupted, the BCP focuses on restarting important functions within the recovery time objective and minimizing the risks involved in interrupted operations.
We have created a BCP for a large-scale earthquake and the outbreak of a highly virulent H1N1-type influenza. We also have created a BCP for logistics operations in the event of an earthquake or torrential rain. We are regularly reviewing and updating our BCPs.
▶Disaster Preparedness
In the event of a crisis, our Risk Management Manual
establishes management levels in line with the crisis, with the person in charge in line with those risk management levels tasked with risk management.
Noting the increased occurrence of abnormal weather conditions, such as torrential rain, typhoons and abnormal temperatures, our annual preparation for natural disasters includes training on understanding and reporting the safety
Information Security
Through the optimization of infrastructure and the ensuring of security, we provide high-quality services protecting against disasters and cyberattacks, while simultaneously promoting robust and sustainable industrialization and the expansion of technological innovation.
Within the Company, we are creating a system ensuring
situations of employees and damage conditions, as well as ways to improve disaster response and employee awareness. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the safety confirmation system linked to the Japan Meteorological Agency information was used four times to confirm the safety of each department using companywide PCs and mobile phones. We will continue training in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, to make sure all employees are registered in the safety confirmation system and through safety confirmation training we will reaffirm the reporting procedure via the responsible parties.

Fundamental Knowledge of Surfactants
Generally, an“interface”refers to the border area between two materials of different states of solid, liquid or gas. A surface active agent, or surfactant, is a term for a chemical that exhibits functions and improves the performance of these interfaces.
1 Basic Structure of Surfactants
Surfactants have a unique chemical structure that has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Using this structure, surfactants can achieve a variety of effects such
as emulsification, dispersion, foaming and adsorption by weakening surface tension or forming molecular aggregates or micelles (spheres).

     2 Surfactant Types
 Surfactants have four main structural types based on the functions they are designed to achieve. Of these four types, three are ionic surfactants that transform into electrolytic dissociation ions (atoms or groups of atoms bearing an electrical charge) when dissolved in water, and the remaining
Anionic surfactants Cationic surfactants Amphoteric surfactants
Nonionic surfactants
type is nonionic surfactants, which do not form ions. The three ionic surfactants are further subdivided based on the type of ion they form in water: anionic (or negative ion) surfactants, cationic (or positive ion) surfactants and amphoteric (containing both positive and negative ions) surfactants.

   3 Main Actions and Applications
    Function
Actions and effects
Mixes water and oil and makes an emulsion. Makes a uniform dispersion with fine particles floating on the water surface.
Spreads agrochemicals thin and uniform on the leaf surfaces. Evenly disperses dyestuff and finishing agents on textiles and leathers.
Takes in air bubbles in water and stabilizes. Prevents foaming.
Removes dirt by moistening the surface of textiles and dirt, taking the dirt off the textiles by penetrating in between them, and emulsifying/dispersing the dirt.
Improves the smoothness of yarns in the spinning and/or knitting process and makes soft and smooth-textured textiles.
Prevents static electricity generation by making the surfaces smooth. Makes static electricity easier to escape by forming a water-absorptive coating on the surface.
Adheres to the metal surface and forms a coat to prevent oxygen (air) and water from contacting the metal and causing rust.
Makes the dyestuff gradually be absorbed by the textiles and brings about uniform dyeing.
A positively charged surfactant is absorbed to negatively charged bacteria, destroys the cells and sterilizes.
Applications
 Emulsifying,
   dispersing

 Interface/surface control technology
A variety of applications can be achieved with surfactants, for example, emulsification, dispersion, solubilization, wetting/penetration, surface /interface tension control, foaming/defoaming and surface modification. The primary applications of surfactants are emulsification and dispersion for mixing together substances that normally are not mixed together. Emulsification and dispersion are conditions in which other substances exist in a liquid in the form of small dispersed particles; this is generally known as emulsion. Surfactants have a wide range of uses spanning from household to industrial. The most common is emulsion between various oils and water. Although water and oils will separate after being mixed, adding a surfactant as an intermediate between water and oils enables the creation of stable emulsion. The most familiar example of this phenomenon is washing dishes. When washing dishes to which oil residue has adhered, the surfactant is first absorbed into the oil residue, where it reduces the interface tension between the oil and dishwashing liquid. Next, the liquid enters between the oil residue and dishware via wetting/penetration. Finally, oil residue is separated from the dishware through physical force such as washing by hand. The residue is adsorbed into the micelles formed by the surfactant and then dispersed throughout the liquid, which prevents re-adherence of the residue. In this way, the surfactant’s surface tension reduction function, wetting/penetration effect and other effects such as emulsification, solubilization and dispersion are major factors in the washing effect. Moreover, improving the wettability of paint and adding various functionality (e.g., leveling, water/oil repellent, antifouling, lubricity) can be included as types of technology for surface modification and interface control. These surfactants exhibit superior solubility in solvents and a high surface tension reduction function with a small amount of use. For example, fluoropolymers are widely used in water-and oil-repellent agents for textile. Our company is working to develop PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid)-free fluoropolymers through the synthesis of various surfactants and the use of application technology. This makes it possible to respond to needs for surface/interface control, which had been difficult to achieve using conventional surfactants.
Alkylene oxide addition technology
This technology adds ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) to raw materials of higher alcohols derived from natural sources such as coconut oil or palm oil, as well as phenols and amines.
Alkylene oxide functional design technology
Through the addition of alkylene oxide (AO), in addition to EO and PO sequencing such as random polymerization and block polymerization, this technology enables desired control for the number of added moles. This makes it possible to freely design a surfactant composition, which satisfies the required performance.
Urethanization technology
This technology synthesizes a urethane resin that is a polymer compound possessing urethane bonds in the main framework of the molecular structure. Through diverse combinations of the raw materials polyisocyanate and polyol, it is possible to change the type and length of the structural chain and to change the structure of both ends, thus creating a variety of physical properties. This makes it possible to create substances such as elastic urethane rubber and urethane elastomer, as well as soft/hard urethane foam in conjunction with foaming reaction. By utilizing these properties, these substances can be used in products such as cushioning, thermal insulation, molding and coating materials. In addition, water-based urethane resin can be obtained by emulsifying urethane resin. Our company’s products can be broadly divided into nonreactive and reactive. Nonreactive water-based urethane resin is an emulsion product of urethane resin. Reactive water-based urethane resin is produced by using a blocking agent to protect the terminal isocyanate groups generated by the reaction between polyisocyanate and polyol and emulsify. Reactive water-based urethane resin is composed of the two basic structures of a soft segment and a hard segment, and it undergoes quasi-crystallization during the resin molding process. Consequently, it combines flexibility, toughness and elasticity and possesses superior solvent resistance and adhesion. Because the material combines safety and high functionality, it is used in a wide range of processes such as film, metal, paper and textile.
   52 DKS REPORT 2019

   Cellulose modification technology
This technology synthesizes anionic water-soluble polymers with cellulose as the main raw material. The CMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) synthesized via this technology can be used in various applications by changing the length of the molecular chain and the addition quantities of the carboxymethyl group. CMC is known as a food additive, is easily dissolved in either cold or hot water and becomes a viscous liquid that is colorless and transparent. It has an extensive record of use as a thickening stabilizer. Uses include as a thickening agent for food seasonings and a binding agent for fish feed and pesticides. CMC is known for functioning as a high-performance dispersion stabilizer. It is applied to products seeking an even higher level of functionality, for example, a dispersion stabilizer of lactoprotein in lactic acid bacteria beverages, an anti-redeposition agent in detergents and a dispersion/thickening stabilizer for toothpaste.
Sucrose esterification technology
This technology is used to obtain sucrose fatty acid esters (SEs), a non-ionic surfactant that as natural sucrose is part of the hydrophilic group and as higher fatty acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid are part of the lipophilic group. The high safety of SEs is recognized by international organizations (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives), and SEs were approved as a food additive in Japan in 1959. In addition to food products, SEs are used in a wide range of products such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. Examples include emulsifiers, viscosity modifiers, anti-aging agents for starches and texture modifiers. Synthesis methods of SEs can be broadly divided into an esterification reaction method that uses fatty acid chlorides and fatty acid anhydrides, a transesterification method with lower alcohol esters of fatty acids and an enzyme method using enzymes such as lipase as the catalyst. Among these methods, the transesterification method has been industrialized, with sucrose and fatty acid methyl esters used as the raw materials.
Cellulose nanofiberization technology
This technology is used to create the new material cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) by chemically or physically treating the naturally derived cellulose fibers to reduce the fiber width to a nano meter size. Our Company’s CNFs are exceptional for their extremely fine fiber width on the single nano level. This fineness is achieved via chemical modification processing. Furthermore, by utilizing its exceptional characteristics such as viscosity behavior, emulsification and dispersion stability effect, our CNFs can be used in products such as cosmetics and general industrial products.
Emulsion/polymerization technology
This technology conducts polymerization by using surfactants to emulsify in water the monomers that do not dissolve in water. This enables synthesis of high molecular weight polymers that cannot be obtained via bulk polymerization or solution polymerization. Furthermore, because the polymer system is surrounded by water, it is easy to remove polymerization heat and perform stable temperature management. A polymerizable surfactant is a type of surfactant that possesses a radical polymerizable group. It is used as an emulsifier for emulsion polymerization. Through copolymerization with monomers during the process of the emulsion polymerization, it improves the mechanical stability, chemical stability, freezing/thawing stability and foaming property of polymer dispersion, and improves the water resistance of the polymer film.
Application Technology
Nano-dispersion technology
This technology stably mixes immiscible substances to bring out the diverse power inherent in materials. This technology is expected to support dispersants that enable dispersion in the nano range, various dispersion methods, and applicability to a wide range of materials such as inorganic powder, organic powder and oil. Nano materials can be broadly divided into carbon materials (e.g., fullerene, nano tubes, nano fibers, graphene), metals (e.g., gold, silver, copper) and metal oxides (e.g., silica, titania, zirconia), all of which possess diverse characteristics. This technology disperses these nano materials into mediums such as water, organic solvents and resins. However, as particle size of substances is reduced to nano size, the impact of the Van der Waals force becomes stronger, resulting in problems such as particles being prone to agglomeration and a decrease in transparency. Interface control is required to prevent agglomeration.
Function/usage: Electronic and electric equipment (touch panels for smartphones and tablets), cosmetics (sunscreen), eyeglass frames, etc. Radiation curing technology
This technology instantly dries and cures coatings and other types of radiation-curable resin compounds by irradiating them with ultraviolet (UV) rays or electron beams (EBs). The technology is also called radcure (UV/EB curing). Radcure technology is used in a wide range of diverse fields due to its ability to conserve resources and energy and reduce environmental load. Its uses include clear coatings for construction materials and furnishings; anti-rust coatings for metal; resistance materials such as semiconductors, dry film and LCD displays; coatings for items such as mobile phones, optical fibers, plastics and paper; printing ink; plate-making materials; and adhesives. Our Company’s monomers are made from the raw material alcohol using EO precision-addition technology. We offer a full lineup of products with added functionality (e.g., high hardness, low viscosity, low curling).
Function/usage: Adhesives, paints/coatings, printing/marking Flame retardation technology
This technology adds/disperses compounds containing flame-retardant elements such as bromine, phosphorus, nitrogen, boron, silicon and/or antimony to/in polymer materials to make them flame-retardant by a chemical reaction and bonding resulting from it. Recently, out of consideration for the environment, attention is being placed on the use of inorganic compounds such as hydrated metal compounds (Mg hydroxide, Al hydroxide) and nano-composites (MMT, CNT). Flame retardants are broadly divided into halogenated and halogen-free products which are based on phosphorus or inorganic substances. Halogenated flame retardants have superior flame-retarding efficiency and therefore are most widely used as flame retardants for plastics. Our Company’s products are brominated flame retardants that give sufficient flame retardancy with a small amount of use. Moreover, the products interfere little with the superior properties of plastic, namely, heat resistance, heat stability, UV stability, workability, mechanical strength and electrical properties. The products are capable of satisfying requirements for the flame retarding of plastics, which are increasingly diverse and have increasingly advanced functions.
Function/usage: Electronic and electric equipment, OA equipment, construction products, automotive products, railway cars, textile, paper, aircraft, marine vessels, etc.
Ionic liquid
Generally, ionic liquid is an ion pair compound that remains in a liquid state at/below 100oC. It has no vapor pressure and is nonflammable. Because ionic liquid has high safety and ion conductivity, it is used in electrolyte applications such as lithium-ion batteries and capacitors. Ionic liquid also is attracting attention as a next-generation material in the energy device field and as a green solvent that reduces environmental impact. Ionic liquid is a salt composed only of ions (anions, cations). It dissolves a variety of organic and inorganic compounds and can conduct ions.
Function/usage: Reactive solvents, extraction solvents; as electrolytes, dye-sensitized solar batteries, lithium-ion batteries, electric bilayer capacitors and actuators; lubricants, dispersants and antistatic agents, etc.
Special Technology
Glycidylation technology
This technology belongs to Yokkaichi Chemical. Via synthesis technology using glycidyl ether, which is a bifunctional aliphatic epoxy compound possessing a flexible framework in the center of the molecule, the technology generates compounds with improved flexibility, toughness and water resistance of cured materials.
Function/usage: Electronic material

  Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
Disclosing the necessary corporate information in a timely and appropriate manner, the Company attaches importance to the occasions for communicating with the wide range of people concerned.
While actively conducting dialogues with its many investors, the Company has been able to seize opportunities for dialogue involving stories about its creation of value.
Through the words of the Chairman himself, the Company arranges regular large and small meetings with investors. In addition, with regard to explaining financial performance and business scope, the personnel in charge conduct interviews and offer direct explanations as part of their everyday tasks. As this Report serves as a tool for sustainable and constructive dialogue, we are working to improve corporate value, including mutual understanding through active communication.
 Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders
On June 25, 2019, the Company held its annual Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders at the hall at the Company's corporate Headquarters building. The shareholders who attended that day numbered 109, including some who had traveled long distances to be there. After the conclusion of the general meeting, the Company held a management briefing session given by the CEO and an informal gathering.
Using the valuable time to directly explain management's way of thinking and direction through mutual dialogue, the Company regards the general meeting as an important occasion for the management team to earnestly obtain feedback directly from shareholders and for that feedback to be subsequently reflected in management.

  On Publishing the DKS Report 2019
  This issue marks the fourth time the DKS Group has published its integrated report since the initial report in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. We believe the report is an important way to communicate information related to the creation of value at DKS to our stakeholders. Taking a long-term perspective, the reports look at the current situation and explain the Company’s growth strategies in an easily understood manner. As we move into the first year of the Reiwa era in Japan, which envisions opening the door to
“beautiful harmony,”we are renewing our efforts to provide a clear and complete introduction of the Company.
DKS celebrated the 110th anniversary of the Company’s founding in 2019. Since the foundation, the Company’s motto has been“contributing to the nation and society through industry.”I believe this encapsulates the theme of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030 adopted by the United Nations at its summit in 2015. Among the 17 SDGs, DKS prioritized five that play to the strengths of the Company. With a focus on achieving these goals, we aim to contribute to the resolution of social issues while achieving sustainable improvements in corporate value.
We believe it is important to produce an integrated report that supports constructive dialogue between the Company and its investors. With the Corporate Governance Code being revised in June 2018, DKS has reconfirmed its position relative to the principles in the revised code and has provided careful explanations of
Editing
Launched at the same time as our 5-year management plan, the Company's integrated report now has reached its fourth issuance.
 In recognition of the fact that companies can no longer expect to last long if they are not in harmony with society, we have adopted the Uni-Top strategy, which focuses on the Company's innovative technologies to resolve environmental and social issues. Amid growing calls for enhanced disclosure, including relative to non-financial data, we have focused on making this report readily available not only outside the Company but also inside the Company so that it can be used to share information and promote further understanding.
 With a new team under a new system, we took a different perspective in the production and editing of this year's report. First, we identified important risks and opportunities based on management strategies in line with a business model centered on value creation. We then sought to devise a clear and consistent story reflecting the DKS vision on the important issues
such to its stakeholders. We also note the importance of climate-related financial disclosures, as outlined by the TFCD, as an indicator for chemicals companies. With this in mind, we have included explanations of our initiatives in technology development and the provision of environmentally friendly products.
The DKS Report 2019 comes in the final year of our 5-year management plan. As a key milestone, we have been focused on clearly identifying risks and opportunities distinct to DKS. For example, our business model adds value to consumers by bringing in new customers through the Company’s full-fledged entry into the life sciences business. Our next 5-year management plan, dubbed“FELIZ 115,”will begin in the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2020. With the goal of instilling happiness (feliz means happy in Spanish) in the management of our business, the new plan should be completed by December 2019.
We look forward to the feedback from our stakeholders that will allow us to produce even more substantial and meaningful reports in the years ahead.
SAKAMOTO Takashi
Chairman, CEO September 2019
supporting its business and corporate activities. At the same time, we sought through cooperation with the production company to improve the report from a visual perspective, making it easier to read.
 We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all the parties concerned for their cooperation in the editing. We also welcome the frank opinions from readers as we work toward the issue for the next fiscal year.

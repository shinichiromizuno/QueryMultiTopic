Basic Philosophy and Basic Policies for Environmental and Safety PracticesBasic Philosophy
Our basic philosophy is to contribute to society by making a company that thrives together with local communities and employees by supplying products that satisfy customers. Based on this, our environmental and safety philosophy is to contribute to the sustainable development and realization of happy societies by considering the human health, safety and environmental preservation throughout the life cycle of each product from development to scrapping.
Basic Policies
(1) Throughout the life cycle of each product from development to scrapping, we evaluate and minimize the impact of business activities on the environment and make the best efforts to preserve the environment.
(2) We aim at accident- and disaster-free operations to secure the safety of both local communities and employees.
(3) We confirm the safety of raw materials, semi-finished products and final products to prevent health-related disorders of all relevant people including, but not limited to, employees, logistic/transportation workers, customers and general consumers.
(4) We strive to continuously improve the safety and environment not only by strictly complying with relevant legislation and regulations but also by self-management.
 Responsible Care (RC) Activity Promotion System
 We set up the safety and environment philosophy, basic and action policies, based on which we promote our corporate activities related to quality, safety and the environment. Such issues are discussed and decided by the RC Promotion Conference, which is the top decision-making body and is chaired by the president.
Moreover, we regularly hold environmental preservation meetings, safety and health meetings and quality

Management Systems
The Company promotes the comprehensive safety management of chemical substances based on the RC Code, which consists of the seven management systems stipulated based on Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) policies: environmental conservation, safety and disaster prevention,
assurance/product liability meetings chaired by the quality, safety and environment personnel and joined by the production branch general managers and relevant department managers. In these meetings, corporate targets, action plans and results are discussed to promote the RC activities. Under each of these meetings is a committee to make, implement and evaluate specific action plans for continuous improvements.

 Environmental risk management is an important measure to minimize environmental risks and/or consequent damages caused by risks. We comply with environmental-related legislation and regulations and agreements with local municipal governments, based on the Declaration of Action by Board Members and Employees and there was no violation of laws and
regulations. All our production sites in Japan are regularly checked for environmental compliance in accordance with the ISO 14001–based environmental management system. Up-to-date information on legislation is checked and understood on a timely basis and disseminated internally to ensure compliance. Recently, education programs using an e-learning system have started.

   Environment-Related Complaints
The Company received no complaints related to the environment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. We will continue to strive to ensure safety in our operations while working to earn the understanding of those living nearby our plants and other company locations.
Environment Accounting
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the DKS Group’s investment in environmental-related systems was spent mainly in the field of pollution prevention. Resource circulation costs accounted for a relatively strong ratio of costs tied to preservation of the environment. The economic benefits therein include profits on the actual sales of valuable resources and the amount of cost savings and are not based on estimated economic benefits.

Global Warming Prevention (Energy Saving)
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, energy consumption in the DKS Group amounted to 25,900 KL, a 1.0% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year, however, the energy consumption per unit worsened 1.6%, which means that we were not able to achieve our fiscal year targets. This is mainly due to only the slight decrease in energy consumption while the production volume decreased. We
recorded 52,900 tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, a 1.9% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year, but a 26.1% reduction compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, meaning that the third year of the five-year target was not reached. We will continue to work to improve the efficiency of our energy use toward the achievement of our five-year targets.

Proper Management of Chemical Substances
The DKS Group had a total of 65 notification substances under the PRTR Law in FY2018. The total amount of emissions was 61.0 tons, which resulted in a 12.6-ton (26.1%) increase compared with the previous year. The breakdown was 60.4 tons to air, 0.59 tons to water and none to land.
In FY2018, the amount of waste transfer recorded was 207.4 tons, a
61.6-ton (22.9%) reduction compared with the previous fiscal year due to the use of recycled solvents and changes in the variety configuration. We will advance improvements in production processes and the introduction of recovery equipment, while continuing to make efforts to reduce the emissions/discharge of PRTR substances into the environment.

  Reducing Emissions of Environmental Impact Substances
 Air Pollution Prevention
Compared with the previous fiscal year, the DKS Group’s air-pollutant emissions in FY2018 showed a 9.0%, 50.0% and 57.3% decrease in SOx, NOx and dust emissions, respectively.
We will move ahead with facility improvements and studies of operational methods with the aim of making further energy-efficiency enhancements.
Water Pollution Prevention
In FY2018, the DKS Group recorded 4,177,000 cubic meters in the amount of water discharge, a 5.6% decrease compared with the previous year, and 27.3 tons of COD emissions, a year-on-year increase of 3.9%. We will continue to make efforts to reduce the water discharge and COD emission amounts by, for example, conducting reviews of our production processes and optimizing the operation methods at our effluent treatment facilities.

Waste Reduction
The amount of waste generated by the DKS Group in FY2018 amounted to 21,658 tons, an increase of 878 tons compared with the previous fiscal year. The waste generation per unit result was 7.1% worse (an increase) than the previous fiscal year, and thus we were unable to achieve our target of a 1% improvement (decrease) in the annual rate. The recycling rate was 90.5%, which marked a 1.3-percentage-point worsening (decrease) compared with the previous fiscal year. The final

disposal amount was 1,044 tons, representing 101 tons year-on-year decrease. One contributory factor was that part of the sludge generated at the new facility was now recycled. For that reason, the final disposal rate was 4.8%, an improvement (decrease) of 0.7 percentage point compared with the previous fiscal year. In the year ahead, we will move ahead with a review of our sludge recycling and work to reduce the final disposal amount.

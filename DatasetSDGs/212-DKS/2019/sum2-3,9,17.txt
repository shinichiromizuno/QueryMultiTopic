    Research and Development
DKS’s Foundation That Underpins StrategiesAs an industrial chemical manufacturer, it is our management philosophy to continue to be a prominent company that responds to the expanding chemical requirements of industries. To realize that philosophy, we are focusing on the research and development of high-value-added products, with a particular focus on products with IT and electronics-related applications, and the development of new applications for battery materials and cellulose nanofibers. With innovative wisdom and technologies, we are pursuing“Chemistry provides a solution”in every industry and developing products that can contribute to a sustainable society.
R&D System
In FY2018, we established the Life Sciences R&D Department, which is focused on the development of cellulose nanofibers, and the Elexcel R&D Department, which develops applications for battery materials, within the Research and Development Headquarters as part of the reorganization to a system promoting new development and collaboration with the Corporate R&D Department in charge of new development, new businesses and companywide research themes. In addition to promoting in-group cooperation between the Functional Chemicals R&D Department, which mainly conducts product development for the Surfactants and Amenity Materials segments, and the Plastic Materials R&D Department, which is responsible for the development of products for the Polyurethane, Functional Materials and Electronic Materials segments, we are working to accelerate research and development through cooperation with outside entities such as public research institutes, universities and customers. The Production Technology Department provides support for the innovation and creation of new production technologies.

Mindful of future business development, we actively promote the filing and obtaining of intellectual property (IP) rights based on R&D results. Recently, to provide our business operations with stronger backup, we have been focusing on improving the quality of our patents through enhanced information retrieval functions. We will continue to respond to the globalization of our business and acquire rights securely for important domestic and foreign markets.

 Products to Meet Environmental Requirements
 DKS has been developing products made using sugars and cellulose, which are eco-friendly materials that are derived from plants and are renewable. Among them, the cellulose nanofiber RHEOCRYSTA possesses unique physicochemical properties due to its single-digit nano size, and the Company is advancing the development of applications so that this product can be used as a high-performance additive in, for example, inks, cosmetics, ceramics and batteries.
DKS began to manufacture and sell HITENOL and NOIGEN Series polymerizable surfactants in the 1980s. Such eco-friendly products as water-based paints and adhesives, which have been popular in recent years, offer excellent water resistance and adhesiveness. The new HITENOL AR Series products offer excellent copolymerization qualities with a wide range of monomers and improve the water resistance of and inhibit the formation of bubbles in paints and adhesives.

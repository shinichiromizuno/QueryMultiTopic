Five Important Issues Important Issue 4
Consideration for the Environment
Shareholders Society
       Natural capital is a critical common asset for chemical manufacturers, making sincere responses to various environmental problems a common global issue in the aim for economic development and conservation of the global environment. DKS will always face social issues, protect human environments and lifestyles, and contribute to the creation of a sustainable society as “chemistry provides a solution” for improving safety and comfort.Basic Philosophy and Basic Policies for Environmental and Safety Practices
Basic Philosophy
Our basic philosophy is to contribute to society by making a company that thrives together with local communities and employees by supplying products that satisfy customers. Based on this, our environmental and safety philosophy is to contribute to the sustainable development and realization of happy societies by considering the human health, safety and environmental preservation throughout the life cycle of each product from development to scrapping.
Basic Policies
1) Throughout the life cycle of each product from development to scrapping, we evaluate and minimize the impact of business activities on the environment and make our best efforts to preserve the environment.
2) We aim at accident- and disaster-free operations to secure the safety of both local communities and employees.
3) We confirm the safety of raw materials, semifinished products and
final products to prevent health-related disorders of all relevant people including, but not limited to, employees, logistic/transportation workers, customers and general consumers.
4) We strive to continuously improve the safety and environment not only by strictly complying with relevant legislation and regulations but also by self-management.Responsible Care (RC) Activity Promotion System
We set up the safety and environment philosophy, as well as basic
and action policies, based on which we promote our corporate activities related to quality, safety and the environment. Such issues are discussed and decided by the RC Promotion Conference, which is the top decision-making body and is chaired by the president.
Moreover, we regularly hold environmental preservation meetings, safety and health meetings and quality assurance/product liability

Management System
In addition to promoting the comprehensive safety management of chemical substances based on the RC Code, which consists of seven factors derived from Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) policies—environmental conservation, safety and disaster prevention,
meetings chaired by the quality, safety and environment personnel and joined by plant general managers and relevant department managers. In these meetings, corporate targets, action plans and results are discussed to promote RC activities. Under each of these meeting organizations is a committee to make, implement and evaluate specific action plans for continuous improvements. RC (Environment, Safety and Quality Assurance) Promotion ConferenceEnvironment Preservation Meeting

Observation of Environmental Laws and Regulations
Environmental risk management is an important measure to minimize environmental risks and/or the consequent damages caused by risks. We comply with environmental-related legislation and regulations
and agreements with local municipal governments based on the Declaration of Action by Board Members and Employees, and
there were no violations of laws or regulations in fiscal 2019. All our DKS REPORT 2020
production plants in Japan are regularly checked for environmental compliance in accordance with the ISO 14001-based environmental management system. Up-to-date information on legislation is checked and understood on a timely basis and disseminated internally to ensure compliance. Recently, education programs using an e-learning system have started.
occupational safety and health, logistics safety, chemical and product safety, dialogues with society and the management system—DKS
is working toward improvements in environmental conservation and quality, using environmental and quality ISO standards as tools.

Environment-Related Complaints
In fiscal 2019, there was one noise complaint. We took immediate steps to investigate the cause and examine corrective measures. As a result, problematic noise was reduced by suppressing equipment

Five Important Issues
      Important Issue 4
Consideration for the Environment
Global Warming Prevention (Energy Saving)
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Group energy consumption amounted to 25,800 KL, a 0.4% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year, however, the energy consumption per unit increased 9.8%, which means that we were not able to achieve our fiscal year targets. This is mainly because, compared to the previous fiscal year, the proportion of products requiring energy increased due to changes in the product mix. In fiscal 2019, we recorded 51,800 tons of carbon

dioxide emissions, a 1.2% decrease compared with the previous fiscal year and a 27.7% reduction compared with fiscal 2005. This is an average 26.8% reduction compared with fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019, meaning the target was not reached. With the start of new medium-term targets in fiscal 2020, we will continue to work to improve the efficiency of our energy use toward the achievement of our five-year targets.

Proper Management of Chemical Substances
The DKS Group had a total of 67 notification substances under the PRTR Regulation in fiscal 2019. The total amount of emissions was 61.2 tons, which resulted in a 0.2-ton (0.4%) increase compared with the previous year. The breakdown was 60.6 tons to air, 0.57 tons to water and none to land. Emissions amounted to 51,800 tons (down 1.2% YoY), a 27.7% decrease compared with fiscal 2005. The average reduction from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019 was 26.8% compared with fiscal 2005, meaning the target was not achieved. With the start of

to improve the efficiency of our energy use toward the achievement
of our five-year targets. The amount of waste transfer recorded was 223.6 tons, a 16.2-ton (7.8%) increase compared with the previous fiscal year. We will advance improvements in production processes and the introduction of recovery equipment, while continuing to make efforts to reduce the emissions/discharge of PRTR substances into the environment.

Where Are We Going? How Should We Manage? How Can We Be Sustainable? Business Activities Report Data Section
Reducing Emissions of Environmental Impact Substances
  Air Pollution Prevention
Compared with the previous fiscal year, the Group’s air-pollutant emissions in fiscal 2019 showed rises of 17.7% and 34.1% for SOx and NOx, respectively, while dust emissions fell 22.8%. We will move ahead with facility improvements and studies of operational methods with the aim of making further energy-efficiency enhancements.
Water Pollution Prevention
In fiscal 2019, the Group recorded 3,952,000 cubic meters in the amount of water discharge, a 5.4% decrease compared with the previous year, and 19.1 tons of COD emissions, a year-on-year decrease of 30.2%. We will continue to make efforts to reduce
the water discharge and COD emission amounts by, for example, conducting reviews of our production processes and optimizing the operation methods at our effluent treatment facilities.

The amount of waste generated by the Group in fiscal 2019 amounted to 19,401 tons, a decrease of 2,257 tons compared with the previous fiscal year. The waste generation per unit for DKS on a non-consolidated basis improved 1.0% (decreased) compared with the previous fiscal year, achieving our target. The recycling rate was 89.7%, which marked a 0.8-percentage-point worsening (decrease) compared with the previous fiscal year. The final disposal amount was

948 tons, a decrease of 96 tons compared with the previous fiscal year. One contributory factor was that part of the sludge generated at the wastewater treatment facility is being recycled. The final disposal rate was 4.9%, a worsening (an increase) of 0.1 percentage point compared with the previous fiscal year. In the year ahead, we will move ahead with a review of our sludge recycling and work to reduce the final disposal amount.

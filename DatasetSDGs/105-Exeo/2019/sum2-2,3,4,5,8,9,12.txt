 Providing the environment for work style reforms and productivity improvement
Responding to food safety and food loss issues
Japan now faces various difficult situations such
as a reduction in the productive-age population
resulting from the declining birthrate and aging
population, the simultaneous pursuit of raising
children or taking care of the elderly and work
style diversification. To address such difficult circumstances, we provide an environment that helps the interested parties to mitigate long working hours and improve operational efficiency.
Providing an ICT environment for high-quality education
Realizing an ICT environment in the field of education has become an urgent task because the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology will introduce computer programming as a compulsory subject effective from 2020. We provide an environment for everyone to receive affordable, quality ICT education regardless of gender.

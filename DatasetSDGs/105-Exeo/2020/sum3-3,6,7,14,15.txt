Reducing hazardous chemical substances, as well as mitigating air, water and soil pollution
Focusing attention on “water,” an essential element for our lives, and the “waste” produced from our lives, we engage in the construction and operation of water treatment facilities for domestic and industrial wastewater and waste treatment facilities. Through the business, we strive to reduce the discharge of hazardous chemical substances, as well as the pollution of air, water and soil.
    Avoiding adverse effects on marine and coastal ecosystems
We have contributed considerably to constructing a social infrastructure of a new era utilizing our long-cultivated underground civil engineering technology.
An example in this area is the horizontal directional drilling of submarine telecommu- nications/power cables, which can bypass a long distance of seabed at places such as fishing grounds and coral reef sanctuaries, preventing damage caused by pipes or ca- bles.

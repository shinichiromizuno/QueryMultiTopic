  Employee Relations“Policy of Regarding Employees as the Group’s Primary Properties” and “Workstyle Reforms” for Sustainable Growth
 Kazunori Yuasa
Operating Officer and General Manager, Human Resources Department
Employees are an invaluable asset. The KYOWA EXEO Group has adopted the “policy of regarding employees as the Group’s primary properties” as its basic phi- losophy on human resources, and pursues affluence for both its employees and the company through respect for human rights, fair evaluations and treatment, and being thorough in its human resource development and professionalism.
We believe that a workplace environment in which we can secure and develop excellent human resources and in which everyone can work with enthusiasm to demonstrate their full potential is essential for sustainable growth in the future. Ac- cordingly, we are working on “workstyle reforms,” including changing our attitudes toward workstyles, reforming rules, and promoting diversity.Respect for Human Rights
In promoting corporate activities, the KYOWA EXEO Group places great importance on respect for human rights and conducts training to raise and improve human rights awareness in order to provide a workplace environ- ment in which each and every employee can work with vi- tality. In addition, through training and other activities to promote compliance, we show that we do not tolerate any kind of discriminatory treatment on gender, beliefs, nation- ality, status of disability, sexual orientation or other basic human rights, and we strongly urge respect for the dignity and individuality of individuals.
childbirth, and nursing care, and these systems provide opportunities for diverse work styles. These efforts are helping to secure our technological capabilities for the fu- ture and ensure that we are able to pass on our skills.
Hiring Foreign Nationals
In order to promote global business, especially in the Asian region, and to internationalize and invigorate the company, we are actively hiring foreign students who are expected to be active both in Japan and abroad.
Changing Attitudes toward Workstyles / Reforming Rules
With the aim of proper management of working hours and making improvements to long working hours, labor repre- sentatives and top management have issued a joint decla- ration and are working on reforms to comply with labor- related laws and regulations, promote flexible work styles, improve operational efficiency across the organization, and maintain and promote physical and mental health such as by raising employee awareness and implementing specific measures. We are also working to realize diverse and flexi- ble work styles through means such as the establishment of a regional key position system (a system for regional limited employees) and a teleworking system.
Furthermore, we are developing and promoting novel ways of working that incorporate the new lifestyles and new working styles recommended by the Japanese gov- ernment. Along with the promotion of workstyle reforms through digital transformation (DX), we are taking the fol- lowing measures to help teleworking take root: (1) review of operations (business inventory, business evaluation, etc.), (2) improvement of the environment (PC, work envi- ronment, etc.), and (3) enhancement of systems (review of commuting styles, safety considerations for employees at high risk of contracting COVID-19, etc.). Through these ef- forts, we are striving to create a work environment where everyone can work with a peace of mind and enthusiasm.

Group Company RelationsAiming for a Functionally Effective Team EXEO
 Yuichi Koyama
Director and Managing Operating Officer, General Manager, Group Business Development Division
In order to maximize the value of the KYOWA EXEO Group, we consider it a top priority issue to spread the Group’s corporate philosophy, ensure that Group companies function efficiently together, and build a Team EXEO that allows the employees of each company to do their jobs with a sense of ful- fillment, and are working on a variety of measures to that end. As part of our efforts, we are responding to the expansion of new businesses while pro- moting the reorganization of Group companies to improve quality and effi- ciency, as well as ensuring financial strength. Going forward, we will continue to promote a variety of measures for the entire Group.
For the Evolving Team EXEO
Our top priority issue is to build a new Team EXEO where all employees of the KYOWA EXEO Group companies, who contribute to improving the value of the Group on a daily basis, can perform their jobs with a sense of fulfill- ment.
In addition to taking on new business challenges and responding to changes in business conditions, we will also work on new Group issues, such as workstyle reforms and diversity promotion, as well as promoting the development of human resources for the future of Team EXEO.
The Role of Group Companies within Team EXEO
We have a high level of expertise in our 122 Group com- panies (88 consolidated subsidiaries, 15 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 1 9 affiliates), including overseas compa- nies, and we strive to respond to the various needs of our customers with the capabilities of the entire Group while enhancing the strengths of each company.
Building a Strong Team EXEO
Based on the Group’s common operational measures, in addition to playing the role of a “go-between” for spread- ing the excellent initiatives of our Group companies, we will further promote the establishment of a strong Team EXEO that takes on the challenge of new businesses and responds to changes.

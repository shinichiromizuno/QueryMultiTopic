 Business Partner RelationsAiming for Further Win-Win Relationships with Our Business Partners
In order for the KYOWA EXEO Group to provide its customers with high quality deliverables (products) without delay, it is essential to work with both construction companies and material procurement companies that deliver materials in a timely manner. In order to maintain a relationship of trust with contact persons at our business partner companies and to facilitate smooth business operations, we will provide a forum for delivering information and business proposals, as well as exchanging opinions, with the aim of achiev- ing creative mutual prosperity.

Green Procurement Initiatives
We have been promoting the introduction of eco-friendly vehicles. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have been selecting manufacturers with environmental conser- vation in mind, such as in response to fuel shortages dur- ing emergencies and in reducing CO2 emissions.
We will also add eco-friendly vehicles to our lineup of construction vehicles to further increase the introduction rate of eco-friendly vehicles.
The KYOWA EXEO Group has been working on green procurement since 2007 in accordance with the Green Procurement Guidelines, and is striving to purchase envi- ronmentally friendly products that have acquired the Eco Mark, GPN listing, the Act on Promoting Green Procure- ment and other such marks.
In addition, due to the large number of PCs ordered, we have been recommending the use of environmentally friendly PCs since fiscal 2017, and in fiscal 2018, almost all of our internal PCs became eco-certified models.
Going forward, in addition to PCs, the entire Group will continue to actively pursue the purchase of eco-friendly products.

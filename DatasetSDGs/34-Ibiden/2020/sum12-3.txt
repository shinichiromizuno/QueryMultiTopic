Contributing to the realization of society capable of dealing with viruses well

To achieve the SDG of “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,” it is important to build a society that is well prepared to deal with infectious diseases.

In the IBIDEN Group, antiviral melamine decorative laminates of the Housing Materials Operation have been used for the walls of various buildings and structures. However, how to address virus infection risks in existing buildings and structure have remained a challenge for us.
To resolve this issue, we developed an antiviral coating material which can be used for existing facilities and has an immediate and enduring effect and durability. Recently, measures for reducing the risk of virus infections and risk control for
food sanitation are increasingly in demand, and the IBIDEN Group will continue to commit itself to developing technologies that will help create safer and reliable clean spaces.

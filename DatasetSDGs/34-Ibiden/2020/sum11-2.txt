Contribution to the realization of a society where everyone can have access to better nutrition

One of the SDGs is “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.”

IBIDEN has been looking into the potential of plant protein to contribute to improved nutrition and sustainable production for people around the world. As a part of these efforts, our DPF operation successfully developed an alternative meat made of soy protein whose texture and flavor closely resembles those of real meat by applying IBIDEN’s high-precision molding technology that we have fostered over the years.
Aiming for the provision of safe and reliable foods
We are developing food products in cooperation with IBIDEN Bussan Co., Ltd. a company specializing in food processing that has already adopted a sanitation operating procedure based on HACCP principles, in order to deliver safe and reliable products to consumers.

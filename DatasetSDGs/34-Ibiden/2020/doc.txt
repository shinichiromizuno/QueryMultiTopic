We aim to achieve sustainable corporate growth by responding to changes in the business environment.
IBIDEN’s DNA that Has Overcome Countless Adversities
Progress in our Medium-Term Management Plan “To The Next Stage 110 Plan”
We would like to express our deepest condolence to those who passed away from natural disasters and COVID-19 around the world. We also express our heartfelt sympathies to those who suffered from the disaster and are still being treated for the disease. We also express our heartfelt respect to those who are still committed to recovery around the world and to those who support healthcare operations amid the ongoing vigilance against COVID-19.
Our living environment is undergoing a major transformation amid rapid advances in digital technologies such as ICT and 5G. On the other hand, in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, a variety of measures are being taken in daily life by making full use of technology to establish social connections while maintaining physical distance between people.
Teleworking is advancing rapidly in companies, and the phrase “new daily life” has become popular.
Today, we face an era that can be called a turning point in history. We cannot survive the coming era in the same way as before. The key is the ability of each company to rethink its respective strengths and uniqueness and survive amid the changing times.
Looking back on history, IBIDEN was established in 1912 as a hydroelectric power plant company named Ibigawa Electric Power Co., Ltd., and it has since changed its business structure according to changes in the times in order to overcome many adversities such as the period during and after the war, high economic growth, the oil crisis, and collapse of the bubble economy. At our foundation lies IBIDEN’s DNA to “create what will be needed by the society in the future based on core technologies.” It is this DNA of IBIDEN that I am more keenly aware of amid the crisis currently confronting society than ever before.
The Group is working on a five-year medium-term management plan, “To The Next Stage 110 Plan” for overcoming changing environment and moving onto the next stage by developing new operations toward the next generation, while strengthening the competitiveness of existing operations nurtured by our predecessors. Under the medium-term management plan, in addition to steady growth in existing businesses such as Electronics and Ceramics Operations, we are building a well-balanced business portfolio by accumulating new businesses as new revenue sources. At the initial stage of the plan, we targeted net sales of ¥430 billion, operating income of ¥45 billion, and an operating income ratio of 10.5% in FY2022, the last fiscal year of the plan. With regard to sales, despite the impact of COVID-19 and changes in the market environment, we will not change our operating income target for the final year of the plan, with our target performance indicators of ¥400 billion
in net sales, ¥45 billion in operating income, and an operating income ratio of 11.3%, as we intend to shift to highly profitable, high-value-added products against the backdrop of high competitiveness.
Our target performance indicators for FY2019, the second year of the medium-term management plan, were net sales of ¥300 billion, operating income of ¥17 billion, and an operating income ratio of 5.7%. Despite a deterioration of economic environment, including slowdown in the Chinese economy due to trade issues between the U.S. and China, and the impact of COVID-19 at the end of the fiscal year, steady growth in new markets in the Electronics Operation, particularly the server market for data centers, resulted in net sales of ¥295.9 billion, approximately the same level as the target, while operating income was ¥19.6 billion and the operating income ratio was 6.7%, exceeding the target.

Main operations that have responded to changes in the external environment
Our mainstay businesses are the Electronics and Ceramics Operations. In FY2019, the Electronics Operations accounted for 44.7% of net sales of ¥295.9 billion, at ¥132.1 billion, and the Ceramics Operation accounted for 29.9% at ¥88.4 billion.
Among these two operations, changes in the environment related to the Electronics Operation are particularly rapid, and we have faced various changes in our history up to the present day. First, with the full-scale popularization of personal computers in the 1990s, we grew significantly, centered on IC package substrates (PKG) for personal computers. Since the 2000s, we have been riding the wave of rapid growth in demand for mobile phones and smartphones, which have dramatically changed our lifestyles, and we achieved further growth by increasing sales of thin compact package substrates (CSP) and motherboard printed wiring boards (PWB). In the 2010s, however, the personal computer market shrank and the smartphone market became increasingly commoditized, resulting in a contraction of the entire Electronics Operation, which was our main market. Demand for high-end smartphones is currently continuing to decline. However, due to the impact of infectious diseases this year, the field of ICT utilization is rapidly expanding, including the promotion of teleworking by companies, the introduction of ICT to school education, and remote diagnosis in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we expect demand for more sophisticated and finer electronic components to expand in the data center market due to the launch of 5G services and advances in ICT. In addition, demand for automotive image analysis and other products is expected to grow.
In the Ceramics Operation, in order to respond to environmental issues triggered by automobile exhaust gas regulations, demand for DPF has risen in developed countries mainly in Europe, since the 2000s and has grown into the second pillar. To meet strong demand globally, we have established supply structures in Japan, Hungary, France, and Mexico. In recent years, however, there have been changes in the market environment, including a shift toward EVs and a shift away from diesel vehicles.

 Electronics Operation Looking Ahead to Growth with Unprecedented Investment
I would like to explain our growth strategies in more detail for these two main operations in response to the changes in the environment they face.
In the Electronics Operation, demand for high- function IC package substrates is expected to rise due to the full-scale spread of 5G, increased data processing volumes accompanying the advancement of ICT, and automotive image analysis. In response to this growing demand, we decided to invest a total of ¥70 billion in the Ogaki Central Plant and Ogaki Plant in FY2018 (phase one investment) in order to improve the production capacity of high-function IC package substrates. Furthermore, in April of this year, we decided to invest ¥60 billion in the Ogaki Central Plant (2nd Building) as the phase two investment in order to renew production facilities and increase capacity in anticipation of next-generation technology responses in addition to meeting demand for high-function IC package substrates. The reason we were able to decide on these investments is that we have made progress in restructuring our businesses, which enabled us to stop unprofitable operations and allocate resources to growth fields, and that we are strategically sharing our future roadmaps with our customers on the back of our advanced technological capabilities.
Until two years ago, the Electronics Operation consisted primarily of three operations: PKG, CSP and PWB. However, we decided to reduce CSP, which is not expected to generate future earnings, allocated personnel and capital expenditures to PKG in anticipation of the full-scale arrival of the 5G era, and realigned resources into markets with growth potential. We established a new structure with the two Operations of PKG and MLB. As a result, I feel that we are now ready to speed up information sharing and decision-making for future business development and to respond swiftly to changes.
Technologies required for high-function IC package substrates are particularly difficult, including multi- layering, refined wiring, and miniaturization, and only a few companies globally can respond to this technology. Although the technical difficulty demanded by our customers is extremely high, we have determined that we can control it through our
accumulated technological capabilities. Investment in high-function IC packages is an unprecedented scale, totaling ¥130 billion. We intend to seize the wave of demand to ensure stable growth in the Electronics Operation.
We will continue to boldly restructure our businesses and proactively invest in growth fields. In FY2022, we expect net sales in the Electronics Operation to increase by ¥20 billion to ¥220 billion, compared with net sales of ¥200 billion at the beginning of the medium-term management plan.
Ceramics Operation Capturing Demand in Emerging Countries
In the DPF operation, which is the mainstay of the Ceramics Operation, in order to respond to changes in the business environment, such as a shift toward EVs and a shift away from diesel mainly in Europe, we announced the dissolution of our DPF production plant in France, which is one of our production bases, in FY2018, and we have reorganized our global supply system by consolidating it into our plant in Hungary for Europe. Against this backdrop, due to the spreading impact of COVID-19, which followed slowing growth in the global automobile market, it is unavoidable for sales of our products for the conventional passenger vehicle market to decline. On the other hand, in emerging countries, regulations on the environment will become more stringent in the future, including stricter exhaust gas regulations that will begin this year. In addition to rising demand for automobiles due to population growth, the use of heavy commercial vehicles (HD) and construction machinery is expected to increase for the purpose of development. In the heavy commercial vehicle market in North America and emerging countries, we will steadily capture demand mainly at our plants in Mexico. In this way, we will continue to maintain an optimal and efficient production structure in the three regions of Japan, Hungary, and Mexico so that we will increase global productivity and cost competitiveness to rebuild our business into one that can generate stable revenues in the medium term.
Furthermore, in response to the continuing trend
toward tighter environmental regulations in the automobile market, we decided to establish a new production base for substrate holding mat whose demand is expected, in the Chinese market, the world’s largest automobile market. The aim is to increase production capacity for high-function substrate holding mat and to strengthen customer support. Operations are scheduled to begin in the first half of FY2021. By proactively making capital investment in markets and fields where demand is expected to grow, we will put the Ceramics Operation as a whole on a stable growth track.
In response to the changing market, we will secure a certain level of profits although we expect net sales for FY2022 for the Ceramics Operation to decrease by ¥30 billion to net sales of ¥90 billion, compared with net sales of ¥120 billion at the beginning of the medium-term management plan, by continuing to select and concentrate on businesses in the future, including reorganizing the DPF production structure and establishing production bases for substrate holding mat.
New Businesses Contributing to Solving Social Issues
At the foundation of our operations lies IBIDEN’s DNA to “create what will be needed by the society in the future based on core technologies.” In FY2017, we established four development centers within the R&D Operation in order to solve social problems and meet customer needs using existing core technologies. Each of the four centers has been engaged in R&D to realize its aspirations of “making the air on the Earth cleaner” and “extending the healthy life expectancy of people.” As a result of R&D for three years, we have reached the stage to set a certain level of target for commercialization. Accordingly, we dissolved four development centers as of the end of FY2019.
One of the product commercialization initiatives is a product called “alternative meat” developed mainly by the Biomaterial Product Development Team, which realizes the flavor and texture of animal protein using vegetable protein such as soybeans. We have developed the product to resolve the future food crisis

   caused by the global population increase, but we believe that the time for full-scale market launch will come soon. We have also developed products for hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles to solve environmental and energy issues. We have launched an in-house project, and are now finalizing our commercialization efforts together with the wisdom of DENSO CORPORATION, with which we executed a capital and business alliance agreement.
In addition, measures to reduce the risk of infections and risk management related to food hygiene are increasingly required. The Group is working on technological development to realize safer and more secure hygiene spaces. Originally within the Group, IBI-BOARD Viruhael antiviral melamine decorative laminate was launched in 2015. However, its introduction was limited to new construction and renovation, and how to apply antiviral measures to existing facilities was a challenge. Against this backdrop, we have developed antiviral coating materials and sprays to combat the risk of infectious diseases, which can be used at existing facilities and offers immediacy, sustainability, and durability. These products can be used in a variety of existing facilities, including food facilities, medical and welfare facilities, and school education facilities, and contribute to the realization of safer and more secure health spaces. Going forward, we will continue to conduct research on how to use the technologies and products that our Group has fostered so that people can distance themselves as far as possible from the threat of viruses.
In addition, we are developing advanced ceramics products that contribute to improving the fuel efficiency of aircraft. We will continue to create products that help resolve social issues by leveraging IBIDEN’s core technologies.
Development of Human Resources Rich in Diversity
We have evolved our core technologies and created new businesses, from IBIDEN’s first business of hydroelectric power generation, to the electrochemical business with the aim of rational utilization of electricity, to the current mainstay of the Electronics and Ceramics Operations. The mindset fostered with the awareness that people are the foundation of supporting technology and business, and that each of
us must take on new challenges and continue changing in order to survive, has supported our technological transformations in the past.
The development of human resources who will support sustainable growth in the future is indispensable for us. In Japan, however, the working population is declining due to the declining birthrate and aging population. We have been aware of this issue from an early stage, and as we promote work style reform, we have been promoting “Good JC activities” to enhance employee motivation by encouraging communications within the organization and thus working more efficiently. This is an abbreviation for Good Job with Good Communication, and is an activity to do good work from good communications. All employees are taking on the challenge of improving operational efficiency and quality by reviewing operations from their purposes and objectives and changing the way of utilizing and developing IT tools. In particular, the general affairs and financial departments, which are called functional departments, have actually achieved tangible results, such as greater efficiency in day-to- day operations and settlement operations, and a significant improvement in operational efficiency. In addition, employee awareness surveys have shown that employees’ motivation is enhanced by allowing them to work on higher-value jobs using time spared by more efficient time utilization.
The Company aims to realize a work environment and climate in which diverse human resources can exercise their individual abilities and can feel reasons for living and job satisfaction amidst a trend of advancing globalization and diversification of values. Since FY2010, we have been pursuing activities to promote women’s active participation in the workplace, in which we have sought to create a working environment that is easy for women to work in while valuing work-life balance. In addition to the improvement of the work-life balance support system and training, etc., we are also promoting the Act on Promotion for Women’s Empowerment, a training program for female employees selected from each department and their immediate supervisors. We are reforming the awareness of workplaces, including the supervisors of female employees, and supporting the development and promotion of female employees at the junior manager level. The ratio of female managers, who will be the backbone of IBIDEN in the future, is gradually increasing. We will continue these
activities with the aim of further empowering female employees. We established IBIDEN Oasis Co., Ltd. to promote employment of people with disabilities so that even more people can play an active role. In April 2019, the company acquired certification as a special subsidiary company. Through hiring of persons with disabilities who are eager to work in a stable manner, we aim to enable their professional independence through ability development. We are also promoting the development of workplaces where senior employees with extensive experience and overseas human resources can play an active role. We intend to continue to create an environment where the IBIDEN Group can maximize its strengths while respecting each individual’s lifestyles, abilities, and working styles.
Promoting ESG Management to Enhance Reliability and Transparency
Our corporate philosophy is to contribute to harmony with the natural environment and also to the progression of an affluent society. We promote ESG management based on the belief that solving social issues through business activities leads to the building of a sustainable society. Since its foundation, IBIDEN has been incorporating hydroelectric power and other clean energy and conducting operations that contribute to solving social issues through its products. The reduction of the environmental burden in the manufacturing processes is in response to the requests of our customers and codes of conduct determined by industry associations, but it is without doubt that our awareness of the environment which we valued since our foundation enabled us to respond to these requests and demands. Our Group’s efforts, which have been accumulated since the past, have been highly evaluated by ESG evaluation organizations. We will continue to disclose information in good faith, including disclosing environmental policies in response to TCFD recommendations, so that everyone can correctly understand our activities.
Currently, SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the United Nations is being accepted widely in society, but we believe that contributing to SDGs is synonymous with implementing our corporate philosophy. In addition to the environmental aspect, we are contributing to SDGs in a variety of ways through our corporate activities, such as promoting diversity that utilizes a diverse human resources. We will continue to contribute to the realization of an affluent society through the products and corporate activities created by our core technologies.
As we advance ESG management, we are focusing particularly on strengthening our corporate governance system in order to enhance the reliability and transparency of management. In 2017, we transitioned to a Company with Audit and Supervisory Committee with the aim of streamlining management and accelerating decision-making. Furthermore, on April 1, 2020, we implemented changes to our executive system, including the elimination of corporate officers and reduction in the number of executives. This is attributable to the Company’s goal
of accelerating decision-making and execution by establishing a governance system that is one step higher in order to respond to the rapidly changing business environment surrounding the Electronics and Ceramics Operations. We have established a system that can respond more quickly to changes in the external environment, so that we are able to appoint personnel with extremely high levels of expertise and new competitiveness as executives. Going forward, we will continue to review our governance system and aim for sustainable growth.
Toward Improving Shareholder Value
With the aim of achieving further growth, in terms of investment, we decided to make a large-scale investment totaling ¥130 billion in the Electronics Operation and also to construct a new production base in China for the Ceramics Operation, which will be our third production base in China. By making the largest-ever investment, free cash flow will temporarily turn negative in FY2020, but from FY2021 onward we plan to achieve positive results by expanding operating cash flow. In addition, we are making steady progress in large-scale investments in IC package substrates in order to achieve profit levels as planned, achieve ROE commensurate with the cost of capital, restore our financial position from the perspective of the equity ratio, and further strengthen our financial structure. Our goal for the ratio of R&D expenditures is at least 5% of net sales, and we will maintain our efforts to create products that will serve as the pillars of the next generation. In terms of capital allocation, for the time being we will prioritize large- scale investments for IC package substrates, but we also maintain our policy of paying stable dividends.
As digital transformation has brought about a new era in the living environment and markets, the unknown virus called COVID-19 has hit us, and there have been major changes in our lifestyle as we have known so far. However, IBIDEN has continued to evolve in response to these changes. I believe that this is precisely the time when the entire IBIDEN Group will work together to confront this challenge by bringing together diverse wisdom and responding to change based on the core technologies that we have built up since our foundation. And in the future, unpredictable events that exceed the current one may hit us. We will return to IBIDEN’s DNA so that we can overcome difficulties even in such times, and strive to create products needed by society and to benefit everyone. We would like to ask shareholders and investors for continued support of the Group going forward.

Human resources are the sources of IBIDEN’s 100 years of history and also what will build the next century of our development. The Company has established human resource training systems in an effort to develop the human resources necessary to accurately grasp changes in the business environment and create new products and technologies.
We implement standardized education across the Company (stratified training programs by age group and by job grade) and provide specialized education for selected personnel based on our basic education and training structure. The training programs by age group were completely revised from life plan-based training to career plan-based training in line with changes in our times such as the extension of the mandatory retirement age to 65, while in specialized education, we opened the Human Resource Development Center in 2017. We also focus on the development of personnel who can flourish globally by promoting not only foreign language but also cross-cultural communication training programs.
Creation of Environment in which Diverse Employees Can Play Active Roles
Our Group aims to realize a work environment and climate in which diverse human resources can exercise their individual abilities and can feel reasons for living and job satisfaction amidst a trend of advancing globalization and diversification of values.
    Productivity Improvement and IT Utilization
IBIDEN regards productivity improvement activities as opportunities for human resource development and has been focusing on having employees master how to do the work with a kaizen (continuous improvement) mind. Instead of pursuing the results of activities, we started from solving problems faced by employees in everyday routine work. We review their operations thoroughly including their objectives and purposes, improve work flow in ways that can generate satisfactory results naturally and efficiently, and proactively introduce IT including RPA to prevent a return to previous conditions. In addition, since these efforts have been carried out across the Company, improvements in cooperation with other departments have been made easily, and as a result, work quality in pursuit of overall optimization has also improved.
Robotic Process Automation: Automation of work processes by robots
Thorough Work Hour Management
In Japan, work style reforms have been promoted and, as a part of the reforms, rectifying the practice of long work hours has become one of the important issues to be addressed. Even though laws and regulations relating to work hours have been tightened, mental illness and occupational accidents caused by long work hours have become a serious problem, and companies are being asked to further efforts to rectify the practice.
IBIDEN and its Group companies in Japan set a goal of reducing the average annual work hours per employee to less than 2,000 hours.
Female Advancement
The Company launched an initiative called Act on Promotion for Women’s Empowerment in FY2017, and has been promoting activities to achieve the goal of having at least five female managers (in Manager or higher-level positions).
Thanks to these efforts, the number of female managers and candidates is steadily increasing.
Division manager level 0 1
Middle manager level 2 1
Junior manager level 11 14
Senior Employees Playing Active Roles
Due to an increase in senior employees and changes in the social environment in Japan, discussions between labor and management were held and through these discussions, we introduced an extension to the mandatory retirement age system from FY2020.
For the treatment of senior employees, we established a reward system based on the employees’ roles and achievements to keep them motivated and make full use of their expertise and worksite skills fostered over the years.
Skill Development for Persons with Disabilities
In April 2019, IBIDEN OASIS Co., Ltd. was certified as a special subsidiary company, and entered business. In addition to its basic operations of environmental maintenance in IBIDEN Group plants, the company received orders for data input, business card creation, and enclosing documents and advertising fliers in envelopes in an effort to develop new skills.
Respect for Human Rights
The IBIDEN Group clarifies in the IBIDEN Standards for Employee Behavior our respect for the basic rights of workers as internationally declared and that we will not aid in the infringement of human rights including the use of any form of forced or involuntary labor or child labor.
We provide training on fair employment and human rights to those in charge of labor affairs management as well as staff members and managers in charge of hiring while striving to keep all employees well-informed on workers’ rights through

Acquisition of Childcare Leave by Male Employees
Due to the efforts we made to enhance and promote the work- life balance support system, more male employees are proactively participating in child rearing and becoming aware of the importance of the balance between work and personal life. As a result, the number of male employees taking childcare leave significantly increased in FY2019.
Retention of Junior Employees
We established a mentor system in which senior members in the workplace support new employees so that they will not feel isolated in their assigned workplaces.
New employees appoint their own mentors after a preparatory period, and the mentors support their mentees for one year, for example, providing advice and assistance with work and their specialized fields and helping the mentees cooperate with other departments.
Development of Non-Japanese Employees
We decided to accept a total of 200 employees from IBIDEN Philippines, Inc., an IBIDEN overseas Group company, as technical interns.
Learning state-of-the-art technologies in Japan and bringing the know-how to the Philippines will enable the interns to upgrade technical levels of their company.
Introduction Value Creation ESG Management
Financial and Corporate Data
   Based on this goal, presidents of Operations established their policies on work hours and heads of departments set their targets, and are tracking progress toward those targets. Measures to encourage employees to take annual paid holidays and reduce overtime are also being taken.
As a result of these measures, labor management has become more complicated. To make managers better able to handle the complex labor management processes, we provide them with necessary training and make sure that all of them understand the processes.
our Standards for Employee Behavior.
In Japan, we provide managers and employees with human
rights-related training programs in efforts to prevent any form of abuse of power. Our manager training programs teach participants things they should know and practice as managers, including daily communication skills, responses when being consulted by staff members and the handling of information.

IBIDEN Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2020 34


We conduct the health and safety activity done with all concerned people under IBIDEN WAY, and aim to harmonize “health and safety” and “operation” with the fundamental rule to minimize the risk that may affect the life and health of person participating to IBIDEN’s operations.
Strengthening Activity for Zero Occupational Accidents
We are working on occupational health and safety activities so that all employees of the entire IBIDEN Group can establish safe and comfortable workplaces and work vigorously with an awareness of “safety first” by putting in place pillars of activities: “zero recurrence of occupational accidents” and “accident/incident prevention”.
The occupational accident frequency rate of the Company and group companies in Japan stands at 0.82, which is lower than the national average of manufacturing companies. However, because the number of work-related accidents in the Company increased, we are striving to strengthen management with the aim of preventing recurrence of similar accidents by analyzing what caused them and putting in place fundamental measures for prevention.
Promoting Health and Productivity Management 1
The Group believes that the physical and mental health of each and every employee constitutes the basis for supporting the Group’s competitiveness, and actively helps employees maintain good health.
As a promoting structure, we have organized the “IBIDEN Group Health Subcommittee,” mainly with representatives from the Health Management Promotion Center (industrial physicians, public health Nurses), Human Resources, Environment & Safety, IBIDEN Health Insurance Society, and IBIDEN Labor Union.

As measures to support employees’ mental health, the employees, workplaces, the Health Management Promotion Center, and Human Resources respectively play their roles, and use external resources for the prevention and treatment of mental health issues.
Acquired Recognition for “the Certified Health & Productivity
Management Outstanding Organization – White 500”
We were again certified as the Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organization for 2020. In the program, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Nippon Kenko Kaigi recognize outstanding enterprises engaging in efforts for health and productivity management.
Our activities to encourage employees to get into the habit of exercising by joining walking events, etc. and the excellent support system of our Health Management Promotion Center were highly evaluated.

We will strive to develop IBIDEN into a company trusted by the international community by harnessing our corporate strengths to engage in activities, including the creation of a better living environment and fostering of local human resources and carrying out activities as a global corporate citizen suitable for the culture and climate of each country and region such as participating in and supporting activities conducted by organizations engaged in such initiatives.

Protection of the Global Environment through
“IBIDEN’s Forest” Activity
In FY2008, we embarked on a forest building initiative as part of our global environmental protection activities. This activity takes place chiefly in Higashi-Yokoyama, the place where IBIDEN was founded, and where the Company operates its initial hydroelectric power generation business.
Business activities of our Group are receiving the blessings of nature such as the stable supply of water resources while having an impact on biodiversity at the same time. In consideration of this, we will continue our efforts for the conservation of biodiversity through activities to conserve the forests.
In these activities, we also work together with organizations outside of the Company including local municipal governments, and we participate in the Japan Business and Biodiversity Partnership promoted by Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) and other organizations for information sharing.

Community Support through a Scholarship
Program in the Philippines
IBIDEN Philippines, Inc. has been providing a scholarship program in cooperation with the country’s high schools for high school students from poor families as part of its educational support activities throughout the year by collecting voluntary donations from our employees since FY2009.
142 employees’ donations helped 222 students in FY2019.

We conduct the environmental load reduction activity with all concerned people under IBIDEN way, aim “Harmony with nature” by reducing the bad effect on global environment generated in our business operation, and fulfill the role as enduring company.

Energy (climate change):
Aim for zero CO2 emissions with the energy conservation and the use of renewable energy, and business contributions.
Blessing of water:
Value the blessing of water and reduce the impact on water resources to the minimum.
Waste (resources):
Reduce waste by minimizing the use of resources and maximizing recycling.
Chemical substances:
Thoroughly control chemical substances contained in raw materials on a global basis.

TOPICS
Action to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
In August 2020, we announced our support for the recommendations of the TCFD. To achieve sustainable growth, we will appropriately assess our climate-related risks and opportunities, clarify their impact on our business operations and necessary measures, and actively disclose such information to a wide range of stakeholders, including investors.

To promote environmental activities including responses to climate change, we established a company- wide Environment Committee chaired by the director in charge of Corporate Strategic Manufacturing Operation who is in charge of company-wide environment, health and safety matters. The Environment Committee has assumed control of the practice of environmental activities.

We recognize highly important business risks and opportunities to be brought about by climate change and continue to respond to them under the Medium-Term Management Plan.
Refer to page 18 for details of the changes in the business environment and our responses to risks.
We plan to verify the impacts to be brought about on our Company’s operations as well as our strategies and goals by using scenario analysis and other methods.

In the company-wide risk management process, we analyze a wide variety of risks surrounding management and addresses items that will seriously impact our business.
A company-wide Risk Management Committee chaired by the President & CEO is held annually.

Under our current Medium-Term Management Plan, we have been working on the reduction of GHG emissions per production volume. Furthermore, we will set a goal for further contributions to the reduction of GHG emissions in the medium-to-long term perspective.

ESG ManagementActions to Climate Change Issues
 We regard the acceleration of climate change as one of the risks surrounding our Company. Therefore, with the aim of achieving the goal of zero GHG emissions by 2050, we have been promoting activities with four pillars including the use of hydroelectric power generation which utilizes the blessing of water passed down from our ancestors.
Resource Circulating Activities
1. Use of Blessings from Our Ancestors with Hydroelectric Power Generation
Hydraulic power generation is clean energy without greenhouse gas emissions. IBIDEN has owned and operated hydraulic power generation plants since our foundation, and currently operates three facilities located at the upstream section of Ibigawa River in Gifu Prefecture (27,900kW in total. Power generation capacity updating was completed by 2015).
3. Low Carbon Energy Use by In-house Power Generation
IBIDEN installed a highly energy efficient in-house power generation gas engine cogeneration system to generate low carbon energy. In fiscal year 2019, we installed the latest cogeneration equipment to promote energy conservation, and worked to strengthen our BCP. These initiatives were highly appreciated by the Advanced Cogeneration and Energy Utilization Center JAPAN (ACEJ) , and we were granted the grand prize of the Cogeneration Award by ACEJ.
Moreover, we install solar power generation equipment in each plant to generate renewable energy. In the future, we aim to establish a system whereby each plant is connected to our own power grid so that privately generated electricity can be optimally supplied in accordance with demand between each plant.
ACEJ Website: https://www.ace.or.jp/web/gp/gp_0010.html
4. Contribution to Expansion of the Renewable
Energy Market by the Power Generation Business
Our Group company, IBIDEN Engineering Co., Ltd. specializes in business in the energy solution field.
Through an integrated approach, in which its business includes design proposal, construction and maintenance, IBIDEN Engineering has a track record in many power generation projects ranging from equipment for hydroelectric power plants and power substations to systems for solar power generation plants and small hydroelectric power plants.
We will continue to promote business solutions for energy problems within and beyond the Group.
Water floating solar power generation plant (Certificated output:1.99MW)
IBIDEN believes that it is an important responsibility of businesses to make effective use of the world’s scarce resources and to take part in a global effort to conserve resources. We promote the so-called 3R activity, which consists of initiatives to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle the resources we consume. In doing so, we aim to improve the resources efficiency.
Currently, each plant and Group companies are working on sorting out and recycling wastes. Together with improved production efficiency, we set a goal of reducing the waste basic unit per production volume by 5% in our Medium-Term Management Plan.
Chemical Control
Compliance with Laws and Regulations related to Substances Contained in Products and Chemical Substances in the Manufacturing Process and Management of the Work Environment
A variety of chemical substances are used in the manufacturing process in the Group. They may cause environmental pollution or pose health hazards to humans. It is a great responsibility for businesses to properly manage chemical substances to secure product safety, reduce environmental burdens, and promote occupational safety.
Regarding chemical substances, the laws and regulations of each country, including the REACH Regulations and the RoHS Directive, as well as the standards demanded by our customers, are becoming increasingly stringent. To prevent risks caused by chemical substances, we are working to properly manage chemical substances throughout the entire supply chain by identifying substances whose use should be eliminated or reduced in the Green Procurement Guidelines.
A large amount of water resources is used in the manufacturing process of electronic products, particularly for cleansing. Ogaki City in Gifu Prefecture, where our domestic production bases are concentrated, is rich in underground water thanks to the Ibigawa River system. However, water shortages are a serious problem in the world today.

2. Energy Use Reduction with Energy Efficient Technologies
The IBIDEN Group consumes a large amount of energy in its production activities, including energy uses for temperature control in the manufacturing process in the Electronics Operation and electric furnaces for the Ceramics Operation.
Therefore, we set targets, monitor energy use company- wide, and conduct improvement activities to realize an energy efficient production process.
GHG Emissions Reduction Target
FY2018-FY2022 (Medium-Term Management Plan)
Aiming to reduce the basic unit per converted production volume by 5% compared to FY2017.
We will continue to set emission reduction targets in coordination with future medium-to-long term growth strategies.
Blessing of water
1) Initiatives for Laws and Regulations related to Chemical Substances
Although some chemical substances used in the ceramic business fall under the category of substances whose inclusion in products is restricted under the EU REACH Regulations, we completely replaced them with alternative substances in fiscal 2018.
Additionally, in Japan, according to the country’s basic plan, equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and PCB waste must be controlled. The IBIDEN Group has been taking action in a planned manner by setting deadlines earlier.
2) Considerations on the Health of Employees with regard to Chemical Substances
To ensure the health and safety of our employees, we provide employees who handle chemical substances with education regarding the harmfulness and proper handling of such substances before the employees are assigned to such operations. When they engage in the operations, they are provided with appropriate protective equipment and are obliged to wear it.
 Environmental Contribution through Business and Products
Based on our corporate missions, the IBIDEN Group aims to contribute to the growth of an enriched society with our products and services created from our business activities.
While the goal of reducing our environmental burden continues, our automobile exhaust parts contribute to realizing cleaner air by reducing particulate matter in emission gas.
We will continue to develop high-efficiency and high-function intake and exhaust systems based on our ceramic molding and sintering technology which aim for cleaner emissions.
Related businesses in our Group also utilize their
accumulated technologies to provide products and services that will help reduce the environmental burden.
IBIDEN Greentec Co., Ltd. continues to provide new construction methods that achieve both disaster prevention and environmental protection, such as the “Totally Green” method.
    Actions to water risk
We carry out risk assessment of water resources in-house by referring to data released by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and other data, and we have thus identified IBIDEN Electronics (Beijing) Co., Ltd. as our Group companies with a high water resource risk. IBIDEN Electronics (Beijing), which uses particularly large amounts of water, has been increasing the use of recycled water inside its industrial park since fiscal year 2012. As a result of such efforts, the ratio of water recycling has been maintained at over 90%.
Wastewater Control
Our Group’s business activities are supported by the rich water resources in the Ogaki area of Gifu Prefecture.
Underground water pumped to the surface passes through wastewater treatment after use, and is released into rivers or a sewage treatment facility under the strict control of our Group based on our own standards that are stricter than the ones required by laws and regulations.

  CeramicsTOPICS
Control and Response to Changes by IT System
IBIDEN believes that the standardization of work quality at each base in the IT system is important for global management. For the ongoing IT system construction conducted globally, we are carrying out required tasks by separating them into two domains of control-focused tasks and response-focused tasks.
System Construction in the Control Perspective
In domains such as purchasing, accounting, and asset management, our global IT system construction focuses on control, and migration to Cloud ERP is being promoted. Standardization of work flow and work management method with Cloud ERP will eliminate uneven work quality and ensure uniform quality of operations. In addition to the completion of migration in our Hungary branch, migration was completed in our offices in Japan and Germany in FY2019. In the future, migration to Cloud ERP is scheduled to be completed in all bases in and outside of Japan by 2025.
System Construction to Respond to Changes
Our global IT system construction for domains that are directly connected to businesses such as production, sales, production control, quality control, and revenue management focuses on the response to changes. For these domains, the System Promotion Unit plays a key role in developing and globally operating the Group’s original applications. The introduction of original systems will enable us to follow changes in requirements from customers and production changes inside the Company.

  IBIDEN Group Supplier CSR Guidelines
In order to lead globally developing operations into sustainable growth with our suppliers, we unveiled “the IBIDEN Group Green Procurement Guidelines” in 2009 as a system for green procurement, designed to procure parts and materials that feature reduced environment impact. In addition, we published “the IBIDEN Group Supplier CSR Guidelines” (hereinafter called “CSR Guidelines”) in 2011.These guidelines provide our suppliers with requests by our customers, the industry and the international community and items that should be managed by the Group. The items are divided into subcategories according to themes such as labor, health and safety, environmental protection, ethics and fair business practices.
IBIDEN Management System “IMS”
IBIDEN globally adopts the IBIDEN Management System (IMS) which aims to continuously improve the Group’s business competitiveness and customer satisfaction level. Based on quality management systems ISO9001 and IATF16949, we integrated environment management system ISO14001, occupational health and safety management system ISO45001, and corporate management systems to improve the quality of every single operation process. We will continue to build and operate systems that allow us to provide high quality products globally so that we can offer products and services exceeding the expectations of society and our customers.
In addition, the Group has received ISO9001 certification at main domestic and overseas manufacturing plants and
IATF16949 in operations related to the automotive industry. ISO9001 and IATF16949 are international quality management system standards.
Measures to improve quality
IBIDEN is striving to contribute to society and customers through product quality. We hold review meetings at each process phase from the development of cutting-edge technologies, product planning, and design to mass production in order to evaluate compliance with requirements. To improve quality further, we offer guidance and audits, including assessment by the president, at workplaces in Japan and overseas and group companies on quality improvement. In addition, we also provide support and guidance to our suppliers for the purpose of quality improvement.
Measures for Supply Chain Management
Communication and Cooperation with Supplier
In order to thoroughly implement CSR Guidelines throughout the entire supply chain, we request our suppliers, including new suppliers, to pledge to comply with CSR Guidelines, as well as to evaluate the status of guideline compliance through CSR investigation and report annually. Furthermore, to confirm the actual status of suppliers and promote improvements, we make requests on improving issues addressed in CSR investigation as well as conduct site visits and audits to ask the suppliers for improvements to their activities. Each guideline is published on the Company’s website so that they may be reviewed by all stakeholders.
Risk Management of the Supply Chain
The IBIDEN Group controls the whole supply chain, not limited to the suppliers from whom we procure materials. In Japan, with regard to contractors and dispatched workers, labor management is becoming complicated by various factors such as the increased number of foreign workers. Amid such circumstances, risk management of the supply chain has become increasingly crucial for us. To ensure the soundness of the supply chain, we periodically share information through personal interviews and confirm the current status in cooperation with our suppliers.
Responsible Sourcing of Resources
(Conflict Minerals )
Illegal mining of resources in conflict areas and high-risk areas has become a major international issue as it abets human rights violations and environmental destruction. Our “CSR Guidelines” clearly state that the suppliers should refrain from illegal mining in conflict areas as well as procuring resources that may support human rights violations. Furthermore, we will conduct reasonable investigations into the mineral supply routes and disclose the findings in good faith.
The targets are tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, and cobalt.
Suppliers’ Compliance Counter
We set up a “compliance counter” for our suppliers to which suppliers can report any compliance problem while dealing with the Company. As with the compliance counter for our internal employees, information will be handled with the utmost care for privacy and the supplier will never suffer prejudicial treatment for contacting the counter.

  Basic Views
The Group considers corporate governance to be a key management mechanism for transparent, fair, prompt and resolute decision-making, and all Group companies are thus actively committed to improving corporate governance. As part of our Group’s corporate governance, we are enhancing internal control by proactively undertaking activities to advance compliance and risk management and we are expanding/strengthening the management oversight functions of our board of directors and the audit functions of our Audit and Supervisory Committee Members. These steps will enable us to construct a transparent corporate governance system worthy of the trust of shareholders and other stakeholders and fulfill our corporate social responsibilities, and will help us improve our corporate value through sustained growth.
Overview of the Corporate Governance Structure
The Company has adopted the organizational form of a company with Audit and Supervisory Committee. To ensure fair and transparent company management, six (6) Outside Directors attend Board of Directors meetings and there provide advice on company management. For fair and transparent procedures applied to nominate these Outside Directors and to determine their compensation, the Company has voluntarily established Nomination/Remuneration Committee.
An Executive Officer System has been introduced to permit rapid management decision-making and quicker execution of operations, which can clarify each role for Executive Directors and Senior Executive Directors and can get the right person in the right place with flexibility and mobility. The Audit and Supervisory Committee has also been given robust check-and-balance functions to help them monitor decision-making by the Board of Directors and the execution of operations by representative Directors.
Currently, the Electronics and Ceramics Operations, which are both our main businesses, are confronted with a rapidly changing business environment.
Against this backdrop, in 2017, we transitioned to a Company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee with the aim of streamlining management and accelerating decision-making. Moreover, we considered the further acceleration of decision-making and execution speed as necessary for maintaining and increasing our competitiveness. Accordingly, as of April 1, 2020, we streamlined the structure of our executive system as follows.
Discontinuation of Corporate Officer Positions and Reduction of the Number of Executives (from 23 to 15)
Executives are Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Outside Directors, Executive Managing Officer, Senior Managing Officers and Audit and Supervisory Committee Members.
Change of Titles of Executive Managing Officers and Senior Managing Officers to Senior Executive Officers
The title change was made to clarify the roles of leading the execution of operations as the heads of departments and working on the resolution of company-wide management challenges as management leaders.
Integration of the Positions of the Corporate Officers and Senior Managements into Senior Managements (Employees)
This change was made to clarify their roles of making quick decisions as the heads of workplaces as well as assuming the responsibilities and authorities for execution in their respective fields.

1. Evaluation Method
All Directors including Outside Directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee Members performed self-evaluations by answering questionnaires about effectiveness of the Board of Director’s function, which is prepared by an administrative office for the Board of Directors.
2. Overview of Results of Analysis and Evaluation
As a result of questionnaire tabulation, Outside Directors, Audit and Supervisory Committee Members rated all evaluation items, as 3.5 points or above. The results could be analyzed and evaluated as that the Board of Directors largely secured the effectiveness in its function.
On the other hand, the questionnaire results tabulation found that there were still tasks and room for improvements on the items below. The Company and the Board of Directors will place priority on those.
Challenges and Issues Recognized
Establishment of an effective risk management structure that can support appropriate risk taking
Arrangement of a system that enables Outside Directors to develop their further understanding of agendas with ample time to consider them in advance
Further Company Actions
The Company is to establish more effective risk management system with collecting information, providing guidelines by the Headquarters and using chief area companies because there are level differences on risk management systems between main overseas manufacturing plants and small-scale locations.
The Company intends to further improve environments in order to enhance the effectiveness of discussions with implementing share of exclusive materials and minutes of the Board Meeting in the process of the Board Meeting. When important issues in need of business judgement are provided, the administrators or a head of the drafting of the proposal explains properly with an ample amount of time in advance.
Board Policies and Procedures in Determining the Compensation of the Senior Management and Corporate Directors
Introduction Value Creation ESG Management
Compensation of the Senior Management and Directors
Financial and Corporate Data
The compensation for the Company’s Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, and Senior Executive Officers comprises monthly fixed remuneration, bonuses depending on their performances and the Stock Distribution Trust for Officers. The monthly remuneration for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members is calculated based on their job positions, within the limits approved by the general meeting of shareholders, and is entrusted to President & CEO in accordance with deliberations and reports by Nomination/ Remuneration Committee, which is resolved by the Board of Directors. The bonus allotments for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are based on the degree to which each Director contributed to the Company’s operations, within the scope of the total amount of bonuses calculated using the stipulated formula. These are entrusted to President & CEO in accordance with deliberations and reports by Nomination/Remuneration Committee, which is resolved by the Board of Directors.
The monthly compensation for Senior Executive Officers is entrusted to President & CEO in accordance with deliberations and reports by Nomination/Remuneration Committee, which is approved by the Board of Directors. In determining the
compensation, broad consideration is given to a suitable balance with the monthly compensation for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, assessments of respective Senior Executive Officers’ job performance, and other factors. The amounts of bonuses to be paid are entrusted to President & CEO in accordance with deliberations and reports by Nomination/ Remuneration Committee, which is resolved by the Board of Directors. The bonus amounts are calculated in accordance with the degree of the Senior Executive Officers’ contribution to the Company’s business results and other factors. Outside Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and Members of Audit and Supervisory Committee, being in positions independent of the execution of operations, are only paid a set basic compensation.
The Company has also introduced Performance-linked Remuneration to Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, so that they shall make a clearer linkage between stock values and the compensation for themselves and elevate their awareness of contributing to improving the medium-to-long term operating results and increasing corporate value by sharing with shareholders, the benefits and risks involved in stock price fluctuations.

  Transition of Cross-Shareholdings
1. Policy on Cross-Shareholding
Our basic policy when engaging in investment for purposes other than pure investment is to give comprehensive consideration to the shares we hold in terms of their importance in implementing our business strategy and strengthening business alliances for the sake of improving corporate value over the medium-to-long term. Meanwhile, the Company appropriately proceeds to sell the shares deemed unnecessary in order to make an effort to reduce holding shares. Furthermore, the profitability in consideration of the status of the listed shares we hold, the purpose and the capital cost is reported to the Board of Directors on an annual basis to examine the policy on cross-shareholdings. When the shares deemed necessary, the Company discloses the purpose of them in Securities Reports.

 2. Standards for the Exercising Voting Rights

 Message from an Outside Director
 Outside Director Chiaki YAMAGUCHI
IBIDEN appoints multiple Independent Directors to enable highly effective supervision of the executive management team including Directors that execute business operations. Our Independent Outside Director Yamaguchi provides advice and supervision from the long term perspective on how to enhance the corporate value of our group based on his wealth of experience in international business and corporate management.
 In Response to Opinions from Outside Directors
We regularly receive honest opinions from Outside Directors including Director Yamaguchi, I greatly appreciate the comments Mr. Yamaguchi shared on this occasion concerning our management structure and challenges confronted by our Company. I feel that his insightful advice based on his experience in international business and corporate management are helping us control risks, an essential task we need to fulfill in developing our operations globally.
Our challenge in diversified human resources including non-Japanese people that Director Yamaguchi pointed out is a very important perspective to strengthen our diversity management and upgrade our globalization. We would like to work on the diffusion of our mission and human resource development by considering the climate of each country and region while respecting the life styles, competence, and work styles of individual employees.
By receiving advice and supervision from Outside Directors from diversified perspectives, we will continue to maintain a governance system that enables proactive and bold decision making even in a highly-uncertain management environment to strive for developing our business persistently.
President&CEO Takeshi Aoki
  Evaluation of Management Structure and Roles of Outside Directors
For Further Enhancement of Management Structure
Strengths and Challenges of IBIDEN
IBIDEN, which started from hydroelectric power generation, has reformed its business structures drastically and flexibly and continued to grow over 100 years of history. We should be very proud of that fact. In addition, IBIDEN continues to skillfully manage and operate a wide variety of businesses with different features such as Electronics, Ceramics, and original group company businesses as well, which is the Group’s another strength.
The corporate culture is a great combination of family-like atmosphere and professionalism about work, and I think people who are eager to work must feel very comfortable at IBIDEN. Another great feature about IBIDEN is that the Company has solidly taken root, and expanded its presence in the surrounding local communities. However, in order to develop further as a global company, IBIDEN needs to upgrade its current corporate culture to something that can be shared with people from outside of Japan including, among others, employees of our overseas group companies. Approximately 60% of our employees work overseas, and our non-Japanese employees outnumber our Japanese employees. Therefore, I believe we should further consider advancement of diversified human resources including non-Japanese people in depth. What will be important at that time is sharing our mission and sense of values founded upon our 100-year history.
For Further Strengthening Functions of the
Board of Directors
For the governance system, six members comprising a majority of the Board of Directors are Outside Directors (all are Independent Directors), and there are five Audit and Supervisory Committee Members (three of which are Independent Directors). I think our governance system has reached the top level in Japan. In addition, the current composition of members of the Board of Directors is well balanced in terms of knowledge, experience, and competence, and I feel all of us are able to proactively state opinions from our respective positions. In the current Board of Directors, I
feel that dynamism of management is being fully exerted. In order not to undermine the dynamism, I would like to be a little cautious about promoting further reforms.
For the important role I should play, I believe I should steer decisions to a direction that will serve the best interests of our shareholders over the long term if anything happens that may endanger the existence of the Company. To that end, I would like to continue supporting decisions by management through providing the necessary advice to and supervision of management by harnessing the experience and knowledge that I fostered through working globally and as a corporate manager.
IBIDEN’s Management Structure
I assumed the post of Outside Director in June 2014, and over the past several years since then, our Company has implemented drastic governance reforms such as transitioning to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, increasing the number of Outside Directors, and streamlining the executive system. These reforms have been implemented based on the recognized needs to respond to changes in the business environment, globalize our businesses and operations, and comply with Japan’s corporate governance code, and I feel we have steadily built up the reforms.
Through the reforms, I personally witnessed how a compact management structure centered around the Chairman of the Board and President, who are united while utilizing different personalities for management enabled speedy decision making and execution. I feel that IBIDEN has become a suitable structure to survive in the rapidly and significantly changing environment such as the electronics industry in which 5G and ICT are evolving.
Atmosphere of Board of Directors Meetings and
Active Discussions
Our Board of Directors meetings feature a very open atmosphere realized by the amazing personality of the President and great corporate culture, and I feel very comfortable with making comments. Recently, I think that management experience over the years has made the President more confident and comfortable, which brings out more active discussions.
Since the start of my tenure, I have felt that Board of
Directors meetings were open and friendly. The atmosphere made everyone including Outside Directors feel comfortable with expressing opinions even from the examination phase. Of course, an appropriate feeling of professionalism is maintained, but I can say we communicate with each other honestly without hesitation.
Since reference materials are shared and prior explanations are made before each Board of Directors meeting, we do not have extended discussions in the meetings very often. However, I believe Board of Directors meetings serve as an important occasion to directly confirm the preparedness and risk awareness of top management.
What I Consider Important in the Role of
Outside Director
Through my eight-year experience as corporate auditor at Toyota Motor Corporation, I learned how difficult it is to put the brakes on or monitor management skillfully. Owing to this experience, I always try to evaluate objectively by understanding the thoughts and positions of corporate executives and judge management decisions in the larger framework. In addition, the most important thing is not to interrupt management. Major accidents and scandals that shake up management are absolutely not an option, but I try to understand and support desperate decisions made by corporate executives in uncertain times as much as possible. After doing all these, I clearly express my concerns from my experience in management and international business in the role of providing advice to and supervising management. What is important is how to control the risk assumed by management for the future.

Indicates a Specific Member of Audit and Supervisory Committee without voting rights, who is a member of the Nomination/Remuneration Committee.
 Candidates for Corporate Management Members and Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are selected/assigned from the perspective of placing the right person in the right job, with due consideration given to the number of people that would enable precise and prompt decision-making and to a balance of knowledge, experience, skills and evaluation of business performance, etc. among the Corporate Management Team/the Board of Directors overall. Candidates for Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are also selected/assigned from the perspective of placing the right person in the right job, with due consideration given to a balance among knowledge of accounting, tax and legal matters, knowledge about the Company’s business, and other perspectives pertinent to corporate management. Given the above, the assignment for
Audit and Supervisory Committee Member candidates is resolved by the Board of Directors after Audit and Supervisory Committee deliberates and agrees on it. The assignment for Corporate Director candidates, prior to a resolution of the Board of Directors, after it has been sufficiently deliberated by Nomination/Remuneration Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors and reported to the Board of Directors. The standards for dismissal from a Corporate Director or a Senior Executive Officer is determined pursuant to Director and Senior Executive Officer Regulations; dismissal of Directors is resolved in the Shareholders Meeting and one of Senior Executive Officers is resolved in the Board of Directors Meeting following the standards and the deliberation by Nomination/ Remuneration Committee.
Communication with Shareholders and Investors
The Company issued approximately 140 million shares and had about 23,000 shareholders as of March 31, 2020. We held a general meeting of shareholders in the multi-purpose hall in the IBIDEN Headquarters Building on June 17, 2020. We have sought to establish a more open environment by adopting the voting rights exercise platform from fiscal year 2006 and making possible the exercise of voting rights via the Internet and smart phones, etc., for shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting. (The ratio of voting rights exercised at the 167th general meeting of shareholders: 86.57%).
In addition, to ensure prompt disclosure, the Notice of Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders added elements of business report is available in our website and platform by a week before mailing it to shareholders. We will continue to promote prompt disclosure such as on our website before mailing.
As for other IR activities, we hold periodic briefings for analysts and institutional investors after the announcement of business results for the full year and those for the interim term, and release materials for the briefings on our website.
Furthermore, we take part in a range of events as briefings for individual investors, providing them with opportunities to invest in shares of the Company.

 Training Policy for Directors and Policy for the Development of Next Generation Management Executives
The Company has established a system to provide financial and other support to Corporate Directors to allow them to attend when necessary outside training sessions, seminars, etc., which will enable them to acquire the knowledge they need and better understanding of their roles and duties. The Company is encouraging newly assigned Company Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members in particular to participate in courses for new directors to enhance their understanding of the knowledge needed in their positions. To enable full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee Members to play a key part in corporate governance, the Company has them participate in courses and study sessions conducted by the Japan Audit & Supervisory Board Members Association (JASBA) and other organizations as well as in outside networking events so that they can acquire the knowledge they need as the
members and better understand their roles and duties as the members. We are arranging courses on the Companies Act and other content suited to the circumstances at the time to be conducted by internal and external experts for Company Directors and Managing Officers who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and Senior Executive Officers.
For the development of next generation management executives, we newly established a Senior Management system in FY2020. We position employees in Senior Management positions as next generation management executive candidates, and have these employees participate in Executive training. In addition, by developing the educational program for employees in Senior Management positions, we will develop human resources in a planned way.

  Risk Management Basic Approach
The IBIDEN Group enables business continuity by analyzing various risks surrounding management, accurately handling losses of business resources that have a great negative impact on the ease of our business operations, ensuring the safety of our shareholders, customers and officers, and reducing and preventing losses of business resources.
By achieving thoroughgoing commitment to “compliance with domestic and international laws, our articles of incorporation, internal regulations and corporate ethics” (Compliance) and through open and fair corporate activities, we aim to be a company that international society relies on.
Structure for Advancing Risk Management
Structure for Promoting Compliance Program
Activities for Advancing Risk Management
1. Business Continuous Plan
We conduct our activities pursuant to the Action Plan to prevent damage and loss to the safety and health of employees, suppliers, shareholders, customers, and local communities, etc.
Measures Taken against the Spread of New Infectious Disease (COVID-19)
In line with guidelines and response procedures, we organized a task force to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our employees and the local societies, in preparation for the pandemic period. As preparation in ordinary times, we have shared information on our intranet, taken hygiene measures to prevent infection, and formulated necessary rules. As measures to combat the spread of the pandemic, the task force has centrally managed information such as the occurrence of infection in each area, the impacts of the infection, and relevant restrictions. We are thus striving to operate our businesses while minimizing the risk of infection, through measures such as changing the work systems depending on the relevant restrictions and the spread of infection. Natural Disaster Preparedness
Considering the occurrence of large-scale natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods, in areas where our plants are located as an important risk theme, we are taking measures to prepare for the occurrence of such disasters. As for measures to be taken when disasters such as earthquakes occur, we believe that lifesaving comes first, followed by the early supply of products to customers. With regard to concrete risk themes in the event of a natural disaster, including confirmation of the safety of employees, supply of materials by suppliers, equipment failure and occurrence of utility problems, we are building a response system, mainly led by the divisions that cope with such risks.
Please visit our website for details of our risk management. https://www.ibiden.com/company/risk-management/
Actually, based on a damage scenario assuming the occurrence of a Nankai Trough Megathrust Earthquake which may affect our plants and domestic affiliated companies, we have already advanced disaster mitigation measures, such as ceiling fall prevention, hazardous liquid medicine leak prevention, and equipment fall prevention.
2. Information Security Measures
Information concerning the operation, technologies and management of the Company is a valuable asset, and for a technology-development-oriented company like us, proper management of information including confidential information of customers and suppliers and prevention of leakage are important issues and responsibilities.
We have established a framework for information security promotion to block illegal access, etc. from the outside, and stipulated fundamental rules to comply with in utilizing and maintaining information assets we own such as trade secrets, personal information and information technologies (IT) under the “Regulations for Information Management.” To improve the protection and utilization of information, we have kept all employees well-informed through the IT Promotion Committee and relevant education. As for personal information, we have established a personal information protection policy and stipulated procedures necessary for the collection, management and utilization of personal information. Recently, falsification of data has become a social problem. Against this background, we introduced a data integrity audit, and are working to prevent falsification and incorrect handling of data for provision to customers.
Bolstering Compliance Activities
1. Compliance Education
3. Whistleblowing System
In addition to the formal channel of reporting, the Group has established a compliance consultation service to facilitate reporting when an officer or employee discovers a violation of compliance. Through this service, officers and employees may report violations nominally to employees in charge of the compliance consultation service or anonymously to outside experts. The consultation counters have been operated with due consideration for the protection of rights of whistleblowers, such as privacy protection and ensuring no disadvantageous treatment. Furthermore, to deepen understanding and enhance the reliability of the system, we have established a support channel that averts conflict of interest at the time of reporting.

4. Self-Check of Activities and Awareness Survey
We conduct a self-check on the status of compliance with the Standards for Employee Behavior and a survey on compliance awareness each year, covering all employees including those of domestic Group companies. With these measures, we clarify our challenges that need to be overcome through improvement activities in the following year.

  When promoting compliance activities, it is crucial that employee awareness is continuously maintained at a high level. We have created an environment where employees can systematically receive education and training on the Standards for Employee Behavior, which define the standards for our employees and executives to practice compliance, immediately after hiring. To deepen the understanding of the details of the Standards for Employee Behavior, we have issued Case Examples for Enlightenment (Case Book), which introduces cases of violation of the Standards and points to remember for compliance, reading them through the workplace to raise employees awareness of compliance.
2. Efforts for Fraud Prevention including Anti-bribery
The Group upholds the IBIDEN Group Charter of Behavior to make efforts to prevent every form of corruption. In the Standards for Employee Behavior also, we demand ethical behavior and strictly prohibit unlawful actions and acts of conflict of interest including bribery. To avoid misconduct, we have appropriately developed a system for ensuring a certain prevention of corruption in line with the current conditions of each site, including measures such as stricter authorization when paying social expenses, the establishment of Gift-giving and -receiving Guidelines, and the development of a Whistleblowing System. In fiscal year 2019, we did not confirm any instances of the imposition of fines or settlement money for malpractice, or any events subject to disciplinary actions.

 Financial and Corporate Data
 Overview of the Fiscal Year Under Review
Analysis of Our Business Performance and Financial Condition
During the fiscal year under review, the global economy saw moderate growth earlier, supported by a strong U.S. economy, however, uncertainties increased including a slowdown in the Chinese economy stemming from trade disputes between the U.S. and China, as well as a deceleration of economic activity caused by COVID-19. In addition, in the domestic economy, the management environment surrounding companies is severe, with weaknesses seen in parts of export and production due to the effects of trends in the uncertain world economy and the impact of COVID-19.
In the semiconductors and electronic components market, the smartphone market saw negative growth from the previous year. However, due to consistent demand for replacement in the personal computer market and overall strong performance of new markets centered around the server market for data centers, the semiconductors and electronic components market grew upward as a whole.
The exhaust system components market in the automotive industry remained under harsh conditions due to a continued decrease in the ratio of diesel passenger vehicle sales in the European passenger vehicle market, in addition to significant negative growth in global automobile sales.
Given this situation, under the new five-year medium term management plan “To The Next Stage 110 Plan” that started in April 2018, we proactively allocated management resources into growing markets, and have been working on measures for the realization of stable growth by increasing competitiveness of our existing businesses along with expanding new businesses.
As a result, net sales for the fiscal year under review amounted to ¥295,999 million, an increase of ¥4,873 million (1.7%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income totaled ¥19,686 million, an increase of ¥9,548 million (94.2%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Ordinary profit amounted to ¥21,364 million, an increase of ¥8,764 million (69.6%) compared to the previous fiscal year.

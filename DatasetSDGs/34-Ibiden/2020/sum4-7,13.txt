Electric Power Business
The Company, which began with hydroelectric power generation, still owns three hydroelectric power plants today, including the Higashi Yokoyama Power Plant. In 2016, renovations were conducted to support the renewable energy feed-in tariff (FIT), supporting the Companyâ€™s business as stable sources of revenue over the medium to long term. Technologies fostered in hydroelectric power generation are deployed in various power generation operations, such as solar power, and contribute to providing renewable energy that puts little stress on the environment.

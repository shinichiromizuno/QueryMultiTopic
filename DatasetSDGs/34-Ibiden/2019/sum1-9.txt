Electronics
   Car Electronics
The number of electronic components and sensors installed on automobiles have dramatically increased against a backdrop of advancements in analysis using big data and high-speed communication networks. Semiconductors used on all systems that control automobiles, IC package substrates to which these are installed, as well as motherboards on which those packages are implemented, are used widely as components for automobiles that require strict reliability.
    Data Center
A large number of microprocessors are used at data centers that process huge quantities of data. The demand for IC packaging substrates used in data centers is on the rise as more and more services are handling big data. IBIDEN supports the superior reliability of data centers with IC packaging featuring high- functionality and high-reliability.
       Computer & Smartphone
At the heart of computers, semiconductors are small chips with a size of only a few millimeters to a few dozen millimeters. IC package substrates are used to implement these semiconductors with techniques that allow the chips to function at 100% performance. Various electronic devices and peripheral equipment are incorporated in smartphones featuring a variety of functions. Thin printed wiring boards with many layers are used to bring out the capabilities of multiple electronic devices within limits on size and thickness.
IC Package Substrate
     Printed Wiring Board■ Core Technologies in Electronics
IC Package Substrate
Focusing on MPUs (micro processor unit) for personal computers and the Data Center, and GPUs (graphic processor unit) for AI and vehicle-mounted applications, we provide state-of-the-art IC packaging substrates. IC packaging substrate is an important component that functions together with IC chips. IBIDEN has always enhanced added values along with IC chip evolution.

niquely competitive products provided by each of our domestic group companies have been successful in a variety of fields.

The Company, which began with hydroelectric power generation, still owns three hydroelectric power plants today, including the Higashi Yokoyama Power Plant. In 2016, renovations were conducted to support the renewable energy feed-in tariff (FIT), establishing a system to sell all of the generated power to external parties. The power plants continue to support the Companyâ€™s business as stable sources of revenue over the medium to long term.
The technologies fostered in hydroelectric power generation have been inherited by group company IBIDEN Engineering Co., Ltd., which now conducts a variety of power generation operations including solar power. These operations also contribute to providing renewable energy that puts little stress on the environment.

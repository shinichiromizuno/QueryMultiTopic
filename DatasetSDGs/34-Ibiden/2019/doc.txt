IBIDEN WAY
The power that has enabled IBIDEN “to overcome many adversities with all our employees and to continue to exist,” and “the wisdom and vitality that have achieved dramatic growth in recent years” - these have persisted throughout IBIDEN’s long history. The systematization that carries this on, transcending borders, is the “IBIDEN WAY.”
    SPIRIT
Trust through Integrity “Wa” Teamwork and Synergy Challenge with Passion IBI-TECHNO Innovation
IBIDEN’s DNA
Ogaki City, where IBIDEN is located, used to flourish as a commercial city of water transport, connected by the Ibi River to Kuwana, which was an important hub on the Tokaido. Eventually, responding to the city’s decline after the Meiji Restoration, the Company’s predecessor, Ibigawa Electric Power Co., Ltd., was established in order to find a way toward survival through attracting industries with a hydroelectric power generation business utilizing the abundant water source of the Ibi River. Ibigawa Electric Power Co., Ltd. symbolized the revival of Ogaki and contributed to its development through attracting factories of large enterprises. Later, the Company started its history as a manufacturer by expanding into electrochemical manufacturing, applying technologies on electronic furnaces fostered in electric power operations.
Since then, the Company has created new technologies and products that apply its accumulated elements and technologies by astutely sensing needs for the next generations from customers that are always the leading companies in each industry at the time even amid external environments that may jeopardize the Company’s continued existence such as the energy reform from coal to oil, the period of high economic growth, and the shift toward an information society.
Despite these changes, great power to overcome hardships came from our personnel who worked to achieve high targets under a corporate culture to implement “Genchi (actual site),” “Genbutsu (actual thing),” and “Jigakari (on-site solution of problems),” as well as each employee having a sense of ownership. In addition, the “blessings of nature” were always essential to IBIDEN’s operations, which began in hydroelectric power generation. The 106 years IBIDEN has accumulated also represent a history of appreciating the blessings of nature and being aware of cohabitation.
The spirit of our predecessors has been passed onto the present as the IBIDEN WAY, IBIDEN’s treasured values. The baton will be passed onto the generation in charge of the future.
※
Gaining customer and societal trust through “Genchi Genbutsu.”
※Genchi Genbutsu: Go and See for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation
Integrating knowledge and wisdom from the employee involvement for greater power.
Anticipating change, and acting boldly to create new value. Evolving by overcoming hurdles through creativity and ingenuity.
      IBIDEN and the SDGs
In September 2015, the “Transforming our world: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. In this agenda, the “SDGs: Sustainable Development Goals,” which comprise 17 goals and 169 targets, were formulated. Upholding the realization of harmony with the natural environment and an affluent society as its corporate philosophy, IBIDEN has continued to develop by creating products that lead to solving social issues with its innovative technologies. We believe that to positively contribute to achieving the SDGs through its businesses is a mission that IBIDEN should fulfill for society based on the IBIDEN WAY.

Message from the President
IBIDEN aims to achieve the medium-term management plan in FY2022 by reforming operational structures in anticipation of changes in the external environment and accumulating new operations that generate further revenues.
Governance Structure Embodying the IBIDEN WAY
Financial and Corporate Data
  DNA that Responds to Changes in Society
IBIDEN was established in 1912 as a hydroelectric power plant company named Ibigawa Electric Power Co., Ltd. that utilized the abundant water source of the Ibi River, and it has since changed its business structure according to changes in the needs of the times in order to overcome countless adversities such as the period during and after the war, high economic growth, the oil crisis, and collapse of the bubble economy. At our foundation lies IBIDEN’s DNA to “create what will be needed by the society in the future based on core technologies.” Specifically, it was the power to continuously connect and develop fundamental technologies derived from the original business of power generation, expanding into the electrochemical industry by utilizing electric power in electric furnaces, and advancing into veneers using chemicals and printed wiring boards. This DNA and development of technologies have led to the Company’s current main operations.
In addition to the connection of technologies, an essential factor in the Company’s development is that we have built close relationships with customers that are the leading companies in the respective industries at that time. It is the “customer first” business cycle in which our customers’ requests, issues, and future road maps are shared, responses are made with innovations utilizing accumulated core technologies, and connections with our customers are further strengthened. The essence of IBI-TECHNO is understanding changes in society through connections with our customers, and pioneering the next steps by fearlessly changing its main operations based on core technologies.
Awareness of External Environment in Main
Operations
In the Company’s business portfolio, the Electronics Operation comprises 39.8% and the Ceramics Operation comprises 35.2% of the most recent net sales of ¥291.1 billion. The Electronics Operation has achieved growth by incorporating demand for electronic components used in mobile devices that entered a period of full-scale adoption in the 2000s, with the use of IC package substrates (PKG) by major semiconductor manufacturers in the 1990s as a turning point. Currently, the personal computer market is declining and the commoditization of the smartphone market is progressing, intensifying price competition with competitors amid contracting markets ( P.21 Fig.1, Fig.2).
In response to such changes in the market environment, from the perspective of selecting and concentrating, we have reorganized unnecessary facilities and operations from which revenues cannot be expected in order to advance reforms in operational structure to concentrate resources on markets where growth can be expected and core technologies can be utilized.
With regard to the medium- to long-term outlook of the market for the Company’s Electronics Operation, the next-generation 5G telecommunications standard is a growth opportunity, a theme to which we can proactively contribute with digital innovations that will transform society with enriched lives, industries, and financial services. The spread of 5G telecommunications will dramatically increase the amount of data being transferred, increasing the use of high-function microprocessors for 5G base stations and data centers that function as infrastructure supporting such data transfers. This is expected to result in new demand ( P.21 Fig.3) for high-end IC package substrates,
which are one of the Company’s strengths. In addition, the impact of 5G is expected to spread to the networking of digital electronics and self-driving, and is hoped to further expand business opportunities. In phases of such paradigm shift, new entries of domestic and foreign competitors can pose a risk, while there are also growth opportunities to be found. The Company maintains one of the highest shares in the world of the high-end IC package substrate market, and is well positioned to overcome issues by closely coordinating with customers through sharing development plans amid the progression of refinement in IC package substrates. These connections with our customers and the technological development capabilities that respond to such connections will become one of our advantages so that we can further improve our high market share and put the Electronics Operation on a strong growth trajectory with the IC package substrate operation as its driver.
The Ceramics Operation has grown into the second pillar with the DPF operation as its driver amid progress in strengthening environmental regulations led by developed countries mainly in Europe against a backdrop of environmental issues caused primarily by exhaust gases from diesel vehicles. In the process, the Company has established a structure to supply our products from four locations in the world: Japan, Hungary, France, and Mexico, in order to respond to strong demand for DPF mainly in the passenger vehicle market in Europe. Going forward, we expect an increase in demand for DPF in developing countries not only for passenger vehicles but also for buses, trucks, and construction equipment. Meanwhile, we are beginning to see changes in the market

Strengthening Competitiveness of Existing Businesses – Structural Reform of the Electronics Operation
As stated above, in the Electronics Operation comprised of PKG, motherboard printed wiring boards (PWB), and thin compact substrates for smartphones and tablets (CSP), we have advanced bold reforms in operational structure since the latter part of the previous medium-term management plan based on changes in the competitive environment. While the Company’s Electronics Operation has grown by closely coordinating with certain major customers from the development stage, this also meant taking the risk of the entire business being easily affected by the customers’ development trends. In order to reduce such risk, the Company is proactively working on development of new users and product areas which are expected to advance in the growing market. In addition, barriers between operations are disappearing in technologies that have been accumulated by operations in PKG, PWB, and CSP, such as multi-layering, refined wiring, and miniaturization. We have reorganized these three operations into a structure that can flexibly respond to users’ requests for new use cases, such as usage environments and required specs.
Furthermore, as a stepping stone toward future growth, we have decided to invest a total of ¥70 billion in the Ogaki Central Plant and Ogaki Plant based on expectations for further growth in demand for a high-function, next-generation PKG mainly for data centers. Through this investment, the production capacity of main domestic bases for the PKG operation, which is the main operation of the Company’s Electronics Operation and has generated stable revenue, will be significantly enhanced. In doing so, we will establish a supply structure that allows us to continue having the highest share of the growing

market. In addition, during the process of considering the investment, we have carefully deliberated the possibility of recouping the investment at internal meetings and the Board of Directors meetings by directly confirming our customers’ strong requests through information exchanges and matching details and reasoning with objective market data. Risks for the Company include responding to increased technological difficulties demanded by customers, which we believe can be controlled with the technological capabilities we have fostered thus far. As well, we also plan to shift personnel resources from CSP, which we plan to scale down in the operational restructuring.
With regard to PWB, we plan to structure our operations by limiting products with seasonal fluctuations as much as possible and focus on products from which stable orders and revenues can be expected, mainly through production of motherboards for smartphones at the Beijing plant for the Chinese market, where the demand is strong, and production of modular substrates for servers at the Malaysia plant. There is concern for U.S.-China trade friction in products for smartphones, but we will adopt a flexible production structure between Beijing and Malaysia while observing the situation, with the possibility of transferring production to Malaysia in the worst-case scenario.
As such, with the effects of restructuring the three operations and progressing the shift toward high value-added products such as next- generation PKG, business results for the Electronics Operation in FY2022 is expected to register net sales of ¥200 billion with a five-year CAGR of 14% expected for 2018-2022.
Strengthening Competitiveness of Existing Businesses – DPF Demand Shifting to Developing Countries
With regard to DPF, which is the main product of the Ceramics
Operation, the effects of the shift toward EVs by countries in Europe (
Fig.4) and shift away from diesel are starting to materialize. Meanwhile,
an increase in demand ( Fig.5) is expected in the overall heavy
commercial vehicle (HD) market in developing countries with growth potential, including construction machinery in addition to buses and trucks starting around 2020 against a backdrop of strong development demand that will follow tighter environmental regulations and an increase in population.
In order to respond to these changes in the markets, we are pursuing optimization and streamlining of the global production structure by deciding to dissolve the DPF production plant in France last fiscal year and concentrating DPF production for Europe at the plant in Hungary. Meanwhile, we will make sure to incorporate the increasing demand in the heavy commercial vehicle market in developing countries with a focus on our Mexico plant. Furthermore, we will concentrate our resources on growing markets by advancing promotion activities for AFP, in which stable growth can be expected due to demand regardless of gasoline or diesel vehicle.
Through these initiatives, we believe stable growth is possible despite the market being in a transitional period. For business results for the Ceramics Operation in FY2022, we expect net sales of ¥120 billion and a five-year CAGR of 4.0% for 2018-2022.

Expanding New Businesses
IBIDEN launched four development centers in FY2017 in order to develop our unique foundational technology we have fostered into new products for fields in which significant growth is expected. At each respective center, we are conducting R&D with the aim of achieving visions such as “to make the air on the Earth cleaner,” “to realize future vehicles we dreamed of as kids,” and “to extend healthy life expectancy of people.”
Among the themes we are currently pursuing, we expect the field of automobile functional products, which involves developing high- efficiency and high-function intake and exhaust systems to achieve cleaner exhaust gas, to come to fruition first. The project is based on technology extrapolated from existing ceramic molding and sintering technology as its core technology, and we are conducting development in cooperation with DENSO CORPORATION, with which we executed a capital and business alliance agreement in 2017. In terms of the developmental stage, we have completed the first prototype and received high praise from our customers. The field of biomaterial products will come next, which is developing materials that contribute to improving the safety and security of foods and living spaces. We have completed verifying the effects of plant activators for crops that realize high productivity and high functionality, and we are making preparations for commercialization.
In future mobility products, we are developing several projects in order to address existing issues for EVs such as weight reduction and comfort. These include improving the capabilities of batteries utilizing our technology to control the physical properties of materials we have fostered in our existing operations, components to control heat and sound, and high-strength, lightweight plastic windows with SiC coating using our coating technology. We are performing evaluations with customers toward market launch. Advanced ceramics will take some time until commercialization as they are for aircraft, which require reliability. However, we have already established technologies to
manufacture lightweight and highly heat resistant ceramic composite components that will significantly improve fuel efficiency, and we are at the stage of receiving durability evaluations. The aircraft business is booming, and while reliability evaluations take time, we can expect sustained revenue contribution over the long term.
I am in charge of monitoring R&D including these four themes, and I conduct reviews by theme each month. In addition, I visit worksites as necessary to interview persons in charge while reviewing the actual products. I focus on confirming the direction of development because it is of utmost importance to have the perspective of “customer-in,” which is to address customers’ issues and connect to value, as opposed to the perspective of “product-out.”
Human Resource Development That Supports IBI-TECHNO’s Innovation
The mindset fostered with the awareness that people are the foundation of supporting technology and business, and that each of us must take on new challenges and continue changing in order to survive, has supported our technological transformations in the past. We believe human resource development is the lifeline of IBIDEN’s sustainable growth, and we are implementing a variety of initiatives.
In order to successfully implement the medium-term management plan and realize sustainable growth, it is essential to develop managerial talent who can strongly promote IBIDEN’s management and business. Therefore, within the general training, we have established training systems in which the required skills and concepts can be learned according to each job grade. In addition, we are promoting initiatives to appoint new leaders to take on the challenge of setting up businesses based on themes of development centers.
In promoting diversity, we have achieved certain results in promoting active participation of women. Within Japan, we started promoting women’s participation and advancement in FY2010 in order to establish an environment in which employees’ capabilities can be fully
utilized while respecting work-life balance amid a declining working population. Since FY2017, we have made efforts based on the Act on Promotion for Women’s Empowerment, namely a training program for female employees selected from each department and their immediate supervisors. The number of female managers and manager candidates has steadily increased as a result of transforming awareness of not only female employees but also supervisors at the workplace. We will continue establishing working environments in which each employee’s capabilities can be fully utilized so that diverse human resources with motivation including female employees, foreign employees, senior employees, as well as employees with disabilities can receive fair opportunities.
Meanwhile, the Human Resource Development Center takes on the role of refining expert skills. For engineers engaged in development, experience at worksites and skills developed through field experience are essential. Even if we improve efficiency by using AI in the future, we still need manufacturing technologies to make full use of such capability. Thus, we send our engineers to actual worksites, allowing them to see with their own eyes, and train in equipment designs by starting with design drawings. We will promote effective utilization of our Human Resource Development Center as our technology bank and hand down technical skills of our forebears and seasoned employees to the next generation so as to improve efficiency and productivity of the entire organization.
Promoting ESG Management – Strengthening Corporate Governance with the Aim of Achieving Highly Transparent Management
Based on our mission, we are promoting ESG management with an understanding that activities to enhance reliability and transparency of management as well as becoming a company trusted by all stakeholders will serve as the foundation for sustainable growth.
Considering corporate governance as a key management mechanism for transparent, fair, prompt and resolute decision-making, all Group companies are actively committed to improving corporate governance. We are enhancing internal control by proactively undertaking activities to advance compliance and risk management, in addition to expanding/ strengthening the management oversight functions of our highly effective Board of Directors, consisting of the optimal number of members, and the audit functions of our Audit and Supervisory Committee.
To inspect the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, we conduct evaluations by questionnaires given to all Directors including Outside Directors, and intensively deliberate at the Board of Directors on items that received poor evaluation or those that showed varied evaluation results. One of the issues from the past fiscal year recognized by the Board of Directors was “supervision of succession planning of the Chief Executive Officer, etc.” To address such issues, we will continue to ceaselessly strive for strengthening corporate governance via measures such as implementing activities to develop next-generation management candidates.
Promoting ESG Management – Social Contribution Through Practicing Our Mission
In recent years, SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) have garnered much attention, and a circle is forming with companies attempting to contribute towards solving social issues on a global scale. Because
IBIDEN has origins in supplying clean energy through hydroelectric power, we have proactively worked on power generation through a variety of clean energies including hydroelectric power and solar power, as well as production activities utilizing in-house power generation through gas turbine co-generation which puts a low burden on the environment. The reduction of the environmental burden in the manufacturing processes is in response to the expectations of our customers and codes of conduct determined by industry associations. With regard to contributions through our products, the Ceramics Operation, which started with a vision “to clean up the world’s skies,” has produced a group of products that contribute to the environment in the exhaust gas field using our unique technology. We will continue to make contributions through our products and strive to obtain support not only from the market but also from society by developing products that address social issues and capture changes in the mobility environment expected in the future.
Toward Improving Shareholder Value
IBIDEN has conducted management with a technology-first model, valuing core technologies while achieving growth by changing the technologies derived from our core technologies according to the needs of the times. Even though we are not optimistic toward the management environments of each operation, we strongly believe that the future market potential and management environments are hopeful, as seen in our decision to invest ¥70 billion in our main Electronics Operation, which is the largest investment since our establishment. We believe the complete execution of this investment, which will become a foothold for growth in the next generation or the generation after, is the key to successfully implementing the medium-term management plan.
Furthermore, we are focusing on forward-looking development of new businesses in addition to enhancing the competitiveness of our existing businesses. In R&D investment, for which we have set a target R&D expense to net sales ratio at 5%, we are even willing to press forward with making investments for the next generation, even if it means temporarily reducing the equity ratio to a certain degree, which we have maintained at over 60%, depending on the progress of development and circumstances in business opportunities.
In terms of return to shareholders, we plan to pay out stable dividends based on a dividend payout ratio of approximately 30% while expanding operations and improving profitability by conducting growth investments within cash flows generated from our operations. In addition, we will conduct further returns to shareholders as appropriate, including purchase of treasury stock, based on our earnings status and situation in the stock market. We would like to ask shareholders and investors for continued support of the Group going forward.

Business Overview and Results for FY2018
Net sales increased from expanding sales into new fields
Looking back on the business environment in FY2018 for the package (PKG) operation for personal computers, the overall PC market continued to shrink year-on-year. Amid this environment, sales grew in new fields and to new customers due to utilization of the Company’s strengths such as multi-layering, ultra-fine wiring, and miniaturization, as well as expanding sales mainly of PKG for servers. As a result, net sales increased compared to the previous fiscal year.
The motherboard and printed wiring board (MLB) operation supplies high-function, high-density printed wiring boards mainly for high-end smartphones. Although the smartphone market in FY2018 continued shrinking as with the PC market, the server market for data centers trended on a high level. As a result, net sales increased compared to the previous fiscal year due to strong sales of substrates for servers.
(Research by the Company)(Forecast)
Growth Strategies for FY2019
Respond to new demand with
proactive investment
While growth in the PC and smartphone markets, which have supported the Electronics Operation, are slowing down, we can expect future growth in the data center market as well as AI and in-vehicle markets due to the spread of 5G and ICT. In these two markets, we expect demand for high-function, fine electronic components, which are the Company’s strengths, to increase.
We will make a ¥70 billion capital investment between FY2019 and FY2021 in order to respond to new demand and manufacture IC package substrates for the next generation and in new fields. With this capital investment, we will support technologies that will be the focus in the next generation, such as self-driving and next-generation telecommunications systems, and proactively expand into fields where we can expect growth.
Going forward, we will continue proactively contributing to digital innovations that will enrich society while promoting selection and concentration of manufacturing systems and product lineup according to changes in the markets.

Business Overview and Results for FY2018
Decrease in ratio of diesel passenger vehicles impacted business results
Diesel particulate filters (DPF), which are the main product of the Ceramics Operation, met a harsh market environment due to a decrease in the ratio of diesel passenger vehicles primarily in Europe. As a result, net sales decreased year-on-year. With regard to other products, net sales increased year-on-year for substrate holding mats (AFP), which continued to expand sales in developing countries, NOx reduction catalysts(SCR), of which automotive products performed strongly, and graphite specialty products (FGM), for which promotion activities were conducted in new fields amid solid performance of the semiconductor market.
As a result, although sales increased in some fields, both net sales and operating income in the Ceramics Operation decreased compared to the previous fiscal year due to the heavy impact of the decrease in sales for DPF.
Growth Strategies for FY2019
Enhance competitiveness by selecting and concentrating resources
The DPF market, which is at our core, is expected to continue the diversification of power trains, primarily in passenger vehicle markets in developed countries. We are promoting restructuring of the production structure in order to tightly grasp this trend, one of which is the dissolution of IBIDEN DPF France S.A.S., our consolidated subsidiary. While IBIDEN DPF France used to manufacture DPF for European automakers, it is being dissolved in order to optimize and streamline the global production structure, in response to changes in the market environment such as the decrease in the ratio of diesel passenger vehicles mainly in Europe, as well as an increase in the ratio of new specification products that comply with stricter exhaust gas regulations (EU6d-Temp and EU6d). Meanwhile, demand is expected to grow going forward in the large vehicle market in developing countries due to stricter exhaust gas regulations. By concentrating our resources on growing markets, we will advance structural reforms of our operation.
With the aim of achieving further growth, we are planning to provide products for EVs that address the issues of weight reduction and comfort with materials, utilizing IBIDEN’s core technologies. In addition, we will create products that will become new growth drivers while utilizing IBIDEN’s technology, such as by developing lightweight and high-heat resistant ceramic composite material products for aircraft engines in addition to automobiles.

Four Development Centers
The four development centers have been established to create the third and fourth pillars that will follow the Electronics and Ceramics Operations. We are conducting research here on a daily basis with the aim of creating new products.
■Message from the Operation Manager, Technological Development Division
The four development centers were established in April 2017 within the Technological Development Division. We are developing new products that support new markets and purposes by evolving existing core technologies and proactively utilizing open innovation.
Because projects in development have been grouped together per product, it has become easier to formulate marketing strategies. Furthermore, the grouping has generated synergistic effects among our engineers, making speedy development possible. I believe this stance of “market-in” is important when developing products as well as the attitude of always being on the lookout for market trends without losing ourselves in development projects at hand. We will keep our eyes open for various kinds of information and create new business pillars by developing products with an acute sense of market needs.

■Human Resource Development Center for Improving Technical Skills
We have established the Human Resource Development Center within the Technological Development Division solely for the purpose of training
engineers to continue to inherit and pass on our technologies for the next hundred years.
 As a Source to Continue Creating IBI-TECHNO
The Human Resource Development Center trains engineers who work at our four development centers, as well as those involved in the Electronics Operation and Ceramics Operation. The Center also provides development support and guidance. Training ranges from the fundamental education required for engineers to training in specialized fields. Nurturing people to be well equipped with skills for the next-generation developments will lead to enhanced technological strengths for IBIDEN. Furthermore, in addition to these human resource development efforts, the Center is tasked with the role of a transactive memory that incorporates the technology and expertise held by each division with the aim of achieving efficient R&D and creating new innovation. It plays an important part as a source to continue creating the IBI-TECHNO of the future.
 Establishing a Human Resource Development System
That Looks Toward the Next 100 Years
Since establishment, the Company has transformed its core operations in various ways. The driving force behind these changes is “the power to overcome many adversities with all our employees and to continue to exist.” It is not easy to overcome turbulent times without the power of each and every employee, which is part of the reason “human resource development” is among the four activity pillars in the current medium-term management plan. The Company aims to put in place a human resource developing system that strengthens its corporate structure in order to continue developing for the next 100 years. Furthermore, we established the Human Resource Development Center within the Technological Development Division in FY2017. Here, we aim to develop the next generation of talent by offering a wide range of training from the fundamental education required for engineers to specialized fields.
Both the human resource development system and the Human Resource Development Center are indispensable for creating the future of IBIDEN. With these two types of human resource training as the foundation, we will nurture the ability for sustainable growth.
  ■Development of Global Human Resources
The IBIDEN Group aims to put in place a human resource development system that strengthens its corporate structure and enables it to achieve consistent progress and growth. To this end, we nurture employees who can contribute to strengthening competitiveness and those who are capable of cross-cultural management.
Especially we provide cross-cultural programs to improve communication skills with overseas staff and strengthen their local response while make efforts to upgrade their practical language skills. We also focus on nurturing the core staff of our overseas entities by inviting them to participate in training programs in Japan.
Practical English program
■Encouraging Career Development
We adopt a system that encourages personalized career development. We support career development through discussions in an interview with a superior concerning skills an employee wants to improve now and in the future and a superior’ s expectations and a support policy. We launched a self-development correspondence course enrollment assistance system to help employees develop their abilities.
Fundamental Policy for Human Resource Training
The four activity standards for this Center are the four components of the IBIDEN WAY:
Trust through Integrity, "Wa" Teamwork and Synergy, Challenge with Passion, IBI-TECHNO Innovation.
Our aim is to train people to be able to learn, think, and act by themselves to deliver results. We encourage an upward spiral process of self- improvement from mind to skill, then opportunity, and finally, self confidence, so that people can build competency independently.
Concentrate Consistent Training to the Human Resource Development Center
●The Human Resource Development Center is a facility where we can consistently implement training related to “process design,” “facility design,” and “schedule design,” which are elements necessary for a manufacturing company.
●Within the facility, we have put in place an area specialized in “safety,” which is a basis for everything. By offering education utilizing an exclusive training kit, we instill the awareness of “safety first” in all employees of the IBIDEN Group.
●In the future, we plan to establish an innovation lab in order to activate “open innovation,” which is an important factor for a company’s development.

■Equitable Evaluation and Treatment
To enhance business competitiveness, we believe it is important for each employee to challenge himself/herself to meet his/her own high expectations, achieve these expectations, and raise his/her organizational capabilities. The Company has in place a results-oriented target management assessment system. Challenge goals closely related to the Company’ s business results are first established, and the results as well as the process for reaching those results are then evaluated fairly and equitably. Finally, individual results are directly reflected in their compensation. Also, we promote communications between supervisors and subordinates when setting goals and in evaluation interviews in order to develop the subordinates.
The Company adopts a job-based grade system, which helps revitalize all employees, under which work is evaluated into grades based on the volume and importance of job results and job grades are set accordingly. Furthermore, the relationship between positions available according to qualifications and job grades is clarified. Employees in the same evaluation rank in the same job grade are equitably treated, regardless of attributes such as their sex, age and race and nationality.

■Organization of Occupational Health and Safety Management
As a means to minimize the risks and adverse health effects on people participating in the Company’s business activities, we have established a health and safety management system and received certification. In FY2014, we merged our entire management system including the environment, health and safety, and quality management systems as the IBIDEN Management System (IMS) and began its operations. Under the IMS, initiatives are deployed to each employee from various meeting bodies and acting organizations.
The Company-wide Environment/Health and Safety Committee meetings are held with the participation of the President, officers, directors, the presidents of affiliated companies, and the chairperson of the labor union, aiming to confirm the purposes of company-wide activities and the progress for the goals. Meetings of the Company- wide Zero Accident Committee, held monthly, are attended by each Plant Manager and management persons responsible for promoting health and safety at affiliated companies. The Committee functions as a place for establishing common ground in order to implement the Plan- Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle of activities of the entire IBIDEN Group. The information of these committees is disseminated from committee meetings held at each plant to safety circles of workplaces (small group activities) in which all employees participate.
■Promoting Health and Productivity Management ※1
The Group believes the physical and mental health of each and every employee is the foundation for competitiveness. We announced the “IBIDEN Group Health and Productivity Management Declaration※2” in June 2017, and we are proactively supporting employees to promote health with measures in which they can enjoy participating.
As a promoting structure, we have organized the “IBIDEN Group Health Subcommittee”, mainly with representatives from the Health Management Promotion Center (industrial physicians, public health nurses), Human Resources, Environment & Safety, IBIDEN Health Insurance Society, and IBIDEN Labor Union. By utilizing the strength of each participant, we promote health management and health promotion activities for the entire domestic group, such as walking events in which employees can participate.

■Basic activities and Specialized activities of Occupational Health and Safety
As part of the basic activities intended to develop a corporate climate in which the top priority is always placed on health & safety and compliance with laws and regulations, we have continued to engage in “Workplace Safety Circles’ Activities,” “Safety Patrol,” and “Raising Awareness through Safety Education.”
We are providing safety education in a systematic way, so that all employees can take the relevant training. As an example of safety education, the introduction of our hazard-simulation safety education has led to employees raising their safety awareness and acquiring the ability to avoid risks.
     ■Supporting Work Life Balance
The Company considers it part of its social responsibility to create an environment in which children, our future leaders, can grow up healthy and safe. To this end, we actively encourage work-life balance by, for example, helping our employees to achieve a balance between work and child rearing. Our company, obtained “Kurumin” Certification from the Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare in 2012 as a company that achieved the planned target and met certain standards among companies that formulated an action plan to support employees for their child-rearing based on the Law on the Promotion of Measures to Support Development of the Next Generation, which took effect in 2005.
■Promotion of Female Advancement
We started promoting women’s participation and advancement in the workplace in fiscal year 2010 and conducted various activities, such as improving the work-life balance system and offering training to female employees and managers for awareness-raising.
We are currently promoting efforts by announcing that we will proactively develop and appoint female employees in career positions. We will continue to appoint more female leaders with the purpose of revitalizing the corporate culture by promoting more female employees with expanded functions to play active roles in the workplace.
■Promoting the Employment of Persons with Disabilities
In order to realize a society where persons with disabilities can live together as members of local communities, it is important to encourage their independence through work, and employees with disabilities are playing an active role in the Company.
We established IBIDEN Oasis Co., Ltd. in October 2018, and it has been certified as a special subsidiary company in April 2019. Through stable hiring of persons with disabilities who are eager to work, we provide support for their professional independence through establishment of a safe working environment and ability development. Going forward, we will aim to achieve a working environment and culture in which diverse human resources can demonstrate individual abilities and feel rewarded to live and to work.
Safety training for engineers
■Occurrence of work-related accidents
We are working on occupational health and safety activities so that all employees of the entire IBIDEN Group can establish safe and comfortable workplaces and work vigorously with an awareness of “safety first” by putting in place four pillars of activities: “recurrence prevention,” “accident/incident prevention,” “health management,” and “disaster prevention.” The Company’s occupational accident frequency rate is at 0.51, which is lower than the national average of manufacturing companies. However, because the number of work- related accidents increased to five cases in FY2018 (equivalent to or more serious than cases of occupational accidents resulting in lost workdays), we are striving to strengthen management with the aim of preventing similar accidents by analyzing the cause of accidents that occurred and putting in place fundamental measures.

Ogaki City in Gifu Prefecture, where our domestic production bases are concentrated, is rich in underground water thanks to the Ibigawa River system. However, water shortages are a serious problem in the world today. Based on the principle of so-called 3R activity—initiatives to reduce, reuse, and recycle resources—the Group carries out business activities by integrating environmental technologies into manufacturing technologies, which has reduced the amount of industrial water use.
■Responding to the Regulations on Chemical Substances by Controlling Substances to be Contained in Products and in
Manufacturing Processes
IBIDEN uses various chemical substances in the manufacturing process. Since chemical substances may cause environmental pollution and human health hazards, the management of chemical substances is one of the risk factors. As the laws and regulations on chemical substances in each country are increasingly rigorous, the management of chemical substances is one of the key issues for the Group from a compliance perspective. To prevent these risks posed by chemical substances, we practice appropriate chemical control by defining the target chemical substances for complete elimination and reduction.
   Energy
Blessing of water
Chemical Waste substances
Four perspectives
●Energy (climate change):
Aim for zero CO2 emissions with the energy conservation and the use of renewable energy, and business contributions.
●Blessing of water:
Value the blessing of water and reduce the impact on water resources to the minimum. ●Waste (resources):
Reduce waste by minimizing the use of resources and maximizing recycling.
●Chemical substances:
Thoroughly control chemical substances contained in raw materials on a global basis.
    ■Measures to Supply Clean Energy
IBIDEN owns three hydroelectric power plants in the upstream section
of Ibigawa River in Gifu Prefecture. Hydraulic power generation uses the potential energy of water to create clean energy without greenhouse gas emissions. To maintain and increase its power output, IBIDEN implements repair work at its three hydroelectric power plants (Higashi Yokoyama Power Plant, Hirose Power Plant, and Kawakami Power Plant) systematically by repairing water supply tunnels※ and updating generators to the latest models.
※ Water supply tunnels: Tunnels for providing water to power plants
■Energy Conservation
As the Group consumes a large amount of energy through its
production activities—whether it is the temperature control during the manufacturing process of electronics or the electric furnaces used for ceramics—energy conservation is an important issue for us.
We are making a company-wide effort to perform the energy-saving management cycle in line with the Energy Conservation Meeting, which is held monthly by the production divisions and related functional divisions. We also monitor risk factors, such as energy cost increases, and work on improvements based on the idea that enhancing energy efficiency is linked directly to strengthening the Company’s competitiveness.
■Trends of GHG emissions
Energy-saving activities are conducive to reducing emissions of CO2, a greenhouse gas (GHG). The Group’s GHG emissions in FY2018 were 800,000 tons, most of which were energy-induced. As a medium- term target for reducing CO2 emissions, during the period from FY2018 through FY2022, we are aiming to reduce the basic unit per converted production volume※ by 5% compared to FY2017.
※ Converted production volume is used to calculate production volume.
■Projects to Promote Renewable Energy
IBIDEN Engineering Co., Ltd., a member of the IBIDEN Group, has
initiated projects in the field of energy solution by making optimal use of the Company's technologies to maintain hydroelectric power plants as well as manage co-generation systems. Established an integrated approach, in which its business includes design proposal, construction and maintenance, IBIDEN Engineering has a track record in many power generation business such as ranging from equipment for hydroelectric power plants and power substations to systems for solar power generation plants and small hydroelectric power plants. We will continue to promote business solutions for the energy problems.
■Projects That Contribute to Both Disaster Prevention and Environmental Protection
In Japan, which is a mountainous country, in order to boost the protection of slopes in difficult weather and soil conditions and to ultimately prevent the loss of life in landslide disasters, practices for securing artificial slopes have undergone many changes over the years with many improvements based on the testing of various methods and technologies through trial-and-error. Currently, in addition to a disaster prevention function, an environmentally-friendly “greener” construction method is expected for artificial slopes. IBIDEN Greentec Co., Ltd., a member of the IBIDEN Group, which has continued to provide new construction methods that achieve both disaster prevention and environmental protection, such as the “Totally Green” method, will create an environment where everyone can live safely and peacefully.

    Supply Chain Management Policy
To earn the trust of international community while operating business globally, both the Group and the entire supply chain must responsibly take actions that respond to social demands.
■IBIDEN Group Supplier CSR Guidelines
Measures for Supply Chain Management
By consistently developing cutting-edge technologies, IBIDEN contributes to the creation of a comfortable IT society as well as a society where cars and nature coexist through the proposal and supply of high-value-added products. Based on its “customer first” policy, the Group meets the needs of customers through unique technologies and designs that take into account the global environment. We understand that our greatest mission is to consistently supply safe and reliable products.
 Basic Procurement Policy
1 We will comply with laws, regulations and customs and build relationships based on mutual cooperation and trust with suppliers.
2 We will offer fair trading opportunities to suppliers.
3 We will fulfill our human rights, environmental and other social responsibilities through our
procurement activities.
  The basic policy for the quality
(Electronics) Based on the concept of quality first, we will achieve customer satisfaction by clearly grasping customer needs and producing and providing reliable products through IBI-TECHNO.
(Ceramics) Through IBI-TECHNO, we will incorporate customers’ real and potential needs and add values to such needs while striving to provide moving experiences to customers through our product- making, which continually gives top priority to quality.
 In order to lead globally developing operations into sustainable growth with our suppliers, we published the “IBIDEN Group Green Procurement Guidelines” in 2009, which are a mechanism to procure parts and materials with reduced environmental burdens, as well as the “IBIDEN Group Supplier CSR Guidelines” (hereinafter called “CSR Guidelines”) in 2011, which compile requirements for the entire supply chain, including human rights violation risks such as forced labor, corruption prevention, and responsible resource procurement.
    ■Communication and Cooperation with Supplier
In order to thoroughly implement CSR Guidelines throughout the entire
supply chain, we request our suppliers, including new suppliers, to pledge to comply with CSR Guidelines, as well as to evaluate the status of guideline compliance through CSR investigation and report annually. Furthermore, to confirm the actual status of suppliers and promote improvements, we make requests on improving issues addressed in CSR investigation as well as conduct site visits and audits to ask the suppliers for improvements to their activities. Each guideline is published on the Company’s website so that they may be reviewed by all stakeholders.
■Suppliers’ Compliance Counter
We set up a “compliance counter” for our suppliers to which suppliers can report any compliance problem while dealing with the Company. As with the compliance counter for our internal employees, information will be handled with the utmost care for privacy and the supplier will never suffer prejudicial treatment for contacting the counter.
■Responsible Sourcing of Resources (Conflict Minerals) Illegal mining of resources in conflict areas and high-risk areas has
become a major international issue as it abets human rights violations and environmental destruction. Our “CSR Guidelines” clearly state that the suppliers should refrain from illegal mining in conflict areas as well as procuring resources that may support human rights violations. Furthermore, we will conduct reasonable investigations into the mineral supply routes and disclose the findings in good faith.
CSR briefing for suppliers
■Quality Management System
The Group has received ISO9001 certification at main domestic and
overseas manufacturing plants and IATF16949 in operations related to the automotive industry. We are striving to offer products that exceed the expectations and needs of our customers.
In addition, the Company has integrated mechanisms for quality (ISO9001, IATF16949), environment (ISO14001), occupational health and safety (ISO45001), and corporate operations into the IBIDEN Management System, and operates with an aim to continuously improve our operational competitiveness and customer satisfaction. Going forward, we will continue to build a system to provide high-quality products on a global scale and upgrade the level of quality.
■Measures to improve quality
To contribute to our customers and the community with quality products, we conduct design reviews and hold quality assurance meetings to study the design and specifications at each stage of the manufacturing process, from the development of cutting-edge technologies, through product planning and design, to mass production. Furthermore, to improve quality, we offer guidance and audits, including assessment by the president, at workplaces in Japan and overseas and group companies, and also provide business partners with guidance for quality improvement.
■IBI-TECHNO Promotion Activities
IBIDEN has conducted IBI-TECHNO promotion activities in which all
employees from all divisions take part in achieving No.1 customer satisfaction by putting the IBIDEN Way into practice. The underlining philosophy is that our activities are designed first and foremost for our customers. Improving the four IBI-TECHNO(“Management of Business”, “Management of Technology”, “Total Productive Management” and “Management Capability”) will boost IBIDEN's corporate value and ensure a stable profit supported by strong competitiveness in the market. We also strive to give back to our stakeholders.

  Governance Structure Embodying the IBIDEN WAY
Corporate Governance
Basic Views
The Group considers corporate governance to be a key management mechanism for transparent, fair, prompt and resolute decision-making, and all Group companies are thus actively committed to improving corporate governance. As part of our Group’s corporate governance, we are enhancing internal control by proactively undertaking activities to advance compliance and risk management and we are expanding/strengthening the management oversight functions of our board of directors and the audit functions of our Audit and Supervisory Committee Members. These steps will enable us to construct a transparent corporate governance system worthy of the trust of shareholders and other stakeholders and fulfill our corporate social responsibilities, and will help us improve our corporate value through sustained growth.
Chart of IBIDEN Group’s Internal Control System
■Efforts to Strengthen the Functions of Audit and Supervisory Committee members
Audit and Supervisory Committee Members attend the Board of Directors meetings and other important meetings and audit Directors’ performance of their professional duties, and full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee Members collaborate with Internal Audit Group and Accounting Auditor in conducting audits of the Company and the Group companies in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and rules. The presence of three Outside Audit and Supervisory Committee Members with a considerable level of knowledge in financial affairs, accounting, and tax practice and law suitably ensures that the above functions are performed.
■Posting of Information on Securing Independent Directors and Executives
The Company has determined that Mr. Yamaguchi, Mr. Mita and Mr. Yoshihisa as outside directors and Mr. Kato, Mr. Horie and Ms. Kawai as outside Audit and Supervisory Committee members present no potential conflict of interest with general shareholders and, convinced that we can count on them to contribute to appropriate corporate governance at the Company and to offer advice on our standards of conduct, we have assigned them as independent directors.
■Policies and Procedures for the Selection of  Corporate Managers and the Assignment of
Director Candidates by the Board of Directors
Candidates for Corporate Manager and Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are selected/assigned from the perspective of placing the right person in the right job, with due consideration given to the number of people that would enable precise and prompt decision-making and to a balance of knowledge, experience and skills among the Corporate Management Team/the Board of Directors overall. Candidates for Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are also selected/assigned from the perspective of placing the right person in the right job, with due consideration given to a balance among knowledge of accounting, tax and legal matters, knowledge about the Company’s business, and other perspectives pertinent to corporate management. (For more information, please refer to page 45-48.)
Given the above, assignment for Audit and Supervisory Committee Member candidates is resolved by the Board of Directors after Audit and Supervisory Committee deliberates and agrees on it. Assignment for Corporate Director candidates, prior to a resolution of the Board of Directors, after it has been sufficiently deliberated by Nomination/ Remuneration Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, including Outside Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and reported to the Board of Directors.

  Evaluation of Effectiveness of Board of Directors
The Company conducts annual analysis and evaluation to verify if the Board of Directors functions effectively, with an aim to improve further function of the Board of Directors by continuing process to take measures to remedy problems and strengthen advantages.
<Further Tasks Acknowledged and Company Actions> 1 We recognize that it is necessary to distribute meeting materials (to Outside Directors) well in advance of a meeting date.
In addition to conventional explanation ahead of a board meeting, the Company built a process which the members can share information at the earliest possible time introducing a fully secure file-sharing system for preliminary consideration in FY2018. In future, to further improve efficiency, we will strive to share information with the Directors on the process of the certain framework and enable them to review all the agenda in advance of the meetings.
2 We recognize that it is necessary to implement measures to ensure
diversity within the Company.
The Company launched promotion of Act on Promotion for Women’s
Empowerment (“the Act”) in FY2017. We have supported promotion of female assistant manager and positively provided awareness-trainings for their superiors, improving ratio of female managers. Compared with FY2016, we have two more female managers and eleven assistant managers as of April 1st, 2019 thanks to the ACT. In the future, we will improve Diversity Action for a wide variety of staff not only women but also non-Japanese, veteran employees and people with disability in order to participate actively and develop themselves.

  Compensation of the Senior Management and Directors
Timely disclosure, Communication with Shareholders and Investors
■Board Policies and Procedures in Determining the Compensation of the Senior Management and Directors
The compensation for the Company’s Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and Executive Officers comprises monthly compensation and bonuses. The monthly compensation for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members is calculated based on their job positions, within the limits approved by the general meeting of shareholders, and is approved by the Board of Directors. Bonus allotments for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members are based on the degree to which each Director contributed to the Company’s operations, within the scope of the total amount of bonuses calculated using the stipulated formula approved by the general meeting of shareholders, and are approved by the Board of Directors. The monthly compensation of Executive Officers is approved by the Board of Directors. In determining the compensation, broad consideration is given to a suitable balance between the monthly compensation for Corporate Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, assessments of respective Executive Officersʼ and Managing Officersʼ
job performance, benchmarks of the same types of industries and the same size companies based on compensation surveys with external organization’s participation, and other factors. The amounts of bonuses to be paid are approved by the Board of Directors. Bonus amounts are calculated in accordance with the degree of the Executive Officers’ contribution to the Company’s business results and other factors. The Nomination/Remuneration Committee, including Outside Directors who are not members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, which was established as an advisory committee for the Board of Directors, prior to a resolution of the Board of Directors, deliberates on compensation and bonuses of Corporate Directors and Managing Officers who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, and reports to the Board of Directors. Outside Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members, because they are in positions independent of the execution of operations, are paid only a fixed, basic compensation.
The Company has also introduced ‘the Stock Distribution Trust for Officers’ to Directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee Members and Executive Officers, so that they shall make a clearer linkage between the Company’ s stock value and compensation for themselves and elevate their awareness of contributing to improving medium- to long term operating results and increasing corporate value.
■Relationships with Stakeholders and Timely Disclosure
Aiming to improve its corporate value, and based on our mission to meet our shareholders, our company group believes that we must fulfill our responsibilities to respective stakeholders other than shareholders, such as employees, business partners, investors, local residents, and local communities.
Based on the Disclosure Rules, which are intended to promote stakeholders’ understanding of the Group and to facilitate proper assessments of the Group, we disclose in a fair, timely, and appropriate manner with decisions on management-related information related to the Group by the Disclosure Committee, consisting chiefly of the president, the Managing Officers in charge of the Financial Department, and other relevant officers.
In addition to making every effort to comply with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and relevant rules, as well as the stock exchangeʼs regulations, we maintain our social credibility in the securities market through education for employees and strict management regarding regulations on insider trading in accordance with the Insider Trading Guidelines.
■Concept of our capital policies
Our company aims to increase shareholder value based on the growth of our business and improvement of profitability, and is disclosing our medium-term management plan. The basic policies of our capital policies are to maintain adequate capital stock standards and the shareholder composition required for stable business management in a changing business environment.
For return to shareholders, setting our target dividend payout ratio at 30%, we make a comprehensive examination of the balance between retaining sufficient earnings for investment in the business and long- term steady dividend payments to shareholders.
■Communication with Shareholders and Investors
The Company issued approximately 140 million shares and had about 26,000 shareholders as of March 31, 2019. We held a general meeting of shareholders in the multi-purpose hall in the IBIDEN Headquarters Building on June 14, 2019. We have sought to establish a more open environment by adopting the voting rights exercise platform from fiscal year 2006 and making possible the exercise of voting rights via the Internet and smart phones, etc., for shareholders who are unable to attend the meeting. (The ratio of voting rights exercised at the 166th general meeting of shareholders: 86.18%).
In addition, to ensure prompt disclosure, the Notice of Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders added elements of business report is available in our website and platform by a week before mailing it to shareholders. We will continue to promote prompt disclosure such as on our website before mailing.
As for other IR activities, we hold periodic briefings for analysts and institutional investors after the announcement of business results for the full year and those for the interim term, and release materials for the briefings on our website.
Furthermore, we take part in a range of events as briefings for individual investors, providing them with opportunities to invest in shares of the Company.

■Measures to Implement Intensively
  ■Measures to Implement Intensively 1. Business Continuous Plan
We consider the risk of disruptions to production caused by the occurrence of a large-scale accident or a disaster in areas where our plants are located as an important risk theme, and are taking measures to prepare for the occurrence of a disaster. As for measures to be taken when disasters such as earthquakes occur, we believe that lifesaving comes first, followed by the early supply of products to customers. With regard to concrete risk themes in the event of a natural disaster, including confirmation of the safety of employees, supply of materials by suppliers, equipment failure and occurrence of utility problems, we are building a response system, mainly led by divisions that cope with such risks. Assuming the occurrence of the Nankai Trough Megathrust Earthquake, we set a recovery time objective (ROT) for our plants and domestic affiliated companies that may be affected by the disaster.
2. Information Security Measures
Information concerning the operation, technologies and management of the Company is a valuable asset, and for a technology-development- oriented company like us, proper management of information including confidential information of customers and suppliers and prevention of leakage are important issues and responsibilities.
We have established a framework for information security promotion
and stipulated fundamental rules to comply with in utilizing and maintaining information assets we own such as trade secrets, personal information and information technologies (IT) under the “Regulations for Information Management.”
To improve the protection and utilization of information of the entire IBIDEN Group, we have established the Information Security Committee, chaired by the director in charge of Strategic Corporate Planning Operations.
For the operation of information security, we have kept all employees well-informed through the IT Promotion Managers’ Committee and compliance education.
As for personal information, we have established a personal information protection policy and stipulated procedures necessary for collection, management and utilization of personal information. Our personal information protection policy is available on our website. Falsification of data, etc., has become a social problem. Against this background, the IBIDEN Group, in fiscal 2017, introduced a data integrity audit, and is working to prevent falsification and incorrect handling of data for provision to customers.
In fiscal year 2018, there were no information leaks that could significantly affect our business activities.
1. Compliance Education
When promoting compliance activities, it is crucial that employee awareness is continuously maintained at a high level. The Company has been building educational system for employees to regularly receive training by job grade, in which the programs start immediately after hiring.
In addition to education based on the Standards for Employee Behavior, we are promoting special education programs, including ones focused on various laws and regulations and corporate taxation.
At overseas bases, which employ many immigrant workers, training is provided on educational training such as the Standards for Employee Behavior in workers’native language so that they can fully understand the contents of the training.
IBIDEN Standards for Employee Behavior
prevention of corruption in line with the current conditions of each site, such as stricter authority when paying social expenses, establishment of the Gift-giving and -receiving Guidelines, and development of the Whistleblowing System.
Also, we have promoted an effort for early detection and correction of fraud through such means as internal audits that use data. In fiscal 2018, there was no instance of legal violation with a significant influence on our business activities, such as the imposition of fines for malpractice.
3. Whistleblowing System
In addition to the formal channel of reporting, the Group has established a compliance consultation service to facilitate reporting when an officer or employee discovers a violation of compliance.
Through this service, officers and employees may report violations nominally to employees in charge of the compliance consultation service or anonymously to outside experts.
The consultation counters have been operated with due consideration for the protection of rights of whistleblowers, such as privacy protection and ensuring no disadvantageous treatment.

Financial and Corporate Data
    Overview of the Fiscal Year Under Review
During the fiscal year under review, the global economy saw moderate growth in the first half, supported by a strong U.S. economy and a recovering European economy. However, in the latter half of the year, uncertainties increased including a slowdown in the Chinese economy stemming from trade disputes between the U.S. and China, as well as political chaos surrounding the U.K.’s withdrawal from EU. In addition, in the domestic economy, the management environment surrounding companies is unclear, with weaknesses seen in parts of export and production due to the effects of trends in the uncertain world economy.
In the semiconductors and electronic components market, the server market for data centers experienced a high-level growth. However, the personal computer and smartphone market saw negative growth from the previous year and the environment surrounding the Company’s Electronics Operation prevents optimism.
The exhaust system components market in the automotive industry is under harsh conditions due to a decrease in the ratio of diesel passenger vehicle sales in the European passenger vehicle market, in addition to weak trends in the global automobile sales.
Given this situation, the Company started a new five-year medium- term management plan “To The Next Stage 110 Plan” in April 2018 in order to realize stable and sustainable growth. In the new medium- term management plan, we will enhance the competitiveness of our existing businesses based on human resource development and work on expanding new businesses that will support medium- to long- term growth. With regard to new businesses, we are working on developing new products and launching into markets quickly at the four development centers established in FY2017.
As a result, net sales for the fiscal year under review amounted to ¥291,126 million, a decrease of ¥9,278 million (3.1%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income totaled ¥10,138 million, a decrease of ¥6,564 million (39.3%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Ordinary profit amounted to ¥12,600 million, a decrease of ¥5,002 million (28.4%) compared to the previous fiscal year. Profit attributable to owners of parent for the period stood at ¥3,306 million, a decrease of ¥8,277 million (71.5%) compared to the previous fiscal year.

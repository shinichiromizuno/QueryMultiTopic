Activities in Fiscal March 2019
Initiatives in distribution
When transporting products not requiring express deliv- ery, we make use of rail freight containers instead of trucks to reduce CO2 emissions. We also utilize reusable folding containers in various sizes to deliver products to stores in an effort to reduce waste in the form of card- board boxes.
Reducing CO2 emissions with
mega solar projects
In 2013 we installed solar power generation panels using areas of the roof and other unused sections of our West Japan Logistics Center (Miki
City, Hyogo Prefecture). This
initiative reduces our emis-
sions of CO2. Total power
generated in fiscal March
2019 was approximately 1.4
million kWh.

Reduction of CO2 Emissions
Electric vehicle charging stations
We have installed electric vehicle charging stations at 100 AUTOBACS Group stores (as of March 31, 2019). On top of enhancing convenience for our EV and PHV customers, we promote environmental conservation activities across the entire Group.

 2 Product Recycling and Proper Disposal
In Japan, approximately 100 million tires, equivalent to 1 million tons, are disposed of every year. Used tires col- lected from customers at AUTOBACS Group stores are pulverized and processed into chips by specialists and are recycled as a source of thermal energy. At the factories of such specialists collecting used tires from AUTOBACS Group stores in Kanto’s vicinity, over 100 tons of used tires are brought in, selected, broken, and transformed into sources of energies every day. Used oils and bat- teries are also separated by material and processed cor- rectly by designated operators and are then recycled.
In addition, radiator liquids, bumpers, and aluminum wheels are separated by material and reused. Through recycling them by material, approximately 90% of an entire automobile’s parts are recycled. Recycling fees are used for transforming parts into different materials and for processing airbags and CFC gas that are cumbersome to process.
3 Recycling Car Freshener Packaging
Collecting and reusing
Since October 2017 we have been collecting empty car freshener prod- ucts that we sell in Japan. Part of the packaging is recycled and made into road safety reflectors.
This project is composed of the
Company, Febreze deodorizer and
air freshener manufacturer Proctor &
Gamble, and TerraCycle Japan, a firm
that provides assistance to corporate
recycling activities, and leverages the
respective strengths in cooperation.
The reflectors are donated to local elementary schools and associations that promote road safety.
TIRE
Processed at pro- cessing plants, recycled into road-surface raw materials and fuel, or reused as used and retread tires.
BATTERY
Have specialists disassemble and recycle into plas- tic and battery or neutralize them to properly dis- posed of.
OIL
Refined at pro- cessing plants and recycled into fuel for boilers, etc.
              4 Donations of Emergency Food Provisions and Addressing Food Waste
In addition to securing
emergency provisions for
employees in preparation
for the possibility of a large-
scale disaster, we donate
food and drink yet to
expire to the NPO Second
Harvest Japan, which runs food banking operations. We also participate in the Kyu-Can-Cho Project. This proj- ect involves the collection of emergency ration canned bread before its expiry date and the subsequent deliv- ery to famine-stricken regions around the world as part of charity goods. We will continue to implement these initia- tives given that they solve food waste and environmental issues, and also contribute to lower disposal costs.

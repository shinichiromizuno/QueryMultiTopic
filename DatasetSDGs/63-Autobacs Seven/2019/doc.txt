Challenges and Growth Trajectory
AUTOBACS was founded in 1974 as Japan’s first comprehensive specialty automotive goods store. After commenc- ing sales of private brand (PB) tires and oil in 1977, we soon commanded a leading share of the domestic automotive goods market by responding to the diverse tastes and needs of our customers with proprietary products and services. As not only cars but also society changes over time, the AUTOBACS Group continuously shakes up business formats, products, and services.
1974-
AUTOBACS Begins its Development as a One-stop Provider of Automotive Goods and Services
    AUTOBACS was es-
tablished in 1974, fol-
lowing Japan’s period
of rapid economic de-
velopment and at a
time of growing con-
sumer interest in personal car ownership. The re- tail distribution of automotive goods had yet to consolidate, and consumers had to go to a dif- ferent source for nearly every item they wanted to purchase for their cars. AUTOBACS provided a one-stop solution for purchasing and installing automotive products and met with strong con- sumer support.
With the proliferation
of personal car own-
ership came demand
for ways to individu-
alize cars and, as a
result, expansion of
the market for automotive goods. AUTOBACS responded by enhancing and enlarging its mer- chandise offerings, and taking innovative steps such as organizing product displays, and mak- ing product suggestions, based on lifestyle to more precisely respond to diversifying cus- tomer preferences.
With the transition to super-
sized retail stores in general,
AUTOBACS created Super
AUTOBACS megastores for car
lifestyle needs. Offering expan-
sive retail spaces, service bays
for product installation and maintenance work, CDs, and even a place to get a bite, Super AUTOBACS were also developed to feature a wide variety of events and serve the needs of everyone from first-time car owners to fam- ilies, and car enthusiasts. At the same time, AUTOBACS mounted a full-scale entry into the provision of statutory safety inspection services, thereby expanding its ability to support the needs of car lifestyles.

 2050 Creating Our Future Together
We face the issues of society, automobiles, and people’s lives and create a brighter, more vigorous future. Our energy comes from our customers. We will steadily grow, day by day, as individuals and as a company, as we continue to shine.
AUTOBACS Chain Management Philosophy
AUTOBACS has always been commit- ted to providing customers with the best solutions for their car lifestyles and creating a rich and healthy automotive society.
We will continue to be a company
indispensable to society
Since its founding, the Company has worked to bring advance- ments to the automotive society and enrich the car lifestyles of customers. Cars as well as society and our lives will undergo even greater transformations against the backdrop of the changes in the global environment, further technological innovations, and diversifi- cation of people’s values.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) launched in January 2016 demand companies worldwide to implement solutions to development issues through their busi- nesses. The target in which the Company can demonstrate leader- ship and contribute the most is “halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents” under “Goal 3, good health and well-being.” The Company intends to contribute to other goals as well by establishing an order of priority from our business fields.
In order to face these environmental changes and turn them into new growth opportunities, we established the “2050 Creating Our Future Together” vision.
We aim to become a “100-year company” indispensable to soci- ety, by continuing to challenge ourselves to create new values while further deepening relations of trust with all stakeholders.
As a company contributing to the development of a culture of enjoying cars and a professional in the car industry, we will con- tinue to leverage our knowledge, technological capabilities, and knowhow accumulated over 70 years to offer superior quality prod- ucts and services tailored to the lifestyles and life stages of cus- tomers and realize sustainable growth.

Corporate Value Creation Process
The business model for the domestic AUTOBACS business, which is our mainstay, is based on a franchise organization with 593 domestic stores operated by 76 franchisees, including 16 consolidated subsidiaries. Serving as the franchise headquarters, AUTOBACS SEVEN provides the approach for providing value to customers, while franchisees deliver a sense of security and an enriched car lifestyle through interaction with customers. Accordingly, our strengths are the franchisees and suppliers that underpin our domestic AUTOBACS business and the capabilities of each and every staff member working at our stores. These strengths are the source of our industry-leading brand power.

CEO Q&A
Under our mission of “We constantly create a new car life- style culture,” we will aim to achieve sustainable growth by promoting the newly formulated Five-year Rolling Plan 2019 and establishing and linking networks that transcend conven- tional barriers.
 Kiomi Kobayashi
Representative Director and Chief Executive Officer
 The Group has set forth three values to be provided into the future: “Demand for comfortable use of a car (safety and security)”; “Enjoy going out by car (experience and discovery)”; and “Be more of your- self with beloved cars (self-expression).” Under the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, we promoted product development and experimentation with new store formats as well as improved the profitability of AUTOBACS stores.
Meanwhile, competition with not only companies in the same industry but also in different industries is intensifying further, amid population decreases due to a declining birthrate and aging population and changes in customer needs. At the same time, as cus- tomers’ car lifestyles become increasingly diverse, new markets are expanding with the spread of elec- trification and automation of cars and of car-sharing
services. We expect the business environment of the Group to undergo even greater and more rapid changes. Under such circumstances, we determined that it will be difficult to increase earnings continu- ously under the existing plan and newly established the Five-year Rolling Plan 2019 which outlines the direction of the Group for the next five years.
Under this plan, the Group intends to turn future significant changes into new growth opportunities. To this end, we will develop business networks that cut across conventional barriers and create a new car lifestyle culture. We look forward to the ongoing sup- port of our shareholders and other investors as we push ahead with this effort.
  
A Look Back at the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan
Q1 Please give an overview of the results for the fiscal year ended March 2019, the second year of the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan.
In addition to improvements in the earnings of domestic stores,
we increased statutory safety inspections and maintenance services.
Under the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, the Group has taken a variety of measures based on two pillars: 1) restoring the competitive strength of the domestic AUTOBACS busi- ness by increasing the attractiveness of stores and products; and 2) developing new future businesses through overseas and new businesses.
As a result, the Group’s results for the fiscal year ended March 2019 were as follows. Net sales was ¥213.8 billion, up 0.7% year on year, operating income was ¥7.4 billion, down 4.0%, and net profit attributable to owners of parent was ¥5.4 billion, up 1.5%.
By segment, the domestic AUTOBACS business recorded decreases in net sales and oper- ating income due to store subsidiaries’ business transfer to a franchisee. Nevertheless, net sales of the domestic AUTOBACS chain was up 0.5% year on year. In fiscal March 2019, the wholesale gross margin for franchisees was restored to its original level. The wholesale gross margin had been lowered only during the previous fiscal year as a measure to boost store results. Even then, for the chain as a whole, the gross margin continued to improve, thanks to more efficient store inventories and increases in service sales, including statutory safety inspection and maintenance. In turn, the earning power of stores improved dramatically. On the sales side, tire sales decreased due to factors such as rebound decline following the previ- ous fiscal year’s demand increase as a result of snowfall in the Kanto area. However, sales of dashboard cameras rose owing to customers’ heightened awareness of safety.
Net sales for the overseas business grew, thanks to more stores in France and Thailand and increases in wholesale sales of oil and other products. In order to accelerate the global expansion of the wholesale business, we made AudioXtra Pty Ltd. in Australia a new sub- sidiary. Meanwhile, the retail business recorded higher operating loss. The car dealer, BtoB and internet business also faced challenges in securing profits.

 Q2 What achievements were made in restoring the competitive strength of the domestic AUTOBACS business?
We advanced efforts in five broad areas.
Number of purchases and purchase unit price increased
First is development of attractive products. We significantly expanded the lineup of our highly profitable private brand “AQ.” We also sought to create entirely new markets by launching car-related lifestyle brands “JKM” and “GORDON MILLER.” In response to increases in senior drivers, we enhanced the selection of dashboard cameras and put efforts into sales of original products, such as the sudden acceleration prevention device “pedal watcher.” We also endeavored to propose new car experiences through sales of drones and electric motorcycles with pedals. Such efforts have contributed to increasing the number of purchases and the purchase unit price per customer.
While the renovation of existing stores had some effects,
the number of new low-cost format stores did not increase as anticipated
Second is development of effective sales and operations that meet customer demand. We primarily promoted development of new store formats and reform of existing stores.
With regard to development of new store formats, we opened Japan’s first car-oriented lifestyle shop, JACK & MARIE Yokohama Bay Quarter, in March 2018. We now have four physical stores of the JACK & MARIE brand. We also renovated the Group’s flagship store, Super AUTOBACS Tokyo Bay Shinonome. In November 2018, it was reopened as A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME, which offers new discoveries and experiences by providing a comfortable space to spend with car goods and offering proposals tailored to different life- styles. Based on local needs, we renovated Super AUTOBACS Toyama-minami, targeted at customers who enjoy spending time in a garage, and Super AUTOBACS Morioka-minami, a store that all family members can enjoy. On the other hand, while we developed new store formats that provide a fewer selection of products and services and can be operated at low cost, we could not increase them as initially anticipated and are reviewing our plan.
As for reform of existing stores, based on analyses of customer service efficiency at each store, we made improvements in operations, including sales floor staff assignments and management of employee hours. We also made changes to sales floor zonings and car- ried out renovations to provide enhanced service bays and restrooms. Store reforms includ- ing renovation were implemented at 127 stores, equivalent to approx. 20% of all stores. Both sales and gross margin of each store staff are improving, and we intend to continue with the reforms at our other stores.
Increasing the number of store visitors remains a challenge
Third is inclusion of families and young customers. On top of the declining birthrate and aging population, car ownership is decreasing among young people. It is a top priority of the Group to increase the number of store visitors, mainly by increasing visitors in their 20s and 30s and tapping into the family market. Accordingly, we have gone beyond developing prod- ucts and store formats. We also make use of the Customer Voice Program that feeds back customer opinions to the stores to improve their operations and have thereby enhanced our guidance for the stores. Furthermore, we integrated our AUTOBACS shopping point with T-Point for greater convenience. However, competition with car dealers and other industries, such as online retailers, is becoming more intense by the day, and the number of store vis- itors still has not increased. We will introduce membership programs to increase loyal cus- tomers and review effective allocation of marketing expenses, including social media and other digital advertising.

Developed system for training and securing mechanics
Fourth is securing, developing, and activeating energizing human resources. Personnel shortage is becoming increasingly serious in Japan. As personnel are indispensable at AUTOBACS stores, we started by taking initiatives focused on retaining our employees. Specifically, we enhanced career supports and improved the workplace environment. We also heightened personnel motivation by actively awarding staff and stores selected by cus- tomer opinion and strengthened our personnel evaluation system.
To secure mechanics, which has been a particularly significant issue, we established Chain Growth Co., Ltd. in March 2017 to serve as an institution for fostering and training mechanics who will be dispatched within the chain. We also developed schemes for them to acquire mechanic certification in a short period of time. In addition, we train overseas technical trainees as mechanics, albeit their permitted length of stay in Japan is stipulated, and they are actively accepted at AUTOBACS stores.
Furthermore, every year, from a pool of approx. 3,700 mechanics at all our stores, we select “AUTOBACS GUYS” to serve as role models embodying “Professional & Friendly” and they appear in a TV commercial. As a result of such initiatives, women mechanics’ active roles stand out in recent years, and diversity is steadily improving.
Cutting logistics costs and other issues still remain
Fifth is strengthening the business platform. Some achievements were made in this con- nection, including increases in operational efficiency, decreases in IT costs, and purchasing reforms at administrative departments. However, we still struggle with reducing logis- tics costs which are rising due to external factors and with making store operations less labor-intensive.
Q3 What progress was made in the development of new future businesses?
We put efforts into our overseas and
new businesses to establish drivers of future growth.
Achieved an earnings model for global wholesale services
In the overseas business, we provide wholesale service as well as retail and maintenance services at stores, according to the different needs of each country. In the wholesale busi- ness, with the AUTOBACS brand having a high reputation and trust as a Japanese brand, we proceeded to develop products in each region and expanded sales routes in China, Russia, the ASEAN region, and elsewhere. We further expanded sales routes by making Australia’s wholesale company AudioXtra Pty Ltd. a subsidiary. We have thus achieved an earnings model for global wholesale services. In the retail business, on the other hand, we view improving the earnings of especially our stores in France and Thailand as an urgent matter.
In parallel with advance investments, commenced structural reforms of earnings
For new business, we are focusing our efforts on the car dealer, BtoB and internet business. In the car dealer business, we increased dealerships. At the same time, in order to strengthen inventory management among stores and increase earnings from services such as maintenance, we established a subsidiary to oversee the car dealer business and renewed the management structure.
In the BtoB business, we integrated two subsidiaries that promote wholesale and other services to non-AUTOBACS chain stores: Cores International Inc. and Palstar K.K. Their busi- nesses were restructured into CAP Style Co., Ltd. This company is working to improve earn- ings, aiming to become a general trading company for automotive goods with both product development and merchandising consulting functions. In the internet business, we are working with franchisees to accelerate the co-creation of a system that fuses internet and physical shopping.

     AUTOBACS Chain
Five-year Rolling Plan 2019
Q4 Why did you newly establish the Five-year Rolling Plan 2019? Establish networks that meet various car lifestyle needs
The 2017 Medium-term Business Plan promoted product development and experiments with new store formats and improved store profitability. However, when we took into account the future business environment, we determined that it would be difficult to increase earnings into the future under the existing plan. Therefore, we reviewed the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan and established the new Five-year Rolling Plan 2019 which out- lines the direction of the Group over the next five years.
Under its mission, “We constantly create a new car lifestyle culture,” the Group tran- scended conventional barriers and developed the AUTOBACS business format, which is Japan’s first one-stop shopping store for automotive goods. Nonetheless, the 2017 Medium- term Business Plan initiatives made us realize that we had actually confined ourselves to the AUTOBACS business format and put ourselves on the defensive by establishing barriers ourselves. So long as this is the case, we will not be able to continue growing in the present era and beyond.
The new Five-year Rolling Plan 2019 is based on a firm recognition that business does not end with selling products. Notably, it gets rid of the retail business framework. The Plan establishes broad networks that connect to markets which have not been accessed before or markets that will be newly created. We will develop networks that address the various needs of customers related to car lifestyle.
Specifically, we will aim to realize medium- to long-term growth by establishing and link- ing six networks: AUTOBACS chain network; overseas alliance network; multi-dealer net- work; pit service network to provide the best service; maintenance network to adapt to next-generation technology; and online network to enhance relationships with customers.
While this will be centered on a business model comprised of headquarters, directly managed stores, and community-based franchisees, we will expand the network on mul- tiple fronts if necessary without limiting ourselves to the AUTOBACS name. Rather than strengthening what we currently have, it aims to evolve them into something new.
Q5 Please elaborate on the six networks.
Organically fused networks that offer services to customers while
using existing stores and the internet
Establishing and linking six networks does not mean building physical infrastructure such as new store networks. It means building organically fused networks that can offer the best prod- ucts and services needed by customers while making use of existing stores and the internet.
The first network, AUTOBACS chain network, will provide three values at the stores in Japan: “safety and security”; “experience and discovery”; and “self-expres- sion.” The second one, overseas alliance network, is a network for overseas development, sales, and service provision centered around the wholesale business.
   Next-generation maintenance
Overseas Alliance
Pit Service Online
The third network, multi-dealer network, encompasses not only the accommodation of multiple vehicle types, including both domestic and imported cars, but also leasing and car sharing services that do not require car ownership. Rather than simply selling cars, it will link with other net- works to increase added value such as maintenance.
The fourth network, pit service network to provide the best service, sin- gle-handedly accepts installation and replacement services even for prod- ucts purchased online or at other stores. The fifth network, maintenance network to adapt to next-generation technology, is a maintenance net- work requiring next-generation technology, such as the advanced safety
  Multi-dealer

technology “aiming” (function adjustment) and on-board diagnostics (OBD) statutory safety inspection. These two networks are designed to ready ourselves for automobile manage- ment that will change significantly going forward.
The last or sixth network is online network to enhance relationships with customers. So far, the Group has been engaged in primarily services of physical stores. This network will secure means to access new customers through e-commerce, online reservations, and more. It is also expected to create great synergies by closely linking with other physical networks.
Q6 How will the new plan be implemented?
Transformed to execution and monitoring system that assures
effectiveness of strategy promotion
While the Rolling Plan that was established is a five-year plan covering the fiscal years end- ing March 31, 2020 to March 31, 2024, the timeframe will not be treated as fixed. The five- year vision will be examined every fiscal year based on changes in the environment. We will review the strategy and add revisions to the initial plan as needed. Focus will be placed on developing a platform for sustainable growth for the future. Numerical targets will be announced each year.
At the same time, we fundamentally transformed our execution and monitoring system to ensure that business is executed. First, based on our transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, three of seven directors are independent outside direc- tors. This will increase the feasibility and pace of strategy promotion as well as enhance external monitoring. We also reviewed evaluation of executive officers, and introduced a stock-based remuneration system for those who concurrently serve as directors and offi- cers. By promoting value sharing with our shareholders, the Group will be managed in a way that seeks to increase corporate value continuously from a medium- to long-term per- spective. For new business, we established a system that enhances coordination across departments. For the BtoB and internet businesses that are key to future growth, we assigned officers in charge, and carved them out as businesses for them to gain momen- tum. Additionally, we will continue to step up efforts to create a company-wide culture that encourages people to embark on challenges.
Q7 Lastly, what are your priority measures and results plan for the fiscal year ending March 2020?
Expect improvements in store earnings to continue and to achieve increases in revenue and profit
Aim for 100% five-year cumulative total shareholder return ratio
In the fiscal year ending March 2020, we are planning consolidated net sales of ¥223.0 bil- lion, up 4.3%, operating income of ¥8.0 billion, up 7.0%, and net profit attributable to own- ers of parent of ¥5.8 billion, up 5.7%. Although the effects of the consumption tax hike are unclear, and the year also falls on a cycle when the number of cars subject to statutory safety inspections will decrease, we forecast that improvements in store earnings will con- tinue, resulting in increases in revenue and profit.
As for priority measures, in parallel with advancing the Five-year Rolling Plan 2019, we aim to make further progress with developing the business platform and shift to a leaner earnings structure to support immediate earnings. Specifically, taking into consideration the insight and challenges we became aware of from the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, we will seek to optimize management resources in the domestic AUTOBACS business, expand retail earnings, review experimental store formats, downsize overseas retail businesses, and reconstruct IT and logistics platforms. The current financial base is firm. We intend to return all of the cumulative profits over the next five years to our shareholders.

Officer (Finance & Accounting, Legal and IR & PR)
 Q1 What efforts are you making to improve profitability indicators such as ROE?
Rigorous monitoring and clear-cut growth investments
The return on equity (ROE) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 improved moderately to 4.4% from 4.3% of the previous fiscal year. We are of course aware that this fig- ure falls far short of the expectations of our shareholders and consider closing the gap as our major management challenge. To improve capital efficiency, we will promote earnings reforms of existing businesses and improvement of resource efficiency with greater speed, while at the same time making active investments in growth.
With regard to growth investment, now that renova- tion investment in A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME has been completed, we will increase investment in store renovations. In addition, in order to establish six networks
in line with the Five-year Rolling Plan 2019, we will carry out bold business investments, including M&A. However, it would be pointless if hasty investments lead to deteri- oration in profitability. We will therefore implement these initiatives carefully without rushing, with a clear image of our future growth.
For the Group’s business investments and in the M&A decision-making process, we set appropriate hurdle rates and make investment decisions based on the type of business.
Under the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, we have also actively invested in pilot store development and new businesses. We will thus conduct rigorous monitoring including a study of such investments. We will steadily raise our earning power through a clear-cut finance strat- egy, making prompt investments in areas that need investment, while quickly terminating investments that should be suspended.

Q2
Could you provide an update on the progress of the earnings improvement measures taken so far? What concrete measures will you take going forward?
We intend to create a more centralized system and ensure that this is reflected in cost benefits in three to four years.
In the overseas business, we intend to increase wholesale by strengthening our tie-ups with local part- ners and switching to a local capital-led approach for expanding overseas stores.
Combining share buyback and dividend, aim for a cumulative 100% total return ratio over five years
The financial policy in the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan outlines that the consolidated dividend payout ratio will be 50% to 100% in principle for realizing proper shareholder returns based on business performance. According to this policy, in fiscal March 2019, we main- tained a high dividend, paying out a per-share annual div- idend of 60 yen (consolidated dividend payout ratio of 90.1%). Regarding future shareholder returns, we intend to achieve cumulative total return ratio of 100% over the five years of the plan and realize stable and adequate shareholder returns. In fiscal March 2020, we plan to pay the same amount of dividend as the previous fiscal year. We have an adequately solid financial base and consider that equity need not be increased any further during the five-year period.
20
 Further improve business platform and create a lean business structure
Under the 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, a particu- larly noteworthy achievement was the improvement in store earnings of the domestic AUTOBACS business. Two fiscal years ago, we lowered the wholesale gross margin as part of the measures to boost franchisees, and this has led to improvements in earnings.
In fiscal March 2019, we undid this special measure. Even then, franchisees as a whole including store subsid- iaries achieved record high earnings for the second con- secutive year. This is primarily attributed to improvement in the inventory turnover rate due to reduction of excess inventory and increase in the works ratio at highly profit- able service bays. In fiscal March 2020, we aim to further improve store earnings by further improving inventory management, along with increasing our share in the stat- utory safety inspection market of which we still only have about a 3% share.
Meanwhile, improving wholesale profitability centered on product sales remains an issue. We are considering enhancing our lineup of tires and private brand “AQ.” products and promoting their sales, as well as fundamen- tally reducing logistics costs and headquarters costs.
As regards Company-wide initiatives, we aim to increase our overall earnings power and create a lean business structure. We will do this by further raising the efficiency of our fixed businesses through adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) and deploying it to stores with a staff shortage and to development depart- ments. Furthermore, we have cut the IT costs of head- quarters’ administrative departments by shifting to cloud- based systems and increasing maintenance efficiency.

 Summary of Fiscal March 2019
Net sales of the domestic AUTOBACS business dipped 1.2% year on year due to the effects of transferring the business of store subsidiaries to a franchisee. Segment profit dipped 6.2% year on year. However, groupwide net sales for the domestic AUTOBACS chain increased 0.5% on both a same store basis and total store basis. With regard to sales, sales of dashboard cameras increased. The number of statutory safety inspections performed also increased by tapping into the cyclical demand since September. In addition, the total number of automobiles sold increased due to targeted strengthening of sales activities in used car purchasing and sales.
Future Key Initiatives
• Boost tire sales
• Strengthen the development and sales of
private brand merchandise
• Expand sales of statutory safety
inspections
• Improve profitability of used car purchasing
and sales business
• Improve store operations
• Renovate stores
• Improve earnings at store subsidiaries • Expand profits in new store formats
   Summary of Fiscal March 2019
Net sales of our overseas business increased 18.0% year on year; however, segment loss grew. In the retailing and services business, sales increased in Thailand where we have made active efforts to deploy small stores to gas station malls. In Singapore, while maintenance ser- vice for car sharing registered steady sales, store sales decreased. In France, operating loss rose due to the effects of inclement weather and protests. In the whole- sale business, operating surplus was recorded in China. In Australia, AudioXtra Pty Ltd. became a consolidated subsidiary.
Future Key Initiatives
• Expand wholesale business • Step up new store openings • Offer new services
   Summary of Fiscal March 2019
Net sales of the car dealer, BtoB and internet business increased 5.6% year on year; however, segment loss grew. In the imported car dealer business, sales rose thanks to increases in dealerships and strengthening of our sales structure. However, profits worsened due to fac- tors such as inventory devaluation at some dealerships. Profits of the BtoB business improved through raising oil wholesale prices and enhancing the lineup of private brand merchandise. In the internet business, we carried out structure reforms, while at the same time construct- ing online shopping platforms for the BtoB business.
Future Key Initiatives
Car Dealer Business
• Remodel existing stores and bolster earnings • Expand dealerships
BtoB Business
• Switch to best-selling products and those with high profit margins
• Secure new suppliers
Internet Business
• Upfront investment in platform construction • Improve existing online shopping website
   Summary of Fiscal March 2019
Net sales of other business decreased 6.1% year on year, and segment profit decreased 1.4% year on year. This is primarily due to decreased revenue from insurance-re- lated fees.

 Store Support Under Franchise System
1 Sales/ Marketing Support
As the franchise headquarters, the Company helps pro- pose and implement store reforms based on head- quarters policy. This is done by assigning over 100 supervisors to sales divisions in 12 areas across Japan under the sales headquarters, one for east Japan and one for west Japan, while making store visits once or twice a week. Counselors offer guidance on sales floor compo- sition and product lineup, taking into account changes in local customer needs and competition. In addition, super- visors study and standardize success cases in an effort to enhance the strengths of individual stores. Meetings attended by the management, executives, and store managers of franchisees are also held regularly to ensure close coordination with the Company.
2 Human Resource Training Support/Dispatch of Mechanics
The franchise headquarters provides supports for stores’ planning of OJT and human resource development. Furthermore, it holds seminars for store executives to
learn about proposing strategies for individual stores and management for improving performance. The Company also trains mechanics and dispatches them within the chain through its subsidiary, Chain Growth Co., Ltd.
3 Operation Reform/Renovation Support
With the aim of creating attractive stores, we sup- port store renovations and operation reform through our Customer Voice Program, drawing on the opinions of customers who visited the stores. In the fiscal year ended March 2019, 127 stores were renovated, including improving in-store navigation and beautifying service bay restrooms.

 Domestic AUTOBACS Business
To differentiate ourselves from competitors in the maturing automotive goods market and tap into new customer segments, we offer the three values of “safety and security,” “experience and discovery,” and “self-expression,” along with promoting product development and store format development.

In the fiscal year ended March 2019, store earnings of the domestic AUTOBACS business improved. For franchisees as a whole, including store subsidiaries, earnings exceeded that of the strong performance registered in the previous fiscal year. For the second consecutive year, a record high profit was set. This was thanks to increased sales of prod- ucts, such as tires and dashboard cameras, and expanded share of service sales, such as statutory safety inspections and maintenance. At domestic store subsidiaries, ongo- ing efforts were made to improve the gross margin, includ- ing by managing inventory, such as reduction of immobile inventory, and refraining from unnecessary changes in sell- ing price. The earnings improvement is also attributed to increases in efficiency due to reforming store operations based on analyses of store customer service, including revis- ing sales floor staff assignments and reviewing employee work content to allocate more time for customer service.
In the fiscal year ended March 2019, the number of statutory inspections performed rose 2.3% year on year to approxi- mately 648,000, partly owing to the increase in the number of vehicles subject to inspections in Japan since the sec- ond half of the year. Following on from the previous year, we kicked off the second round of “AUTOBACS GUYS” in which we select a number of mechanics working at our stores to be involved in our advertising campaign to convey their tech- nical skills and passion for automobile maintenance.

At the end of March 2018, we revised the CARS fran- chise chain agreement to enhance used car purchasing and reduce costs of CARS stores. We also closed five unprofitable used car purchasing stores in order to inten- sify our sales activities. As a result, the number of auto- mobiles sold in Fiscal March 2018 increased to a record of approximately 310,000.

for safe driving assistance products
 To meet the basic “safety and security” needs of our customers, we are endeavoring to expand our selection of maintenance products that need replacing regularly, like tires and engine oil, centered around the devel- opment of private brand merchandise. Furthermore, the recent social situation has led to rises in demand for safe driving assistance products, such as “pedal watcher” sudden acceleration prevention device and dashboard cameras that can record front and rear views. We are leading the way in the industry to expand
our offering of such products. We are also focusing on selling tires, our key item, as a set with wheels, and are enhancing our lineup, including all-season tires.

 Wholesale Business
With an increasing need for the products of the Japanese brand AUTOBACS, we have actively expanded sales channels by making Australia’s AudioXtra Pty Ltd. our new consolidated subsidiary in October 2018. We also develop and produce not only Made in Japan products, but also products competitive in each region and distrib- ute them across countries. We currently sell oil produced in Japan in Russia, China, and the ASEAN region, while maintenance products such as brake pads produced in China are sold in Indonesia. We aim to expand opera- tions by making wholesale a core part of our overseas business.

    Imported Car Dealer Business
The business of a dealership in Suginami-ku, Tokyo was newly transferred to the Group. We have acquired trading rights to BMW/MINI and are their official dealer with a total of ten locations in Japan, five of which are in Tokyo and the other five in Tochigi Prefecture. Against this background, in April 2019, we established AUTOBACS DEALER GROUP HOLDINGS Co., Ltd., a subsidiary over- seeing the imported car dealer business. Accordingly, we intend to rebuild our inventory management system, strengthen the earnings structure by promoting higher earnings in maintenance which is expected to have syn- ergies with the AUTOBACS Group. At the same time, we will seek to further increase the number of dealerships.
BtoB Business
In the fiscal year ended March 2019, we raised oil whole- sale prices amid the ongoing severe environment, includ- ing surging costs of oil and distribution. In addition, we integrated two subsidiaries engaged in the wholesale business, Cores International Inc. and Palstar K.K. We established CAP Style Co., Ltd., a general trading com- pany for automotive goods having the functions of both product development and merchandising consulting. This business merger has resulted in some positive impacts, including enhanced lineup of private brand merchandise, which has helped to improve the earnings structure of the BtoB business. We are also strengthening our sales structure and increasing distribution efficiency for sell- ing replacement parts and automotive goods to corporate customers.

  Activities in Fiscal March 2019

For the purpose of improving the value the AUTOBACS chain delivers to customers, we have put in place more than thirty stratified educations and training systems for mainly store staff. We offer a multitude of different group training sessions on topics such as leadership, sales skill improvement, or wheels and undercarriage, and with a total of 91 sessions held in fiscal March 2019, together with e-learning and other initiatives like OJT at stores, we hope to see significant benefits. We are also striving
2 Career Support
Based on the concept that “employees build their own careers by themselves,” at AUTOBACS we have a number of schemes to support the career formation of employees.
Career rotations and skill enhancements
Our personnel system is based on a combination of job rotations and the enhancement of skill levels every few years so that all employees can accumulate knowledge and experience. We have also established an internal job posting and free agent system and implemented person- nel movement within the Company. Under this system, employees who meet certain conditions can aspire to work in a position they have set their sights on. Moreover, we have established a course for specialist workers which takes into account the orientation and aptitude of each and every employee and assists their career formation in line with individual characteristics and aspirations.
Personnel development program
We have in place a so-called “cafeteria plan” through which employees can choose to take any of the roughly
3 Work-style Reforms
In addition to promoting the creation of a workplace where each and every employee can work safely and remain healthy, we are working to establish an environment in which our employees can feel enriched, fulfilled, and safe at work.
Supporting various working styles
In the midst of mounting societal demands to tackle issues such as an ageing society, work-life balance, and globalization, we are implementing a number of initia- tives to provide various work-style options to employees with the goal of establishing an environment in which our employees can work energetically. Such options include shorter working hours, half-day paid leave, telecommut- ing (with no limitations on frequency or reason), satel- lite office-based work, staggered starting times, and the enhancement of ICT-based communication tools.
to enhance the quality of in-store services by boosting staff knowledge, technical skills, and motivation, with an assessment system linked to our internal Group qualifi- cations, such as Car Lifestyle Advisor and Car Lifestyle Consultant. We also focus on training that assists employees in acquiring automobile mechanic, automobile inspector, or other public licenses, and we are seeing a steady increase in the number of qualified employees.
160 courses offered by external organizations. Some courses are offered in the form of correspondence learning, or public seminars, while others promise pub- lic qualification. The plan assists the voluntary career development of our employees and we provide mone- tary assistance with subsidies up to ¥100,000 per person per year. So far, 1,193 employees have utilized this plan. As an incentive for skills development, we also provide a bonus to employees that have acquired certain public qualifications designated by the Company.
Internship
Our summer internship program was held ten times for three days at a time and offers students that are begin- ning to choose potential employers a chance to work on-site in a variety of job roles, visit our facilities, and par- ticipate in various workshops so that they can be con- vinced when making decisions. This program gives us the opportunity to hear the opinions of the younger, next-generation, while students get the chance to start thinking about their future career paths.
Open Days for employee’s children
Since August 2015 we have hosted a Open Days for employee’s children every year. This event affords a rare opportunity for children to see their parents at work and not only deepens their understanding of what their par- ents do for a living, but aims to encourage employees to think about their work and family life. In fiscal year 2019, 27 mainly elemen-
tary school students had fun taking part in a road safety quiz, cash register roleplaying, and Company facility tour.

4 Promoting Diversity and Inclusion
Making AUTOBACS an easier place for women to work
Based on our belief in
no corporate growth
without diversity, the
Company’s view is
that “an easier place
to work for women
is a better place for
everyone.” To this
end, we are endeavoring to establish a workplace envi- ronment where women can easily return to work follow- ing various life events such as marriage, childbirth, and child-rearing.
Initiatives for fostering female executives
The Company has partly launched a mentoring system for female employees, and as part of our career devel- opment activities, we host an interactive workshop for female executives and regular employees. In addition, as part of efforts to create a workplace culture where women can thrive, we implement a program regarding diversity acceptance in our management trainings. We also provide individual counseling on work and home life compatibility and career formation.
A workplace where employees can keep working after maternity and childcare leave
At the Company we have many female employees of par- enting generation that emphasize the importance of both family and career, and 100% of them return to work after maternity and childcare leave. We attribute this to vari- ous initiatives, such as a longer timeframe during which employees with children (up to sixth year at elementary school) can work shorter hours, as well as the implemen- tation of the “Female Tasks” career assistance project.
Creating a workplace full of diversity
In the globally expand-
ing businesses of the
AUTOBACS Group,
there are more and
more opportunities for
foreign employees,
both in Japan and over-
seas. As part of our hir-
ing of disabled persons, we are also working hard to create an environment in which people with disabilities can find it easy to work by establishing a system that offers a choice of flexible working styles.

Yuki Tanaka (Legal Department) Childcare leave: Two months
I did not take childcare
leave for my first child.
For my second child,
however, as my first
child was still young
and a handful, I was
set from the start to
take advantage of the
system. While I had
concerns about work, I
was able to devote myself to childcare with the under- standing of my department. As many things happen unexpectedly with childcare, I was conscious about using time more efficiently. Taking childcare leave also gave me a good opportunity to be more attuned to my community and broaden my horizons. The time I spent face to face with the growth of my child during this period is irreplaceable. I encourage any male employee who is considering childcare leave to take a longer one than I did.
Takuya Nanjo (A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME) Childcare leave: One and a half months
I took childcare leave
due to concerns about
my wife’s physical
condition. Although I
was the first male to
take childcare leave
at my store, the store
manager thought it
was a great idea and
was supportive when I
consulted him. Consequently, I was able to take child- care leave feeling relieved. During my leave, my wife and I overcame difficulties by working together while enjoying the experience, and we are now even closer. I also had more opportunities to talk with people in the community with whom I had no contact before. This has enabled me to carry on a range of conversa- tions with customers at my workplace and helped me grow personally. I hope to contribute to the Company by supporting men who are thinking of taking child- care leave.

 5 Health Initiatives
We focus on health-promoting initiatives based on our statement on health, which declares that we recognize health is the utmost management foundation indispens- able for our broad-ranging corporate activities. We aim to be a company that contributes widely to society by pro- moting “health management” to foster human resources with a strong awareness of what it means to be healthy, both physically and mentally.

Health management training
Mental healthcare, health counseling
Every year all employees at the Company undergo a men- tal health check performed by external specialists for the purpose of mental care. We also have in place a system whereby employees can seek counseling at a designated institution and our occupational physician provides regular health consultation and mental health counseling sessions.
DBJ Employees’ Health Management Rating
Our health initiatives have been rated the highest rank three times (2015, 2017, 2019) under the DBJ Employees’ Health Management Rating, which is used by the Development Bank of Japan to deter- mine lending terms.
No Smoking Promotion Business Consortium
The Company is a member of the No Smoking Promotion Business Consortium, a consortium estab- lished in partnership by the Tokyo Medical Association and Japan Cancer Society and comprised mainly of companies with head- quarters and offices in Tokyo.
Certified as 2019 Health and Productivity Management Organization (White 500) The Company has been certified
as a 2019 Health and Productivity Management Organization (White
500) by a program sponsored by
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry and Nippon Kenko Kaigi.
Specifically, in 2014 we set forth
a statement on health and estab-
lished the Health Management Office at the Company, as an effort to make health counseling easily accessible to employees. Furthermore, we promote the Data Health Plans, in addition to holding seminars and disseminating information on health internally.
  If an employee is
found to have a life-
style disease-related
condition at their peri-
odic health examina-
tion, they must follow
the instructions of
the occupational phy-
sician and undergo
dietary and exercise
training in order to
improve their health condition. Depending on the severity of their health condition, improvement measures will be separately prescribed, while follow-up examinations will also continue for a certain period.
Meal improvement program “Office Okan”
In fiscal March 2019, we
launched “Office Okan” at
the headquarters and some
other places, with the aim
of improving the meals of
employees and preventing
lifestyle diseases. The ser-
vice offers dishes that allow
employees to eat a balanced lunch at a reasonable “one coin” price. Starchy dishes, protein dishes, vegetable dishes, and sal- ads selected monthly are delivered to the designated refriger- ator in the office and can be purchased from 100 yen a dish.
  Health management training
    Comment from Head of Human Resources and General Affairs Department
The Company, since its founding, has identified “the health of employees is a com- pany asset” as one of the three main pillars of its management, and considered that the health of employees and corporate management are interlinked. Currently, as a struc- ture for realizing health management, the Health Promotion Council chaired by the CEO is in charge of health management planning, while the Health Management Office led by myself as the Head of Human Resources and General Affairs Department is in charge of its execution. Occupational physicians and health nurses actively collaborate with the Company to promote health by sharing information as necessary, while being affiliated with the Health Management Office. We will continue to advance initiatives that pro- mote the mental and physical health of employees, which in turn will further strengthen the foundation of the Company.

AUTOBACS SEVEN Environmental Policy >
https://www.autobacs.co.jp/en/sustainability/environment.html
Activities in Fiscal March 2019
Initiatives in distribution
When transporting products not requiring express deliv- ery, we make use of rail freight containers instead of trucks to reduce CO2 emissions. We also utilize reusable folding containers in various sizes to deliver products to stores in an effort to reduce waste in the form of card- board boxes.
Reducing CO2 emissions with
mega solar projects
In 2013 we installed solar power generation panels using areas of the roof and other unused sections of our West Japan Logistics Center (Miki
City, Hyogo Prefecture). This
initiative reduces our emis-
sions of CO2. Total power
generated in fiscal March
2019 was approximately 1.4
million kWh.

 2 Product Recycling and Proper Disposal
In Japan, approximately 100 million tires, equivalent to 1 million tons, are disposed of every year. Used tires col- lected from customers at AUTOBACS Group stores are pulverized and processed into chips by specialists and are recycled as a source of thermal energy. At the factories of such specialists collecting used tires from AUTOBACS Group stores in Kanto’s vicinity, over 100 tons of used tires are brought in, selected, broken, and transformed into sources of energies every day. Used oils and bat- teries are also separated by material and processed cor- rectly by designated operators and are then recycled.
In addition, radiator liquids, bumpers, and aluminum wheels are separated by material and reused. Through recycling them by material, approximately 90% of an entire automobile’s parts are recycled. Recycling fees are used for transforming parts into different materials and for processing airbags and CFC gas that are cumbersome to process.
3 Recycling Car Freshener Packaging
Collecting and reusing
Since October 2017 we have been collecting empty car freshener prod- ucts that we sell in Japan. Part of the packaging is recycled and made into road safety reflectors.
This project is composed of the
Company, Febreze deodorizer and
air freshener manufacturer Proctor &
Gamble, and TerraCycle Japan, a firm
that provides assistance to corporate
recycling activities, and leverages the
respective strengths in cooperation.
The reflectors are donated to local elementary schools and associations that promote road safety.
TIRE
Processed at pro- cessing plants, recycled into road-surface raw materials and fuel, or reused as used and retread tires.
BATTERY
Have specialists disassemble and recycle into plas- tic and battery or neutralize them to properly dis- posed of.
OIL
Refined at pro- cessing plants and recycled into fuel for boilers, etc.
              4 Donations of Emergency Food Provisions and Addressing Food Waste
In addition to securing
emergency provisions for
employees in preparation
for the possibility of a large-
scale disaster, we donate
food and drink yet to
expire to the NPO Second
Harvest Japan, which runs food banking operations. We also participate in the Kyu-Can-Cho Project. This proj- ect involves the collection of emergency ration canned bread before its expiry date and the subsequent deliv- ery to famine-stricken regions around the world as part of charity goods. We will continue to implement these initia- tives given that they solve food waste and environmental issues, and also contribute to lower disposal costs.
    Mt. Fuji Cleanup Activities
Environmental conservation activities with various stakeholders
Mt. Fuji is registered on the World Heritage List. However, the foothills of the mountain unfortunately see a lot of unauthorized dumping of rubbish, includ- ing many tires. Every autumn we take part in a cleanup operation with the NPO Fujisan Club, employees, former employees, and foreign trainees work- ing at franchisees. In October 2018, approximately 40 volunteers participated in the 18th cleanup.

Assisting Safe Driving through Our Products
                 5
Community Monitoring Services Using IoT Technology
We sell the “Pedal
Watcher” sudden acceler-
ation prevention device, in
order to prevent accidents
caused by drivers who are
elderly or are not used to
driving and mistake the
accelerator for the brake.
In addition, we support
safety and security by offering dashboard cameras and car navigation devices designed to assist safe driving.
8 Raising Traffic Safety Awareness through a Picture Book
Through industry-academia
collaboration with BAIKA
Women’s University, we
published a picture book
on traffic safety entitled
Mugi-chan no Pan (Mugi’s
Bread). Based on the theme
of “traffic safety,” a story
unfolds about a bear named
Mugi who is riding a mobile
catering trailer with his father to town to sell bread, and along the way, interacts with various animals. Some of the proceeds from the picture book were donated to Kotsuiji Ikueikai (Scholarship Foundation for Traffic Accident Orphans). Some stores hold storytelling events and read the picture book to local children.
 In November 2017, we
began new initiatives
and demonstration tests
using IoT technology for
ensuring the safety and
security of the elderly
and their families. In
March 2019, we entered
into a Comprehensive
Cooperation Agreement with Oita Prefecture. Using the IoT platform “WEAR+i” developed by the Company under the theme of safety and security, the agreement aims to revitalize the region and improve services for people in the prefecture in eight areas, including road safety and envi- ronmental protection.

Brand Management
  Our Vision (Policy)
The AUTOBACS Group strives to offer values to society, as a strength of our corporate brand developed since its founding. At the same time, we have established systems to guard against the following critical risks which could harm the brand through business activities.
  Product Quality Management
Product Quality Guidelines
Recognizing that the products and services we provide customers are directly linked to their safety, AUTOBACS SEVEN strives to maintain and further improve quality by establishing the AUTOBACS Group Product Quality Guidelines.
Autobacs Group Product Quality Guidelines >
https://www.autobacs.co.jp/en/sustainability/society/ quality.html
1 Product Quality Standards
We manage product quality according to the Product Quality Control Regulations. We carry out multifaceted quality control of the private brand products we sell, along with national brand products. This includes working with manufacturers and suppliers to ensure the legality of the products and their uses and protect consumers based on the Product Liability Act.
2 AQL Standards
We outsource the production of many private brand products to overseas factories. With the aim of stabiliz- ing quality, we conduct audits and provide advice at such manufacturing sites. In addition, private brand products are inspected based on the globally adopted Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) immediately before factory shipment or at the time of arrival at the logistics centers.
3 Product Failure Hotline
Defective products may be mixed in with national brand products, albeit rarely. In such cases, we oblige our sup- pliers to submit a corrective action report, and review and propose preventative measures involving the quality con- trol system and the manufacturing process. Furthermore, we have introduced a Group online bulletin board called the “Product Failure Hotline” to share information with Group stores in a timely manner.
Service Quality Management
1 Quality Management of Works at Service Bays At the Group stores, customer safety is given foremost pri- ority at all times when changing tires and carrying out other works. To this end, we have developed manuals on works at service bays and manuals for preventing wheel detachment. We also strive to enhance the staff’s skills by establishing a mechanic certification system, and through technical train- ing and e-learning. For statutory safety inspections, 15-min- ute inspections are conducted with guidance provided from the Company to the stores, in order to unify the Group’s work, improve quality, and increase work efficiency.
2 Certification of Hybrid Car Compatible Stores To perform maintenance on hybrid car batteries, laws and regulations require taking a special seminar on handling low voltages. In addition to offering “hybrid training” for Group employees, the Group certifies stores as “hybrid car compatible stores” if they have the following: special seminar on handling low voltages; insulation equipment; diagnostic machinery; and hybrid training. Certified stores have signboards by their entrance. As of the end of April 2019, 391 stores have been certified.
3 Personal Information Risks
For protecting personal information, the Group imple- ments optimum measures to ensure information security and publishes its private policy to inform those inside and outside the Group. In case of personal information leak- age, we have established an internal communication sys- tem to minimize the impacts on the holders of personal information and ensure that the business activities of the Group are unaffected.
  Certified by Third Party Inspection Body,
TÜV Rheinland Japan
Since July 2017, the Company has a business alliance with TÜV Rheinland Japan, a third party that excels in audits of the automobile after-sales market. Under this alliance, we have taken steps to redevelop the facility and environmental standards of service bays at automo- tive goods stores, while offering higher quality works at service bays. As a result, in July 2018, the “Automobile Goods Retailer Maintenance Factory Certification” was conferred in Japan for the first time to two stores of the AUTOBACS Group, Super AUTOBACS KUKI (Kuki City, Saitama Prefecture) and AUTOBACS Fujiidera (Fujiidera City, Osaka Prefecture).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Corporate Governance

Non-executive directors, acting as observers, attend meetings of the Executive Committee and express their opinions on deliberation of matters as necessary.
well as other requirements for independence stipulated by the Company. Furthermore, efforts are made to ensure that at least one of the directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee has considerable insight on finance and accounting.
The Company has established the Corporate Governance Committee as an advisory body for the Board of Directors, chaired by an outside director and comprised of all the out- side directors and a representative director. When deciding on resolutions of the general shareholders’ meetings regard- ing selection of director candidates and dismissal of directors, the Board of Directors makes a decision after obtaining the advice and findings of the Corporate Governance Committee.

Corporate Governance
Remuneration
Director Remuneration
1) Basic Policy
The basic policy on determining director remuneration is to secure as AUTOBACS SEVEN directors outstanding individuals who will work to maintain and increase the cor- porate value of the Group, which comprises a franchise system, and contribute to the effective functioning of the business supervisory function.
2) Remuneration Standards
Standards for remuneration shall be set by considering third-party survey data on executive remuneration, and taking into account the Company’s position in the industry and factors such as difficulty of achieving targets and spe- cific roles of individuals.
3) Composition and Basic Concept of Remuneration
Remuneration for executive directors and officers con- sists of fixed basic remuneration, an annual incentive that is determined in accordance with the degree of achieve- ment such as performance in a single year, and a medi- um-to-long term incentive aimed at giving medium-to-long term incentives. Outside directors and directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members are paid only fixed remuneration which is set according to their role.
a. Basic remuneration
The scope of control and responsibility, degree of influence on the management of the consolidated Group, and achieve- ment in the previous fiscal year are considered in determin- ing the basic remuneration from the remuneration table.
b. Annual incentive
Individuals’ assessment items are set based on the eval- uation criteria, namely, a single-year consolidated ordinary profit target which is an evaluation indicator common to all executive directors and officers, financial performance figures such as evaluation indicators tailored to an indi- vidual’s area of responsibility, and the degree of achieve- ment of a strategic target which cannot be measured by financial performance figures alone. The annual incentive is designed to fluctuate within 0-180% of the remunera- tion standard amount, according to the degree of target achievement.
c. Medium-to-long term incentive
To improve performance and corporate value over the medium-and-long term and better share values with shareholders, shares with restrictions on transfer will be issued in advance in accordance with the amount set for each remuneration table.
4) Remuneration Determination Process
The objectivity and transparency of the Company’s remu- neration system for directors (excluding directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members) and offi- cers are secured by having the Corporate Governance Committee deliberate and provide input on these mat- ters. The remuneration of directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members is decided by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, within the limit of the remu- neration amount resolved in advance at a general share- holders’ meeting.

Compliance
The Company is moving forward with the strengthening of its compliance system and is stressing to employees of the parent company, subsidiaries, and all AUTOBACS Group stores, including franchise stores, the importance of pursuing business activities that are legally and ethi- cally irreproachable.
Respect for the law and corporate ethics is a given. With that as a fundamental premise, the Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Action have been established in
Risk Management
The Company, in addition to a risk management system for properly identifying and evaluating risks and implementing proper controls, has also adopted a comprehensive risk man- agement structure integrating crisis management focused on limiting the extent of damage, and minimizing damage and losses, caused by a serious incident.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the representative director and chief executive officer, sets the risk management policies for the fiscal year and, based on the poli- cies and provisions concerning risk management, takes steps to smoothly and appropriately advance risk management activities.
response to the legitimate expectations of all stakehold- ers and serve as fundamental principles in efforts to rein- force compliance understanding and conduct education initiatives for employees of not only the Company but also franchisees. Checks are carried out once a year to deter- mine whether any activities inconsistent with the Code of Conduct or Guidelines for Action have taken place, while a system for rapidly responding to any problems that come to light has also been established.
The Risk Management Committee identifies key risk-re- lated issues for each fiscal year and monitors measures to address them. The General Affairs and Internal Control Department, Legal Department, Corporate Audit Department and Customer Services Department cooperate to assist monitoring by the Risk Management Committee.
In addition, the officer in charge of general affairs reports to the Board of Directors on serious incidents and responses to them, as set forth in the rules for reporting on serious inci- dents, and shares these reports with the Audit and Supervisory Committee and other relevant departments within the Company.

    Evaluating the Board of Directors
The Company analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of the Board of Directors to examine whether it is properly fulfilling its roles, find the issues at the Board of Directors, and promote its ongoing improvements.
In this fiscal year’s effectiveness evaluation, all directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee members answered, in the for- mat of multiple choice or short answer, evaluation items, including “operation of Board of Directors,” “agenda of Board of Directors,” “composition of Board of Directors,” “system of supports for out- side directors,” “role of Audit and Supervisory Committee members and expectations of them,” “operation of the Corporate Governance Committee,” “relations with investors and shareholders,” and “ini- tiatives in response to issues indicated in the previous fiscal year’s evaluation.” The Corporate Governance Committee analyzed the responses and identified the issues, and the findings were then shared with and discussed in-depth by the Board of Directors.
As a result of such evaluations, it was confirmed that the Company’s Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee are for the most part functioning properly. As for the issue found from the evaluation that took place in the previous fis- cal year of “a need to improve monitoring, including status of the Medium-term Business Plan,” it was evaluated that improvements were made compared to the previous fiscal year. However, it was confirmed that more active discussions were needed regarding mea- sures in response to the monitoring. In regard to “debate on long- term visions, policies, and strategies,” it was evaluated that there was still room for improvement.
Based on the above evaluation findings, it was confirmed that an issue to be addressed was enhancing discussions at the Board of Directors, along with implementing the PDCA cycle by, improving the system of the monitoring of agenda items not only to share the results but also to conduct studies and consider measures as needed.

Conversation Between CEO and Outside Director
   Kiomi Kobayashi
Representative Director and Chief Executive Officer
We aim for corporate management that meets the expectations of shareholders from a medium- to long-term perspective.
Yoshiko Takayama Outside Director (Independent Director)
What are you particularly mindful of in your role as outside director?
Takayama I personally am very conscious of two aspects: the medium- to long-term aspect; and securing shareholder profits. With regard to the medium- to long-term aspect, there are no differences in view between internal and out- side directors. Therefore, I believe my important mission is to check how the expectations of shareholders are incorpo- rated into corporate management. The management at the Company interacts with customers, suppliers, and employ- ees on a daily basis and knows their opinions firsthand. However, they have few opportunities to interact directly with shareholders. In this regard, it is one of the essen- tial roles of outside directors to supervise to ensure that the shareholder perspective is not lacking from corporate management. In my case especially, I have interacted with shareholders and investors for many years. Based on such background, I believe I am expected to draw on my experi- ence and insight to contribute to increasing the Company’s medium- to long-term corporate value.
What do you consider as the expectations of shareholders and investors?
Takayama Shareholders would like the Company to be managed such that it generates returns exceeding capi- tal costs over the long-term and in a stable manner. They assess management policies and business strategies from this standpoint. To this end, the Company is asked to make the necessary changes. However, when making an important internal decision, many challenges arise as one would expect. As a result, the Company may hesitate to carry out bold trans- formations. In such times, it is my role to ask whether the capital market will positively evaluate the measure in ques- tion and encourage the Company to address priority issues.
Kobayashi You indeed are the voice of the shareholders who support our corporate management from a medium- to long-term perspective. As you say, with internal discussions alone, our attention may become focused on customers, franchisees, and employees and we may not notice that the shareholders’ viewpoint is missing. I expect you will super- vise us rigorously on such fronts.
What is your assessment of the current structure of the Board of Directors?
Takayama As to whether it has the size and composition to fully fulfill its supervisory functions, with regard to size, the Company transitioned to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee this fiscal year, and as a result, the number of directors changed from eight to seven. I think this is an appropriate number, neither too many nor too few, for adequately discussing critical management issues and mak- ing speedy decisions. As for composition, three of the seven directors are outside directors, which is to say outside direc- tors make up 43% of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the outside directors are a diverse group with members hav- ing various backgrounds. I believe they, as a team, can study and analyze management from many angles and provide objective advice and supervision. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee is set up to select director candidates and deliberate remuneration for members of the Board of Directors, Audit and Supervisory Committee members, and officers. The Committee is comprised of three outside direc- tors and one president, and the chair is an outside director. It discusses important issues of corporate governance, and I view that both independence and objectivity are secured.
What are your thoughts on the effectiveness of the Board of Directors?
Takayama “Effectiveness” is an abstract term. With respect to the actual operations of the Board of Directors, specifically there are three requirements that are essen- tial elements for raising the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Do the members, including outside directors, fully understand the content and background of the agenda items? Is adequate time being spent on discussing import- ant items? Are the items being analyzed, studied, and dis- cussed from multiple perspectives? With regard to whether there is full understanding and whether adequate time is being spent, the Company has quite a unique arrangement. At the Company, the Executive Committee meets before the Board of Directors. Unlike the executive committees of other companies, it is a forum for discussion among all directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee Members,
     
including outside directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee Members. It is not simply for providing prior explanations. All members express their frank opinions and hold in-depth discussions regarding matters that officers intend to raise to the Board of Directors. Many matters not fit for discussion at the Board of Directors are also raised at the Executive Committee, and heated discussions take place involving both internal and outside members. This arrangement enables outside directors to deepen their understanding of the Company’s issues and carry out effi- cient and effective deliberations on important agenda items at meetings of the Board of Directors.
Kobayashi We are in the process of transitioning from top- down management, which dates back to the years when car ownership soared and automotive goods were flying off the shelves, to a system of promoting changes in store format, products, and services through a bottom-up approach. For this process, communication between officers and super- visors is extremely important, and we are thus consciously promoting open communication at the Board of Directors. The meetings of the Executive Committee held beforehand also have an atmosphere supporting exchanges of various views. The Company has always had a culture of taking out- side opinions seriously.
What is your view on developing a succession plan?
Takayama A succession plan is about establishing a long- term system for fully training professionals with the creden- tials to lead the Company. I have an understanding of the issue that a succession plan needs to be fully developed. Now that the transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee has been completed, the Corporate Governance Committee will further delve into the discus- sions on programs for training top management.
Kobayashi The succession plan is a key management issue. We need to carefully consider what credentials and abilities are needed by top management, bearing in mind the changes in the times in the long-term. They must be able to lead franchise stores, demonstrate leadership internally, and beyond capabilities and skills, have the human qualities to be respected by those around them. While deepening dis- cussion with outside directors on such matters, we hope to create a system for fostering management profession- als and selecting them based on appropriate procedures.
Are there any challenges with human resources which are fundamental for providing the AUTOBACS values?
Kobayashi The trust that has been built up over many years has given AUTOBACS its reputation and created the value of the Group. The AUTOBACS name is supported by the actions taken by each of the over 14,000 employees of the Group. In this sense, we are working to secure and train human resources as a key management issue. A major issue in particular is the decline in certified car maintenance personnel. The Company has an institution within the Group to train certified mechanics in a short period of time. Even
then, there are not enough, and we are accepting over 100 technical trainees from overseas. With the birthrate declin- ing and population aging at an accelerated pace in Japan, we will need even more overseas human resources. We are therefore currently putting efforts into enhancing the envi- ronment for accepting overseas human resources, includ- ing living supports.
Takayama As regards women’s empowerment, the Company has an environment that enables women to con- tinue working for a long time, including childcare leave. However, there aren’t role models in the Company. This is an issue to be addressed. The Company has many outstanding women employees, and many women are certain to assume key positions in the medium- to long-term. The Board of Directors makes a point of regularly discussing the arrange- ments for promoting women’s empowerment and how they are reflected in the number of women in managerial positions.
What are you mindful of in terms of contributing to the common global theme of the SDGs?
Takayama Adapting to the SDGs involves two aspects: the Company’s responsibility as a corporate citizen; and growth opportunities. Both are important. Since manage- ment resources are limited, the Company should engage in efforts upon making clear what can be done effectively in line with its businesses. It is very important under the Company’s management strategy that the Company pro- vides safety and security in a motorized society, and thereby, contributes to good health and well-being which is one of the SDGs. Gender equality as well as decent work and economic growth are also items that the Company should address with priority for its future growth. All stakeholders will no doubt be facing the same direction in the medium- to long-term, and I am confident that implementing corpo- rate management that satisfies customers and employees will lead to increasing shareholder returns.
Kobayashi We are also making steady efforts in the area of environment. For example, we conduct activities to pro- mote recycling of used tires collected from customers. We are also developing a system for tracking whether waste disposal operators have disposed of waste appropriately, including batteries. With Japan expected to start introduc- ing mandatory fees for plastic shopping bags, we will need to consider measures even more than before.
Our business does not end with selling products. We pro- vide services that go beyond the statutory safety inspection system in terms of maintaining a certain level of car func- tions at all times. We take pride in fulfilling a certain role in providing safety and security. Recent years have seen rapid advances in technological innovations of cars. For example, more cars are equipped with a system that maintains a cer- tain distance between vehicles using a sensor, as well as a system that brakes automatically. Conversely, it means that if such high-tech equipment fails to function, there would be a higher risk of causing a tragic accident. In response to such needs, we consider it our responsibility to create high quality support services to achieve target 6 of SDGs 3, good health and well-being.

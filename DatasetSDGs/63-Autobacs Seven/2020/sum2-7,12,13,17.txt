ESG: Environmental Conservation
Our Vision
The Company takes into account the impacts our business activities have on the environment and aims to realize a sustainable society by ensuring proper waste disposal and reducing our environmental burdens at our stores and during distribution.
Key Themes
Reduction of CO2 emissions in our business processes and recycling of used products SDGs  SDG Targets
Target 7.2: By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowl- edge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable de- velopment and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development
Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to cli- mate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse
Target 17.17: Encourage and promote effective public, public-pri- vate and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships
     AUTOBACS SEVEN Environmental Policy
 In September 2011 the Company established the AUTOBACS SEVEN Environmental Policy, and promotes environmentally friendly business operations as a fran- chise chain headquarters.
Activities in Fiscal March 2020
1 Product Recycling and Proper Disposal In Japan, approximately 100 million tires, equivalent to 1
million tons, are disposed of every year. Used tires col- lected from customers at AUTOBACS Group stores are pulverized and processed into chips by specialists and are recycled as a source of thermal energy. At the factories of such specialists collecting used tires from AUTOBACS Group stores in Kanto’s vicinity, over 100 tons of used tires are brought in, selected, broken, and transformed into sources of energies every day. Used oils and batter- ies are also separated by material and processed correctly by designated operators and are then recycled.
In addition, radiator liquids, bumpers, and aluminum wheels are separated by material and reused. Through recycling them by material, approximately 90% of an entire automobile’s parts are recycled. Recycling fees are used for transforming parts into different materials and for processing airbags and CFC gas that are cumbersome to process.

Electric vehicle charging stations
We have installed electric vehicle charging stations at 103 AUTOBACS Group stores (as of March 31, 2020). On top of enhancing convenience for our EV and PHV customers, we promote environmental conservation activities across the entire Group.
Initiatives in distribution
When transporting products not requiring express deliv- ery, we make use of rail freight containers instead of trucks to reduce CO2 emissions. We also utilize reusable folding containers in various sizes to deliver products to stores in an effort to reduce waste in the form of card- board boxes.
Reducing CO2 emissions with mega solar projects
In 2013 we installed solar power generation panels using areas of the roof and other unused sections of our West Japan Logistics Center (Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture). This initiative reduces our emissions of CO2. Total power generated in fiscal March 2020 was approximately 1.4 million kWh.
Developing environmentally friendly private brand products
We are working to minimize the amount of waste gener- ated by the packaging of our private brand products by reducing the weight and reviewing the materials of such packaging.

  3 Recycling Car Freshener Packaging
Collecting and reusing
From October 2017 to March 2020, we collected empty car freshener products at AUTOBACS stores and recycled the plastic from those prod- ucts to create road safety reflectors.
This was a joint collaboration between
AUTOBACS SEVEN; Procter & Gamble
Japan, maker of the Febreze brand of
deodorizers; and TerraCycle Japan,
which supports corporate recycling
activities. The project draws on the
strengths of each company. The recy-
cled reflectors created through the project were donated to elementary schools and organizations that promote road safety.
4 Reducing Use of Plastic Bags
In October 2019, we stepped up efforts to reduce the use of plastic bags, including by encouraging cus- tomers to bring their own bags and displaying posters. This was before a law mandating charges on plastic bags was enacted in July 2020.

  Since April 2020, we have sequen-
tially introduced a system for charging
fees on plastic bags. We also help
reduce plastic waste with our own
reusable bags. For customers who
wish to use them, we have made
the bags more durable and reusable
rather than disposable. In addition to
plastic shopping bags, we are looking
to reduce the use of plastic bags gen-
erated in our stores, with the aim of
making our stores more environmentally friendly.

Vision
Becoming a 100-year Company
Over more than 45 years, in parallel with advances in the motorization of Japan, AUTOBACS SEVEN has provided cus- tomers with the best solutions for their car lifestyles and contributed to increasing the enjoyment and convenience of living with cars. The AUTOBACS Group aims to become a “100-year company” that is indispensable to society by con- tinuing to address issues facing society, automobiles, and people’s lives and creating a rich and healthy automotive soci- ety, in order to help resolve social issues stemming from cars.
  2050 Creating Our Future Together
We face the issues of society, automobiles, and people’s lives and create a brighter, more vigorous future.
Our energy comes from our customers.
We will steadily grow, day by day, as individuals and as a company, as we continue to shine.
We constantly create a new car lifestyle culture
Recent times have seen major transformations in society and people’s lives, in addition to cars, against the backdrop of changes in the global environment, increasingly complex social issues, technological innovations, and diversification of people’s values.
In particular, the spread of COVID-19 has changed what is considered “normal” around the world.
Cars are an important part of the infrastructure supporting our daily lives, so we are committed to providing the best possi- ble services to protect the safety and security of our customers. To this end, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a valuable oppor- tunity to rethink our raison d’etre, which is to continue operating our business while giving full attention to the pandemic and thus contribute to local communities and society.
To face these environmental changes and turn them into new growth opportunities, we established the “2050 Creating Our Future Together” vision as part of our mission—“We constantly create a new car lifestyle culture.” We aim to deepen relation- ships of trust with all of our stakeholders, while continuing to create new value in our quest to become a “100-year company” that is always sought after by society.
 AUTOBACS SEVEN is a company that fosters a culture of car enjoyment and is a professional in the car industry. In these roles, we will continue leveraging our knowledge, technological capabilities, and know-how, accumulated over 70 years since our foundation, to offer superior-quality products and services tailored to the lifestyles and life stages of customers, and thus deliver sustainable growth.

Challenges and Growth Trajectory
AUTOBACS was founded in 1974 as Japan’s first comprehensive specialty automotive goods store. After commenc- ing sales of private brand (PB) tires and oil in 1977, we soon commanded a leading share of the domestic automotive goods market by responding to the diverse tastes and needs of our customers with proprietary products and services. As not only cars but also society changes over time, the AUTOBACS Group continuously shakes up business formats, products, and services.

Development of Super AUTOBACS
and Full-Fledged Entry into Statutory > Inspection Services
With the transition to supersized
retail stores in general, AUTOBACS
created Super AUTOBACS mega-
stores for car lifestyle needs. Offering
expansive retail spaces, service bays
for product installation and maintenance work, CDs, and even a place to get a bite, Super AUTOBACS were also developed to feature a wide variety of events and serve the needs of everyone from first-time car owners to families, and car enthusiasts. At the same time, AUTOBACS mounted a full-scale entry into the provi- sion of statutory safety inspection services, thereby expanding its ability to support the needs of car lifestyles.

Enhanced Merchandise Offerings and Proactive Marketing Responding to Diversifying Preferences
>1990
AUTOBACS was estab-
lished in 1974, follow-
ing Japan’s period of
rapid economic devel-
opment and at a time
of growing consumer interest in personal car ownership. The retail distribution of automotive goods had yet to consolidate, and consumers had to go to a different source for nearly every item they wanted to purchase for their cars. AUTOBACS provided a one-stop solution for pur- chasing and installing automotive products and met with strong consumer support.
With the proliferation
of personal car owner-
ship came demand for
ways to individualize
cars and, as a result,
expansion of the market for automotive goods. AUTOBACS responded by enhancing and enlarg- ing its merchandise offerings, and taking innova- tive steps such as organizing product displays, and making product suggestions, based on lifestyle to more precisely respond to diversifying customer preferences.

Comprehensive Support for Car Lifestyles through Three Core Operations
>2010
Transformation and Creation for Robust Growth
Under our 2017 Medium-term Business Plan, we focused on “developing drivers of future growth.” In April 2019, we launched Five- year Rolling Plan to address the dramatical- ly changing environment, keep pace with and adapt to changes in society, cars, and people’s lifestyles, and enhance market competitiveness.
>2020
Car lifestyles have changed over the years due to the
growing popularity of environmentally friendly vehi-
cles and owners keeping their cars for longer periods
of time. As the age of drivers continues to increase,
the Company has expanded its services to include stat-
utory safety inspections and maintenance, car purchas-
ing and sales, and sales of automotive goods, so that everyone can drive safely for a long time. With these three core operations, we have transformed our business model into one that supports the overall car lifestyles of our customers.
    >

 09
Five-year Rolling Plan
To help each of our businesses adapt to changes in society, automobiles, and people’s life- styles, as well as to increase their market competitiveness, we are working to improve the quality of our products and services. To this end, we will establish a robust cross-business infrastructure while enhancing and linking our six networks. At the same time, we aim to tran- sition from a company focused on car accessories and services to a platform provider that connects our six networks to create a new economic zone for car lifestyle culture creation.
 Five-year Rolling Plan Vision
Against the backdrop of global environmental changes, ongoing technological innovation, and diversification of people’s values, many things are going to change in our industry, including cars and car maintenance needs. To achieve sustainable corporate growth in the face of these challenges, we need to have systems in place enabling us to detect and respond quickly to changes.
In order to develop close ties to society, cars, and people’s lives and provide customers with richer, better-quality offerings, we formulated Five-year Rolling Plan Vision as part of our mis- sion, “We constantly create a new car lifestyle culture.” Under the plan, we have set four goals aimed at enhancing and linking our six networks, and we will strive to achieve these goals while making annual reviews.

1. We will build networks to incorporate and consolidate cross-industry information and know-how and then integrate all kinds of information online, including cus- tomer information, held by each network.
2. By combining all kinds of data, including the latest information on cars and maintenance, customer usage information, maintenance history, and information on car purchases and sales, we will provide customers with more accurate proposals and unprecedented services.
3. In addition to wholesaling and retailing of automotive goods and related services, we aim to eliminate cus- tomer inconvenience and provide enjoyment in various customer-centered usage scenarios while building infrastructure that is close to our customers.
4. In order to achieve our goals, we will emphasize digi- tal transformation and integration of information while making effective use of business operators, human resources, facilities, and other forms of business infra- structure and work organically with them to adapt to changes in society.

 Initiatives for Six Networks
Automotive-related Goods Sales Network
While further strengthening the AUTOBACS Chain, we will col-
laborate with all forms of busi-
nesses that sell automotive
goods, including home improve-
ment stores and gas stations,
and utilize each other’s resourc-
es to increase our market competitiveness.
Maintenance network to adapt to Next-generation Technology
By collaborating with service pro-
viders that can handle maintenance
of cars equipped with next-gener-
ation technologies, including sup-
port cars, we will strive to offer
reliable maintenance and other ser-
vices during periods of major tech-
nological innovation. Reflecting this policy, we made Seiwa Automobile Sales Co., Ltd. and Takamori Jidousha Seibi Kogyo Co., Ltd. into consolidated subsidiaries. We also formed a com- prehensive business alliance with the BS-Summit Business Cooperative, a national network of automobile maintenance providers.
Overseas Alliances Network
We are building a new business
model through collaborations with
companies that are competitive in-
ternationally, as well as overseas
start-up companies with unique in-
novative technologies. We also
aim to increase profits by col-
laborating with domestic and
overseas supply chains. As part of this initiative, we made Singapore-based SK Automobile Pte. Ltd. and Australia-based AudioXtra Pty Ltd. into consolidated subsidiaries and otherwise reinforced our network.
Service Pit Network to provide the best service
To meet growing demand for in-
stallation of car accessories stem-
ming from growth in online sales
of automotive goods, we will col-
laborate with service providers,
gas stations, and other related
businesses throughout the mar-
ket. This will enhance the convenience of our installation ser- vices and increase the value we provide by supplementing our services with other information via our online network.
Multi-dealer Network
Customers’ car lifestyles begin
when they purchase vehicles.
As a channel that connects with
such customers, we not only
operate our own dealership busi-
ness but also collaborate with
dealers that handle other brands.
In so doing, we gather data on industry-wide trends and infor- mation on vehicles and maintenance from various manufac- turers, which we use to enhance the competitiveness of our own respective businesses. Currently, we operate BMW/MINI dealerships in 12 locations, and a Tesla Service Center recently opened at A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME.
Online network to enhance relationships with customers
We gather and integrate cross-in-
dustry information from our other
five networks related to vehicle
and maintenance trends, chang-
ing customer needs, and social
changes pertaining to laws and
the environment. Our aim is to
build an “online network” that gives us information we can leverage to strengthen the competitiveness of our respective businesses. As part of this initiative, we have a strategic alliance with Car Frontier Co., Ltd., a member of the Mitsubishi Group. Under the alliance, we took an equity stake in BEAD Co., Ltd., operator of the TIREHOOD e-commerce site, through which customers can arrange everything from tire purchases to instal- lation reservations, all online.

   Kiomi Kobayashi
Representative Director and Chief Executive Officer
 Under the mission of “We constantly create a new
car lifestyle culture,” we are striving to deliver three values to our customers to sustain growth and improve corporate value.
To fulfill the Group’s mission, which is “We constantly create a new car lifestyle culture,” we are striving to deliver three fundamental car-related values to customers: “Demand for comfortable use of a car (safety and security)”; “Enjoy going out by car (experience and discovery)”; and “Be more of yourself with beloved cars (self-expression).”
To deliver these three values, we are developing new products and new business models, remodeling our stores to make them easier for customers to use, improving our operations, and focusing on training our mechanics and other human resources to increase our competitiveness in the market.
To advance these initiatives, in 2019 the Group developed its Five-year Rolling Plan, which sets the direction of the Group over the next five years. The plan will be reviewed annually to ensure that new growth opportunities can be achieved in the event of major changes in the future and to advance the creation of a new car lifestyle culture.
Thank you for your continued support and loyalty.

  The business environment surrounding the Group
Responding to fast-paced changes under the Five-year Rolling Plan
AUTOBACS SEVEN finds itself in a business environment that is undergoing major changes. It is imperative that we respond to major trends such as the development of driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies and the widespread use of electric vehicles, as well as to the accompanying vehicle maintenance systems being put in place. This will require the rapid expansion of new services, including sharing and subscription services, as well as the development of the IT infrastructure accompanying these services. We face intensify- ing competition from our industry peers as well as indirect competitors such as dealers and online shopping companies, while at the same time the market is expanding into the realm of transactions between individuals. Furthermore, the market is expected to change signifi- cantly and rapidly in the future due to factors such as changes in the customer base caused by the declining birthrate and aging population and the diversification of customer needs.
To respond to these fast-paced changes in the business environment, in 2019 the Group formulated its Five-year Rolling Plan.
The Five-year Rolling Plan, which will be reviewed annually, sets targets for the establish- ment and linking of our six networks. Specifically, we aim to realize medium- to long-term growth by establishing and linking the following six networks through which we provide ser- vices tailored to the scenarios in which customers use their cars: automotive goods and ser- vices sales network; pit service network to provide the best service; maintenance network to adapt to next-generation technology; multi-dealer network; the overseas alliance network; and online network to enhance relationships with customers.
Results for the fiscal year ended March 2020
Strong sales in Japan thanks to factors such as
increased awareness of safe driving
In the fiscal year ended March 2020, the first year of the Five-year Rolling Plan, net sales were ¥221.4 billion, up 3.5% year on year, and operating income was ¥7.5 billion, up 1.4%, thanks to strong sales in the domestic AUTOBACS business against the backdrop of height- ened awareness of safe driving and last-minute demand before the consumption tax hike in October 2019. Net profit attributable to owners of parent was ¥3.7 billion, down 31.4%, due mainly to the recording of an impairment loss on fixed assets.
By segment, the domestic AUTOBACS business increased net sales by 0.2% from the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the acquisition of franchisee shares and conversion to con- solidated subsidiary status. In the current fiscal year, in addition to the last-minute demand before the consumption tax hike, there was also last-minute demand generated by the increase in tire prices accompanying an increase in the price charged by tire manufacturers. On the sales front, sales of dashboard cameras continued to grow, mainly in response to reports of road rage starting in August 2019, although tires were down year over year due to a record warm winter.
In our overseas business, we scaled back unprofitable retail operations and focused on the profitable wholesale business. Regionally, in addition to opening new stores in Thailand, we expanded our presence there by opening a small outlet in the gas station malls operated by the PTG Group, which ranks second in the number of gas stations in the country. In addi- tion, we acquired a stake in SK AUTOMOBILE, an auto body repair, painting, and mainte- nance company in Singapore, and made it a consolidated subsidiary. Meanwhile, in France, sales were significantly affected by the impact of the transfer of directly operated stores to franchisees and the novel coronavirus pandemic, resulting in a decline in sales.

  Impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic
Thorough safety measures, limited impact on this year’s operations
The Group considers it our mission to support our customers’ automobiles as a means of transportation and to provide them with safety and security. In response to the novel corona- virus pandemic, we prioritized the safety of our customers, suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders. In our stores, we took measures to maintain business continuity, including enforcing thorough hygiene control and, where necessary, limiting our business hours, face- to-face contact, and menu of products and services.
As a concrete measure to prevent the spread of the virus, we established a crisis response headquarters and made it our top priority to prevent store employees from becoming infected in order to prevent the spread to customers. In order to prevent transmission of the virus in our stores, we thoroughly implemented hygiene measures for our employees (hand wash- ing, hand sanitizing, physical condition checks, wearing masks and gloves while serving cus- tomers, etc.) and asked our customers to help us by sanitizing their hands when they enter our stores. As a general rule, our employees at headquarters and offices worked from home, and when they were obliged to come to work, we did everything possible to prevent infec- tion, including thorough temperature testing and disinfection before coming to work and staggered starting times.

16
  The impact on the Company’s operations in Japan is expected to be limited at this time, since our core business is based on automobiles, which are a critical component of the trans- portation infrastructure.
At the same time, we have implemented measures to support our franchisees. Specifically, we have reduced or exempted franchise stores from some of the costs of nationwide sales promotion projects, established a payment grace period for certain days for one month of billing for goods from April 2020 onwards, and established a short-term loan system, among other measures.
Progress of Five-year Rolling Plan
Establish networks that meet various car lifestyle needs
The Five-year Rolling Plan assembles information and expertise across various barriers, including corporate and industry barriers and national borders, and establishes six broad networks that connect to markets that will be newly created, with the aim of linking them together to provide services tailored to every automotive usage scenario. Based on this idea, we will accelerate our efforts to establish and link the six networks.
Network of automotive goods and services sales
As we work to further strengthen the AUTOBACS chain, we are collaborating with all busi- nesses that sell automotive goods and services, including home improvement stores, gas stations, and other car accessory retailers, to mutually leverage our resources to increase our market competitiveness. Specifically, we are expanding fleet transactions using the AUTOBACS store network and expanding direct transactions to other industries, among other initiatives. The number of companies engaged in fleet transactions more than dou- bled in the fiscal year ending March 2020 compared to the previous year, and the number of stores handling transactions with companies in different industries also increased in both number and results.
Maintenance network to adapt to next-generation technology
In the face of new automotive technologies and trends such as CASE (connected, autono- mous, shared, electric), it is essential that we keep up with next-generation technologies in the field of maintenance. Specifically, we need to support next-generation technologies such as the advanced safety technology of “aiming” (function adjustment) and on-board diag- nostics (OBD) for statutory safety inspections. In response, the Group is working to build a maintenance network that can support next-generation technologies in an era of techno- logical innovation by collaborating with service shops that support the maintenance of cars equipped with next-generation technologies. As part of this effort, in addition to acquiring new subsidiaries (Seiwa Automobile Sales Co., Ltd. in June 2019 and Takamori Jidousha Seibi Kogyo Co. Ltd. in May 2020), we entered into a business alliance with the BS-Summit Business Cooperative, a nationwide network of automobile mechanics. Furthermore, in the future, we plan to establish a training system to enable us to carry out specialized mainte- nance such as aiming, and to increase the number of centers with the specialized mainte- nance certification.
Multi-dealer network
In the car buying scenario, which is the gateway to the car lifestyle, we connect with cus- tomers through our car dealerships, but that is not our only channel. We also collaborate with dealers who operate under other brands to collect vehicle and maintenance information from manufacturers, including industry-wide trends and next-generation automotive technol- ogy, thereby strengthening our business competitiveness. Currently, we have seven BMW and MINI dealers in central Tokyo and five regional locations, and we have attracted a Tesla Service Center to our A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME site.

   Overseas alliance network
We aim to build a network for overseas development, sales, and service provision centered around the wholesale business. By collaborating with companies that have a competitive edge in international markets and overseas start-up companies with their own innovative technologies, we will be able to build new business models and expand revenues by link- ing domestic and overseas supply chains. We are also aiming to contribute to our domes- tic value chain by developing suppliers and wholesalers. As part of this effort, in November 2019, we made Singapore’s SK AUTOMOBILE a subsidiary in order to expand our auto body repair, painting, and maintenance businesses in Singapore, where demand for ongoing main- tenance is expected due to the stable number of vehicle registrations.
Online network to enhance relationships with customers
We aim to build a network that integrates information on vehicles and maintenance, changing customer needs, and changes in society, such as regulations and the environment, across the barriers between businesses, to create a source of information that will strengthen the competitiveness of each business.
(1) Strategic alliance with Car Frontier Co., Ltd. (Mitsubishi Group), a tire e-commerce site
Under a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Group’s Car Frontier Co., Ltd., we have invested in BEAD Co., Ltd., which operates TIREHOOD, an online tire e-commerce site that offers a full range of services from purchasing tires to making reservations for installation. With this investment, we aim to improve existing services and provide new services to drivers by fus- ing TIREHOOD’s Internet-based business and service development with the AUTOBACS chain’s store network and technological capabilities. In addition, we are working to establish a network of more than 4,000 TIREHOOD installation sites throughout Japan.
(2) Improvements to the official AUTOBACS app
With a wide range of services being delivered online, it is essential to stay connected digitally with your customers. AUTOBACS SEVEN is developing an app designed for easier login, faster startup, and improved usability. To enhance customer convenience, we are using loca- tion information to deliver targeted and store-specific communications.
(3) Renovation of the official AUTOBACS shopping site
Consumer purchasing behavior is diversifying, the e-commerce market is expanding, and price competition is intensifying. In response, AUTOBACS SEVEN has renovated its web- site and expanded its functionality, for example by enabling advance payment on the web, allowing customization of merchandise sale prices, and awarding T-points. By improving cus- tomer convenience, we aim to drive visits to our physical stores and increase market share.
Business platform to promote the Five-year Rolling Plan
As we continue to implement the Five-Year Rolling Plan, we are focusing on establishing and linking together the six networks, while also improving our five business platforms: human resources, IT, logistics, finance, and information.
Above all, with respect to human resources, we are making improvements to our training system, which continues to provide training to selected younger employees, management candidates, female executives, and section chiefs. To foster the talent to lead the Group in the future, we are further expanding the scope of our future executive training to include fran- chisees and sales staff. In the area of work-style reforms, we have implemented a number of initiatives to provide all employees with a variety of work-style options with the goal of estab- lishing an environment in which they can work energetically. Such options include shorter working hours, half-day paid leave, telecommuting, satellite office-based work, staggered starting times, and flex time. We are also enhancing our ICT-based communication tools to support these options.

18
  With respect to IT and logistics, our initiatives include the development of an IT infrastruc- ture for the purpose of providing advanced IT services and supporting work-life balance, the automation and streamlining of logistics in the AUTOBACS business, the development of our logistics infrastructure (for example, expanding the logistics capacity of our online business), the promotion of data management center projects, and the development of an information infrastructure in the Information Systems Division aimed at increasing customer satisfaction. We are also working to strengthen our financial base by strengthening cash flow manage- ment and investment income management.
In addition to these improvements to our business platforms, we are also working to improve the effectiveness and speed of strategy promotion, including the establishment of a system for strategy promotion and the enhancement of monitoring.
Changes to the Governance System
Transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee
Starting from the fiscal year ending March 2020, AUTOBACS SEVEN has transitioned to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. Leading up to the move, the Company had aimed to establish a stronger, more effective corporate governance system by separat- ing business execution and supervision to pursue both swift and decisive decision-making and appropriate monitoring. To achieve this goal and establish further sustainable growth and increased corporate value over the medium to long term, we made the transition to a com- pany with an Audit and Supervisory Committee.
At the time of the transition, the 12-member system of directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members was streamlined down to seven directors (including three Audit and Supervisory Committee members). It is our judgment that this number is sufficient given the size of the Company, and that this resizing has strengthened governance to a certain extent by energizing the exchange of opinions between directors and accelerating the speed of decision-making.
Outlook for the fiscal year ended March 2021
Projected increases in revenue and profit
With respect to the fiscal year ending March 2021, the Group’s sales in Japan (based on exist- ing stores) struggled in April and May due to the decline in consumption associated with the novel coronavirus pandemic, but recovered in June to the same level as the previous year, and in July and August exceeded the previous year. We also anticipate increased demand for car parts and accessories and increased demand for maintenance due to increased use of vehicles and owners keeping their cars for longer periods of time. Furthermore, we antici- pate that pent-up demand for winter products, suppressed by the previous year’s warm win- ter, will result in increased demand this year.
Under this business environment, for the fiscal year ending March 2021 we anticipate net sales of ¥223.8 billion, up 1.1% year on year, operating income of ¥7.6 billion, up 0.2%, and net profit attributable to owners of parent of ¥5.5 billion, up 46.1%.

Finance & Accounting Officer Q&A
   In addition to rigorously managing earnings, we aim to achieve 100% shareholder returns in total over the next five years.
Tomoaki Ikeda
Officer (Finance & Accounting and IR & PR)
 Q1
 Q2
Q3
 What is your financial strategy for the Five-year Rolling Plan launched in 2019?
A major goal of the financial strategy in the Five-year Rolling Plan is to increase capital efficiency.
Specifically, in terms of shareholder returns, along with a stable and continuous dividend, the Company intends to flexibly implement the acquisition of its own shares, while ensuring financial soundness. By doing so, we aim to achieve a total shareholder return ratio of 100% over a five-year period, while taking into account future capital needs.
In terms of cash flow management, we are focused on the appropriate control of surplus funds in excess of our working capital requirements, as well as revising our business portfolio through tighter control over return on investment. While promoting aggressive investment for growth, we will continue to consider withdrawing from less profitable businesses.
Could you be a little more specific about “tighter control over return on investment”?
As part of the Group’s business investment or M&A deci- sion-making process, we make investment decisions by setting appropriate hurdle rates based on the line of business. We also provide regular monitoring reports on investment projects to the Board of Directors. The
process involves checking whether or not our invest- ments in Japan and overseas are generating the free cash flow (FCF) that was originally planned, and if not, the internal and external directors deliberate on whether to continue the project or withdraw.
What is the financial status of
your franchisees? How do you expect the coronavirus pandemic to affect the financial situation of
your franchisees in the future?
For one year only in the fiscal year ended March, 2018, the Company reduced the wholesale prices charged to franchisees as a way to fund activities related to product selection, sales promotion, and training. This led to a sig- nificant improvement in the profits of our franchisees, and they have performed well since then. In the fiscal year ended March, 2020, they maintained almost the same level despite the impact of the record warm winter and the novel coronavirus.
With respect to the current fiscal year ending March 2021, sales in Japan (based on existing stores) struggled in April and May due to the coronavirus pandemic, but recovered in June to the same level as the previous year, and in July and August exceeded the previous year. It is true that the situation is unpredictable, but I believe the entire AUTOBACS franchise chain will continue to work together as a team to overcome this challenge.

20
  Q4 What is your financial policy (defensive financial policy) for supporting your franchisees against the coronavirus pandemic?
Also, please explain your financial base and ability to raise funds in case of an emergency.
Even under a state of emergency, automobiles are a crit- ical part of the infrastructure of people’s daily lives. In order to protect customers’ safety and peace of mind in their daily lives, which includes their cars, we have con- tinued our maintenance-oriented operations while mini- mizing contact between customers and employees and prioritizing prevention of the spread of the virus.
Under these circumstances, we have implemented the necessary support policies to help our franchisees take measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The specific support policies we have implemented include: 1. reductions and exemptions from “store personality” costs*; 2. a payment grace system; and 3. a short-term loan system.
At the same time, we have taken steps to increase our liquidity on hand to prepare for the worst-case scenario. As you know, the Company’s financial base is solid, but we have been carefully examining the situation, including cases where sales have fallen much further than expected.
I believe our financial strategy in the event of an unprecedented crisis should proceed in three phases: 1. increase liquidity on hand to prepare for the worst- case scenario; 2. invest to revive sluggish sales; and 3. invest in future growth.
* Franchise stores bear half of the cost of nationwide sales promotion projects
Q5 Please state your shareholder returns policy and any other message you have for shareholders.
As you know, our Five-year Rolling Plan remains unchanged with the goal of a total shareholder return ratio of 100%. At the same time, the Company intends to pay stable and continuous dividends, with the goal of a con- solidated dividend payout ratio of 50-100%.
For the fiscal year ended March 2020, we will pay an annual dividend of 60 yen as announced at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our policy for the current fiscal year end- ing March 2021 is to maintain the same dividend amount despite the coronavirus pandemic. With respect to share buybacks, we will make careful judgments based on the current situation.
Although the impact of the novel coronavirus pan- demic is still uncertain, I see this unprecedented crisis as a business opportunity. I believe that the nature of the automobile will be reconsidered in the context of this new mode of life. It is also a golden opportunity to carry out structural reforms centered on costs. I intend to take this opportunity to significantly improve our profitability and meet the expectations of our shareholders.
I would like to ask our shareholders for their continued support.

  Summary of Fiscal March 2020
Net sales of the domestic AUTOBACS business increased 0.2% year on year due to the effects of franchisee conversion to consolidated subsidiary status. Segment profit dipped 8.7% year on year. Groupwide net sales for the domestic AUTOBACS chain decreased 0.2% year on year on both a same store basis and total store basis. In terms of sales, tires performed well in the first half of the fiscal year due to last-minute demand before the consumption tax hike. However, the subsequent contraction in demand in the second half, plus the impact of a record warm winter, caused sales to fall below the previous year’s level. Meanwhile, dashboard cameras continued to perform well over the previous year against the backdrop of increasing demand for safe driving assistance.
Future Key Initiatives
• Boost tire sales
• Strengthen the development and
sales of private brand merchandise • Expand sales of statutory safety
inspections
• Improve profitability of used car pur-
chasing and sales business • Improve store operations
• Renovate stores
• Improve earnings at store
subsidiaries
• Expand profits in new store formats
  Summary of Fiscal March 2020
In the overseas business, operating losses narrowed due to the strengthening of highly profitable wholesale operations. Net sales increased 4.8% year on year and segment losses decreased. In the retailing and services business, sales increased in Thailand where we have made active efforts to deploy small stores to gas station malls. Meanwhile, sales in France declined due to the impact of the transfer of directly operated stores to franchisees and the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales and operating income increased in Singapore, where we acquired a stake in SK AUTOMOBILE, a local company operating a sheet metal painting and maintenance factory, and made it a consolidated subsidiary. In the wholesale business, wholesale sales to the Chinese domestic market grew signifi- cantly. In addition, in order to strengthen cooperation related to expansion of the whole- sale business in China and the manufacture of private brand merchandise, Guangdong CarHouse Industrial Development Holdings Co., Ltd. (CarHouse) Group was made an equity-method company. In Australia, we worked to expand wholesale earnings in our overseas business through AudioXtra Pty Ltd., which we made a consolidated subsidiary.
Future Key Initiatives
• Expand wholesale business
• Establish and link an overseas alli-
ance network
• Provide new services tailored to
each market
  Summary of Fiscal March 2020
Net sales of the car dealer, BtoB and internet business increased 28.2% year on year, converting the segment loss into a surplus. In the imported car dealer busi- ness, we established a presiding company to strengthen our sales structure and services. In the B-to-B business, both net sales and profits improved due to the effects of business consolidation. In addition, to expand our service business, including statutory safety inspections and maintenance services, we made Seiwa Automobile Sales Co., Ltd. a subsidiary. In the internet business, we promoted the use of AI to strengthen digital marketing.
Future Key Initiatives
Car Dealer Business
• Remodel existing stores and bolster earnings
• Expand dealerships BtoB Business
• Switch to best-selling products and
those with high profit margins
• Secure new suppliers Internet Business
• Upfront investment in platform
construction
• Update existing online shopping website
  Summary of Fiscal March 2020
Net sales of other business decreased 4.1% year on year, and segment profit decreased 4.2% year on year. This is primarily due to decreased revenue from insurance-related fees.

    Number One Store for Tire Sales
AUTOBACS SEVEN strives to provide a shopping expe- rience and services tailored to the region and season to meet the wide-ranging needs of our customers. As a result of these efforts, AUTOBACS was voted the num- ber one tire retailer for the fourth consecutive year in the "Tire Survey 2020" conducted by JMA Research Institute Inc. The survey was conducted among people who own a car/cars at home from 18 to 69 years old across Japan, and 25.9% of respondents selected AUTOBACS SEVEN as their destination for tire purchases.
Statutory Safety Inspections and Maintenance
Decreased number of cars that underwent a statutory inspection as a result of reduced demand for the inspection and measures to extend the inspection expiration date
We have stepped up our TV advertising and point-of-sale promotions and strengthened in-store initiatives such as 15-minute inspections. However, the number of statutory inspections performed fell 2.2% year on year to approxi- mately 634,000, owing to a decline in the number of vehi- cles subject to inspections starting in October 2019 and the policy of extending inspection expiration dates as a response to COVID-19.
Used Car Purchasing and Sales
To enhance used car purchasing and reduce costs in our CARS stores, we closed five unprofitable used car pur- chasing stores and intensified our sales activities. As a result, approximately 31,000 vehicles were sold in the fiscal year ended March 2020. In addition, AUTOBACS CARS was ranked No. 1 in customer satisfaction among used car purchasing companies in the 2019 Oricon Customer Satisfaction Survey.

Domestic AUTOBACS Business
  Strategy Based on Three Values
Automotive Goods
Enhancing the lineup of private brand merchandise and tires
     To meet the safety and security needs of our customers, we are endeavoring to expand our selection of mainte- nance products that need replacing regularly, like tires and engine oil, centered around the development of private brand merchandise. Furthermore, the growing awareness of safe driving in recent years has led to a rise in demand for safe driving assistance products such as the “Pedal Watcher II” sudden acceleration prevention device and dashboard cameras that can record front and rear views. We are leading the way in the industry to expand our offering of such products. We are also strengthening our
Sales of campers for outdoor fun
To meet the needs of customers who enjoy going out by car, we sell products such as drones that offer fun not just on the trip but once customers reach their destina- tions, and we are working on the development of life- style products. Under the branding of GORDON MILLER MOTORS, our original car label, we are producing camp- ers equipped with a state-of-the-art chassis and design linked with its unique world view on garages, and pro- moting the “VAN Life” concept, which integrates the vehicle into the living space.
Promoting product development by ARTA
To meet the need for self-expression through cars, we are newly marketing ARTA (AUTOBACS RACING TEAM AGURI) as a racing sports brand and promoting the development of merchandise such as racing goods and sportswear under this label. In addition, in January 2020, we teamed up with the Swiss luxury mechani- cal wristwatch brand CVSTOS to launch the high-end ARTA CVSTOS series, which features a sporty yet ele- gant concept the two companies have in common.

    Store Format Strategy
  Two Smart+1 stores in Osaka and Tochigi
   y and rity
We have continued to develop and open new store formats that offer only certain products and services and can be operated at low cost. As part of this, we operate two Maintenance Members-only “Smart+1” stores, one in Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture, and the other in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture. The stores specialize in car maintenance services centered on hand car wash and are accessible by appointment only. The stores offer a carefully selected lineup of essential products, and customers can wait and relax in the store’s cafe lounge enjoying coffee and pastries until the work is completed.

  Expansion of JACK & MARIE to five stores
  ience d
very
In November 2019, JACK & MARIE, Japan’s first car-oriented lifestyle shop, sought to increase its brand value by opening a new physical store at Grandberry Park in Machida, Tokyo. It is our first JACK & MARIE store in Tokyo and the one with the largest sales floor. This brings the total to five stores, with two stores in Yokohama and one each in Nagoya and Fukuoka. The brand encourages exciting outdoor uses of automobiles based on the concept of a stylish Australian lifestyle sur- rounded by nature.

Overseas Business
We are engaged in wholesale and retailing and services mainly in the ASEAN region, which continues to enjoy economic growth, through capital and business tie-ups with leading local firms and joint venture operations.
   Wholesale Business
With increasing demand for the products of the Japanese brand AUTOBACS, particularly Japanese engine oil, overseas sales grew significantly. Wholesale sales to the Chinese domestic market also grew significantly. In October 2019, in order to strengthen cooperation related to the expansion of the wholesale business in China and the manufacture of private brand merchandise, addi- tional investment was made in the Guangdong CarHouse Industrial Development Holdings Co., Ltd. (CarHouse) Group, and it was made an equity-method company. In
Private brand oil for overseas market
Singapore, we are promoting the wholesale introduction of private brand merchandise such as wipers, mainly to convenience stores and hypermarkets, and we are also working on B-to-B and online sales. In Australia, we worked to expand wholesale earnings in our overseas business through AudioXtra Pty Ltd., which we made a consolidated subsidiary in October 2018. Going forward, we will continue to focus on wholesaling as the core of our overseas business as we work to further expand our sales channels.
              Strategic Elements of Overseas Wholesale Business
• Promoting businesses that harness local characteristics and quality unique to a Japanese brand
• Strengthening alliances with local partners
• Improving profitability through low cost, low risk, and diverse earnings sources
• Establishing a battery business

   Retailing and Services Business
As of March 31, 2020, the Group operates 45 stores in seven countries and regions excluding Japan, tailoring services to the car culture of each region.
We are strengthening works at service bays in France, which is seeing growth in tire sales. In Thailand, we are partnered with the PTG Group, which ranks second in the number of gas stations in the country, and oper- ate small stores in the company’s gas station malls. We
newly opened these small stores in PTG Group’s gas sta- tion malls in April and November 2019. In Singapore, we acquired a stake in SK AUTOMOBILE, a local company operating a sheet metal painting and maintenance factory, in November 2019 and made it a consolidated subsidiary. This will allow us to continue to expand in the country, where demand for ongoing maintenance is expected due to the stable number of vehicle registrations.

Car Dealer, BtoB and Internet Business
We are nurturing and strengthening our imported car dealer, BtoB and internet businesses as new growth drivers – areas in which we expect to realize synergies with the domestic AUTOBACS business in the future.
   Imported Car Dealer Business
Strengthen sales structure and improve services
  AUTOBACS SEVEN is an official dealer of BMW/MINI in Japan with a total of 12 locations, seven of which are in Tokyo and five in Tochigi Prefecture. In April 2019, the Company established AUTOBACS DEALER GROUP HOLDINGS Co., Ltd. as an entity to manage the imported car dealership business, as part of its effort to develop a system for future expansion of earnings. We also strengthened the sales structure at each site and worked to strengthen not only sales of new and used cars but also services.

We are also making improvements to the AUTOBACS app to enhance our relationships with customers more than ever before.

    BtoB Business
Improve earnings structure by expanding new sales channels
  In the BtoB business, we were able to increase sales and profits at our automotive goods wholesaler CAP Style Co., Ltd. by securing sales channels outside of the AUTOBACS chain and optimizing business operations.
Our wholesale business, which does business directly with different industries, is gradually expanding. The num- bers are increasing both in terms of the number of stores we do business with and actual sales.
In the fleet business, which we are strengthening with the aim of capturing corporate demand, transactions with nationwide operators increased, and sales increased,
particularly of safety support merchandise such as dash- board cameras. The number of companies with whom we do business, including government agencies, grew significantly by more than 200% over the previous year.
As part of our efforts to build a maintenance network with service shops, we acquired two new wholly owned sub- sidiaries and began promoting revenue growth at the com- panies: Seiwa Automobile Sales Co., Ltd. (which conducts statutory safety inspections, maintenance services, and auto body repair in Shiga Prefecture) in June 2019, and Takamori Automobile Maintenance Industry Co., Ltd. in May 2020.

  Activities in Fiscal March 2020
1 Educational Training to Enhance Strength of Human Resources at AUTOBACS Chain Stores
  The AUTOBACS chain is enhancing its education and training systems in order to improve the value it provides to custom- ers. We have established a stratified education and training system for store employees, who operate closest to our cus- tomers. We offer a multitude of different group training ses- sions on topics such as leadership, sales skill improvement, and product knowledge. We combine these with e-learning and other initiatives like OJT at stores in an effort to deliver significant outcomes. We also strive to enhance the quality
2 Career Support
Based on the concept that “employees choose and build their own careers by themselves,” we have established an educational program to help individual employees clar- ify their own career paths through work, and have an edu- cation program in place to back this up.
Career rotations and skill enhancements
To ensure that employees gain a wide range of knowledge and experience, we conduct regular personnel transfers with a view toward job rotation, especially for younger employ- ees. We have also established an internal job posting and free agent system so that employees who meet certain conditions can apply to work in positions they desire. In addition, we offer specialist courses for employees who have diverse experi- ences and have established their preferences and aptitudes. In these ways, we support the development of careers that
3 Work-style Reforms
In addition to promoting the creation of a workplace where each and every employee can work safely and remain healthy, we are working to establish an environment in which our employees can feel enriched, fulfilled, and safe at work.
Supporting various working styles
In light of mounting societal demands to tackle issues, such as an ageing society, need for work-life balance, and globalization, we are implementing various initiatives to provide multiple work-style options to employees with
of in-store services by boosting staff knowledge, technical skills, and motivation, with an assessment system linked to our internal Group qualifications, such as Car Lifestyle Advisor and Car Lifestyle Consultant. In addition, we focus on training to help employees acquire public qualifications, including auto- mobile mechanic and automobile inspector, that will become key to our services in the future. We will work to steadily increase the number of qualified employees going forward.
match each employee’s abilities, aptitudes, and aspirations.
Personnel development program
In addition to in-house training, we have a “cafeteria plan” that offers around 160 courses, including correspondence courses from external organizations, as well as e-learning courses and public seminars. The purpose of the plan is to encourage employees’ voluntary career development efforts. Employees using the plan, which is positioned as a “system to support employees who work hard,” can receive monetary assistance with subsidies up to ¥100,000 per person per year. In addition, we have a full range of programs to encourage employees who are proactive in their self-development and skills development. For exam- ple, we provide rewards for those who have acquired offi- cial qualifications designated by the Company.
the goal of establishing an environment in which everyone can work energetically. Such options include telecommut- ing, satellite office-based work, staggered starting times to avoid peak-hour commuting, half-day paid leave, and shorter working hours for those with childcare and elder care commitments. We are also enhancing our ICT-based communication tools. Going forward, we will trial a flex- time system and a system that releases employees from single-employer assignments, with the aim of establishing more diverse work-style arrangements.
   Comments from the General Manager, Personnel Department Yumiko Sako, General Manager, Personnel Department
The Company has been proactive in supporting career development that matches the apti- tudes and abilities of individual employees and in transforming the way they work. During the COVID-19 crisis, for example, employees were forced to adopt workstyles they had never experienced before, with some prohibited from visiting their workplaces.
We see this as an opportunity and are keen to embrace new ways of working in the future. In the year under review, for instance, we established the Corporate Culture Reform Project to undertake reviews of operations and promote cross-divisional consideration of mechanisms for realizing new ways of working. We will also work to re-engineer our recruit- ing practices and education systems in our quest to become an organization that embraces individual diversity, continues to produce results through teamwork, and is able to create new markets with flexible ideas without fear of change.

ESG: HR Development and Work-style Reforms
   4 Promoting Diversity and Inclusion
Based on our belief that we cannot grow as a company without diversity, we are working to create comfortable working environments for both men and women.
A workplace where employees can keep work- ing after maternity and childcare leave
Our view is that “a company where women can work comfortably is a company where everyone can work comfortably.” Based on this view, we have created envi- ronments that are work-friendly, even for women expe- riencing major life events, such as marriage, childbirth, and childcare. As a result, our return-to-work rate for female employees after taking maternity and childcare leave is 100%. This is testament to our efforts to support
women’s careers and improve various personnel systems.
Encouraging men to childcare leave (work- style diversity initiative)
Although there is an uptrend in male employees taking childcare leave in Japan, the proportion remains low at just 6.16% of the male workforce, compared with 82.2% for women (according to a survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare).
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the percent- age of the Company’s male employees who took one month or more of childcare leave was 7.69%, which is higher than the national average, and some employees are even taking childcare leave for longer than one year.
 Comment from Male Employee that Took Childcare Leave
Takuya Nishigaki (worker at A PIT AUTOBACS SHINONOME) Took childcare leave from April 2019
My wife, who works for the same company, was very keen to continue working in her department, which handles product development. So after consulting with both her parents and mine, we decided that I would take the childcare leave option.
I was concerned that my boss might be opposed to my taking a whole year for childcare leave, but he readily agreed and supported me.
At first I was confused because everything was new to me and I couldn’t communicate well with my child. Now I’ve gotten used to it and I’m feeling more comfortable. I’m enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Having experienced firsthand the difficul- ties of balancing childcare and work, I understand the needs of people in similar situations. So I believe that I can help the Company create more worker-friendly environments in the future.
In Japan, it is still considered unusual for men to take childcare leave, but in our rapidly changing soci- ety, an environment that allows everyone to work flexibly is essential for a company to achieve more
Creating a workplace full of diversity
The Company’s policy is that all people have the right to work equally, regardless of their nationality. Under this pol- icy, we use the same recruiting standards to select peo- ple regardless of their nationality. Accordingly, we have welcomed a number of foreign nationals to the Company, including both new graduates and mid-career hires.
In the globally expanding businesses of the AUTOBACS Group, there are more and more opportunities for foreign employees, both in Japan and overseas.
As part of our hiring of disabled persons, we are also working hard to create an environment in which people with disabilities can find it easy to work by establishing a system that offers a choice of flexible working styles.
sustainable growth. I hope to encourage men who are think- ing about taking child- care leave to go ahead and take it, so that we can become a com- pany that is known for offering childcare leave for men as a matter of course, and hope- fully this will spread throughout society.

Since its founding, the Company has worked to enhance the “physical and mental health of employees,” identi- fied as one of its three pillars of management. In order to realize our vision for the future, we must be a bright, energetic, and vibrant organization. Going forward, we will continue contributing broadly to society by raising employee awareness about the health of both “mind” and “body” and powerfully promoting “health management.”

External recognition
In fiscal 2019, the Company was again evaluated highly by external organizations for its initiatives related to the mental and physical health of employees. For example, we received the highest rank under the DBJ Employees’ Health Management Rating, and we were certified as a 2020 Health and Productivity Management Organization.
Health management support system spearheaded by the Health Management Promotion Committee
The Group established the Health Management Promotion Committee to spearhead its health management initia- tives. The committee supports the activities of the Group’s in-house health management promotion organization—con- sisting of health insurance union, labor union, and mutual aid association representatives—by examining specific mea- sures to promote the health of employees. The in-house health management promotion organization also has a resi- dent public health nurse who, together with an occupational physician and clinical psychologist, provides health counsel- ing and support for improving lifestyle habits, including men- tal health. In addition, the Health Management Promotion Committee seeks to create healthy and safe work environ- ments. In addition to priority issues related to health man- agement, it examines occupational safety and health issues, such as the need to reduce overtime work and the risk of workplace accidents, and it communicates information on its activities throughout the Company via the Safety and Health Committee. We are confident that this initiative will help increase the vitality of our entire organization and lead to improvements in corporate value.
We are pursuing six health management initiatives.
All employees of the AUTOBACS Group are working together to address the issues listed below. These activities reflect our effort to build an organizational culture in which everyone understands that the health of each individual
employee is key to creating corporate value, and also sym- bolize our commitment to benefiting society in general.
1. Anti-smoking: With the goal of reducing the smok-
ing rate among employees to 32%, we are encourag- ing workers to quit smoking and taking measures to prevent health hazards caused by passive smoking. The Company is also a member of the No Smoking Promotion Business Consortium, established jointly by the Tokyo Medical Association and the Japan Cancer Society. The consortium consists mainly of companies with headquarters and offices in Tokyo.
2. Lifestyle-related diseases: We are working to prevent the onset and aggravation of lifestyle-related diseases with the goal of reducing the percentage of employees with high health risks to 30% or less.
3. Cancer: By increasing the rate of screening and consul- tation among employees, we support the early detec- tion and treatment of cancer. We are also working to help affected workers remain in employment while getting treatment.
4.Mental health: Committed to helping all employ- ees perform at their best in an energetic and healthy manner, we are working to reduce the percentage of employees with high stress to 10% or less and those taking leave due to mental health problems to 1% or less. Specifically, we promote self-care, line-based care, care by in-house occupational health staff, and care utilizing external services.
5.Health-related issues specific to women: We are working to improve work environments and support measures to help female employees spend healthy, cheerful, fulfilling lives with independence.
6. Workplaces that promote “health management”: We are working to establish environments and structures to instill “health management” initiatives in the workplace.

ESG: Environmental Conservation
Our Vision
The Company takes into account the impacts our business activities have on the environment and aims to realize a sustainable society by ensuring proper waste disposal and reducing our environmental burdens at our stores and during distribution.
Key Themes
Reduction of CO2 emissions in our business processes and recycling of used products SDGs
   SDG Targets
Target 7.2: By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowl- edge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable de- velopment and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development
Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to cli- mate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries
Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse
Target 17.17: Encourage and promote effective public, public-pri- vate and civil society partnerships, building on the experience and resourcing strategies of partnerships
     AUTOBACS SEVEN Environmental Policy
 In September 2011 the Company established the AUTOBACS SEVEN Environmental Policy, and promotes environmentally friendly business operations as a fran- chise chain headquarters.
Activities in Fiscal March 2020
1 Product Recycling and Proper Disposal In Japan, approximately 100 million tires, equivalent to 1
million tons, are disposed of every year. Used tires col- lected from customers at AUTOBACS Group stores are pulverized and processed into chips by specialists and are recycled as a source of thermal energy. At the factories of such specialists collecting used tires from AUTOBACS Group stores in Kanto’s vicinity, over 100 tons of used tires are brought in, selected, broken, and transformed into sources of energies every day. Used oils and batter- ies are also separated by material and processed correctly by designated operators and are then recycled.
In addition, radiator liquids, bumpers, and aluminum wheels are separated by material and reused. Through recycling them by material, approximately 90% of an entire automobile’s parts are recycled. Recycling fees are used for transforming parts into different materials and for processing airbags and CFC gas that are cumbersome to process.

   2 Reduction of CO2 Emissions
Electric vehicle charging stations
We have installed electric vehicle charging stations at 103 AUTOBACS Group stores (as of March 31, 2020). On top of enhancing convenience for our EV and PHV customers, we promote environmental conservation activities across the entire Group.
Initiatives in distribution
When transporting products not requiring express deliv- ery, we make use of rail freight containers instead of trucks to reduce CO2 emissions. We also utilize reusable folding containers in various sizes to deliver products to stores in an effort to reduce waste in the form of card- board boxes.
Reducing CO2 emissions with mega solar projects
In 2013 we installed solar power generation panels using areas of the roof and other unused sections of our West Japan Logistics Center (Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture). This initiative reduces our emissions of CO2. Total power generated in fiscal March 2020 was approximately 1.4 million kWh.
Developing environmentally friendly private brand products
We are working to minimize the amount of waste gener- ated by the packaging of our private brand products by reducing the weight and reviewing the materials of such packaging.

  3 Recycling Car Freshener Packaging
Collecting and reusing
From October 2017 to March 2020, we collected empty car freshener products at AUTOBACS stores and recycled the plastic from those prod- ucts to create road safety reflectors.
This was a joint collaboration between
AUTOBACS SEVEN; Procter & Gamble
Japan, maker of the Febreze brand of
deodorizers; and TerraCycle Japan,
which supports corporate recycling
activities. The project draws on the
strengths of each company. The recy-
cled reflectors created through the project were donated to elementary schools and organizations that promote road safety.
4 Reducing Use of Plastic Bags
In October 2019, we stepped up efforts to reduce the use of plastic bags, including by encouraging cus- tomers to bring their own bags and displaying posters. This was before a law mandating charges on plastic bags was enacted in July 2020.
Product Packaging (plastics) Product Packaging (paper)
Stores (plastic bags) Stores (paper)
  Since April 2020, we have sequen-
tially introduced a system for charging
fees on plastic bags. We also help
reduce plastic waste with our own
reusable bags. For customers who
wish to use them, we have made
the bags more durable and reusable
rather than disposable. In addition to
plastic shopping bags, we are looking
to reduce the use of plastic bags gen-
erated in our stores, with the aim of
making our stores more environmentally friendly.

Assisting safe driving through our products
We developed and launched
a sudden acceleration pre-
vention device aimed at pre-
venting accidents caused
by drivers who are elderly
or not used to driving and
mistake the accelerator for
the brake. In some regions, we also provide traffic safety training in cooperation with local governments and the police.
Monitoring AI robot: ZUKKU
We provide unobtrusive
monitoring for the elderly
through ZUKKU, an owl-
shaped mini-robot that
utilizes AI to conduct
natural conversations.
Equipped with interactive
functionality and motion sensors, ZUKKU watches over the daily activities of people’s loved ones by analyzing the frequency of conversations and certain keywords, then transmits information about the physical condition of the subject to the PCs or smartphones of family members in distant locations.
Distribution of recycled road safety reflectors to around 7,000 children
From October 2017 to
March 2020, we collected
empty car freshener
products at AUTOBACS
stores for recycling into
road safety reflectors.
We donated the reflec-
tors to around 7,000 elementary and daycare school chil- dren through our stores nationwide.
Driving assistance system for safe driving even in dense fog
We conducted a field test
in Oita Prefecture aimed at
establishing Japan’s first
5G-based driving assis-
tance system to enable
safe driving even in dense
fog. In Oita Prefecture,
express buses are the
main means of transportation between Oita Airport and Oita City, and they often encounter dense fog around the Hiji Junction at the midpoint of the journey. Our aim is to establish a driving assistance system allowing safe driv- ing on highways affected by dense fog.

   2 Supporting Development of the Next Generation Children
Communicating the appeal of motorsports and the challenge to the dreams to children
In fiscal March 2020, in coop-
eration between the Com-
pany and ARTA (AUTOBACS
RACING TEAM AGURI),
a team driver and engineer
visited elementary schools in
Suzuka, Mie Prefecture and Haga, Tochigi Prefecture to talk about the joys, rigors, and importance of holding a dream. These interactions not only stimulate an interest in motor- sports and racing cars, but they also aim to spark the first step towards realizing future dreams of children and students.
Classroom support at
Oita Prefectural High School
In December 2019,
we signed a “Compre-
hensive Collaborative
Agreement on Com-
munity Activation” with the Oita Prefectural Government. As part of this effort, we opened a laboratory on the cam- pus of the Oita Prefectural Information Science High School in May 2020. Our employees are permanently stationed at the lab to support classes aimed at resolving regional issues through industry-academic-government collaboration.
The lab provides students with the opportunity to experience our IoT-based monitoring robots and driving assistance services, and to come into contact with the lat- est technologies.
Kodomobacs: A fun way to interact with cars and develop a view of occupation Our in-store event
“Kodomobacs” gives chil-
dren the chance to try their
hand at a number of activ-
ities, including a working
experience at service bays
where they get to wear
AUTOBACS overalls and
change a car tire, taking sou-
venir photographs wearing a car racing suit, and decorating cars with drawings. The purpose of this event is to have chil- dren interact with our employees to cultivate a view of occu- pation, and also have them experience the appeal of making a living together with cars, the wonderful life partner.
AUTOBACS pavilion at KidZania
As an official sponsor
of KidZania, a small city
where kids can have fun
role-playing jobs and learn-
ing about how society
works, AUTOBACS runs
Car Lifestyle Support Cen-
ter pavilions at both Kid-
Zania Tokyo and KidZania
Koshien. Through their experiences at our pavilions, our goal is to have kids learn how fun it is to work with cars, gain an understanding of car safety and mechanisms, and contribute to a safe motorized society in the future.

Community Support for Natural Disasters
Initiatives to support victims of torrential rains in August 2019 and typhoons (No. 15 and No. 19)
Free rental support for car-sharing service
We donated 17 vehicles
to the Japan Car Sharing
Association in order to
give disaster-affected
people and local volunteer
groups a free-of-change
means of transportation.
We also serviced and replaced the tires of those cars with winter tires at AUTOBACS stores to ensure ongoing vehi- cle safety.
Employee-matching fundraising donations
Immediately after the disasters, we distributed food at local evacuation centers. We also made donations to AAR Japan, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that provides supplies to welfare facilities for the elderly, spe- cial-needs schools, and other organizations without easy access to support. This was in the form of matching dona- tions, where the Company agreed to match any donations collected from employees.
Car maintenance consultation service
We set up a consultation service for customers who needed to main- tain their vehicles after the natural disasters and sought advice on a wide range of problems.

Brand Management
   Our Vision (Policy)
The AUTOBACS Group strives to offer values to society, as a strength of our corporate brand developed since its founding. At the same time, we have established systems to guard against the following critical risks which could harm the brand through business activities.
Product Quality Management
1 Product Quality Guidelines
Recognizing that the products and services we provide customers are directly linked to their safety, AUTOBACS SEVEN strives to maintain and further improve quality by establishing the AUTOBACS Group Product Quality Guidelines.

Autobacs Group Product Quality Guidelines >
https://www.autobacs.co.jp/en/sustainability/society/quality.html
Product Quality Standards
At the Group stores, customer safety is given foremost priority at all times when changing tires and carrying out other works. To this end, we have developed manu- als on works at service bays and manuals for preventing wheel detachment. We also strive to enhance the staff’s skills by establishing a mechanic certification system, and through technical training and e-learning. For statutory safety inspections, 15-minute inspections are conducted with guidance provided from the Company to the stores, in order to unify the Group’s work, improve quality, and increase work efficiency.
2 Certification of Hybrid Car Compatible Stores
To perform maintenance on hybrid car batteries, laws and regulations require taking a special seminar on handling low voltages. In addition to offering “hybrid training” for Group employees, the Group certifies stores as “hybrid car compatible stores” if they have the following: special seminar on handling low voltages; insulation equipment; diagnostic machinery; and hybrid training. Certified stores have signboards by their entrance. As of the end of March 2020, 382 stores have been certified.
3 Personal Information Risks
For protecting personal information, the Group imple- ments optimum measures to ensure information security and publishes its private policy to inform those inside and outside the Group. In case of personal information leak- age, we have established an internal communication sys- tem to minimize the impacts on the holders of personal information and ensure that the business activities of the Group are unaffected.
Certified by Third Party Inspection Body, TÜV Rheinland Japan
Since July 2017, the Company has a business alliance with TÜV Rheinland Japan, a third party that excels in audits of the automobile after-sales market. Under this alliance, we have taken steps to redevelop the facility and environmental stan- dards of service bays at automotive goods stores, while offer- ing higher quality works at service bays. As a result, in July 2018, the “Automobile Goods Retailer Maintenance Factory Certification” was conferred in Japan for the first time to two stores of the AUTOBACS Group. As of March 2020, nine stores of the AUTOBACS Group have been conferred.
We manage product quality according to the Product Quality Control Regulations. We carry out multifaceted quality control of the private brand products we sell, along with national brand products. This includes working with manufacturers and suppliers to ensure the legality of the products and their uses and protect consumers based on the Product Liability Act.
3 AQL Standards
We outsource the production of many private brand products to overseas factories. With the aim of stabiliz- ing quality, we conduct audits and provide advice at such manufacturing sites. In addition, private brand products are inspected based on the globally adopted Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) immediately before factory shipment or at the time of arrival at the logistics centers.
4 Product Failure Hotline
Defective products may be mixed in with national brand products, albeit rarely. In such cases, we oblige our sup- pliers to submit a corrective action report, and review and propose preventative measures involving the quality con- trol system and the manufacturing process. Furthermore, we have introduced a Group online bulletin board called the “Product Failure Hotline” to share information with Group stores in a timely manner.
 
Corporate Governance
44
   We strive to constantly strengthen our corporate governance in order to maintain the support and trust of all our stakeholders.
Corporate Governance > https://www.autobacs.co.jp/en/sustainability/governance.html Basic Concepts
  Based on the AUTOBACS SEVEN Vision, the AUTOBACS Chain Management Mission, and the Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Action of the AUTOBACS SEVEN Group, we operate our business with consideration to all stakeholders. As a public entity of society, we will achieve sustainable growth and improve corporate value over the medium-to long term, and will continue striving to
strengthen corporate governance to contribute to society. Based on these basic concepts, we will build a sys- tem to achieve fair and transparent management, includ- ing separation of business execution and supervision, together with swift and bold decision-making and proper monitoring, and strive to make the system function practi-
cally and sufficiently.
Changes to the Governance System
 The Company has transitioned from a company with an Audit and Supervisory Board to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, with approval received at the 72nd ordinary meeting of general shareholders held on June 21, 2019. The Company aims to have a more effec- tive corporate governance system by separating business execution and supervision to pursue both swift and deci- sive decision-making and appropriate monitoring, along with sustainable growth and the further improvement of the medium-to-long-term corporate value. To this end, while harnessing the characteristics of a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, the Company is rein- forcing the corporate governance system through the fol- lowing measures:
Composition of Directors
(1) Appointment of one-third or more of independent outside directors: enhancement of the supervisory unction, protection of general shareholders’ interest
(2) Establishment of committees as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors: ensuring of transparency, objectivity, and appropriateness
(3) Selection of full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members and selected Audit and Supervisory Committee members: ensuring effectiveness of the activ- ities of Audit and Supervisory Committee, enhancement of the audit function
(4) Adoption of an officer system: separation of busi- ness execution and supervision, clarification of man- agement responsibilities
(5) Regular meetings with officers by Audit and Supervisory Committee members: enhancement and reinforcement of monitoring

Establishment of a Liaison Group for Independent Outside Directors
The Company holds meetings of the Liaison Group for Independent Outside Directors, which is chaired by the lead- ing independent outside director and includes only indepen- dent outside directors among its participants.
The Liaison Group is intended to be a vehicle for outside direc- tors to share information and enhance communication among themselves, and it is expected to be a venue for the develop- ment of a common understanding of, and information exchange on, governance and other management matters at the Company. The Liaison Group, in principle, meets several times a year.
as other requirements for independence stipulated by the Company. Furthermore, efforts are made to ensure that at least one of the directors who are members of the Audit and Supervisory Committee has considerable insight on finance and accounting.
The Company has established the Corporate Governance Committee as an advisory body for the Board of Directors, chaired by an outside director and comprised of all the out- side directors and a representative director. When deciding on resolutions of the general shareholders’ meetings regard- ing selection of director candidates and dismissal of directors, the Board of Directors makes a decision after obtaining the advice and findings of the Corporate Governance Committee.

Corporate Governance
  Remuneration
Director Remuneration
1) Basic Policy
The basic policy on determining director remuneration is to secure as AUTOBACS SEVEN directors outstand- ing individuals who will work to maintain and increase the corporate value of the Group, which comprises a fran- chise system, and contribute to the effective functioning of the business supervisory function.
2) Remuneration Standards
Standards for remuneration shall be set by considering third-party survey data on executive remuneration, and taking into account the Company’s position in the industry and factors such as difficulty of achieving targets and spe- cific roles of individuals.
3) Composition and Basic Concept of Remuneration
Remuneration for executive directors and officers con- sists of fixed basic remuneration, an annual incentive that is determined in accordance with the degree of achieve- ment such as performance in a single year, and a medium- to-long term incentive aimed at giving medium-to-long term incentives. Outside directors and directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members are paid only fixed remuneration which is set according to their role.
a. Basic remuneration
The scope of control and responsibility, degree of influence on the management of the consolidated Group, and achieve- ment in the previous fiscal year are considered in determining
Total Remuneration for the Fiscal Year ended March 2020
the basic remuneration from the remuneration table.
b. Annual incentive
Individuals’ assessment items are set based on the evaluation criteria, namely, a single-year consolidated ordinary profit target which is an evaluation indicator common to all executive directors and officers, finan- cial performance figures such as evaluation indicators tailored to an individual’s area of responsibility, and the degree of achievement of a strategic target which cannot be measured by financial performance figures alone. The annual incentive is designed to fluctuate within 0-180% of the remuneration standard amount, according to the degree of target achievement.
c. Medium-to-long term incentive
To improve performance and corporate value over the medium-and-long term and better share values with shareholders, shares with restrictions on transfer will be issued in advance in accordance with the amount set for each remuneration table.
4) Remuneration Determination Process
The objectivity and transparency of the Company’s remu- neration system for directors (excluding directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members) and officers are secured by having the Corporate Governance Committee deliberate and provide input on these matters. The remuner- ation of directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members is decided by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, within the limit of the remuneration amount resolved in advance at a general shareholders’ meeting.

Compliance
The Company is moving forward with the strengthening of its compliance system and is stressing to employees of the parent company, subsidiaries, and all AUTOBACS Group stores, including franchise stores, the importance of pursuing business activities that are legally and ethi- cally irreproachable.
Respect for the law and corporate ethics is a given. Based on this fundamental premise, the Company established its Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Action in response to the legitimate expectations of all
Risk Management
The Company, in addition to a risk management system for properly identifying and evaluating risks and implementing proper controls, has also adopted a comprehensive risk management structure integrating crisis management focused on limiting the extent of damage, and minimizing damage and losses, caused by a serious incident.
The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the representative director and chief executive offi- cer, sets the risk management policies for the fiscal year and, based on the policies and provisions concerning risk management, takes steps to smoothly and appropriately advance risk management activities.
Evaluating the Board of Directors
The Company analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of the Board of Directors to examine whether it is properly fulfilling its roles, find the issues at the Board of Directors, and promote its ongoing improvements.
In the fiscal 2019 effectiveness evaluation, all directors and Audit and Supervisory Committee members answered the eval- uation items in the format of multiple choice or short answers. These items included “operation of Board of Directors,” “agenda of Board of Directors,” “composition of Board of Directors,” “support system for outside directors,” “expected role of Audit and Supervisory Committee members,” “operation of the Corporate Governance Committee,” “relations with sharehold- ers and other investors,” and “initiatives to address issues indi- cated in the previous fiscal year’s evaluation.” The Corporate

stakeholders. These serve as fundamental principles guiding our efforts to strengthen compliance and con- duct education initiatives for employees of not only the Company but also franchisees. To monitor the sta- tus of legal compliance, we hold a monthly Compliance Secretariat Meeting, attended by members of relevant departments. The aim of the meeting is to confirm the presence/absence of acts that deviate from the Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Action. This system enables us to respond promptly when a problem is recognized.
The Risk Management Committee identifies key risk-related issues for each fiscal year and monitors mea- sures to address them. The General Affairs and Internal Control Department, Legal Department, Corporate Audit Department, and Car Lifestyle Support Center cooperate to assist monitoring by the Risk Management Committee.
In addition, the officer in charge of general affairs reports to the Board of Directors on serious incidents and responses to them, as set forth in the rules for report- ing on serious incidents, and shares these reports with the Audit and Supervisory Committee and other relevant departments within the Company.
Governance Committee analyzed the responses and identified the issues, and reported its findings to the Board of Directors.
As a result of such evaluations, it was confirmed that the Company’s Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee are for the most part functioning properly. However, this was the first effectiveness evaluation since our transition to company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, and we received multiple comments related to the transition.
As for current issues related to the Board of Directors, we confirmed that, as a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee, we need to confirm our thoughts about the mon- itoring model we should aim for, and we need to decide on and implement methods for monitoring and verifying individ- ual cases.

Messages from Outside Directors
   Yukio Kakegai
Independent Outside Director
(Full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee Member)
Efforts to strengthen corporate governance
The biggest change in recent years was AUTOBACS SEVEN’s transition in FY2019 to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. As a result, the Company’s organizational audits switched from direct audits based on each individual auditor’s own indepen- dence and responsibility to a system where the Audit and Supervisory Committee performs an audit after receiv- ing reports from the Corporate Audit Department and the Audit and Supervisory Committee Office staff. However, over the past year, it was thought that there had been insufficient preparation for audits under the new system during the transition period, and therefore as an Audit and Supervisory Committee member, I assumed the roles of an executive director as well as a full-time (selected) Audit and Supervisory Committee member with the right to investigate the company’s situation independently. In cases where it may be necessary to conduct an investi- gation, having an internal audit committee member who is familiar with the company’s affairs can be very helpful.
Aside from auditing, another change in overall gover- nance is that the number of directors decreased signifi- cantly in our transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. As a result, I feel that our small group of select directors has become more tight-knit in our deliberations. On the other hand, I believe that with fewer members, we will need to devise ways to address the lack of people with expertise in certain areas.
Qualities needed in an outside director
Although I am an outside director and a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee, I think it is import- ant for outside directors to have the perspective of being “outside the company,” whether or not they are mem- bers of the Audit and Supervisory Committee. In other words, we need to always remember that our real boss is the shareholder.
Our duty to the shareholder, our boss, is to monitor and audit the execution of management, and ultimately, I think our most important quality is whether we are pre- pared to replace the top management when there is a problem with execution.
On the other hand, when your role is limited to being an Audit and Supervisory Committee member, your most important qualities are a desire to see what cannot be seen and a willingness to probe deeper. You won’t be able to see what cannot be seen if you just accept reports on the premise that human nature is basically good. I believe it is essential to always take a strict view of monitoring and auditing.
Risks and opportunities
In recent years, AUTOBACS SEVEN has rapidly expanded the Group, mainly overseas. For this reason, what is needed more than ever is a system and the manpower to inspect every corner of our Group companies to avoid global risks.
Fortunately, our governance transition has strength- ened Group company audits by the Audit and Supervisory Committee Office staff. In addition, to strengthen our grip on governance and compliance at Group compa- nies, we are expanding the staff of the Corporate Audit Department and assigning the Audit and Supervisory Committee Office staff to serve concurrently as audi- tors of major subsidiaries and affiliates to keep a close eye on them.
Future challenges
With our transition to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee and a focus on organizational audits, an important issue for the future is to establish a system that can maintain and improve the quality of audits even if the people performing them change.
Even if the system is strengthened, at the end of the day, people are still involved, so it is equally important to ensure the quality of personnel involved in the audit. What kind of personnel should be involved in the audit? I believe that we need real professionals. The Chinese characters for the word “professional” are pronounced kurouto. In Eastern thought, this kurouto is a person who can see things even in the dark. This is exactly what I believe we need in auditing—to cultivate people who are able to notice things in the dark with no hints.

   Efforts to strengthen corporate governance
Starting from the fiscal year ended March 2019, AUTOBACS SEVEN transitioned to a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. With this transi- tion, audits by Audit and Supervisory Committee mem- bers became focused on paperwork audits rather than physical inspections. There are general concerns about the adequacy of audits at a company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee. However, the Company has enhanced the Audit and Supervisory Committee Office, increased its staff, and enhanced the provision of informa- tion related to its audits, and I believe that at this point we have achieved adequate coverage.
Succession plans and monitoring methods, which are important to corporate governance, are currently an ongo- ing theme, and are now under discussion based on the company’s goals and specific management strategies.
Qualities needed in an outside director
In addition to AUTOBACS SEVEN, I serve as an outside director at other companies, including a pharmaceutical company. Taking these experiences into account, I believe that the role of the outside director is important for intro- ducing an outside perspective, and therefore objectivity and transparency are our most important qualities.
On the other hand, if we adopt a self-righteousness outsider’s perspective, we cannot contribute to the improvement of corporate value. While maintaining an outsider’s perspective, I believe that outside directors must deepen their understanding of the company’s his- tory and the management philosophy and corporate cul- ture that have emerged from it, and then offer objective opinions based on these understandings.
Risks and opportunities
To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, we have consistently put the highest priority on the safety of our employees and customers. When a state of emergency was declared, we took measures to prevent the spread of the virus such as restricting the maintenance hours at our stores and having office workers work from home as a general rule. Our rapid response to prevent the spread of the virus is a credit to our ability to prepare for risk.
We are currently considering what we need to do as a company in the next phase. I believe it is time to take a hard look at what business opportunities and risks lie ahead under our new mode of life coexisting with the coronavirus, and in particular to prepare for the coming of a new era of car lifestyle.
Minesaburo Miyake
Independent Outside Director
(Audit and Supervisory Committee Member)
On the other hand, it is important for employees to be aware of the true nature of their work in terms of address- ing risks on a daily basis. For this reason, I believe our employees must internalize our management philoso- phy and Guidelines for Action on a daily basis. Currently, I am concerned that there are too few opportunities to talk about our philosophy of management in the training sys- tem and in practice as a preparation for the future.
Social issues and AUTOBACS SEVEN
In recent years, there has been a growing trend of compa- nies taking advantage of their strengths in their business areas to address social issues such as the SDGs, includ- ing ESG investment, while increasing corporate value. I believe these challenges require a careful and concerted approach. Specifically, it is important to do the follow- ing: (1) adopt a perspective that looks 10 years into the future; (2) adopt a narrow but deep area of expertise (or region); and (3) create an environment in which employ- ees can work with pride. I believe that the AUTOBACS brand is already taking this approach, and I think it is par- ticularly important to develop and strengthen this brand even more carefully than before.
To do so, it is necessary to engage in discussions and initiatives with a medium- to long-term perspective on improving brand value in relation to existing and new busi- nesses. My previous experience is with food manufactur- ers and incorporated foundations, and I hope the insights I have gained in those positions will help me contribute to this goal.

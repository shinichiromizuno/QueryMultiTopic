 Challenges and Growth Trajectory
AUTOBACS was founded in 1974 as Japan’s first comprehensive specialty automotive goods store. After com- mencing sales of private brand (PB) tires and oil in 1977, we soon commanded a leading share of the domes- tic automotive goods market by responding to the diverse tastes and needs of our customers with proprietary products and services. As our motorized society has continued to develop and change over time, the AUTOBACS Group will continue to achieve sustainable growth by boldly shaking up business formats, products, and ser- vices and contributing to an affluent motorized society.

 Message from Management
 Kiomi Kobayashi
Representative Director and Chief Executive Officer
 Aiming to become a 100-year company,
we will squarely face society, cars and the daily lives of people
and carve out markets for the future together with our stakeholders.
During my two years as the chief executive officer, we have achieved results with the 2017 Medium-Term Business Plan (covering the fiscal years ending March 31, 2018 to March 31, 2020) designed to proceed with the reforms of the Company Group with fresh perspectives and bold ideas.
In order to contribute to the development of motorized society and the affluent car life of our customers, AUTOBACS was established as Japan’s first one-stop shop for automotive goods and opened its first store in 1974. Since then, we have worked to consistently strengthen our business platform comprised of headquarters, directly managed stores and franchisees. In the coming years, however, we expect that technological innovations beyond our imagination and changes in people’s values will transform not only cars but also society and our lifestyles in a multitude of ways.
Under such circumstances, our vision “2050 Creating Our Future Together” enshrines our commitment to squarely face society, cars and the daily lives of people in any era and continue to carve out markets for the future together with our stakeholders. Based on this vision, we will make Company-wide concerted efforts to lay the foundation for becoming a 100-year company under the 2017 Medium-Term Business Plan. We look forward to the ongoing support of our shareholders and other investors as we push ahead with this effort.
13 AUTOBACS SEVEN Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2018
 
  CEO Q&A
Q1
Please give an overview of the results for the fiscal year ended March 2018.
We yielded positive results from increased business activities of franchisees and improvements in the earnings of domestic store subsidiaries.
Our results for the fiscal year ended March 2018 were boosted by an increase in sales of tires, a product we have been selling with priority, as new car sales in Japan recovered for the second consecutive year. There was a last-min- ute surge in demand for summer tires ahead of price hikes, and demand for winter tires and tire chains rose due to snowfall all across Japan in the win- ter. In addition, dash cams, a device that has come under the spotlight for preventing accidents from aggressive driving of others, recorded nearly a dou- bling of sales year on year. Measures to increase business activities of fran- chisees were also successful, and the earnings of domestic store subsidiaries improved significantly.
As a result, the Company Group recorded net sales of ¥211.6 billion, up 3.7% year on year, operating income of ¥7.2 billion, up 25.0%, and profit attrib- utable to owners of parent of ¥5.4 billion, up 79.2%.
Aiming to become a 100-year company, the Company Group will proac- tively propose ideas for new car lifestyles. To this end, it is essential above all that franchisees regain their vigor. Additionally, it is essential that domestic store subsidiaries improve their earnings, something we have been working on over the last several years. In fiscal year 2017, we were able to register major achievements in these two challenge areas and make a steady start towards achieving our goals in the first year of the 2017 Medium-Term Business Plan.

  It is important that we have a structure that can adapt to any kind of motorized society and create markets.
Some time ago, owning and riding a car used to be seen as a status sym- bol. Until around the year 2000, number of cars owned soared, and automo- tive goods sold in droves as soon as they hit the shelves. But now in Japan, the population is aging at a globally unprecedented speed, and younger gen- erations are said to be losing interest in cars. In fact, the percentage of our Company Group loyalty members in their 20s to 30s has declined over the past decade, while the percentage of families and senior citizens who are in their 40s and above has increased. Technology has also advanced at whirlwind speed with the shift from gasoline cars to electric vehicles, the rise in smart cars connected to the internet, and the development of automated driving, while customer values are becoming ever more diverse. Meanwhile, we are beginning to see the expansion of car-sharing services.
There is no doubt that motorized societies are at a major turning point. That said, if we think about the average life span of a car or other factors, we expect

 CEO Q&A
Q3
What exactly do you mean by creating markets?
even more requests and consultations regarding cars to emerge in the next 20 to 30 years at least amid new and old values mixed together. This is precisely where the opportunities lie for us.
Although we refer to customers as a group, both their desired services and expectations differ by their geographic area and attributes. For example, in more rural areas, cars are a daily necessity and the phenomenon of young peo- ple losing interest in cars is not applicable. In this regard, it is dangerous to make a forecast of the future changes in a uniform manner. It is more import- ant that we earn the trust and support of customers as in the brand message, “Anything about cars, you find at AUTOBACS,” regardless of the changes soci- ety undergoes and remain a “professional and friendly presence” that custom- ers can always turn to.
We will create markets based on the three values provided to customers.
Ever since I became the chief executive officer, I have stated that AUTOBACS will become a “professional and friendly presence” and will “restore the sense of excitement” that both employees and customers used to have. It is becom- ing ever more critical not to be passive and to create markets ourselves in line with the changes in the times. As a starting point, we have classified the values provided by AUTOBACS into three categories. The first is “demand for com- fortable use of a car,” the basic and important value represented by “safety and security.” Tires, other maintenance products, and statutory inspections and safety checks fall under this category as well as dash cams.
The second category is “demand for enjoyment using a car,” which rep- resents “value of experience.” This category provides products bearing in mind outdoor activities that utilize a car, such as lifestyle-related goods, drones, automated bikes, and campers.
The third category is “demand for greater enjoyment of car itself,” which represents “self-expression.” This category includes products that increase the self-satisfaction of customers through getting enjoyment out of riding and customizing cars, such as motor sports goods, garage goods, and products of a racing sports brand (ARTA). We will further explore these three categories to create markets for the future.
We have developed and begun experimenting with Japan’s first new business formats
We have already begun experimenting with new business formats, includ- ing AUTOBACS GARAGE FUCHU, a garage café-inspired store that custom- ers not knowledgeable about cars will also find enjoyable, and the opening of AUTOBACS Mini at shopping malls which provide information on statutory safety inspections and car washing to shoppers.
We also launched JACK & MARIE, Japan’s first car-centric lifestyle brand. We began selling its products on ZOZOTOWN, Japan’s largest online fashion shopping site, which was followed by the opening of its first store in Yokohama as a store independent from AUTOBACS brand. The brand’s lineup consists of 2,000 SKUs, such as accessories for enhancing the car interior as well as table- ware and clothing for spending time outdoors in style. By focusing on the val- ues customers gain from experience, rather than ownership of products, we offer lifestyles that will make them want to immediately pack their bags into the car and leave for outdoor activities.
Going forward, we need to ask ourselves how we will incorporate the ele- ments of new business formats into our existing stores in the respective regions and generate earnings. Given the current business environment, if we

 Q5
How do you intend to proceed with product development?
do nothing, the automotive goods market could get even smaller. In creating markets, it is vital that we develop products as well as transform the way we sell them and our retail approaches.
We will boost our private-brand products and tire lineup.
We will accelerate the development of products corresponding with our three pillar categories. Specifically, for customers who are general driver, we will develop products such as tires, oil, batteries and wipers that require routine replacements under our private brand “AQ.” (AUTOBACS QUALITY.) as the products of choice. We will also develop frequently utilized car-washing goods and small articles and keep introducing them into the market as AQ. lineup. In the immediate term, we are focusing on the development of low-price tire products. At the same time, we will strengthen our lineup and sales of all-sea- son tires and develop this market since there are definitely rising needs for such tires.
In addition, we will have more items from the private offshoot brands of our unique lifestyle brand JACK & MARIE, namely, JKM, a brand offering useful goods for car outings, interior goods and fragrances, and GORDON MILLER, a brand targeted at consumers who enjoy spending time in the garage. We will continue to develop products that will provide enjoyment to customers.
We will increase our competitiveness by integrating online and physical stores.
In recent years, we also face intense competition with other industries such as online shopping companies. Physical stores are, however, still indispensable for cars in terms of attaching automotive goods, statutory safety inspections, maintenance, and other aftercare services. That said, online busi- nesses cannot be ignored in the coming years. A key factor for remaining competitive will be how we integrate physical and online stores so that they better demonstrate their respective

strengths.
Therefore, I have made strengthening our
online business one of our priorities. In partic- ular, we will establish a platform for providing tires and wheel sets as well as products pro- cured overseas to both individuals and corpo- rations and expand our customer base. We will also enhance systems to sell products online and attach the products at the stores of the Company Group. We will ensure that we secure customer reservations for attaching products at the stores, so that online and physical stores can be integrated, which in turn will lead to more efficient personnel assignments and operations at the stores.
We will need to further raise the stores’ capabilities of service bay in order to scale up these initiatives to our franchisees. During the period of the Medium-Term Business Plan, I wish we build up the foundation of a platform that integrates online and physical stores.

 CEO Q&A
Q7
What measures are you taking to secure human resources?
The training institution we established for securing mechanics as our priority is now in operation.
Of the approximately 10,000 employees of the Company Group, approximately 3,800 people are certified mechanics. As personnel shortages become more serious with the acceleration of the declining birthrate and aging population, it will become a significant challenge to secure mechanics for further increasing our capabilities of service bays.
Foreseeing such circumstances, we established Chain Growth Co., Ltd. in March 2017 as an institution for fostering and training mechanics who will be dispatched within the chain and developed schemes for them to acquire the certification of mechanics in a short period of time. We also train over- seas technical trainees into mechanics and actively accept them at AUTOBACS stores. As of the end of March 2018, we welcomed more than 120 trainees from our partner school in the Philippines. Furthermore, we put spotlight on automobile mechanics and have selected “AUTOBACS GUYS,” a select group of mechanics from all of our stores who epitomize AUTOBACS’ “professional and friendly” services, to appear in a TV commercial. Through such initiatives, we foster pride in working as an automobile mechanic at AUTOBACS stores.
We are improving the way we approach our roughly 7.63 million members.
The Company Group has approximately 7,630,000 members who visit our stores at least once a year. This number indicates that there is still a lot of room for increas- ing the number of statutory safety inspections. We are thus striving to differentiate our unique safety and security services, including repair and replacement warran- ties for flat tires and window glass and bumper scratches as well as post-inspection maintenance services at reasonable prices. We are also engaged in ongoing activ- ities to encourage customers who have previously signed up for statutory safety inspections to reserve follow-up inspections and approaching visiting customers at the stores. The number of statutory safety inspections in the market decreased in the fiscal year ended March 2018. It will, however, conversely increase in the fiscal year ending March 2019, and therefore, we intend to give particular focus on sell- ing statutory safety inspections. We will enhance our 15-minute inspections at the service bays as well as training and education on operations for these inspections.
We will strengthen our wholesale business and aim to achieve a surplus in two years.
We are expanding our overseas business, especially in the ASEAN region. In the fiscal year ended March 2018, we not only continued to operate AUTOBACS stores but also began conducting businesses with our partners. In Thailand, we formed a capital and business alliance with the P.T.G. Group, a leading local gas station chain, and opened small stores on its premises providing mainly main- tenance services. We plan to open 20 stores in the fiscal year ending March 2019. In Singapore, we opened in-store shops at existing gas stations and commenced vehicle maintenance services for car sharing companies. We also began whole-selling to home centers and supermarkets. In China, we invested in Guangdong CarHouse Industrial Development Holdings Co., Ltd. that devel- ops platforms for selling products to maintenance plants and car-washing sites, and began finding new purchasers and developing private-brand products.
Up to now we have been expanding our business by bringing our retail business format in Japan to overseas. Nowadays, the products sold under the AUTOBACS brand, the No. 1 brand in the Japanese market, are beginning to receive positive reviews overseas. In this light, we will expand the countries where we do busi- ness, work on developing private-brand products for boosting the wholesale busi- ness, and aim to put the overseas business into a surplus in two years.
  Q8
How are you promoting the sales of statutory safety inspections which provide opportunities for contact with customers?
  Q9
What progress has been made by your overseas business which you position as your future growth business?
  17 AUTOBACS SEVEN Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2018

 Q10
How are the used car purchasing, imported car dealership, and BtoB businesses?
The imported car dealership business recorded steady growth. We will reform the earnings structure of the used car purchasing and BtoB businesses.
The imported car dealership business we entered by acquiring a BMW deal- ership has received positive reviews from importers and is expanding its geo- graphic coverage in the form of attracting customers mainly in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The positive reviews owe not only to our financial strength but also to the experience and know-how we have gained from our contacts with customers at the stores. We will take steps to increase efficiency such as exchanging inventories and human resources among dealerships. In terms of creating synergies with AUTOBACS businesses, we will, for example, make use of the dealerships to improve the quality of our customer and pit services.
Stores specializing in used car purchases have not made progress as planned. It has been difficult to assign human resources who are knowledgeable about the operations including appraisals. Furthermore, the cost of purchasing used cars has exceeded our expectations. AUTOBACS still hopes to meet the needs of cus- tomers who are looking to sell their used cars or be introduced to a new car when debating whether to get a statutory safety inspection, replace their car or get rid of their car. At the same time, we have to make improvements to avoid excess spending and not yielding a profit. Thus, from the year ending March 2019, we will transfer this business to the domestic AUTOBACS business and strive to improve earnings including closing unprofitable stores. We will shift to a business model of operating used car purchase stores on the premises of AUTOBACS stores that are run by franchisees while holding down investment and cost.
The BtoB business is seeing a rise in home center and other customers. However, logistics expenses and purchasing costs are putting downward pres- sure on earnings. We will switch to high-selling and profitable products and review the terms with customers for unprofitable transactions.
We will ensure that the increased business activities of franchisees are not temporary and lead to increases in revenue and profit.
As I stated at the beginning, our focused efforts to bring life back to fran- chisees are beginning to yield results. In the fiscal year ending March 2019, we will make even more changes benefiting customers as part of our efforts

to increase the business activities of franchisees. Specifically, we will focus our efforts on strength- ening tire and statutory safety inspection sales and renovating our stores. Store renovations are not sim- ply remodeling; they will offer products based on the three values provided to customers and enhance cus- tomer services and operations so that customers can shop in comfort. Meanwhile, headquarters will con- tinue to develop products, carry out store optimiza- tions and consolidations in the respective geographic areas, and improve the earnings of domestic store subsidiaries. We will also give priority to establishing a platform that integrates online and physical stores. Overseas, we will make efforts to expand our whole- sale business.
Through these initiatives, for the fiscal year ending March 2019, we anticipate net sales of ¥215.0 billion, up 1.6% year on year, operating income of ¥9.0 bil- lion, up 23.6%, and net profit attributable to owners of parent of ¥6.8 billion, up 25.8%.

 CFO Q&A
 We will implement the measures under the Medium-Term Business Plan to improve profitability in excess of
our cost of capital.
Isao Hirata
Director and Senior Managing Executive Officer, Head of Corporate Administration
Q1
How has asset and capital efficiency improved?
Monitoring capital efficiencies of businesses. Contributing to improving ROE.
The 2017 Medium-Term Business Plan considers improving capital efficiency to increase corporate value as a critical management matter, and aims to achieve a consolidated ROE of 7% by the fiscal year ending March 2020 as a checkpoint on the way to double-digit ROE in the future. To this end, ROE in the fiscal year ended March 2018 improved from 2.3% to 4.3% year-on-year.
The Company Group sets our weighted average cost of capital (WACC) at 5.6% (tentatively during the plan) and, in principle, establishes business plans bearing that in mind. In managing the performance of each of our businesses including the overseas business and new businesses, we will refer to ROA as an important indicator. Based on business profitability and asset usage effi- ciency for a given length of time, we set KPIs connected to target ROAs and the operating income of each business and seek to improve the profitability of management resources.
As an outcome of these initiatives, gross margin improved significantly in the fiscal year ended March 2018 thanks to factors such as controlling selling prices by store subsidiaries and improving the inventory turnover rate through reducing dead stock. As a result, operating income improved.

 Q2
What cost reductions were made at the administrative departments?
Q3
What is your view on cash flow and shareholder returns?
Meanwhile, in the fiscal year ended March 2018, we implemented measures to decrease the wholesale gross margin for franchisees only for one year in order to increase the business activities of franchisees, including strengthening prod- uct lineup and sales promotion. Supported by these initiatives, the profits of fran- chisees improved greatly and wholesale sales also recovered. This has created a virtuous cycle in which a robust retail business leads to a robust wholesale busi- ness. In the fiscal year ending March 2019, we will reduce the wholesale gross margin to the original level, while using the funds to make focused investments in promoting the sales of tires that are a necessity for cars and have many repeat customers, statutory safety inspections that will rise in demand, and renovations for store reforms to support the expansion of the earnings of each store.
Progress in cutting IT maintenance costs
For the administrative departments, we are planning ¥1.0 billion in expense cuts by the fiscal year ending March 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended March 2017 by undertaking measures such as promoting operational effi- ciency, IT cost reductions and purchasing reforms. In particular, in the fiscal year ended March 2018, we were able to cut IT maintenance costs by transi- tioning to a cloud system and reviewing maintenance coverage. On the other hand, we will promote our aggressive IT strategy designed to develop online sale platforms and to know customers and improve customer services as part of our business investment, and in doing so we will make clear investments with ROI in mind.
Switched to performance-based shareholder returns while maintaining a high level of dividends
We switched our dividend policy for paying returns to shareholders from main- taining a consolidated DOE of 3% or higher to performance-based returns. Based on paying a stable dividend, dividend amounts are determined according to a consolidated dividend payout ratio of 50-100% and consideration of business performance. In the fiscal year ended March 2018, we continued the per-share dividend at ¥60 annually (consolidated dividend payout ratio 91.6%) based on this policy. The same amount is planned for the fiscal year ending March 2019.
During the three years of the 2017 Medium-Term Business Plan, we plan to make a business investment of approximately ¥21.0 billion in store reforms, over- seas business and development of new businesses. With regard to cash on hand, ¥25.0 billion for working capital and planned business investments is considered the optimum level. We will reduce any surplus funds by paying returns to share- holders flexibly through the end of the fiscal year ending March 2020. Based on this view, we will secure a certain level of equity capital that is considered a sound financial base enabling agile financial strategies, while at the same time, expand profits to swiftly improve profitability which exceeds the cost of capital.

 Toward the Realization of
Three Values
In offering the three values of “safety and security,” “experiential value,” and “self-expression” we aim to be a professional and friendly presence for our customers.
  Strengths
• Strong automotive goods store brand recognition
• 600 stores operated by highly experienced franchisees
• More than 10,000 employees well-versed in automotive goods, including over 3,700 mechanics
• Customer base and database of around 8 mil- lion people
Summary of FY March 2018
Net sales in the domestic AUTOBACS business for the fis- cal year ended March 31, 2018 dipped 0.5% year on year to ¥178.6 billion due to the factors including the trans- fer of shares of a consolidated subsidiary, which oper- ates AUTOBACS chain stores, to a franchisee. However, total sales for the domestic businesses in the AUTOBACS chain, including franchise outlets, increased 1.3% on a same-store basis and overall-store basis. Segment profit also rose 14.3% year on year to ¥16.5 billion owing to earnings improvements at domestic store subsidiaries.

Opening Smart+1 and
AUTOBACS Mini stores
To meet the basic “safety and security” needs of our customers, we are develop- ing and opening new store formats that
offer only certain products and services and which can be operated at low cost. The first Maintenance Members-only “Smart+1” store that opened in February 2017 provides car maintenance services centering on hand car wash. Customers can wait in comfort in the café area. Also, in fis- cal year 2017, we opened five “AUTOBACS Mini” stores to provide information about statutory safety inspections and car wash services to shopping center customers. With an emphasis on ease and convenience, we plan to open more low-cost stores in regions where there is demand as a way of increasing our interaction with customers.

Meanwhile, with the aim of generating experiential value from enjoyable car use, we launched the “JACK & MARIE” brand as Japan’s first car-centric lifestyle shop to propose five situations: (1) packing, (2) loading, (3) enjoy indoor space when driving, (4) sleeping comfortably in the car, and (5) enjoying cafés at one’s destination. In conjunc- tion with the sales launch of the brand’s original products on Japan’s largest fashion online retailer “ZOZOTOWN,” we opened the first brick-and-mortar store in March 2018 in the Yokohama Bay Quarter shopping center.

Super AUTOBACS stores offer customers a wealth of information about top-selling products and new products thanks to their overwhelming product lineup and display. The general counter also has professional staff members waiting to handle various requests and inquiries from cus- tomers in a friendly manner.

   Strategy: Statutory Safety Inspections
 Focusing on bolstering safety inspections business to address cyclical demand
As part of our statutory safety inspections and maintenance services to deliver safety and security to our customers, we selected a number of mechanics working at our ser- vice bays to be involved in our “AUTOBACS GUYS” televi- sion commercials and in-store safety inspection advertising campaign to convey their technical skills and passion for automobile maintenance. However, the number of statu- tory inspections performed in fiscal year 2017 dipped 1.9% year on year to 633,000 owing to a considerable decrease in the number of vehicles subject to inspections in Japan
Statutory Safety Inspections Performed (all-stores basis)
during the same period.
As fiscal 2018 will see a cyclical increase in the number
of cars subject to safety inspections, we are stepping up efforts to inform our Maintenance Members about this. In addition to encouraging customers to make online bookings or over the telephone, we continue to implement training courses for our mechanics in order to make our “15-min- ute inspections” at service bays and store operations even more efficient. We also offer Maintenance Members that have completed a statutory safety inspection an additional layer of safety with our “Three Relief Star Compensation” service to deliver free damage compensation for one year up to a certain amount for any damage to tires, window glass, or bumpers. Moreover, we are implementing pro- active sales activities at each store, such as encouraging customers who have completed their safety inspection to make a booking for next time, as well as taking good care of customers upon arrival at our stores.

                Strategy: Automobile Purchase and Sales (C@RS)
 Structural shift to operating model for curbing investment costs
At mainly our existing AUTOBACS stores we provide a secure, simple, and transparent car purchasing service based on our patented appraisal system (Appraisal Dr.). We are also operating automobile purchase and sales stores under the “AUTOBACS C@RS” brand, which on top of car purchases, offer sales and leasing services too.
In fiscal 2017 we sought to differentiate ourselves in
Automobiles Purchased and Automobiles Sold
(all-stores basis, including used car purchase stores)
the car purchasing market by leveraging television com- mercials, but owing to changes in purchase appraisal per- sonnel and a decline in sales to used car dealers at auto auctions and the like, sales volume at AUTOBACS C@RS franchise stores fell 11.6% year on year to 24,000 units. In terms of earnings, losses increased due to the number of appraisals falling short of plan and the booking of upfront costs associated with store openings.

  Domestic AUTOBACS Business Store Operations
 Promoting Store Operational
Reforms
In order to be professional and friendly and construct a relationship with our customers so they visit our stores time and time again, we are promoting reforms of our store operations based the opinions of our customers.
 Summary of FY March 2018
In terms of store operations, more than 100 counsel- ors (supervisors) are deployed from two sales headquar- ters—one for the eastern half of Japan and another for the western half—to sales divisions in 12 areas across the country. The counselors visit stores once or twice a week to provide support on formulating and implement- ing store restructuring based on headquarter policies. The counselors leverage customer opinion data from the Customer Voice Program and analyze Maintenance Member data to provide guidance on stocking top-selling items (in each area and at individual stores) and creating sales-floor displays with the goal of boosting store sales
Store Support and Guidance
In the domestic AUTOBACS business, 576 stores are operated by 77 franchisees (including 15 subsidiaries), while 27 are operated directly by AUTOBACS. Based on an annual marketing plan drawn up by the Company, which serves as the franchise headquarters, each store runs flexibly taking into account factors such as changes in weather and social circumstances, as well as regional customer demand. Within the Company’s eastern and western sales headquarters, a total of 12 sales divisions
Store Renovations
In fiscal 2019 and 2020, in conjunction with store opera- tional improvements, we plan to renovate stores by incor- porating the know-how we acquired during the process of developing new products and new store formats. In terms of physical upgrades to our stores, in order to have our customers recognize our professional and friendly presence, we are cleaning up in-store service bay areas and toilets, refurbishing customer waiting corners, and expanding sales displays of lifestyle products.
share and strengthening their earnings capabilities.
In fiscal 2018, we informed our customers in advance of a shipment price hike by a tire manufacturer owing to skyrocketing raw material prices and successfully endeavored to work with our customers on sourcing products with more affordable prices. As a result, tire sales remained brisk. Sales of dash cams also increased due to the reporting of accidents from aggressive driving of others and accidents involving drivers going the wrong way. At the same time, in addition to tackling the key issue of improving store earnings, we pushed ahead with
regional store restructuring and reorganization.
have been established and counselors for each area pro- vide guidance and support for stores in their area.
Our Medium-Term Business Plan calls for stronger sales of tires, statutory safety inspections, and car-re- lated lifestyle products at existing AUTOBACS chain stores and the Company provides support for stocking items that are in peak demand, creating sales-floor dis- plays, implementing marketing activities, and even offers daily operational support.

    Customer Voice Program and Operation Management
 Harnessing customer opinions to improve services and develop products
In order to generate an AUTOBACS Group culture that enables us to act as a professional and friendly presence, we launched our Customer Voice Program to collect the opinions of customers that visited our stores. Customers access and answer a survey via the barcode on their shopping receipt, which we use to develop products and improve in-store customer interactions, product lineup, and facilities.
For example, at a store where a customer highlighted the long waiting time before they could speak to a staff member, staffing and time-management operations are reviewed. A follow-up examination is conducted on changes in purchase trends and improvement results are verified. We have also implemented the AUTOBACS AWARDS system to recognize outstanding stores and staff members. The assessment criteria for the awards
are based on the analysis of items that correlate strongly with customer satisfaction across all stores, such as accu- rately informing customers of waiting times and deliver- ing polite greetings to customers when welcoming and sending off.

   Management Improvement at Store Subsidiaries
 Exhaustive measures for improving ROA
ROA is an important metric for the Group’s subsidiaries and stores, which is why we set conditional KPIs and engage in performance management. For store earnings too, from an ROA perspective we focus on profit mar- gin and asset turnover and make sure that improvements are achieved in the key KPIs of sales, gross margin, and SG&A expenses.
For sales, we make appropriate product and price changes depending on market demand, while for gross margin, we do not offer excessive over-the-counter dis- counts and make every effort to reduce immovable inventory and curb disposal losses. With regard to the nor- malization of inventory, an especially important issue for the Group, we strive to manage inventory on a standalone product basis and increase our stock of products with a high inventory turnover rate, while at the same time, more accurately reducing stock that has a low inventory turn- over rate. As for SG&A expenses, we make good use of data collected through our Customer Voice Program to improve store productivity by streamlining work shifts
and operations. We are also working to curb indirect costs such as rent and system costs.
We have extended these initiatives from store sub- sidiaries to franchisee stores and observed considerable earnings improvements at all stores in fiscal 2018.

 Overseas Business
 Strengthening Our Business Platform
Mainly in the ASEAN Region
We are beefing up our business platform mainly in the ASEAN region, which continues to enjoy economic growth, with core operations in retail, services, and new wholesale businesses through capital and business tie-ups with leading local firms and joint venture operations.
  Strengths
• Top brand in Japan
• Close relationships with suppliers in Japan
• Many years of retail business know-how in overseas markets

     Alliances with local partners
Each country is different when it comes to the auto- motive goods and maintenance service market. We provide goods and services that meet the needs of local customers and have business tie-ups with local partner firms in each region to secure revenue. In Thailand, we are opening stores in collaboration with the PTG Group, the country’s second-largest gas stand

We are also deliv- ering products to Kit Loong stores. Elsewhere, in the Philippines we are supplying products to the Motech Group, a local operator of automotive goods and main- tenance stores.

   New Business (Wholesale)
 As a new business overseas, we are continually expand- ing the provision of services to retail stores and local firms and the wholesaling of products developed and manufactured in various regions.
For example, we are also focusing on the whole- sale business, including oil products for Russia sourced in Japan and brake pads for Indonesia manufactured in
China. In China, we have entered into a business alliance with a company that operates an automotive goods sales and services platform and manufactures and sells car air fresheners. In addition to distributing products via this company’s sales channels, we are also starting to consider the manufacturing and sale of products under our own brand.

In conjunction with the opening of a shopping mall store by alliance partner PTG Group, the subsidiary aims to expand market share and boost profit.
Current Status and Future Direction
In Singapore, where car ownership is expensive, AUTOBACS stores similar to those in Japan are being opened to target upper-middle-income earners. In fiscal 2018, in addition to the opening of stores at gas stations, the subsidiary expanded its wholesale business to local home improvement stores, super- markets, and gas stations. The subsidiary also secured a con- tract to provide maintenance services for vehicles used by a local car-sharing company.

Current Status and Future Direction
In January 2016, AUTOBACS entered into a capital and busi- ness alliance with the Motech Group, a local provider of automo- bile maintenance services. Under the law of the Philippines, the Company Group itself cannot open stores, therefore going for- ward, the Group will offer brand licenses, wholesale certain prod- ucts and provide support for store network development to local stores. In addition, the Group will develop its business mainly by wholesaling merchandise to the Motech Group.
Current Status and Future Direction
We entered the Chinese market in 2004 but closed all of our stores by the end of fiscal year 2015 in order to reorganize our retail business. However, our automotive goods trading business remains in operation, which recorded an operating loss of ¥2 mil- lion in fiscal 2018. We will continue to develop the trading busi- ness and strengthen our supply of merchandize to Japan and other parts of Asia.

 Developing Future Earnings
Pillars
We are nurturing our imported car dealer and BtoB businesses as new growth drivers – areas in which we expect to leverage the strengths of the Company Group and realize synergies with the domestic AUTOBACS business in the future.
  Strengths
• AUTOBACS brand recognition, reliability, and financial strength
• Retail sector services, and know-how on customer service and treatment
• Collaboration with existing AUTOBACS stores
• Product procurement capabilities and extensive product lineup
Summary of FY March 2018
Net sales in the used car buying, dealer, and BtoB busi- ness increased 30.9% year on year to ¥30.8 billion for a segment operating loss of ¥1.6 billion (vs. a loss of ¥0.5 billion in fiscal 2017). Operations continue to steadily expand in the imported car dealer business, including an increase in the number of dealerships owing to a business
Imported Car Dealer Business
Expanding BMW/MINI dealer operations
In recent years, non-Japanese car makers have succes- sively rolled out compact vehicles and as a result, sales of these models are increasing in Japan. In this market environment, we entered the imported car dealer busi- ness in April 2015 and are expanding our operations with the acquisition of trading rights for three dealerships in Tokyo in fiscal 2018. We are currently an official BMW/ MINI dealer with a total of 11 locations in Japan, six of which are in Tokyo and the other five in Tochigi Prefecture.
Furthermore, we are steadily expanding earnings by melding imported car dealer brands and hospitality with the sales and management know-how of AUTOBACS. Going forward, we intend to strengthen collaboration between dealerships and further expand earnings by add- ing more locations to our network.
Opportunities and Risks
• Realignment of automobile dealer industry
• Tough price competition due to fierce competi- tion from peers
• Rising purchase prices and distribution costs • Expanding online automotive goods market
acquisition, but losses in the BtoB business have widened and remain an issue up ahead. While we will endeavor to continually expand these new growth businesses, we also intend to focus on initiatives aimed at improving earn- ings in the BtoB business.

Developing a wholesaling market outside of the AUTOBACS Group
In fiscal 2018, we engaged in the wholesaling of merchan- dise to AUTOBACS Group stores, home improvement stores, and discount stores through our consolidated sub- sidiaries Cores International Inc. and Palstar K.K. The for- mer handles various automotive goods such as motor sports products, while the latter deals merchandize includ- ing oil and repair paint, etc.
While wholesaling to home improvement stores increased in fiscal 2018, profit declined mainly as a result of higher oil purchasing costs and distribution expenses. Subsequently, we intend to improve earnings by switch- ing to top-selling products and merchandise with high profit margins and at the same time by reviewing distri- bution and transaction conditions. We also aim to expand this business by focusing on increasing sales of parts to repair shops through e-commerce channels.

The internet business was separated from the domestic AUTOBACS business in fiscal 2019 to strengthen exist- ing online sales channels with a core focus on tires, the Company’s mainstay product. In addition, we are upgrad- ing our existing website and developing a platform with the aim of turning it into a new source of earnings that will contribute to the expansion of the BtoC and BtoB busi- nesses in the future.

  Migration of Used Car Purchasing Business
From fiscal 2019, the used car purchasing business was moved to the domestic AUTOBACS business and some unprofitable stores have been closed in an effort to improve earnings. We are pushing ahead with a structural shift to an operating model that keeps down investments and costs at franchise store premises.

 Our Approach to ESG
Owing to the 2015 Paris Agreement and the adoption of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), require- ments of the international community and frameworks relating to SRI (socially responsible investment) and ESG (environment, social and governance) are changing rapidly.

2. Recycling Car Freshener Packaging
Collecting and reusing
Since October 2017 we have been collecting empty car freshener products that we sell in Japan. Part of

  the packaging is recycled and made into road safety reflectors.
This project is composed
of the Company, Febreze
deodorizer and air fresh-
ener manufacturer Proctor

3. Recycling Used Tires
Manufacturing and consumption responsibility
Every year in Japan there are around 100 million used tires, the equivalent of one million tons. The used tires we collect from customers at AUTOBACS stores are shred- ded into small chips by waste disposal companies and recycled as fuel mainly at cement plants and paper mills (91% of used tires in Japan are recycled).

Mt. Fuji is registered on the World Heritage List. However, the foothills of the mountain unfortunately see a lot of unauthorized dumping of rubbish, including many tires. Every year we take part in a cleanup operation with the NPO Fujisan Club. In fiscal 2018, 41 volunteers partici- pated in the 17th cleanup.
5. Reduction of CO2 Emissions
Electric vehicle charging stations
We have installed electric vehicle charging stations at 102 AUTOBACS Group stores (as of March 31, 2018). On top of enhancing convenience for our EV and PHV custom- ers, we aim to contribute to a sustainable society where humans and cars are in harmony with the environment by promoting environmental conservation activities across the entire Group.
Initiatives in distribution
When transporting products not requiring express deliv- ery, we make use of rail freight containers instead of trucks to reduce CO2 emissions. We also utilize reusable folding containers in various sizes to deliver products to stores in an effort to reduce waste in the form of card- board boxes.
Reducing CO2 emissions with mega solar projects
In 2013 we installed solar power generation panels using areas of the roof and other unused sections of our West Japan Logistics Center (Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture). This initiative reduces our emissions of CO2. Total power gen- erated in fiscal 2018 was approximately 1.4 million kWh.
6. Addressing Food Waste with
Donations of Emergency Food
Provisions
In addition to securing emer-
gency provisions for employ-
ees in preparation for the
possibility of a large-scale
disaster, we donate food
and drink yet to expire to the
NPO Second Harvest Japan,
which runs food banking
operations. We also participate in the Kyu-Can-Cho Project. This project involves the collection of emergency ration canned bread stored before its expiry date and the subse- quent delivery to famine-stricken regions around the world as part of charity goods. We will continue to implement these initiatives given that they solve food waste and environmen- tal issues, and also contribute to lower disposal costs.
      September 10, 2017 Activity Report
The morning session took place in Aokigahara forest. A lot of old rubbish had been thrown on to the banks of the road and in some cases, wedged deep into molten rock forma- tions, a topographical feature of the area. Rubbish was col- lected from the roadside inclines in bags and loaded onto a truck. All up, 460kg of rubbish was collected.
The afternoon session involved cleaning at the NPO Morinogakkou. Based on the desire to do something useful for Fujisan Club leveraging the strengths of the AUTOBACS Group, we washed the vehicles owned by Fujisan Club,
cut the grass at Morinogakkou, and cleaned their windows.

 HR Development and Work-style Reforms
 Our Vision
As a company that solves the issues of local communities through our business operations, we focus on nurturing personnel that possess expert knowledge and know-how. We recognize human resources to be the source of value we provide to society and we continually seek to enrich our workplaces so each and every employee can remain healthy and safe.
Key Themes
Fostering the corporate culture where diversified human resources can work comfortably.
SDG Targets
Target 5.5: Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life
Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value
    Number of Annual Group Training Sessions Implemented
Activities in FY March 2018
1. Educational Training to Enhance Strength of
Human Resources at AUTOBACS Chain Stores
For the purpose of improving the value the AUTOBACS chain delivers to cus- tomers, we have put in place more than thirty stratified educations and training systems for mainly store staff. We offer a multitude of different group train- ing sessions on topics such as leadership, sales skill improvement, or wheels and undercarriage, and with a total of 91 sessions held in fiscal 2018, together with e-learning and other initiatives like OJT at stores, we hope to see signif- icant benefits. We are also striving to enhance the quality of in-store services by boosting staff knowledge, technical skills, and motivation, with an assess- ment system linked to our internal Group qualifications, such as Car Lifestyle Advisor and Car Lifestyle Consultant. We also focus on training that assists employees in acquiring automobile mechanic, automobile inspector, or other public licenses, and we are seeing a steady increase in the number of quali- fied employees.
2. Career Support
Based on the concept that “employees build their own careers by them- selves,” at AUTOBACS we have a number of schemes to support the career formation of employees.
Career rotations and skill enhancements
Our personnel system is based on a combination of job rotations and the enhancement of skill levels every few years so that all employees can accu- mulate knowledge and experience. We have also established an internal job posting and free agent system and implemented personnel movement within the Company. Under this system, employees who meet certain conditions can aspire to work in a position they have set their sights on. Moreover, we have established a course for specialist workers which takes into account the orien- tation and aptitude of each and every employee and assists their career forma- tion in line with individual characteristics and aspirations.

      Utilization of Telecommuting and Satellite Offices
Personnel development program
We have in place a so-called “cafeteria plan” through which employees can choose to take any of the roughly 160 courses offered by external organiza- tions. Some courses are offered in the form of correspondence learning, or public seminars, while others promise public qualification. The plan assists the voluntary career development of our employees and we provide mone- tary assistance with subsidies up to ¥100,000 per person per year. So far, 978 employees have utilized this plan. As an incentive for skills development, we also provide a bonus to employees that have acquired certain public qualifica- tions designated by the Company.
Internship
Our summer internship program was held ten times for three days at a time and offers students that are beginning to choose potential employers a chance to work on-site in a variety of job roles, visit our facilities, and participate in various workshops so that they can be convinced when making decisions. This program gives us the opportunity to hear the opinions of the younger, next-generation, while students get the chance to start thinking about their future career paths.
3. Work-style Reforms
In addition to promoting the creation of a workplace where each and every employee can work safely and remain healthy, we are working to establish an environment in which our employees can feel enriched, fulfilled, and safe at work.
Supporting various working styles
In the midst of mounting societal demands to tackle issues such as an age- ing society, work-life balance, and globalization, we are implementing a number of initiatives to provide various work-style options to employees with the goal of establishing an environment in which our employees can work energetically. Such options include shorter working hours, half-day paid leave, telecommuting (with no limitations on frequency or reason), satellite office-based work, stag- gered starting times, and the enhancement of ICT-based communication tools.
Kids visiting day
Since August 2015 we have hosted a kids visiting day every year. This event affords a rare opportunity for chil-
dren to see their parents at work

4. Promoting Diversity
Making AUTOBACS an easier place for women to work
The Company believes that “an easier place to work for women is a better place for everyone.” To this end, we are endeavoring to establish a workplace environment where women can easily return to work following various life events such as marriage, childbirth, and child-rearing.
Initiatives for fostering female executives
The Company actively hires and devel-
ops female employees. We have partly
launched a mentoring system for
female employees and as part of our
career development activities, we host
an interactive workshop for female
executives and regular employees. In
addition, as part of efforts to create a
workplace culture where women can thrive, we implement a program regard- ing diversity acceptance in our management trainings. We also provide individ- ual counselling on work and home life compatibility and career formation.

Agnès Darnac, the president of our con- solidated subsidiary AUTOBACS FRANCE S.A.S., is a female executive with a wealth of knowledge in finance, labor services, and business affairs. She stresses the impor- tance of internal communication and is con- tributing to the increase in female and family customers at AUTOBACS stores in France.

   Ratio of Female Employees Returning to Work After Maternity and Childcare Leave
A workplace where employees can keep working after maternity and childcare leave
At the Company we have many female employees of parenting generation that emphasize the importance of both family and career, and 100% of them return to work after maternity and childcare leave. We attribute this to various initia- tives, such as a longer timeframe during which employees with children (up to sixth year at elementary school) can work shorter hours, as well as the imple- mentation of the “Female Tasks” career assistance project.
Creating a workplace full of diversity
In the globally expanding businesses of the AUTOBACS Group, there are more and more opportunities for foreign employees, both in Japan and over- seas. As part of our hiring of disabled persons, we are also working hard to create an environment in which people with disabilities can find it easy to work by establishing a system that offers a choice of flexible working styles.

Comment from male employee that took childcare leave
At first, I was certainly hesitant about male employees taking long-term childcare leave. But through actually going on childcare leave, experi- encing housework and childcare on a daily basis, and having more opportunities to interact with my local community, I came to understand what is involved in raising a child rather than just having an idea about it. Nothing can replace the special time I spent with my child and family during that period.
I also think the period of childcare leave gives
an opportunity to grow as a person. Obviously, I was unable to directly contribute to company results during the period of childcare, but because of the experiences and broader perspectives I gained during that time, I think I have a better awareness of what is required to work more efficiently. Up ahead, I hope to contribute to the Company by providing support to employees thinking about taking childcare leave just like I did.

5. Health Initiatives
We focus on health-promoting initiatives based on our statement on health, which declares that we recognize health is the utmost management founda- tion indispensable for our broad-ranging corporate activities. We aim to be a company that contributes widely to society by promoting “healthy manage- ment” to foster human resources with a strong awareness of what it means to be healthy, both physically and mentally.
Health management training
If an employee is found to have a life-
style disease-related condition at their
periodic health examination, they
must follow the instructions of the
occupational physician and undergo
dietary and exercise training in order
to improve their health condition.
Depending on the severity of their
health condition, improvement mea-
sures will be separately prescribed,
while follow-up examinations will also continue for a certain period.
Mental healthcare, health counselling
Every year all employees at the Company undergo a mental health check per- formed by external experts for the purpose of mental care. We also have in place a system whereby employees can seek counselling at a designated insti- tution and our occupational physician provides regular health consultation and mental health counselling sessions.
DBJ Employees’ Health Management Rating

tary schools in Suzuka, Mie
Prefecture and Haga, Tochigi
Prefecture, as well as a vocational school in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture to talk about the joys, rigors, and importance of holding a dream. These interactions not only stimulate an interest in motorsports and racing cars, but they also aim to spark the first step towards realizing future dreams of chil- dren and students.
2. Junior High and
High School Student Visits
As a company with roots in the community, we accept student visits from neighboring junior high and high schools to some of our stores, and to our east and west Japan logistics centers respectively located in Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture and Miki, Hyogo Prefecture.

cuts from cotton t-shirts that would normally be thrown away. This project was launched in July 2017 with the objective of providing aid to children in Bangladesh where the product is made.
6. Providing Assistance During
Natural Disasters
Following the torrential
rain and flooding in north-
ern Kyushu in July 2017,
we placed money boxes
at all our AUTOBACS
Group stores nation-
wide to collect dona-
tions for the Japan Red
Cross Society. We also coordinated with the Japan Car Sharing Association to assist in the transportation of 11 vehicles stationed in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture to four disaster-hit regions (one area in Toho Village and three in Asakura City) in Fukuoka Prefecture so they can be used
as car sharing vehicles for victims of the disaster and relief organizations. We also carried out safety inspections, maintenance, and tire changes required on these vehicles in the disaster regions.

  Corporate Governance System
The Company has adopted the “Company with an Audit and Supervisory Board” organizational format (as defined under Japan’s Companies Act), which has a double-check- ing function of management, with the Board of Directors responsible for supervision of business execution and Audit and Supervisory Board members responsible for audits.
Management and Business Execution Framework
1) Board of Directors
Chaired by the representative director, the Board of Directors consists of eight directors (5 of them concurrently serving as officers, and 3 outside directors, all of whom are independent officers) and, in principle, meets once a month. The Board of Directors makes decisions on matters specified in laws and regulations or in the articles of incor- poration, and important matters concerning the Company’s business activities. It also receives reports on such mat- ters as required. To strengthen the supervisory function, efforts are made to maintain a Board of Directors with out- side directors accounting for over 30% of all directors. In addition, to protect benefits for general shareholders, inde- pendence is stressed in selecting outside directors. Efforts are made to ensure the best possible decisions to increase corporate value over the medium-to-long term.
2) Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, which is chaired by the chief executive officer and comprised of executive offi- cers, meets, in principle, once a month. The Executive Committee preliminarily discusses inherent risks, possible responses, and other aspects of matters to be taken up by the Board of Directors and reports on these discussions and their results to the Board. It also develops company- wide policies and plans. Outside directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members, acting as observers, attend meetings of the Executive Committee and express their opinions as necessary.
3) Other Meetings
Meetings with officers and representatives of various business segments are established to discuss compa- ny-wide policies and management issues; confirm busi- ness performance and progress of the Medium-Term Business Plan; and confirm implementation progress, analyze, and make recommendations regarding strategies concerning individual businesses. In principle, such meet- ings meet once or two times a month.
Nomination of Inside Directors
Basic Policy
In nominating directors, only those who understand the importance of trust-based relationships with franchise stores, suppliers, employees and others involved in the AUTOBACS franchise chain, and who have the will and capabilities to increase corporate value and the common benefit of share- holders over the medium-to-long term are considered.
Advisory Bodies
1) Corporate Governance Committee
The Corporate Governance Committee is a voluntary advi- sory body that chaired by an outside director and consists of all the outside directors and the representative director. In principle, it meets once a month to discuss candidates for director, statutory auditor, and senior executive officer positions, the remuneration system for directors and offi- cers, and other governance-related matters. The commit- tee submits its findings and recommendations on these matters to the Board of Directors.
2) Risk Management Committee
With the representative director as its chair, the Risk Management Committee is comprised of directors with officer responsibilities and officers responsible for internal control functions. In principle, the Committee meets once a year to set out policies that will promote efficient, proper pursuit of risk management in the fiscal year.
Audit System
1) Internal Audits
A staff of nine auditors evaluates the internal control system and continuously performs audits to determine whether the business activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are in compliance with the law and regula- tions, and internal rules and manuals. Assessments and audit results are reported to the representative director, Audit and Supervisory Board members, and officers as appropriate, and corrective measures and guidance are provided to departments where deficiencies are identified. 2) Audits by Audit and Supervisory Board Members The Audit and Supervisory Board consists of four mem- bers, three of whom are outside members (independent officers). The Audit and Supervisory Board sets out auditing policies and establishes an audit plan. It receives reports from each Audit and Supervisory Board member on the progress and results of their audits, and from the Board of Directors and the independent auditor on the status of execution of their duties, and requires further explana- tions as needed. Each Audit and Supervisory Board mem- ber attends the Board of Directors meetings, the Executive Committee meetings, and other important meetings to audit the performance of duties by directors and officers. 3) Independent Audits
The Company has concluded an audit agreement with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC to perform independent audits of the Company.
Nomination Process
Possible candidates for director are selected by the Board of Directors, following a recommendation made by the Corporate Governance Committee.
 AUTOBACS SEVEN Co., Ltd. Integrated Report 2018 46

 Corporate Governance
 Outside Directors and Outside Audit and Supervisory Board Members
Nominations
The Company’s outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members are comprised of individuals, including one woman, with diverse experiences. All directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members meet the stan- dards for the independence prescribed by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the requirements specified in the Company’s own rules. Each of the outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members possesses experience and knowledge in various fields and actively contributes to the discussions at the Board of Directors meetings, etc. from his or her own independent, objective perspectives.
Appointment of a Leading Independent Outside Director
The Company has appointed a leading independent outside director with the aim of promoting construc- tive dialogue with shareholders and other investors and strengthening mutual information-sharing and com- munication between outside directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members.
Establishment of a Liaison Group for Independent Outside Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members
The Company has established a Liaison Group for Independent Outside Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members, which is chaired by the leading indepen- dent outside director and includes only independent out- side directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members among its participants. The Liaison Group is intended to be a vehicle for outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members to share informa- tion and enhance communication among themselves, and it is expected to be a venue for the development of a com- mon understanding of, and information exchange on, gov- ernance and other management matters at the Company. The Liaison Group, in principle, meets several times a year.
to secure as AUTOBACS SEVEN directors outstanding individuals who will work to maintain and increase the cor- porate value of the Company Group, which comprises a franchise system, and contribute to the effective function- ing of the business supervisory function.
2) Remuneration Standards
Standards for remuneration shall be set by considering third-party survey data on executive remuneration, and taking into account the Company’s position in the industry and factors such as difficulty of achieving targets and spe- cific roles of individuals.
3) Composition and basic concept of remuneration
The remuneration of the Company’s directors is com- posed of “fixed remuneration,” which is a basic remu- neration, and “performance-based remuneration,” which fluctuates based on the achievement rate of the plans for multiple evaluation indicators including numerical targets.
Performance-based remuneration is paid according to the business results relative to an annual plan, and the ratio of performance-based remuneration to total remu- neration is designed so that the higher the rank as an offi- cer, the higher the ratio.
In addition, as remuneration linked to the medium-term results, an incentive is under consideration that is pro- vided according to the achievement rate of the target set in the Medium-Term Business Plan.
The performance-based remuneration varies within 0-180% of the performance-based remuneration standard amount that is predetermined for each rank, designed such that, assuming target achievement of 100%, the ratio of performance-based remuneration to total remu- neration stands at 40% or higher in the case of a repre- sentative director and chief executive officer.
However, performance-based remuneration, in light of its nature, is not applied to outside directors who are independent of the Company’s business operations and receive only fixed remuneration.
4) Remuneration Determination Process
The objectivity and transparency of the Company’s direc- tor remuneration system and remuneration amounts are secured by having the Corporate Governance Committee, which is chaired by an outside director and is comprised of all of the outside directors and the representative director, deliberate and provide input on these matters.
Remuneration for Audit and Supervisory Board Members
Remuneration for the Company’s Audit and Supervisory Board members is determined by the Audit and Supervisory Board members, within an overall remunera- tion amount approved at a general shareholders’ meeting. Considering their roles as independent individuals with the authority to audit the execution of duties of directors, remuneration for Audit and Supervisory Board members is composed of only fixed remuneration.
Total Remuneration for the Fiscal Year ended March 2018
 Independence Requirements for Outside Directors and Outside Audit and Supervisory Board Members *Excerpted
The Company’s independent directors and independent Audit and Supervisory Board members are outside directors and outside Audit and Supervisory Board members as defined in Japan’s Companies Act and Ordinance for Enforcement of the Companies Act. They also fulfill the following requirements for independence. Independence shall be considered to have been lost at the time any of the following require- ments for independence are violated.

   Facilitating the Exercise of Voting Rights
In order to enable participation by as many shareholders as possible, the Company avoids days when large num- bers of other companies schedule their general sharehold- ers’ meetings when scheduling its own. The 71st ordinary general shareholders’ meeting was held on Thursday, June 21, 2018. For the 71st ordinary general sharehold- ers’ meeting, notifications were sent 17 days in advance of the meeting date. Furthermore, meeting notifications were posted on the Company’s website, TDNet, and on an electronic voting platform on May 30, for the improve- ment of convenience.
Dialogue with Investors
The Company engages in constructive dialogue with shareholders through venues such as the general share- holders’ meetings and results briefings, and discloses information in a timely, appropriate manner on the Company’s corporate website. For institutional investors, the Company engages in dialogue by, for example, par- ticipating in financial results briefings arranged by invest- ment securities firms and holding briefings when interim and full-year results are announced.

Compliance
The Company is moving forward with the strengthening of its compliance system and is stressing to employees of the parent company, subsidiaries, and all AUTOBACS Group stores, including franchise stores, the importance of pursuing business activities that are legally and ethically irreproachable. Respect for the law and corporate ethics is a given. With that as a fundamental premise, the Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Action have been established in response to the legitimate expectations of all stakehold- ers and serve as fundamental principles in efforts to rein- force compliance understanding and conduct education initiatives for employees of not only the Company but also franchisees. Checks are carried out once a year to deter- mine whether any activities inconsistent with the Code of Conduct or Guidelines for Action have taken place, while a system for rapidly responding to any problems that come to light has also been established.
Risk Management
The Company, in addition to a risk management system for properly identifying and evaluating risks and implementing proper controls, has also adopted a comprehensive risk management structure integrating crisis management focused on limiting the extent of damage, and minimizing damage and losses, caused by a serious incident. The Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the repre- sentative director and chief executive officer, sets the risk management policies for the fiscal year and, based on the policies and provisions concerning risk management, takes steps to smoothly and appropriately advance risk management activities. The Risk Management Committee identifies key risk-related issues for each fiscal year and monitors measures to address them. The General Affairs and Internal Control Department, Legal Department, Corporate Audit Department and Customer Services Department cooperate to assist monitoring by the Risk Management Committee. In addition, the officer in charge of general affairs reports to the Board of Directors on seri- ous incidents and responses to them, as set forth in the rules for reporting on serious incidents, and shares these reports with the Audit and Supervisory Board and other relevant departments within the Company.

  Evaluating the Board of Directors
The Company analyzes and evaluates the effective- ness of the Board of Directors to examine whether it is properly fulfilling its roles, find the issues at the Board of Directors, and promote its ongoing improve- ments. All directors and Audit and Supervisory Board members answered evaluation items, in order for the Corporate Governance Committee to analyze the responses and identify the issues. The findings were then shared with and discussed in-depth by the Board of Directors.
As a result, it was confirmed that the Company’s Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee are for the most part functioning properly. In particular, as for the issue found from the evalua- tion took place in the previous fiscal year of “a need to enhance the supervisory function by monitoring of
progress in implementing medium- to long-term man- agement policies and strategies,” it was evaluated that the progress of strengthening the supervisory function of the Board of Directors has been made by implement- ing the progress reports of the Company’s Medium- Term Business Plan regularly based on the schedule and thorough discussions based on the reports. . In contrast, as issues to be addressed up ahead, the eval- uation found there is room for further deepening prog- ress reports on the Company’s Medium-Term Business Plan and the nature of discussions based on those reports, as well as engaging further in debate about long-term visions, policies, strategies, and personnel strategies with the aim of establishing a competitive advantage over the longer term.

A New Field Where Light Can Be Utilized â€“ Functional Devices Business
The range of fields in which light can play an active role is constantly expanding. For example, light is utilized in automotive head-up displays, remote sensing technology and fuel cell manufacturing processes. In addi- tion, demand is increasing for optical components that are capable of extracting light using the best possible method. Light may be used for the microscopic surface processing of wind power, solar power and other renewable energy equipment in order to prevent the adherence of dirt, dust and other forms of soiling.
In this environment, Ushio has launched a functional devices business, taking advantage of its experience of internally developing light source and optical technologies and key parts (optical components) of optical devices as a manufacturer specializing in light and its expertise in microfabrication, which it has developed through its engagement in the semiconductor manufacturing process, particularly exposure technology.

As the range of things that can be done with light expands, there is increasing demand for more freedom to control light.
In this environment, functional parts that utilize our expertise in microfab- rication will make it possible to control light in different ways from those that depend on the existing optical technology owing to their more efficient designs and manufacturing process.
We will continue to work with our customers in order to achieve more advances in technologies that use functional devices for the control of light.

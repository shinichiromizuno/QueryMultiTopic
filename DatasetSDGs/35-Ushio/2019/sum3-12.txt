The “XEFIRIA” UV Ozone Deodorizer for Hotel Rooms
Hotels in Japan are using multiple activities to raise their occupancy rates and improve the guest experience, including for the growing number of foreign tourists. One issue is the increasing demand for a method of removing odors from guest rooms quickly.
To meet this demand, Ushio used knowledge acquired from the design of industrial equipment concerning the use of UV radiation to generate ozone. Applying this know-how led to the development of XEFIRIA, the world’s first compact, maintenance-free “light” ozone deodorizer with a specially designed mercury-free UV lamp.
Compared with the conventional electrical discharge deodorizing method, XEFIRIA produces nitrogen oxides(NOx), which is harmful to people, and the time needed to remove cigarette and perfume odors is greatly reduced. In addition to this, we have focused on a light- weight design to reduce the burden of carrying the deodorizer around, simple touch panel operability, and the use of multiple languages to enhance usability. These features help reduce the burden of the cleaning staff and improve the work environment.

I have been wanting to be of help to people since before I became responsible for XEFIRIA. My work on the XEFIRIA project was extremely rewarding. For example, I have heard from hotels that this new product can remove perfume odors, which were previously very difficult to eliminate.
I now want to use this experience to solve problems involving odors in many other industries as well.

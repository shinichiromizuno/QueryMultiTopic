By 2030, the aging of populations around the globe is expected to have progressed even further, and in Japan, in particular, one-third of the population is expected to be age 65 or older. While the average lifespan increases, social issues related to long periods of unhealthy life, including becoming bedridden or needing nursing care, have been emerging. To that end, Ushio aims to extend healthy lifespans by offering solutions that help improve the quality of life.
Specifically, measures toward environmental hygiene, medical care (diagnosis and treatment), nursing care, social welfare, disease prevention, and anti-aging, are essential for extending healthy lifes- pans, and Ushio already offers a wide lineup of products in these areas. For example, we offer light disinfecting technologies such as Care222 in the environmental hygiene field, UV medical devices and
various medical-use light sources in the medical care field, and medical cosmetics and other products in the anti-aging field.
Through the development of such products, we have conducted research related to the effects of light on the human body, including photoimmunology and the skin penetration level of light. We have also amassed know-how from a pharmaceutical perspective regard- ing the necessary processes for achieving the practical application of our products in society. By building on this research and know-how, we aim to extend the healthy lifespans of an even greater number of people. Leveraging this know-how, we will promote the development of devices and equipment in the fields of nursing care, social welfare, and disease prevention as well going forward.

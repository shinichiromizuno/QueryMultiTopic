The world’s population is projected to grow to about 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100.
Following global population increases and the rise of income levels, demand for food, livestock feed, and crops is expected to significantly increase, primarily in emerging countries. Meanwhile, in terms of supply, there are concerns over severe food shortages in the future due to limited farming space and water supply as well as the progression of climate change. Particularly, securing a stable supply of protein-rich food has become a major social issue, and for this reason we believe we will see plant factories, vertical farming, and protected horticulture—which are all highly productive means of growing crops—play an even greater role in the future.
Over its history, Ushio has developed discharge lamps that cover the broad light wavelength range needed to promote photosynthesis and support the growing, cultivation, and harvest of crops. The Company has also developed new light sources and unique light technologies that are widely used as energy to efficiently grow crops. However, in order to secure higher levels of productivity, there is a need to further promote digitalization. Specifically, we believe that remarkable progress is being made in terms of sensing technologies, and will therefore focus our efforts on development in the sensing domain going forward.

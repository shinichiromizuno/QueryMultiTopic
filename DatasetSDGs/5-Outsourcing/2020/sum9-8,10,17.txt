Initiatives of ORJ INC. (Japan) 
Providing employment and lifestyle support for foreign interns and workers 
As an island nation, Japan is behind other developed countries in developing an employment (intern) environment for foreign nationals, such as foreign technical interns. Serving as a bridge between foreign workers and Japanese companies, ORJ provides companies with know-how on accepting foreign interns and workers, as well as daily support for foreigners through its 24/7 multilingual call center. In addition, ORJ is promoting the creation of a healthy and secure society by collaborating with Group companies and dispatching organizations throughout Asia to build a mechanism for eliminating human resource brokers who exploit foreign technical interns with unfair commissions.

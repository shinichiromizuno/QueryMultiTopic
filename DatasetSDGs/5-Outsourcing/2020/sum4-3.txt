“School of Sign Language” 
School of Sign Language is a sign language class for teaching Japanese Sign Language*, a language for deaf people, held by our officially certified subsidiary, Outsourcing Business Service Inc. Teaching more than 600 students each year, the school is ranked number one in Japan in terms of number of classes held and number of instructors. In addition, Outsourcing Business Service Inc. has established a dedicated website, and provides news and conducts various activities to support the child rearing of hearing children of deaf adults (CODA) through Japanese Sign Language. 
The Group will continue to actively support activities that assume the social responsibility and role of supporting people with disabilities and the people around them. 
* Deaf people in Japan learn sign language before they learn Japanese. For that reason, Japanese Sign Language is a sign language that has different language structure from both Japanese and “Japanese signed language,” a manually coded Japanese.

	.	1  Support for foreign students  Many foreign students who come to Japan fromdeveloping countries are unable to focus on studying, which was their purpose for coming to the country, because they must work part-time jobs to cover living expenses due to their economic situation. The Group cooperates with the International Human resource Network Organization Foundation, which promotes the human resource development and networking support business so that people in countries around the world can live safe, secure and rich lives in peace. Through benefit-type scholarships and other assistance, such as providing academic and career counseling in various locations throughout Japan to provide support on writing resumes and handling interviews, this organization supports foreign students who will shape the future.

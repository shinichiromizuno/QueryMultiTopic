	.	3  Support in local regions  As part of our support for local regions, through the officially certified subsidiary Outsourcing Business Service Inc., we donate communication boards for deaf people in the regions where that company has business locations. Through this initiative which is in its fifth year, we have donated communication boards in Tokyo and Osaka Prefectures and Tottori-shi, Kagoshima-shi and Sasebo-shi. We plan to broaden our circle of support in the future.

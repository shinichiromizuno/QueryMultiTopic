Promoting eco-friendly commuting 
Workplace 
    
OTTO continually reviews employee housing, believing the distance between home and the workplace should not exceed 15 kilometers. One reason to keep that distance as short 
as possible is to promote the use of electric bicycles for commuting. Even when car or bus shuttle services are provided, OTTO encourages eco- friendly driving methods that keep the engine revolutions and torque down.

Establishment and provision of quality housing 
Due to a shortage of comfortable quality housing in the Netherlands, OTTO is cooperating with external partners to establish housing for foreign national workers that exceeds the minimum standard for quality housing in that country set by SNF (Stichting Normering Flexwonen). When developing housing, it is OTTOâ€™s policy to engage in dialog with the neighboring community to ensure a positive relationship with residents of the local region. Numerous dispatched employees arriving from outside the country begin life in the Netherlands by first living in the housing provided by OTTO.

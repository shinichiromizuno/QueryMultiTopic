Corporate Governance
Basic approach
The Kyokuyo Group’s basic corporate governance policy is to conduct highly transparent management for shareholders and other stakeholders, and to perform swift and decisive decision-making to achieve sustainable growth and improve our corporate value over the medium to long term. We also comply with our Corporate Philosophy and Group Corporate Action Charter to establish appropriate systems for monitoring and supervision to ensure compliance, and strive to maintain the efficiency and fairness of management.
Corporate governance system
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors convenes regularly, with extraordinary meetings convened as necessary, as the basis of a system for ensuring that the duties of the Kyokuyo Group’s board of directors are carried out efficiently. In order to clarify the management responsibilities of directors and establish a management system that can swiftly respond to changes in the business environment, we set a one-year term of office for directors. In addition, four independent external directors, one- third of the total, are appointed to strengthen the supervisory system.
Corporate governance system
Elects/Dismisses
External directors
External directors are expected to conduct effective management supervision and to provide frank and constructive advice regarding the Group’s management from an independent and objective standpoint, with a practical perspective that draws on abundant experience, knowledge, and expertise.
We select candidates for external directors who can provide supervision as well as frank and constructive advice regarding management at Kyokuyo, based on our unique standards in addition to the requirements for independence as stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Increased number of external directors
To enable the Board of Directors to focus more on management decision-making and supervision with the aims of achieving sustainable business growth and improving corporate value over the medium to long term, we drastically revised the board’s composition, reducing the number of internal directors by one for a total of eight and increasing the number of external directors by two for a total of four. Furthermore, four of the 12 directors are independent directors as stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, making at least one-third of the Company’s directors independent. With this revision, we will enhance management supervision and expedite decision-making.
Board of Auditors
We are a company with a Board of Auditors. Two of our four auditors are external auditors and work to enhance the supervision of our managers. In accordance with the audit policy and audit plan formulated by the Board of Auditors at

the beginning of the fiscal year, each auditor conducts audits that focus on understanding the status and confirming the efficiency of management execution and internal control such as internal checks, compliance, and internal audits.
Nomination and Remuneration Committee
Kyokuyo has adopted an optional Nomination and Remuneration Committee as an advisory body for the Board of Directors. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is made up of three or more members, the majority of which are independent external directors. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee deliberates topics such as the nomination and compensation of directors in response to

consultation from the Board of Directors, and provides its recommendations to the Board of Directors.
Evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
We give an annual questionnaire to all directors and auditors regarding the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole. The results are reported to the Board of Directors, leading to improvements. The questionnaires have been returned with generally positive evaluations of the composition and operation of the Board of Directors, the mechanism of governance, etc.
We are working to further improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors by securing time for consideration of agenda items, such as by simplifying income and expenditure reports.
Internal controls
We have established a basic policy on internal control systems and have put in place related rules to develop and operate an internal control system. With the Internal Controls over Financial Reporting, as stipulated by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, we evaluate the status of the development and operation of our internal control system. We reported that the Group’s internal control system was effective in fiscal 2020, as in the past.
Cross-shareholdings
Recognizing the risk of price fluctuations associated with holding shares, we hold shares other than those for investment purposes, taking fully into account the rationality of the holding purpose, such as maintaining and stabilizing business relationships and fostering mutual trust.
The Board of Directors carefully examines the purpose of holding, transaction status, dividends, capital costs, and other matters related to cross-shareholdings individually each year to determine whether they are to be held or reduced.
In principle, when exercising voting rights, we respect the judgment of the Board of Directors of the share issuer and vote in the affirmative. However, if we think that a proposal would adversely affect relationships and transactions with the Kyokuyo Group, or if we believe it will harm the common interests of our shareholders, we consider the matter carefully before deciding whether or not to approve it.
Dialogue with shareholders and investors
IR policy
We believe that maintaining transparent and fair management is fundamental to corporate governance with the aim of achieving sustainable growth of the company and increasing corporate value over the medium to long term. To this end, we recognize that it is important to actively engage in dialogue with shareholders and reflect their opinions and requests in our management.
Based on this recognition, we disclose accurate corporate information required by shareholders and investors fairly and promptly in clear language. We strive for timely and proactive information disclosure in addition to disclosing information in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Securities Listing Regulations stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Promoting shareholders’ and investors’ understanding of Kyokuyo
        Policy of training for directors and auditors
   Newly appointed internal directors attend external seminars to acquire necessary knowledge as directors. We also promptly provide explanations of the Group’s business to newly appointed external directors and newly appointed external auditors at the time of their appointment.
Executive remuneration
Policy for deciding executive remuneration
Our basic policy on remuneration for directors is to have a balanced remuneration system, the purpose of which is to motivate directors to contribute more to improving performance and increasing corporate value from a medium- to long-term perspective.
Under the above policy, directors’ remuneration consists of fixed basic compensation and performance-based stock compensation, both of which are paid within the total amount of remuneration set at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.
Amounts of remuneration for directors and auditors (fiscal 2020)
In addition to regular executive training sessions for directors and auditors, we recommend that directors and auditors participate in external seminars and other training sessions as necessary, with the company paying all expenses.
Fixed basic compensation is determined based on each director’s responsibilities. For performance-linked stock compensation, points to be awarded to each director for each fiscal year are determined according to the degree of achievement of consolidated sales and consolidated operating profit, with the Company’s shares being paid through a trust upon a director's retirement.
Since the remuneration of external directors is independent of business execution, they are only paid fixed basic compensation with no performance-based stock compensation.
In order to provide shareholders with a deeper understanding of the current state of Kyokuyo, we send a Business Report to people who are shareholders as of the end of March every year. In addition, at our twice- yearly IR briefings for analysts and institutional investors, the president himself explains our financial results and future measures, and successively conducts dialogues (interviews) at the request of analysts and institutional investors.

Risk Management
Basic approach
Kyokuyo has established basic risk management rules for the Kyokuyo Group and maintains a risk management system in order to conceive all risks that could affect the business activities of the entire Group, prevent their occurrence, and to minimize any risks incurred should the anticipated risks occur.
Each department and group company manages on a daily basis the risks faced in their own work, and Kyokuyo’s head office departments, as supervisory departments, cooperate with the foregoing departments and group companies to manage risks throughout the Group. Furthermore, as the department in charge of overall risk management, the Division of Internal Control of Kyokuyo Co., Ltd. shares risk information with the supervisory departments to manage risks throughout the entire Kyokuyo Group.
In the event of an emergency, we will organize and respond with level-specific organizations such as a response headquarters, countermeasure projects, and response teams.
Risk management system
We recognize the major risks that could have a material impact on the financial condition, business results, etc. of Kyokuyo and the Kyokuyo Group, and we share the status of risks and countermeasures with the Board of Directors. Our

Response to COVID-19
In light of the spread of COVID-19, we have established a response headquarters to formulate and notify all officers and employees of action guidelines against the disease. Based on these action guidelines, we are giving top priority to measures to prevent infection and the spread of the disease, such as staggered work hours and the implementation of telecommuting, and we have started providing a COVID-19 vaccination program at work for applicants, with a view to respecting the lives of employees and their families.
We will continue to closely monitor the situation related to COVID-19 and make every effort to prevent the spread of the disease while fulfilling our supply responsibilities as a food manufacturer.
Internal Audit Team conducts audits of the risk management systems of Kyokuyo and its group companies, and reports the results to the Internal Audit Committee.

Compliance
Basic approach
Kyokuyo and the Kyokuyo Group adopt compliance (compliance with laws and regulations, the Corporate Philosophy, Action Guidelines, Corporate Action Charter, internal rules, and corporate ethics) as a basic policy of management in accordance with our Corporate Philosophy, Action Guidelines, and Corporate Action Charter.
Compliance system
As the basis of our compliance system, we have established the Kyokuyo Group Corporate Action Charter and basic compliance rules, based on our Corporate Philosophy, and strive to ensure that the Group’s officers and employees are thoroughly aware of the same. In addition, we have established a Division of Internal Control under a compliance officer as an organization that specifically promotes the establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the compliance system, which we have established as a cross-sectional compliance system for the entire Group.
Whistleblowing system
We have established a Group whistleblowing system to report legal violations and other compliance-related matters. The system protects whistleblowers, with the head of the internal compliance department and an external attorney’s office as the direct information recipients. The system is operated in accordance with rules for protecting whistleblowers.
Compliance education
In addition to dispatching a notification within the company every April about thorough compliance, at the group's general meeting the president calls attention to compliance, and we also conduct internal training as appropriate, to strive for instilling awareness of compliance.

Thorough compliance with the Act against Delay in Payment
of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors (Subcontract Act)
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Japan Fair Trade Commission have requested that “fairness be made in subcontract transactions.” Based on the recognition that making transaction conditions between business operators fair and reasonable is the basis of supply chain management, the Kyokuyo Group provides a company subsidy for attendance at seminars on the Subcontracting Act to ensure employees retain a better understanding of the law.
In fiscal 2020, a total of 29 employees attended external seminars using this system. By observing this law, we are building sound and stable relationships with our partner companies and strengthening our own compliance.
We are also learning that requests such as extremely short delivery times lead to long working hours at business partners, and that this is not only in violation of the Subcontracting Act but also problematic in terms of the workstyle reforms promoted by the Japanese government.

With the impact of climate change becoming increasingly problematic on a global scale, companies are being asked to reduce emission
of greenhouse gases that cause global warming and to implement energy-saving initiatives. In consideration of the environmental impact of these operations, the Sumitomo Forestry Group fully recognizes
the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking other measures to combat climate change through the promotion of strict energy-saving activities, renewable energy use and other efforts. With a medium- to long-term perspective of the future, in 2018, we
established greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for 2030, and were certified as SBT* in July 2018. Furthermore, Sumitomo Forestry joined RE100, an international initiative that aims to achieve 100% renewable energy for electricity used in Group business activities and for fuel used to generate electric power in the power generation business by 2040. In addition, to reduce environmental burden and more effectively utilize natural resources, we are promoting the reduction, reuse and recycling of industrial waste.

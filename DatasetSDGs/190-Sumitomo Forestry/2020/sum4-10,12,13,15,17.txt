With businesses centered on wood, the Sumitomo Forestry Group promotes sustainable forest management and timber procurement both domestically and abroad. In procuring wood and timber products, we engage in management under specified numerical targets, placing it as an important theme of sustainability that encompasses environmental aspects such as climate change measures and biodiversity conservation as well as social aspects such as human rights.
With the increase in concern about forest depletion as one of the causes of climate change, demand for sustainability in procurement of timber is on the rise. Amid these circumstances, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has declared the goal of handling all of its timber and timber products to be sustainable by fiscal 2021. We have heightened our evaluation criteria for sustainable timber procurement as we work to step up our confirmation system. As we continue to contribute to solving social issues, we have defined KPIs to establish timber procurement that achieves both forest resource utilization and biodiversity conservation.

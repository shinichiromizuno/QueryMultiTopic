The Sumitomo Forestry Group offers a lineup of timber-centered products and services for our customerâ€™s lifestyles, mainly in the field of housing. While it goes without saying that we attend to customer's peace of mind and safety in providing products and services, we also believe that engaging in development and sales mindful of creating a sustainable society is a crucial role that our Group must fulfill.
One of the areas that we could contribute the most in reducing environmental impact is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
from housing. Net zero energy houses (ZEH) and other housing measures in Japan offer guidance to promote eco-products as well as advocate excellent long-term housing as an asset. We have set targets for the ratio of orders we receive for ZEH and other environmentally friendly products to contribute to a sustainable society while serving customers in keeping with their needs by reducing household energy consumption through recommending houses built to
ZEH specifications.

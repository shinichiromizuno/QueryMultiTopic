Integrated Report 2021 2

 Message from the Chairman
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a grave impact on our lives, including restrictions on movement and disruption of supply chains. The very frameworks of social and economic activities have been greatly altered. As natural disasters have simultaneously grown increasingly severe throughout the world, people are becoming more aware of the threat posed by climate change and activities geared toward a decarbonized society are accelerating in many different countries. The vulnerabilities of our modern society which have been revealed by the pandemic and these disasters are driving a shift in values away from short-term economic efficiency and toward an emphasis on sustainability. Companies are also expected to play a larger role than ever in contributing to the sustainable development of society.
Sumitomo’s Business Philosophy which the Sumitomo Forestry Group has inherited includes the concept of Jiri-rita, or “Benefit self and benefit others,” and Koushi-ichinyo, or “Private and public interests are one and the same.” To put it another way, Sumitomo’s business “must benefit the nation and society.” Our corporate history dates back to involvement in procuring timber for charcoal and mine building in conjunction with the opening of the Besshi Copper Mines in 1691. Since then, the spirit of harmony with the public interest has been ingrained in the fundamentals of our management long before age of concepts such as ESG and the SDGs. One example is the Large-Scale Reforestation Plan created in 1894 to revitalize forests through large-scale tree planting, which was launched when the forests surrounding the Besshi Copper Mines were in danger of being devastated.
In addition to the management of precious natural capital of forest resources, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has carried on the emphasis our predecessors placed on the public interest, supporting the environment and society through our business in a wide variety of fields from forestry management, the distribution and production of timber and building materials, as well as wooden construction in Japan and abroad, renewable energy, and elderly care. Together with all of our stakeholders, we will continue adapting to the changing times and creating business that solves social issues and serves a purpose in people’s everyday lives in order to contribute to the realization of a prosperous, sustainable society.

Integrated Report 2021 6
Toshiro Mitsuyoshi
President and Representative Director
A look back at 2020
The COVID-19 pandemic threw social life and business activity into chaos in 2020. Many countries responded with bold fiscal stimulus and monetary easing policies exceeding those of the 2008 financial crisis. This helped support the global economy, which has been showing signs of recovery this year, spearheaded by the United States and China.
The time spent living with the coronavirus triggered significant changes in individual lifestyles and values, and the Sumitomo Forestry Group was affected as well. We were forced to limit the number of visitors at our model homes and restrict our sales activities, and we had no choice but to temporarily suspend production at some of our manufacturing sites overseas. At the same time, however, the crisis gave us a massive opportunity to pivot our business activities in a direction that matches the new lifestyles and values called the “new normal,” through measures such as digital marketing and workstyle reforms that include remote working.
The Housing and Construction Business, our core business in Japan, faced a crisis when a state of emergency was declared from April to May 2020 and the number of visitors to our model homes decreased 80% to almost 90% compared to the same period the year before. Our existing housing sales model for the housing business was no longer viable because it depended on customers visiting the model homes to begin business discussions. Thus we had to fundamentally revise our order receiving processes. We focused on attracting customers online by setting up MYHOME PARK, an online channel that allows visitors to view the construction of Sumitomo Forestry Home houses with variety of content. We also held design consultations and online sites tours. Going further, we endeavored to provide safer, securer and more functional residences such
as houses with floor plans that incorporate remote working spaces or hand-washing areas in the entryway while also featuring attractive interiors rich with the qualities of wood that Sumitomo Forestry is known for. Thanks to these initiatives, we received more than twice the number of requests for information compared to the previous year, and the value of orders received exceeded the value for the same period last year.
At the same time, the Overseas Housing and Real Estate Business, which has grown into one of our revenue pillars, responded flexibly to changes in market environments. While the United States housing market experienced a large drop in inventory for existing homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, monetary easing policies created historically low interest rates for housing loans and the rise in remote working triggered growth in demand for detached houses in suburban areas. As a result, the market for new detached houses stagnated temporarily and then speedily rebounded. While continuing to develop products suited to each individual business area, the Sumitomo Forestry Group also expanded businesses by entering the market in Atlanta, Georgia, where vigorous demand for housing is expected. The number of units sold in Australia increased as well, backed by governmental housing subsidy policies and low interest rates. These contributed to a new record for profits* on a consolidated basis in the fiscal year ended December 2020 for the overall Overseas Housing and Real Estate Business.
* The fiscal year ended December 2020 is an irregular nine-month fiscal year covering the period from April 2020 to December 2020 due to a change in the accounting period. Therefore the record-high profits are based on a comparison with the first three quarters of the previous year.

Business strategies for 2021
The outlook for the final year of the 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan (Medium-Term Plan for short), is not entirely optimistic due to factors such as the resurgence of COVID-19 due to mutant strains, the effects of intensifying natural disasters, and steep price jumps for construction materials such as timber caused by demand increases in countries like the United States and China that have taken the lead in economic recovery. Recognizing that the drive towards realizing a decarbonized society is a business opportunity, we are responding to the “new normal” and moving ahead with a future-oriented business strategy that strives to solve social issues by creating “shared benefit” comprised of an “environmental value” and a “social value.”
In Japan, we are expanding businesses in the Timber and Building Materials Business that are not linked to the number of new housing starts, such as biofuel and exports of domestic timber. In the Housing and Construction Business we aim to further popularize ZEH (Net Zero Energy Houses), streamline construction and reduce construction times, increase competitiveness, and improve profitability. Overseas, we will take advantage of steady demand for housing in the United States and Australia to achieve stable growth in the detached housing business in existing areas while expanding the business in new areas, such as Denver, Colorado. In the real estate development business in the United States, we plan to steadily expand our new investments while keeping an eye on market trends.
Concerning climate change measures, the focal point of the next Medium-Term Management Plan, we are undertaking sustainable forest management, which is gaining attention as sources of carbon sinks, increasing the manufacture and distribution of timber products, popularizing wood construction, expanding the renewable energy business, and linking up with local governments to provide forest management consulting that can contribute to regional revitalization.
Strengthening our business foundations for sustainable growth
The outlook for our business environment remains unclear, and we are committed to strengthening our business foundation to make our operations more resilient. In addition to maximizing the management resources in each business for our growth, we will also press on with digital transformation (DX). We have already launched structural design services for builders and precut factories in the Timber and Building Materials Business, and in the Housing and Construction Business, we have started working on digital marketing that uses real-life data we have collected through model homes and other avenues. Going forward, we intend to go further by rebuilding the structure that allows us to provide the hundreds of thousands of Sumitomo Forestry Group customers with comprehensive services and transforming that into increased customer satisfaction, improved productivity, the creation of added value and the realization of workstyle reform.
Human capital is one of the most important elements of Sumitomo Forestry Group business foundation. Sumitomo Forestry is committed to creating a workplace where a diverse group of employees can flourish. In March 2021, our efforts to encourage women to play active roles in the workplace were recognized with the “Nadeshiko Brand” designation from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan. This designation is given to enterprises that have been judged to be outstanding at encouraging women’s success at work. By focusing attention on workstyle reform and human resource development, we aim to further increase our competitiveness with strong individuals and a strong organization.
As we expand our businesses, we are placing greater emphasis on compliance and risk management across the Group. One way we are doing this in the growing real-estate-for-sale business is to create a system that allows for stable business expansion with appropriate monitoring that keeps an eye on trends in the market economy. With the growing awareness of ESG thinking ,
companies that seek to merely increase short-term profits are not highly regarded by consumers and investors. With forward-looking sustainable growth as a prerequisite, we will continue to enhance our governance and keep our management highly transparent. In March 2021 we appointed one more female outside director, which resulted in a total of two female directors. As a result, outside directors now constitute one third of the company’s directors.
Financial strategy and shareholder returns
On the financial side, management continues its efforts to enhance shareholders’ equity, along with measures to improve cash flow and return on equity (ROE). Concerning cash flow improvements in particular, we are working to optimize the cash conversion cycle through measures such as maintaining inventory at suitable levels and collecting receivables at an early stage. We will endeavor to carefully select and implement effective investment and lending

 projects that will help improve long-term corporate value, and we will thoroughly examine the cost-effectiveness of our general and administrative expenses. Furthermore, the coronavirus crisis revealed the overall weakness of the supply chain, and thus we are taking steps to guarantee fluidity flexibly and quickly in emergency situations like the suspension of business activities while identifying risks and capital requirements.
We view returns to shareholders as one of our most important management tasks at Sumitomo Forestry, and our basic policy is to provide stable and ongoing returns. The Company is keen to continue to return an appropriate level of profits to shareholders based on recent profit levels and a comprehensive evaluation of the balance between our business foundations, financial conditions and cash flow.
Towards a decarbonized society
The Japanese government has announced its goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050. This is but one of many actions that various national governments, corporations and investors are accelerating towards the year 2050 in keeping with the Paris Agreement. At the Leaders Summit on Climate 2021, all the participating countries set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gases by 2030, with Japan announcing a major increase in its target value from a 26% decrease to a 46% decrease in 2030 compared to 2013. Considering the year 2030 as the final year set for achieving the SDGs and a stepping stone towards 2050, we are positioning the year 2021 as the “the first year of decarbonization,” and are currently formulating medium- to long-term management policies. We intend to start our next Medium-Term Management Plan from 2022 based on those policies. We have already begun to implement climate change measures by announcing our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), setting Science Based Targets (SBT) for long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction and joining the RE100 initiative. However, as part of our future medium- to long-term strategy, we believe it will be important to develop businesses that maximize the use of wood and forest resources, which are renewable natural capital with the
ability to absorb CO2 and fix carbon, in the construction industry and as biomass fuel.
The construction industry is said to account for 38% of all greenhouse gases emitted worldwide. Wood construction, including in the non-residential sector, is becoming the focus of attention in the hopes that it can help reduce the burden on the environment. Around 70% of the greenhouse gases emitted from construction is termed “operational carbon,” which refers to emissions from the energy used when buildings are used. Progress is being made on energy-saving measures to reduce operational carbon such as an increase in ZEH and technological developments in ZEB.*1 The other roughly 30% of emissions is called “embodied carbon,” which is generated when raw materials are sourced, processed, transported, constructed or disposed of. Wood construction is expected to emit less embodied carbon than reinforced concrete construction and steel construction. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, wood construction is also capable of continuously fixing a large amount of carbon over a long period of time. Thus from the perspective of carbon fixing, increasing wood construction could be compared to converting cities into forests. The Group will pursue a business strategy that seeks to reduce greenhouse gases together with our partners and customers by popularizing wooden buildings for non-residential purposes while also providing wooden ZEH residences.
The Green Growth Strategy established by the government of Japan in December 2020 shows that forest resources play a major role in the achievement of a carbon-neutral society by the year 2050 due to their ability to absorb CO2 and their use in wood biomass power generation. The Sumitomo Forestry Group promotes sustainable forest management in Japan and overseas. Additionally, with the expanded use of wood products and wood construction, we seek to contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society by taking part in cyclical economic activities, also called a “circular bioeconomy,”*2 which reduce global warming and avoid placing a burden on the biosphere.
The role forests play as natural capital goes beyond absorbing CO2 and fixing carbon: they also perform various functions such as preventing landslides and conserving the soil and water sources. Beyond that, they furnish human lifestyles with a high amount of value in a variety of aspects including scenery, recreation, arts and crafts, and traditional culture. While some calculations of shared benefit converted to monetary value suggest a figure of 70 trillion yen, the academic basis for this scientific analysis is still in the development stages and no real link to economic value has been established. In September 2020, Sumitomo Forestry signed an industry-university collaboration agreement with the University of Tokyo. We plan to spend ten years conducting joint research into ways to increase “the value of trees” through such means as quantifying their “shared benefit.” Visualizing the shared benefit provided by forests and the timber that comes from them will not only increase the value of the approximately 280,000 hectares of forest assets held and managed by the Group in Japan and elsewhere but will also increase the value of forests and wood buildings worldwide, contributing to the
creation of a circular bioeconomy that will improve the sustainability of society as a whole.
*1 ZEB (Net Zero Energy Building)
*2 A circular economic system where resource efficiency is maximized by
applying biotechnology and other technologies in order to use renewable biological resources for as long as possible within the ecological boundaries of the ecosystem.
To our stakeholders
Although countries around the world have begun to administer the coronavirus vaccine, the presence of mutant strains means that the end of the coronavirus crisis remains hard to predict. However, it is certain that societies and economies will make large strides in coping with the “new normal” and creating a decarbonized society once the crisis is past.
“The Sumitomo Forestry Group utilizes wood as a healthy and environmentally friendly natural resource to provide a diverse range of lifestyle-related services that contribute to the realization of a sustainable and prosperous society. All our efforts are based on Sumitomo’s Business Spirit, which places prime importance on fairness and integrity for the good of society.” We have set this as our management philosophy. As a Group with the word “Forestry” in our name, realizing a sustainable society that co-exists with nature runs ceaselessly through our DNA, starting from the Large-Scale Reforestation Plan we formulated to revitalize a devastated forest in 1894. Whether they are involved in forest management or wood construction, distributing timber and building materials, renewable energy or elderly care, each of our over 20,000 employees acts with pride and confidence as they work to solve various societal problems through our businesses. The outlook for the future may be uncertain, but we will nevertheless strive to increase our resilience as a corporation in order to live up to the trust our stakeholders have placed in us. We will also continue to develop businesses for a post-COVID world that can contribute broadly upstream and downstream to the achievement of SDGs. It is my sincere hope that all our stakeholders will continue to understand and support us as we strive to make these goals a reality.

Sumitomo also left behind writings such as “Value trust and make certainty a principle” advocating the importance of integrity, “Refrain from the pursuit of easy gains” which warns against being blinded by thirst for quick profits, and the concept of Jiri-rita, or “Benefit self and benefit others,“ and Koushi-ichinyo, or “Private and public interests are one and the same“ with which Sumitomo urges harmony with the public interest - between the individual, the nation and society.
These words through which our predecessors have kept the company marching forward throughout its long history, as well as the thoughts behind them, are devotedly observed as Sumitomo’s Business Spirit even in the present day.

    Sumitomo Forestry’s origin in management of the forest surrounding the Copper Mine
The House of Sumitomo opened the Besshi Copper Mine in present-day Niihama, Ehime Prefecture in 1691. Sumitomo Forestry’s origin can be traced back to the management of the forest surrounding the copper mine. Timber for charcoal essential to copper smelting and wood used for tunnel support posts were sourced from the forest, as were building materials for the homes of the workers.
Start of the large-scale reforestation plan and sustainable forestry
In the late 19th century, the forests surrounding the Besshi Copper Mine were in danger of being devastated after a long period of excessive logging and smoke pollution. The then manager of the mine, Teigo Iba, believed “Allowing this land to be degraded while moving forward with business made possible by its fruits runs counter to the proper course of our relationship with nature. We must return all the mountains of Besshi to their verdant state.” With this belief, he
launched the Large-Scale Reforestation Plan in 1894 to restore the forests that had been lost. Through a process of trial and error, and by implementing large-scale planting efforts of a maximum of more than two million trees per year, the mountains were eventually returned to a state of rich greenery. This concept of sustainable forestry has been passed on to the present day.

         Evolution into a building materials distributor and manufacturer
In the 1950s with Japan experiencing a high level of economic growth, demand for wood skyrocketed due to explosive growth in the number of new housing starts. However, forestry in Japan at the time was facing market shortages of wood since trees planted shortly after World War II were not fully grown.
Facing these circumstances, Sumitomo Forestry began importing wood produced overseas before other Japanese companies. Establishing a system for production, distribution, and sales of wood materials in Japan and overseas, Sumitomo Forestry became the highest-volume distributor of wood and building materials in Japan.

Housing business expansion in Japan and overseas
Once the 1970s began, housing policy changed emphasis from securing “quantity” to improving “quality” including living environments in accordance with changes in economic and social circumstances.
In order to meet these social needs, Sumitomo Forestry entered the custom-built wooden housing business in 1975. Utilizing a wood materials procurement network inside and outside of Japan to offer high-quality wooden housing, Sumitomo Forestry Home houses grew to become the top brand in custom-built wooden houses.
In 2003, we also entered the housing business in the United States where
wooden housing is mainstream. We then entered the housing market in Australia, where most housing is also made of wood. Forming alliances with local partners who share the same business outlook, we have expanded our business operations in these housing markets where the respective housing cultures are readily apparent.

MOCCA (Timber Solutions) for timber usage in the non-residential field
Since usable forest plantations in Japan have not been sufficiently tended to, there is concern about degradation of the multiple functions that forests serve. It has become imperative that trees can be utilized to maintain forests and revitalize forestry. This led to the Act for Promotion of Use of Wood in Public Buildings which went into effect in 2010.
In order to address these needs, the Sumitomo Forestry Group launched the MOCCA (Timber Solutions) business in 2011 to promote the use of wood in non-residential buildings. MOCCA has since established a solid track record in buildings such as commercial, educational, and social services facilities.
Started renewable energy business

Promoting Renewable Energy Business
In 2011 the Sumitomo Forestry Group refocused on the value of forestry resources, and entered the renewable energy business. We have established multiple wood biomass power plants that burn wood waste from construction and timber left unused in forests, and we aim to build the capacity to generate 300 MW in renewable energy.

 Value creation model 1: The power of forests
The public benefits of the forests, which are sustainable natural capital
Absorb CO2
Through photosynthesis, trees absorb CO2 and fix it in the form of carbon. The carbon fixing continues even when they are used for buildings or other purposes. Moreover, the carbon released when a tree is burned originates from the CO2 the tree absorbed as it was growing, which means that the tree's life cycle does not affect the density of CO2 in the atmosphere, making it carbon neutral.
At present, as the rise in energy demands and the global warming caused by the increase in CO2 have become problems for the whole world, much hope is being placed on the expansion of wood biomass power generation from construction waste and unused timber from forests.
Cultivate water sources
By storing rain water, the soil levels out the amount of water flowing into rivers and mitigates flooding, stabilizing the flow rate of rivers. Furthermore, when rain water passes through the soil in forests, the water will be purified.
Preserve biodiversity
In Japan, two-thirds of which is covered by forest area, forests make up the foundation of the ecosystem network and support rich biodiversity. The majority of domestic biological species live, breed and grow in forests, so forestry plays a large role in the preservation of biodiversity.
Prevent damage from landslides / Protect soil
Forest top soil is covered in fallen leaves and branches. This prevents the rain from touching the soil directly during heavy rain, protecting the surface of the ground from erosion. Moreover, the spreading roots of trees and shrubs prevent landslides.
Health / Recreation
A wide variety of plants and animals inhabit forests, and they play an important role as locations for mountain climbing, camping, recreational activities involving contact with nature, and environmental education.
Forests are resources that can be used continuously by planting, raising, using and replanting them. Moreover, forests and trees provide more than wood building materials and fuel; they also serve many functions that benefit the public. For example, they preserve biodiversity, cultivate water sources, protect the soil, prevent damage from landslides, and absorb and fix CO2, the

As trees grow, they “absorb” CO2 and emit oxygen. The CO2 continues to be “fixed” as carbon even when the trees are harvested and used in timber products and wood construction. Using timber products instead of materials that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases during the process of procuring raw materials to production can help reduce the relative amount of emissions. Timber products and wood buildings are used for as long as possible and fix carbon continuously, and when they are scrapped, they are used as fuel in biomass power generation. The CO2 emitted when this is done is the same CO2 that was absorbed in the growing process, so biomass power generation is said to be “carbon-neutral.”

Expanding company-owned forests with “sustainable forestry” as a philosophy
Japan is a land of trees, with forests covering approximately 70% of its soil. In addition to usage for buildings and paper, people receive a variety of other benefits from trees such as cultivating water sources and preventing damage from landslides.
The Sumitomo Forestry Group practices sustainable forestry in Japan and abroad, aiming to keep these great benefits of trees sustainable while continuously being able to utilize timber resources over the long haul.
Our forest management is rooted in the philosophy of “sustainable forestry” of planting, growing, cutting, utilizing trees and then replanting trees. Based on this philosophy we have been expanding our company-owned forests in areas throughout Japan. Currently we own a total of approximately 48,000 hectares of forest in Japan, a vast area equivalent to roughly one eight-hundredth of Japan as a whole. These company-owned forests have been granted forest certification. We practice sustainable forest management through systematic afforestation and logging, while striving to be eco-friendly including considerations for the surrounding ecosystems.
Increasing accumulation of carbon in Japan’s forests
Total forest area has hardly changed at all over the past 50 years, but forest accumulation is increasing each year. Nearly all of the increase is from plantation forests of trees planted for the purpose of timber production. The total area of plantation forests in Japan today is a staggering 5.9 times greater than 50 years ago.
One major reason why plantation forests accumulation has increased was a wave of tree plantings all at once, which was promoted after the end of World War II. Many of the plantation forests in Japan were planted at least 50 years ago, and have now reached the “harvest period” to be logged, used, and replanted for the next generation. However, due to the combined factors of decreasing demand for domestic timber, the falling and aging population of foresters, and lagging mechanization of forestry, little progress has been made in tree thinning and regeneration cutting.
If trees that can be used as resources are not logged and replanted for the next generation, forest resources run the risk of excessive aging in the future. Additionally, forests could be devastated if they are not properly managed (cared for), including systematic logging. This is said to be a possible precursor to various environmental problems such as declining carbon dioxide absorption and capture, and an increase in landslides.
Japanese government measures for use of domestic timber
The government has introduced a variety of measures to tackle these problems concerning Japan’s forests and forestry.
The Forest and Forestry Revitalization Plan was formulated in 2009, setting out the goal of raising Japan’s timber self-sufficiency rate to at least 50% as a metric for the revitalization of the country’s forests and forestry. Then the next year in 2010, the government took the initiative by announcing a basic policy for tackling timber usage with the Act for Promotion of Use of Wood in Public Buildings, etc. Then in 2018, part of the Building Standards Act was revised to loosen regulations on which wooden buildings must be built to be fire-resistant.

 Business Background

    Thanks to these supportive efforts by the government, usage of domestic timber has been gradually increasing - mainly in the sector of non-residential buildings. Wood buildings still comprise only around 10% of all non-residential buildings, but recently there have been many more diverse types of large wooden buildings constructed, including public facilities such as elementary schools and community centers, in addition to commercial facilities. This increase in the use of wood construction in the non-residential sector is also expected to result in greater usage of domestic timber.
MOCCA aims to increase use of domestic timber
In order to increase the use of domestic timber, we launched the MOCCA (Timber Solutions) business in 2011 which promotes the use of wood in the non-residential buildings sector.
In addition to public buildings such as administration buildings for local governments and community educational facilities, MOCCA has produced proposals in a broader range of sectors including commercial facilities, offices, care facilities, nursing homes, and nursery schools. For example, using wood as the materials for the floors of nursing homes can reduce physical strain on occupants and health care workers from walking about the building. Actively incorporating timber and wood building materials into office spaces and school classrooms has also been reported to raise people’s productivity according to the results of surveys. Our MOCCA business has been steadily establishing a

track record by proposing new wood usages such as these to a variety of customers.
In 2017, we also established a business and capital alliance with construction company Kumagai Gumi Co.,Ltd., and we are forming an organizational structure to collaborate with them on business that leverages trees and greenery. Together with Kumagai Gumi, we have a shared recognition of issues pertaining to forest resources and a common vision for how to utilize them. Our aim is to drive the effective utilization of timber in the civil works and construction sectors and energize the forestry industry, while also helping to conserve national land and the
earth’s environment.

Contributions to the SDGs through wooden buildings
Wooden buildings not only emit little carbon dioxide during construction, but the timber used as construction material can help reduce carbon dioxide through continuous carbon fixation of carbon dioxide in the air. Additionally, once the buildings are no longer in use and dismantled, the discarded materials can be reused as fuel for wood biomass power generation. Since wooden buildings contribute in these ways to reductions in environmental impact throughout the product life cycle, we consider the expansion of our MOCCA business to be part of our activities toward achieving the SDGs.
Wood is a renewable natural resource. Using wood in various buildings where people spend time can create comfortable spaces that add calm to our lives. Through forest management balanced with environmental conservation, and by drawing out the maximum potential of wood through sustainable use of forest

Reductions in worldwide forest area and the primary causes
The total amount of forest area in the world is approximately 4 billion hectares. They make up 31% of all land area on earth. However, at present the world's forest areas are continually shrinking. In the 30-year span from 1990 to the present, approximately 180 million hectares of forest are believed to have disappeared from the planet. This is nearly equal to 4.7 times the land area of Japan.
In recent years, although some countries appear to be reducing the speed of forest area decline, the area of new forest planted is also declining, and the amount of forest area in the world has reduced by approximately 5 million hectares a year in the past ten years.
There are several reasons for deforestation, including massive forest fires, drought and illegal logging, but the greatest factor is the conversion of forests into farmland such as large-scale plantations. Demand for food is rising rapidly as the population of the world grows. Thus large forests are being developed and turned into farmland, and the development of forests has a major effect on the lives of people in the region. To create a sustainable society, in addition to securing food on a global scale and working toward the economic development of various local communities, forest conservation should also be carried out with a long-term view in mind.
Fluctuations in worldwide forest area
Overseas forest management and contributions to the SDGs
As deforestation continues worldwide, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has endeavored to expand its forestry management both in Japan and overseas in order to secure raw materials sustainably. Currently we hold and manage forests in three countries, namely Indonesia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. We have obtained FSC® and other forest certifications* and established a sustainable system where harvesting and reforestation are carried out in a regular cycle. The Group holds and controls a forest area of approximately 231 thousand hectares in three countries, and the timber produced in those forests is used for furniture, as building material, as pulp raw material for paper-making and for a host of other applications in markets all over the world.
When conducting this kind of forest management overseas, we proceed with activities systematically after establishing numerical targets concerning topics such as “maintaining forest certification,” “expanding the area managed” and “forest carbon stock.” At the same time, we are also committed to SDG-con- scious initiatives such as those that preserve biodiversity and foster coexistence with local residents.
* Forest certification: An environmental labeling system from private-sector entities whereby independent third-party organizations certify that forest management and the distribution of timber and timber products is being carried out appropriately based on certain standards.

Developing new uses for timber and building material
Sumitomo Forestry runs timber and building material manufacturing businesses in different countries around the world, but our businesses in Indonesia are the largest in terms of scale and the oldest in terms of history. The oldest manufacturing base there celebrated its 50th anniversary of founding in 2020. The manufacturing bases in Indonesia produce not only products close to raw materials such as plywood and particleboard but also highly processed items like musical instruments and interior finish material for construction.
Timber is the key material for such products, making up a high percentage of the manufacturing cost. This makes securing a
Field of seedlings for reforestation
stable supply of raw material an extremely important undertaking. For those reasons, all Group companies in Indonesia endeavor to expand their reforestation activities, planting especially fast-grow- ing tropical trees which can be used as raw material in a short period of four to seven years.
All the companies are also focusing their efforts on develop- ing products and technologies aimed at increasing the number of uses for timber. One example is a species of tree called balsa. It produces the lightest timber and is used for building and modeling because it is easy to process. Due to these special qualities, as demand for renewable energy has increased in recent years, its range of uses has increased to include the cores of wind power turbine blades.
Balsa
     Free distribution of seedlings and guarantee to purchase logs
Helping regional communities through “social forestry”
When we manage forests overseas, in addition to “industrial reforestation” that targets the sustainable production of timber and “environmental reforestation” aimed at environmental conservation, we also actively engage in “social forestry” which affects the economies of local communities while earning us the cooperation of residents in the surrounding area. For example, in Indonesia, PT. Kutai Timber Indonesia (KTI), a Group company, has been carrying out an initiative for the past 20 years where it distributes seedlings it has raised to local farming families for free. When the trees grow, KTI purchases them at market price and uses them as raw material in factories that produce plywood and building material.
This has the benefit of not only securing a stable supply of raw materials for the Group on one hand but also allowing local farming families to increase their cash incomes by growing the seedlings on land not suitable for farming, thus improving their livelihoods. This initiative received an award from Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry in recognition of its contribution to environmental conservation through reforestation.
Establishing a management model for peatland
We have been carrying out large-scale industrial reforestation in the West Kalimantan province of Indonesia since 2010. The forest in the target area of this business was devastated by industrial

logging between the sixties and early nineties as well as by repeated illegal logging and slash-and-burn farming. The objective of the project is to revive this land as a reforestation area while at the same time preventing the further deterioration of the forest by coexisting with the local residents.
The whole project area is peatland, made up of an accumu- lation of withered vegetation that has barely decomposed over thousands of years. Peatland contains precious ecosystems and plays a major role in storing carbon and in the water cycle. However, when it dries up, the organic matter in the ground decomposes and releases greenhouse gases while also potentially triggering huge forest fires. This makes appropriate management of the water level essential.
That is why the Sumitomo Forestry Group first performed a thorough topographical survey as well as a boring survey to understand the density and distribution of the peat. Based on the detailed data obtained through the survey, we created waterways with the function of regulating the water level throughout the project area, thereby establishing a globally unprecedented management model capable of keeping the groundwater level stable even during the dry season. This management model has come to the attention of other countries with large areas of peatland. Therefore, in the future we will be able to help alleviate global environmental problems and promote sustainable development by deploying and popularizing the know-how cultivated in Indonesia.

Expanding reforestation activities on Kalimantan Island, Indonesia
  In December 2020, PT. Kubu Mulia Forestry, a member of the Sumitomo Forestry Group, obtained the business rights to the industrial reforestation asset bordering the Group’s project area in West Kalimantan in Indonesia. This has expanded the total area managed by the Group in that area to from roughly 145 thousand hectares to approximately 155 thousand hectares. After a thorough survey of the plants and animals was conducted, the whole project area was strictly divided into the area for protection and the area for use, and a net was installed in the area for protection to prevent the isolation of rare animals. This expansion of the project area has made it possible to conserve the ecosystems of an even wider area. Additionally, through the unification of water level management, we will further promote the sustainable use of peatland and the reduction in the emission of CO2. Going forward, we will further refine our sustainable peatland management model which combines economic efficiency with environmental conservation and endeavor to deploy and popularize it overseas.

Initiatives towards growth
In the timber and building materials distribution business, we utilize supply chains for sustainable procurement of timber to promote sales of eco-friendly products like plantation timber, while also continuing to expand our efforts in the non-residential building construction market and to build a stable supply system for wood fuel used in biomass power generation. We will continue increasing the range of variations for KIKORIN-PLYWOOD, a high-quality, eco- friendly plywood that the Company developed, giving customers a
Progress in FY ended December 2020
In the timber and building materials distribution business, we worked to strengthen collaboration with our trading partners and developed a versatile business portfolio, continuing to focus on expanding our lineup of fuel wood for biomass power generation, increasing exports of domestic materials, and strengthening efforts in non-housing and construction markets. We also put more focus on expanding sales of plywood made with sustainable plantation timber in the aim of reducing environmental impact. However, performance was sluggish due to the decreased sales volume of plywood and other lumber products resulting from weakness in the
broader selection of products.
In the manufacturing business, we aim to increase profitability
by further integrating manufacturing and sales through cooperation with the timber and building materials distribution business, and by developing high-value-added products that satisfy customer needs.
We are also working on ways to generate new revenue sources through DX (digital transformation) efforts.

domestically due to the decreased sales volume of fixtures, flooring, and other products resulting from weakness in the housing market. Overseas, the sales volume of medium density fiberboard (MDF) from New Zealand decreased, particularly in Japan, but performance was strong due to the reduction in manufacturing costs. In Indonesia, performance was sluggish due to the decreased sales volume of plywood, particle board, and other products.
  DX efforts: Launched structural design support services for builders and pre-cut factories
In August 2020, the Company began to offer Structure Express, a service for builders and pre-cut factories that helps them with structural design, as a new business that utilizes our know-how accumulated in the housing and construction business and networks in the timber and building materials business. Based on architectural drawing data created by builders, the system utilizes AI to automatically generate the structural calculations and data that links pre-cut and CAD*1, then provides these online. In addition to being helpful for builders who struggle with long work hours due to labor shortages, and improving productivity at pre-cut factories, it can also automatically calculate the optimal materials needed to achieve seismic performance level 3*2 which helps to make safe, secure housing more prevalent.
The Sumitomo Forestry Group aims to maximize synergies within the Group by dedicating efforts to spec-in activities for builders which incorporates structural design services, and will target 300 builders and 3,000 buildings by the fiscal year ending December 2023, while also capturing the related materials sales
for these projects.

The Sumitomo Forestry Group has been providing quality living environments by doing our part to increase the prevalence of high-quality homes that last a long time. “Sumitomo Forestry Home Houses,” made from advanced construction methods while fully expressing the attractiveness and qualities of wood, is a leading brand in custom-built wooden detached homes. They have received high accolades for being gentle on the environment, and as comfortable, safe and secure homes that can be lived in for a long time.
Leveraging our design and technological capabilities accumulated in the custom-built housing business, Sumitomo Forestry has expanded its range of business operations to offer the unique, comforting feel of wood in the apartment business, residential property development (spec homes) business, landscaping business, and existing homes business as well. In recent years we have also been engaged in wood construction and the use of wood materials in the non-residential building construction fields due to increasing new production and consumption of timber, which has also been attracting attention in government policies. The Sumitomo Forestry Group will continue to offer abundant lifestyles by providing high-value-added products and services while harnessing synergies in housing-related businesses.
Initiatives towards growth
The number of new housing starts is likely to tend downward, alongside the declining population and number of households amid a falling birthrate and aging population. At the same time, new demand is emerging amid the “new normal” and values unique to mature markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With these changes in mind, Sumitomo Forestry builds highly satisfactory homes for customers in our custom-built detached housing business by proposing layouts with working spaces and interior wood materials that only Sumitomo Forestry can offer, in addition to providing living environments that are comfortable yet strong against natural disasters, while promoting net zero energy houses (ZEH). We are also making progressively more use of the data accumulated through our sales activities to ambitiously transform our sales model. To address worsening labor shortages at
Progress in FY ended December 2020
In our custom-built detached housing business, we focused on online sales activities, such as rolling out MYHOME PARK, a service that allows users to experience our home building virtually. In addition, we leveraged our design capabilities to focus on proposing plans corresponding to new lifestyles, such as the changes in work styles brought about by the spread of telecommuting. As a result, orders have increased compared to the same time last year. On the other hand, profitability was down due to increased production costs, including labor costs, and there were delays in construction. As such, performance was sluggish.

   Comfortable housing propositions in tune with customers’ lives
We construct most of our houses using our original Big-Frame (BF) construction method that employs a wooden-beam Rahmen structure. This enables us to satisfy a variety of customer needs by allowing flexible design. In addition, there has been a strong need for long-lasting, high-quality homes that reflect full consideration of factors such as safety, durability, and environmental impact. In these circumstances, we have been promoting the widespread adoption of homes specified as ZEH (net zero energy house) which produce a net balance of zero annual primary energy consumption per household. We supply living environments that are resilient to natural disasters and comfortable year-round.
People are thinking about housing in many more different ways than before as a result of changes in their values and lifestyles.

We are harnessing the wealth of ideas and know-how that we have built up until now to make our customers’ dream homes a reality. In doing so, we focus on providing housing that meets the demands of an array of customers, from first-time home buyers to double-income households and married couples that are done raising their children and seeking a residence for themselves. With telecommuting on the rise due to the spread of COVID-19, we are also making proposals for floor plans that offer sufficient workspace. By making housing with new value-added features more widely available in society, we will contribute to the reliability and safety of as many customers as possible.

Utilizing resources effectively for local production and consumption of energy
In the Environment and Resources Business, Sumitomo Forestry owns a total of approximately 48 thousand hectares of forest in Japan, which is approximately one eight-hundredth of the country’s land area, for which we engage in sustainable forestry management based on a “sustainable forestry” approach of planting, growing, logging, and utilizing trees, and then replanting trees. This includes acquiring forestry certification from the Sustainable Green Ecosystem Council (SGEC). Overseas, we own and manage approximately 231 thousand hectares of plantation forests in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand, including forests that have acquired third-party forestry certification such as FSC®, while we are also contributing to preserving biodiversity and developing local communities.
In our Renewable Energy Business to make effective use of wood and other resources, we are mainly active in wood biomass power generation in Japan.

Initiatives towards growth
The Japanese government has declared the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to virtually zero by 2050, and society at large is progressing toward decarbonization. In our Environment and Resources Business we are striving to enhance our corporate value by utilizing sustainable forest resources effectively.
Currently in Japan, forests planted after WWII have matured and reached their harvesting period, and reforms are being progressed to turn the forestry industry into a growth industry by promoting the use of wood. While the use of domestic timber is being promoted, clearcut logging is also expected to continue. Securing reliable supplies of the seedlings needed for reforestation is therefore becoming a pivotal issue. In the Group’s domestic forestry business, we are aiming to improve productivity and ensure safety by introducing advanced forestry machinery. At the same
Progress in FY ended December 2020
In our domestic forestry business, we signed a comprehensive partnership with Nishiawakura Village, Aida-gun, Okayama and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited for the promotion of a forest trust with a forestation asset as the trust property in August, 2020. As forestry experts, we will provide management support with respect to forestation asset management methods and increasing the efficiency of forestation, felling, and other activities carried out by a forest management company. Utilizing the know-how cultivated through this agreement, we will contribute to the promotion of regional revitalization based on forestry as we roll out our forest trust efforts.
Business results were also strong, owing primarily to increased
time, we are establishing and strengthening our container seedling production system and striving to implement sustainable forestry management that is competitive internationally.
In our overseas forestry business, natural wood supplies are expected to further diminish due to global deforestation and the tightening of logging restrictions in natural forests. In this situation, we will continue to grow stably and over the long term by supplying sustainable high-quality wood from the forests we have planted, while also looking to expand our forest area.
For our renewable energy business which has been attracting greater attention since the Japanese Government pledged to become carbon neutral by 2050, we will strengthen our wood biomass power generation business and accelerate our effective utilization of other sustainable resources.

Biomass power generation using fuel chips
Wood biomass power generation is considered to be a power generation method that does not result in changes in CO2 levels. Since CO2 emitted by combustion of the wood is the CO2 in air that is absorbed by trees through photosynthesis during the growth process, this power generation does not increase CO2 in the atmosphere during the trees’ lifecycle. This concept of a carbon cycle is known as carbon neutral and curtails increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

 Research technology development concept: The W350 Plan
The W350 Plan is the research technology development concept to be completed by 2041, which will mark the 350th year since the Company’s founding. Characterized by the construction of wooden high-rise buildings, the plan is intended to create “Environmentally-Friendly and Timber-Utilizing Cities” that transform cityscapes into forests. We strive to bring about innovation that encourages a sustainable cycle for timber-utilization and forestry management, and realize a vision for environmentally-friendly timber-using cities where people, trees and diverse plant and animal life can coexist with the planet.
The potential of trees is expected to provide important solutions to a host of issues we face. These issues range from the global environment to urban environments, living environments, and the mental and physical well-being of every individual. The Tsukuba Research Institute has produced various research achievements. The Sumitomo Forestry Group, through its business activities, will return the benefits derived from these R&D achievements to individuals and society as a whole. By doing so, the Group will contribute to the realization of a sustainable and prosperous society.
    Research and Development (R&D)
Promoting the W350 Plan, changing cities into forests
In order to enhance the potential of trees and their added value, it will be absolutely essential to continuously develop technologies. The Tsukuba Research Institute will serve as the driving force
behind this effort. Ever since it was established in 1991, the Tsukuba Research Institute has supported the foundations of the Sumitomo Forestry Group with its advanced tree-related research and technological development capabilities. At present, the institute conducts two main types of R&D activities: (1) Corporate R&D, which seeks to create future technologies over the long term, and (2) R&D through collaboration between business divisions which aims to boost earnings over the short and medium terms. The Tsukuba Research Institute is pushing ahead with these R&D activities through an organizational structure of seven different groups. The institute is also playing a central role in a research technology development concept called the W350 Plan.

Collaboration with Kumagai Gumi: Creating new markets through innovation
Sumitomo Forestry has been collaborating with Kumagai Gumi through eight working groups in five sectors since our business and capital alliance started in November 2017. Specific initiatives we are engaged in include joint efforts between K&E (Kumagai Gumi Group) and Sumitomo Forestry Home Tech in the non-residential renovation business, and we have established a collaborative team for design and construction of mid- to large-sized wooden buildings. In greenery and civil projects, the alliance is steadily accumulating a track record in environmental real estate utilizing Kumagai Gumi’s construction technology and Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping's environmental greening know-how.
In March 2021, the “with TREE” brand was launched as an initiative of one of the working groups, the Mid- to Large-sized Wooden Building Working Group. From the procurement of raw
materials to building and consulting, we will integrate the respective expertise of Sumitomo Forestry and Kumagai Gumi to offer total solutions for health and environmentally-conscious construction that advances the use of wood materials and wood construction in medium- and large-scale building projects.
In overseas business, the two Groups
established a joint venture in Singapore in January 2020 to develop real estate in Asia. The first collaborative
overseas project is development of a high-rise condominium building and commercial and mixed use complexes with a local company in Jakarta (Indonesia). The two Groups intend to continue their efforts to create new markets with innovation that transcends their existing frameworks through collaboration.
Collaboration with the University of Tokyo - Building a circular bioeconomic system for wood resources
In September 2020, Sumitomo Forestry entered into an industry-academia collaboration agreement with the University of Tokyo. Together, we are working to build a future society of cyclic regeneration through the creation of new value from trees and plants. Leveraging cutting-edge scientific research of both partners over the next decade, this project will increase the value of trees, and build a circular bioeconomic system of wood recycling. The ultimate goal is to create a sustainable future society in which both people and the environment can flourish.
Specifically, this project seeks multifaceted co-creation of global commons* through a three-pronged effort to boost the economic value of trees and plants, make the shared benefit of forest resources more evident, and quantify relationships between people, trees and plants. The project also includes collaborative efforts in human resources development and venture companies.
Sumitomo Forestry remains dedicated to making the value of trees and forest resources evident and creating new value. Leveraging the University of Tokyo’s cutting-edge research findings alongside our 330 years of experience in forestry management and expertise in the timber and housing industries, we will build a cyclic symbiotic economy and generate new business.

  In the Sumitomo Forestry Group, we engage in business and ESG initiatives in a unified manner with the aim of improving our corporate value in ways that cannot be explained by economics alone, and as a natural outcome of fulfilling the expectations of society including the SDGs.
In the 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan of which fiscal 2021 is the final year, we defined the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets which incorporate our strategies and five material issues for sustainability. Based on these material issues, we have also established 15 qualitative targets, as well as evaluative
metrics (quantitative goals) that we are targeting for FY ending December 2021.
Each company and division within the Group is making steady progress toward achieving these numerical targets by incorporating them into their fiscal year budget plans, and repeating PDCA cycles. We also actively join and sponsor international initiatives geared toward achieving a sustainable society.
These initiatives in the Group have earned a certain level of external recognition, and Sumitomo Forestry has been added to multiple sustainability stock indexes.

We have been operating based on this corporate philosophy and engaging in sustainability management. We redefined the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct in July 2017 so that it conforms to the requirements of society, such as recent international standards and initiatives.
We formulate various policies and guidelines according to these principles, such as our environmental, procurement and human rights policies, and endeavor to imbue these principles in each and every employee.
Through the monitoring of effectiveness and operational status by the Sustainability Committee, within the context of the Corporate Philosophy, Our Values and Code of Conduct, as well as proactive communications with stakeholders based on ISO 26000, Sumitomo Forestry will continue to engage in sustainability management with the ultimate aim of contributing to a sustainable society.
Sustainability Committee
In response to increased demand for medium- to long-term initiatives regarding Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) and the disclosure of such information, and also in order to address SDGs, TCFD guidelines, and human rights issues, Sumitomo Forestry established a Sustainability Committee in the fiscal year ended March 2019.
The Sustainability Committee is comprised of executive officers and directors, as well as general managers, with the President and Executive Officer acting as the committee chairman. At committee meetings held four times a year, committee members monitor the Company’s operational status and effectiveness within the context of Our Values and the Code of Conduct, along with the formulation and promotion of initiatives that address medium- to long-term ESG issues which concern the Sumitomo Forestry
Group’s sustainability, starting with climate change. The meetings also analyze risks and opportunities, and manage progress on the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, which incorporate business strategies that contribute to achieving SDGs.
For example, regarding climate change, the Company has been analyzing scenarios based on TCFD while coordinating with each business division since the fiscal year ended March 2019 (-> P.72). We evaluate risks and opportunities that could have a serious financial impact at the Company-wide and division level, based on the latest information and data gathered from each department. . Minutes of the committee’s meetings are reported in their entirety to the Board of Directors with the aim of integrating business with solutions to social issues.
Five material issues
Mid-Term Sustainability Targets
 Formulation and management of Mid-Term Sustainability Targets
In 2015, the Sumitomo Forestry Group identified five material issues and established a Medium-Term Sustainability Management Plan that specified strategies and targets for each issue. With the fiscal year ended March 2021 set as the target year, each company and division within the Group has been engaged toward achieving those goals.
Interest in ESG has been higher than ever before, including moves to strengthen governance structures and to address risks related to climate change and human rights, amid technological innovation with advances in ICT and rapid changes in industry structures caused by accelerating globalization. Companies are expected to pursue growth while contributing to SDGs by solving these issues.
Affected by these changes to our business environment, we have determined that there is a need to work on promoting sustainability management to an even greater extent. In addition, “promote further integration of business operations and ESG initiatives” was advocated as a basic policy of the Sumitomo Forestry Group's 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan, and we also formulated the new Mid-Term Sustainability Targets which incorporate sustainability strategies and material issues, while also revising some of our five material issues.
In the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, we establish 15 qualitative targets based on contributions to achieving SDGs and on our five material issues. In addition, we specified evaluative indices (quantitative goals) for each qualitative target item, which serve as
our targets for the fiscal year ending December 2021.
Each Group company and department has set a “Sustainability
Budget” with numerical targets set for the fiscal year and is engaged in initiatives toward achieving these goals.
The Sumitomo Forestry Group fully implements a PDCA cycle for the progress and achievement of each target at the Sustainability Committee convened two times a year in addition to providing reports to the Board of Directors.

Five material issues Identifying material issues
Following the changes in the economic, environmental and social situation, in March 2015, the Sumitomo Forestry Group identified new material issues.
The Group surveyed both internal and external stakeholders as well as outside experts, receiving responses from about 2,700 people. In preparing the questionnaire, 27 issues most closely related to the Sumitomo Forestry Group were specified, based on the Sumitomo Forestry Group’s Corporate Philosophy and Our Values, and taking into account such matters as ISO 26000, the international standard on the social responsibility of organizations, and evaluation points linked to socially responsible investment (SRI). After incorporating management

      perspectives, the survey results were mapped out against axes of “management” and “stakeholders,” before determining the materiality of each issue. Twelve of these issues were identified as being highly material, and rearranged into five material issues.
In conjunction with the formulation of the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets in 2018, we also revised our material issues in light of new demands from society.
We are currently working in revising these material issues leading up to the formulation of our subsequent medium-term plan, for which work will commence in January 2022.
Material Issue
With the impact of climate change becoming increasingly problematic on a global scale, companies are being asked to reduce emission of greenhouse gases that cause global warming and to implement energy-saving initiatives. In consideration of the environmental impact of these operations, the Sumitomo Forestry Group fully recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking other measures to combat climate change through the promotion of strict energy-saving activities, renewable energy use and other efforts. With a medium- to long-term perspective of the future, in 2018, we
established greenhouse gas emission reduction goals for 2030, and were certified as SBT* in July 2018. Furthermore, Sumitomo Forestry joined RE100, an international initiative that aims to achieve 100% renewable energy for electricity used in Group business activities and for fuel used to generate electric power in the power generation business by 2040. In addition, to reduce environmental burden and more effectively utilize natural resources, we are promoting the reduction, reuse and recycling of industrial waste.

The Group promotes a free and open-minded corporate culture that respects diversity in accordance with Our Values. We are also committed to securing an appropriate balance between work and individual commitments such as caring for children and the elderly, maintaining a safe and healthy work environment, and implementing regular educational and training programs to prepare for disasters,
accidents and so forth, as stipulated in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct established in 2017. Further, we are advancing development of a vibrant workplace where diverse human assets can be actively engaged without regard to gender, age, nationality, race, religion or disability.
Material Issue
With businesses centered on wood, the Sumitomo Forestry Group promotes sustainable forest management and timber procurement both domestically and abroad. In procuring wood and timber products, we engage in management under specified numerical targets, placing it as an important theme of sustainability that encompasses environmental aspects such as climate change measures and biodiversity conservation as well as social aspects such as human rights.
With the increase in concern about forest depletion as one of the causes of climate change, demand for sustainability in procurement of
timber is on the rise. Amid these circumstances, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has declared the goal of handling all of its timber and timber products to be sustainable by the end of the fiscal year ending December 2021. We have heightened our evaluation criteria for sustainable timber procurement as we work to step up our confirmation system. As we continue to contribute to solving social issues, we have defined KPIs to establish timber procurement that achieves both forest resource utilization and biodiversity conservation.

        The development and sale of reliable and safe products 2 and services that consider the environment and society
With the background of globalization, diversification and expansion of our business, the Group is reviewing its philosophy structure. Sustainability management based on the Corporate Philosophy, Our Values, and Code of Conduct complies with international codes, international initiatives, and other social demands. In addition, we are
working to reinforce the mechanism for managing business risk-which also encompasses Group companies-by constantly managing prioritized risks through the Risk Management Committee while strengthening the Business Continuity Management (BCM) system as a measure against disasters.

The Sumitomo Forestry Group offers a lineup of timber-centered products and services for our customer’s lifestyles, mainly in the field of housing. While it goes without saying that we attend to customer's peace of mind and safety in providing products and services, we also believe that engaging in development and sales mindful of creating a sustainable society is a crucial role that our Group must fulfill.
One of the areas that we could contribute the most in reducing environmental impact is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
from housing. Net zero energy houses (ZEH) and other housing measures in Japan offer guidance to promote eco-products as well as advocate excellent long-term housing as an asset. We have set targets for the ratio of orders we receive for ZEH and other environmentally friendly products to contribute to a sustainable society while serving customers in keeping with their needs by reducing household energy consumption through recommending houses built to
ZEH specifications.
       Participation in the United Nations Global Compact
We support the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and joined the compact in December 2008. The ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact are based on globally established agreements, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. They incorporate support of and respect for the protection of human rights and the eradication of forced labor and child labor.

Sustainability
  Human rights initiatives
In July 2019, we formulated the Sumitomo Forestry Group Human Rights Policy based on respect for the International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights), the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Core Labour Standards, the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We also joined the United Nations Global Compact and World Business Council for
Sustainability Development (WBCSD). Based on these international standards, the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct advocates respect for human rights and the creation of healthy workplaces. With the aim of spreading acceptance of these policies at our business partners, we periodically conduct assessments of our partners. We also conduct due diligence of human rights, address risks related to human rights, and further engage in reducing risks related to human rights.
Supply chain management
The Sumitomo Forestry Group is aware of its responsibility to respect human rights and solve environmental problems in its supply chain and is working to promote the spread of timber from certified forests in order to help create a sustainable society throughout its supply chain.
We are working even harder to implement these principles throughout the Group. In 2015 we revised our Timber Procurement Philosophy & Policy into the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy, and then in 2017 we formulated the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct which also applies to supply chains.
Timber procurement management
The Sumitomo Forestry Group established the Timber Procurement Committee, comprising managers from departments in charge of timber procurement, to promote Group-wide management of timber procurement through confirming legality of imported timber, setting procurement standards and risk assessments for illegal logging and such.
In the fiscal year ended December 2020, the committee met
  WEB Sumitomo Forestry Group Human Rights Policy https://sfc.jp/english/corporate/philosophy/humanrights.html Due diligence and addressing significant risks
Through human rights due diligence, the Sumitomo Forestry Group identifies factors that may have a negative impact on human rights and works to prevent or reduce them.
Respect for human rights at overseas plantations
PT. Wana Subur Lestari and PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri operate with respect for human rights and the environment, conducting joint surveys with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, and interviewing local residents to hear their opinions.
Additionally, Open Bay Timber Ltd. (OBT) in Papua New Guinea has installed a suggestion box that anyone in the community, including people inside and outside the company, can post in. Being open to consultations from not only employees but also the residents of the surrounding area helps to increase the company's perceived trustworthiness by giving people a way to communicate their thoughts to the company.
Based on the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy, the Group carries out due diligence to ensure the legality of our timber procurement and to ensure that sustainable timber procurement is being put into practice, including considerations for human rights, labor practices, biodiversity preservation and local communities. Each division that procures timber reports to the Timber Procurement Committee on the progress with this due diligence, and works to promote continual improvement in the supply chain.
Access to information
The Timber & Building Materials Division, Housing & Construction Division, and the timber procurement divisions across the Group conduct due diligence to ensure suppliers supply timber and wood products that meet logging compliance requirements.
Procurement managers gather information in accordance with the due diligence manual for timber procurement.
Risk assessments and measures to reduce risk
With this information sorted by country, region, wood species, and timber type, risk assessment on illegal logging or human rights violation is carried out based on procurement standards stipulated by the committee. Risk categories are A (low risk), B (medium risk) and C (high risk). Timber and wood products in the B (medium risk) and C (high risk) categories should not be solely evaluated with documentation to prove that they are legally harvested according to that country’s laws and regulations. In addition, when necessary, company staff are sent for on-site inspections to ensure traceability back to the logging site.
three times and confirmed legal compliance and conducted sustainability surveys at all 117 direct suppliers subject to inspections, as well as 19 suppliers for overseas Group companies (distributors). Sumitomo Forestry periodically checks legal compliance and sustainability at these suppliers, including new and existing suppliers, once a year-no more than two years from the current year.
   Sustainability fact-finding surveys
Regarding the initiatives of each Group company, in the fiscal year ended December 2020, a survey was conducted involving 59 Group companies around the world, confirming that 45 companies provided human rights training, 49 companies have systems to handle grievances, and 53 companies have risk mitigation plans in place. Based on this survey, we did not find any human rights violations.
Respect for human rights through sustainability procurement
We engage in fair and responsible procurement activities based on the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy. For importing and procuring timber, we conduct surveys of our suppliers and on-site interviews to ensure our procurement activities take into account human rights, labor, biodiversity conservation and local communities.
Identifying and addressing significant human rights risks
The Company identified significant human rights risks in 2019 by mapping out risks at stakeholders in the value chains of each business division. The Company has already taken steps to address these identified significant risks, and is drawing up plans and advancing countermeasures to prevent, avoid, mitigate and rectify the risks for each stakeholder.
Initiatives for enabling sustainable timber procurement
   2012
Sumitomo Forestry signed an advisory agreement with the IFC. Along with the IFC, we conducted surveys of business locations to understand whether land usage plans at business sites were being properly implemented and adequate consideration is made for the livelihoods of local residents while respecting the rights of indigenous people and protecting cultural assets.

Integrated Report 2021 64
2013 and 2015
Public hearings were held with invitations sent to local residents, neighboring companies, academics, NGOs, government officials and other stakeholders.
2018
With help from the IFC, Sumitomo Forestry set up grievance mechanisms at WSL and MTI to collect information and opinions from local residents. With the Universitas Indonesia, Sumitomo Forestry launched a three-year social survey covering its business sites and surrounding areas.
The Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy (Excerpt)
The Sumitomo Forestry Group utilizes wood as a renewable natural resource in its business operations. To contribute to a sustainable society, we are committed to procurement activities that take into account economic, environmental and societal interests and comply with the following policy:
1. Procurement based on legal and highly reliable supply chains
2. Procurement based on fair opportunity and competition
3. Procurement of sustainable timber and wood products 4. Communication
 
 Sustainability
Consideration for human rights, labor, biodiversity conservation and local communities
The following items are checked, through supplier surveys and local interviews for the products that are being procured:
Whether the rights of workers, local and indigenous communities are abused in the area where we procure the products and their raw materials from. If this is the case, whether suppliers check their logging practices with consideration for these rights.
Whether forests with high conservation value are included in the area where we procure the products and their raw materials from. If this is the case, whether suppliers check their logging practices with consideration to forests with high conservation value.
Each procurement division reports the status and progress of these initiatives to the Timber Procurement Committee, facilitating continuous improvements throughout the supply chain. In the fiscal year ended December 2020, we used a Sustainability Procurement Survey form that had been revised from the year before to add societal and environmental aspects. Based on suppliers’ responses, we then strengthened the management system with new scoring for survey outcomes to improve the visualization of suppliers’ sustainability initiatives.
Strengthening sustainability initiatives for timber and wood products
Amid growing concerns over deforestation as a factor in climate change, the Sumitomo Forestry Group established a new Action Plan in May 2019, in addition to its own timber procurement due diligence mechanism. We have reinforced and newly implemented sustainability evaluation standards for timber procurement.
Policy on “Sustainable Timber and Wood Products”
In the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets as part of the 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan, we set a target of 100% procurement of sustainable timber and wood products by the end of the fiscal year ending December 2021. Even in situations where legality can be confirmed, we will promote the gradual increased use of alternative wood (natural timber from forest thinning or plantation timber) to stop the handling of items that do not fall under our definition of sustainable timber or timber products.
  Our thinking regarding “sustainable timber and wood products”
1 Certified timber and pre-certified timber: FSC, PEFC, and SGEC
(Regardless of CoC connection, we place emphasis on certification at time of production and promote a shift to certified timber)
3 Natural timber where forestry management and distribution can be assessed as sustainable
(This does not include timber from conversion forests = timber harvested from natural forests that were converted to farmland such as palm oil plantations)

  Diversity & inclusion
Equal opportunity and diversity in employee hiring and compensation practices are respected based on international standards for the human rights of people from all walks of life. These principles are set out in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct.
Promoting health management
To maintain and improve the health of individual employees, we promote the creation of workplaces where employees will be able to work with enthusiasm.
Initiatives to maintain and improve employee health
Activities for diverse talent acquisition
In its recruitment activities, the Group emphasizes the ambition and volition of the applicant, and does not differentiate selection processes according to academic background or gender. At Group companies outside Japan, the employment of local staff is actively promoted, and talented personnel are employed and promoted to management positions, irrespective of race or gender.
If there has been a compliance violation, the employee will be dealt with appropriately in accordance with Employment Regulations.
Unfair dismissals are not allowed.
Sumitomo Forestry strives for talent acquisition, a major issue for
management, by properly reflecting these employment and treatment policies in our recruitment activities. The Workstyle Diversification Department, an independent organization within the Personnel Department, takes the lead in supporting the activities of our diverse workforce, including female employees, re-employed retirees, and employees with disabilities.
The Healthcare Promotion Team in the Workstyle Diversification Department of the Personnel Department employs one clinical psychologist and two public health nurses and the team undertakes a variety of initiatives aimed at maintaining and improving employee health, starting with health management self-care training during new employee training and including publishing articles and information about health-related events on the Workstyle Diversification Department intranet.
Sumitomo Forestry use an appointment system for regular physical examinations which are crucial for disease prevention, and we maintain a medical examination rate of 100%. Furthermore, we ensure
Practicing mental healthcare
Based on the Guideline on Maintaining and Improving Mental Health of Workers formulated by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Sumitomo Forestry offers four different kinds of care for mental health: self-care, care provided by line managers, care provided by occupational health staff within the workplace, and care using resources from outside the workplace.
Using stress checks
We use websites and other resources designed to help all employees (excluding employees on long-term leaves of absence from work such as those undergoing medical treatment or on childcare leave) to prevent mental disorders.
In the fiscal year ended December 2020, to further encourage active healthy living, we added items that measure presenteeism and absenteeism to the stress check and analyzed them. Moreover, as a follow-up measure for stress checks, we distributed the organizational

that business sites with a small number of workers also have a system where they can consult occupational physicians and public health nurses for regular checkups, or consult them about overwork and follow-up measures for stress checks. For example, business sites with 50 or fewer employees have an assigned occupational physician.
Additionally, when staff are posted abroad, we check their health examination results before they leave and after they return, discuss the results with the persons in question, listen to their thoughts on the status of their health and offer advice.
Since April 2013, an employee who is a qualified clinical psychologist has cooperated with an external provider of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP)* to provide follow-up support and help in returning to work for individuals with mental disorders.

  Identification and measures for environmental risk
Addressing climate change
In December 2015, COP21 (2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference) negotiated and adopted the Paris Agreement, the new framework for addressing climate change starting in the year 2020. The global aim of the agreement, which entered into force in
We recognize that changes in the environment, such as climate change or biodiversity, may have an impact on our business activities. We therefore collect relevant information, conduct analyses when necessary, and make use of the results in business risk assessments.
Depending on the degree of risk, each department decides on specific measures and assessment indicators for risks that arise in day-to-day operations and delivers a progress report every quarter to the Risk Management Committee, while for longer-term risks, countermeasures are formulated by the Sustainability Committee.
Moreover, risks with the potential to have a major impact on
operations are reported to the Board of Directors for discussion on countermeasures. In the fiscal year ended December 2020, the Sustainability Committee invited an outside instructor to lead a study group on the topic, “Forest policy and issues facing the world's forests: Matters arising from climate change and COVID-19.” Speaking on expectations for private enterprises of the future, the instructor stressed the need for business stories tailored for post-corona societies that are also coping with climate change, as well as the importance of making changes and commitments aimed at fulfilling the SDGs.
November 2016, is to maintain global average temperature levels that do not rise more than 2°C from what they were before the Industrial Revolution.
Energy conservation and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in business activities
As the impact of climate change becomes more imminent globally, companies are required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a measure against global warming. The Sumitomo Forestry Group declared in June 2017 that it would set Science Based Targets (SBT)
under the SBT initiative*1 and establish new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the entire Group. Subsequently, those targets were officially approved as SBT in July 2018. The SBT for the Sumitomo Forestry Group are as follows.
 Risks and strategies related to changes in climate and biodiversity
 Risks related to natural disasters
Damage from a major earthquake, wind, flood, or other destructive natural element could result in cost increases arising from interrupted operations at facilities or verification of safety in our housing sales, delays in the completion of construction contracts, or other events. A significant increase in costs caused by a natural disaster could influence the Group’s operating results and financial position.
Strategies
Sumitomo Forestry promotes sales of homes using its BF (Big-Frame) construction method, which offers high earthquake resistance, as well as disaster-resilient homes with functions that allow people to stay for a certain period of time even if lifeline services are disrupted. The Company is also creating services that offer rapid assistance in the event of a natural disaster by using IoT technology to remotely look for damage.
Risks related to changes in timber resources and procurement restrictions
Given that timber is our main material and the source of our products, depletion of timber resources or changes in vegetation as a result of climate change and the loss of biodiversity may mean that Sumitomo Forestry will incur costs and be forced to change suppliers if restrictions are put in place.
Strategies
Sumitomo Forestry imports timber from over 20 countries as a measure to mitigate the risk of changes in forest conditions and new regulations on timber procurement, and has dispatched employees to key countries in order to gather information and check the legality of timber procurement by headquarters staff.
Also, Sumitomo Forestry was the first company in Japan to be registered as a Type 1 Wood-Related Entity under the Clean Wood Act that came into effect in May 2017, and makes a concerted effort to procure legally harvested timber for the entire Group.
Risks related to mandatory emission reductions
As the movement to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions gains momentum globally, there is the possibility that reduction of GHG emissions will be imposed upon businesses in countries where the Sumitomo Forestry Group has a presence. If Group companies with bases in these countries are unable to meet reduction targets, they will be required to purchase carbon emission credits, a risk that will increase business costs. In Japan as well, introduction of a new carbon tax could influence business activities and costs.
Strategies
We have set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for each Group company and business division, and work to reduce emissions in line with targets set each fiscal year.
Risk related to energy supply shortages
In countries such as New Zealand for example, which consumes electricity generated by hydropower plants, operations at our Group’s plants that use hydroelectric power could come to a halt if dam levels fall as a result of less rainfall and hydroelectric power transmission is suspended.
Strategies
We have set greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for each Group company and business division, and work to reduce emissions in line with targets set each fiscal year. In addition to the actions, we have promoted reduction of electricity consumption.
Risks related to reputational damage
If Sumitomo Forestry makes mistakes when addressing risks, such as climate change and the preservation of biodiversity, the Company’s reputation may be damaged and earnings, such as sales, would be directly affected.
Strategies
The Risk Management Committee and the Sustainability Committee take a comprehensive approach to analyzing and responding to risks related to the environment, society and corporate governance from short-, medium- and long-term perspectives.
 SBT (Science Based Targets)
1 Scope 1 and 2*2 : Total 21% reduction (Target year 2030; Base year 2017). 2 Scope 3*2 : Total 16% reduction in categories 1*3 and 11*3
(Target year 2030; Base year 2017)
  *1 The SBT initiative was established in 2015 by four organizations (The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)) for the purpose of promoting GHG emission reduction targets based on scientific data in order to keep global warming to below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. In Japan, the Ministry of the Environment encourages companies to adopt SBT in their initiatives.
*2 Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions of a company, including those from fuel consumption.
For example, CO2 emissions from using gasoline in company vehicles.
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions (including CH4 and N2O) from purchased electricity and heat. For example, CO2 emissions from using electricity in office buildings.
Scope 3: GHG emissions occurring in the supply chain.
For example, CO2 emissions when sold products are used.
*3 Category 1 (in Scope 3): GHG emissions when harvesting, manufacturing, or transporting purchased (or acquired) goods and services. Category 11 (in Scope 3): GHG emissions when using sold goods and services.
In October 2018, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which reports the latest in scientific knowledge on global warming published its Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C. This report showed just how large of a difference the impact on the global environment would be between keeping temperature increases below 2°C and below 1.5°C.
Following the awareness amplified by the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, the SBT initiative updated its target
State of progress of SBT
Scope 1 and 2: Total 21% reduction (Target year 2030; Base year 2017)
Scope 3: Total 16% reduction in categories 1 and 11 (Target year 2030; Base year 2017)
validation criteria in April 2019 to only accept targets along two different pathways, those that are consistent with limiting warming to “well below” 2°C, and those that limit warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (applied starting in October 2019). The Sumitomo Forestry Group is currently coordinating internally to make further reductions to the greenhouse gas emissions from our business activities in line with this revision by the SBT initiative.

Participation in RE100, targeting 100% renewable energy
Response to TCFD
The Sumitomo Forestry Group understands that climate change poses great risks. We announced our support for the TCFD* in July 2018. In the same year, we began to analyze scenarios based on TCFD guidelines. The Group envisioned conditions in the Company’s core Timber and Building Materials Business and Housing and
At the Sumitomo Forestry Group, we have positioned the “reduction of the environmental impact of our business activities” as a material issue, and endeavor to conserve energy and utilize renewable energy. As a part of these efforts, in March 2020,
Sumitomo Forestry joined RE100*, an international initiative that aims for 100% renewable energy for electricity used, and accelerated its efforts to reduce greenhouse gases.
Construction Business in 2030 according to two scenarios. In one scenario, the average global temperature would be 2°C higher than prior to the industrial revolution; the alternative scenario analysis entailed a 4°C increase. The results of these analyses were reported to the Sustainability Committee and Board of Directors.
* RE100 is an international initiative that collaborates with international environmental NGOs The Climate Group and CDP. As of February 2021, it had 290 member companies from around the world, including 50 Japanese firms.
 Greenhouse gas emissions by Scope, based on the GHG Protocol
Since the fiscal year ended March 2013, we have obtained quantitative data for each scope that conforms to the GHG Protocol, the widely used global greenhouse gas measurement standard. In light of increasing demand for renewable energy in recent years, the Group made entry into the biomass power generation business in 2011 and has invested in six of these power plants as of the fiscal year ended December 2020. Mombetsu Biomass Power Plant which is a consolidated subsidiary uses coal as a supplementary fuel to ensure smooth operation and maintenance.
For that reason, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have increased significantly since the fiscal year ended March 2017 in which the Mombetsu Biomass Power Plant went into operation. Due mainly to revised methods for estimating emissions resulting in a decrease in emissions (8,879 t-CO2) at overseas subsidiaries in the Overseas Housing and Real Estate Business, and decreased production at overseas manufacturing plants due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in January through December 2020 decreased 2.7% compared to the fiscal year ended March 2020.Of the total for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions recognized under the GHG Protocol, overseas plants emitted 27.7%, while domestic plants and the power generation business accounted for 60.1%. We started measuring Scope 3 emissions in
the fiscal year ended March 2014 and significantly broadened the scope of our measurements in the fiscal years ended March 2016 and March 2018.
Greenhouse gas emissions for Scopes 1 and 2
* Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): The Financial Stability Board directed the creation of a task force for disclosing financial information related to climate in December 2015, which led to a framework for companies to voluntarily disclose information on climate-related risks and opportunities.
 By 2040, we aim to utilize 100% renewable energy for the electricity used for our Group business activities and for the fuel for our power generation operations.
State of Progress of RE100 Targets
Sumitomo Forestry Group’s implementation of renewable energy includes solar power generation panels installed at our housing exhibition sites and generated power for our own use (including an adjacent wood fuel chip factory) from our biomass power generation sites. In the fiscal year ended December 2020, renewable energy accounted for about 17% of our total group electricity usage. Additionally, the percentage of biomass-derived fuel in the amount of fuel consumed by power generation businesses is 88%. To accelerate the implementation of renewable energy, we plan to have each business division set its own targets and tackle the issue as a company-wide initiative.
Approaches to the 100% Use of Renewable Energy
In order to derive 100% of the electric power used in our business activities from renewable energy, we are examining the use of “Sumirin Denki,” a service where we purchase surplus power as well as supply electricity generated from solar power systems of Sumitomo Forestry Home houses, and installing solar power generation systems in our plants inside and outside Japan. Furthermore, we will consider a diverse range of procurement methods that take advantage of programs in each country we operate.

Corporate Governance
 Corporate Governance System
The Company has adopted the structure of a company with a board of statutory auditors and has a Board of Directors comprising 9 directors (7 male and 2 female), including 3 Outside Directors (1 male and 2 female), and a Board of Statutory Auditors comprising 5
statutory auditors (5 male), including 3 Outside Statutory Auditors (3 male). Under this organizational structure, we have introduced an executive officer system to separate decision-making and supervisory functions from execution functions.
Board of Directors and Executive Committee
The Board of Directors usually meets once a month, making decisions on important issues, checking up on performance and other matters, and carrying out its supervisory functions. Prior to the Board of Directors meeting, the Executive Committee, an advisory body for the president, holds a meeting twice a month, in principle, and is attended by those directors who also serve as executive officers, as well as the full-time statutory auditors. The Board of Directors met 10 times and the Executive Committee met 17 times in the fiscal year ended December 2020. Directors and statutory auditors strive to maintain a Board of Directors meeting attendance rate of at least 75%.
At the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 30, 2021, to strengthen the supervisory functions of the Board of Directors, the number of female outside directors was increased by one and the ratio of independent outside directors on the Board of Directors was increased to 1/3.
Statutory Audit System
Each statutory auditor audits the directors’ execution of duties utilizing the deep insights and diverse perspectives they have acquired from their various backgrounds.
As assistants to the statutory auditors, ten auditing inspectors, who double as senior managers of major departments, are assigned particularly to enhance the function of audits from a practical perspective. Under this system, the statutory auditors attend important meetings such as Board of Directors meetings and Executive Committee meetings, and are able to obtain accurate information regarding the managerial decision-making process at appropriate times. To enhance the effectiveness of audits, the statutory auditors strive to cooperate with the accounting auditor as well as the Internal Audit Department. They also receive reports regularly from the divisions responsible for risk management and compliance, accounting and labor, and monitor and verify that internal controls are functioning effectively. The statutory auditors are also provided with opportunities to express their opinions regarding the directors’ execution of operations whenever needed. In addition, the Group Board of Statutory Auditors, attended by the Company’s full-time statutory auditors and the statutory auditors of major subsidiaries, meets regularly in an effort to strengthen the monitoring functions regarding the status of execution of Group management. Furthermore, in line with the monthly Board of Statutory Auditors meeting, opportunities are provided for the assigned executive officers to explain matters discussed at the Executive Committee meeting so that all statutory auditors and outside directors can understand important matters in detail. The statutory auditors and representative directors also exchange
opinions regularly. This system ensures that the statutory auditors can provide adequate monitoring functions of the directors’ execution of operations from the perspective of shareholders.
The Board of Statutory Auditors met 10 times and the Group Board of Statutory Auditors met 4 times in the fiscal year ended December 2020.
Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee
The Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee has been established as an advisory body to the Board of Directors to ensure transparency and fairness, and solicit opinions, in the nomination of director and statutory auditor candidates and executive officers; the removal of directors, statutory auditors and executive officers; the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers; and decisions about remuneration for directors and executive officers. The committee is comprised of the Chairman of the Board, the President, and all of the outside officers (3 outside directors and 3 outside statutory auditors) so that the majority of members are outside officers. An outside director serves as the committee chair.

Corporate Governance
  Analysis / Evaluation and its results of effectiveness of the Board of Directors
The Company carries out regular self-analysis and self-evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. We strive to further enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors by making continuous efforts to improve any issues identified.
Executive remuneration
Sumitomo Forestry has created an officer remuneration system commensurate with the duties of directors and statutory auditors that are expected by stakeholders in order to realize the Group’s Corporate Philosophy.
Remuneration for Directors (Excluding Outside Directors)
Remuneration for directors, excluding outside directors, is comprised of basic remuneration and performance-linked remuneration. Basic remuneration comprises monthly remuneration and remuneration paid as restricted stocks (referred to below as “restricted stocks”).
The Company sets the amount of basic remuneration commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of each director’s position. Under basic remuneration, monthly remuneration is paid as a fixed amount of cash. Furthermore, as a basic principle, 10% of the basic remuneration is paid in the form of restricted stocks. The amount of cash payments, based on a resolution passed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, does not exceed ¥40 million per month (and no more than ¥5 million for outside directors). The amount of restricted stocks paid out does not exceed ¥100 million per year, per a resolution passed by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Restricted stock remuneration is offered as a medium and long-term incentive to increase the motivation and ambition of officers to enhance the corporate value of Sumitomo Forestry, while also sharing this value with our shareholders to increase the Company’s share price.
Performance-linked remuneration is awarded in presupposed amounts calculated based on a certain mathematical formula (a calculation method where the size of the bonus fluctuates in proportion to the amount of profit) that are commensurate with profit attributable to owners of the parent as well as consolidated recurring income, excluding actuarial differences in retirement benefit accounting for the relevant accounting period, which are generally decided upon and approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Remuneration for Directors (Excluding Outside Directors)
   Basic Remuneration
Performance- Linked Remuneration
At the 76th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 24, 2016, passage of a resolution set remuneration at up to ¥40 million per month (and no more than ¥5 million for outside directors).
As of the 78th General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2018, the Company introduced a remuneration system for allocating shares with restrictions on their transfer, in lieu of stock-based compensation stock options. The maximum limit of monetary remuneration allocated to directors, excluding outside directors, through restricted stock was resolved to be ¥100 million annually.
* In addition, with this resolution, excluding those that have already been issued, remuneration of stock-based compensation stock options in the form of share options was abolished.
A set amount is approved at the annual Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.
Monthly Remune- ration
 Main issues in the effectiveness evaluation performed in the fiscal year ended March 2020
• Improve the way Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee meetings are run.
• Make better use of preliminary meetings among officers to enhance deliberations by the Board of Directors. • Hold discussions about future business strategies in light of the COVID-19 crisis.
Restricted Stock
Bonuses
 Outside Director remuneration
Remuneration for outside directors consists solely of monthly remuneration as basic remuneration. The amount set is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the outside director.
Statutory Auditor remuneration
Statutory auditor remuneration consists solely of monthly remuneration as basic remuneration. A resolution was approved by the 74th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on June 20, 2014, that limits this monthly remuneration to no more than ¥8 million per month.
At the 65th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 29, 2005, the Company abolished the executive retirement bonus system. We reference the results of a third-party assessment of executive remuneration at Japanese companies to ensure the objectivity and fairness of executive remuneration including for outside officers and set an appropriate level of remuneration.

Corporate Governance
 Risk management
Establishment of internal controls system
The Company has adopted a basic policy on the establishment of an internal controls system at the Board of Directors meeting as well as Our Values to embody our corporate philosophy, summarizing the Code of Conduct that all officers and employees of the Group should follow, and has established a system to secure the soundness of our business in accordance with the Companies Act.
Risk Management System
To strengthen the risk management system for the entire Group, the Company has formulated the Risk Management Basic Regulations. Accordingly, the President and Executive Officer of Sumitomo Forestry has been appointed as the highest authority on risk management for the Sumitomo Forestry Group. Executive officers in charge of the Head Office Administrative Division and each business division are appointed to positions responsible for risk management, while general managers are responsible for advancing risk management. The basic regulations also comprehensively encompass risks with ESG aspects.
The Company has established the Risk Management
Risk management structure of the Sumitomo Forestry Group
Committee, which is chaired by the President and Executive Officer and comprised of all other executive officers. Each executive officer identifies and analyzes manageable risks in their respective field and formulates action plans. The committee meets regularly once every quarter to share and discuss the state of plan execution. The committee discusses short-term risks, such as compliance pertaining to prevention of corruption and other matters, and responses to risks that have already materialized. These activities are reported to the Board of Directors, and reflected in business execution.
Established under the umbrella of the Risk Management Committee, the Compliance Subcommittee and the BCM Subcommittee are comprised of the general manager of the General Administration Department, who serves as committee chairman, and the staff in charge of risk management, including those of the departments supervising subsidiaries. These subcommittees work to enhance the effectiveness of risk management pertaining to Group-wide risks, namely, compliance risks related to core business and business interruption.
In the fiscal year ended December 2020, the Risk Management Committee convened three times, the Compliance Subcommittee once, and the BCM Subcommittee twice, and the Board of Directors received reports from them three times.

Rapidly identifying and responding to risk
In addition to the normal reporting line, we have a “two-hours rule,” which is a system designed to rapidly and accurately relay information to the management via the headquarters’ risk management division in the event of an emergency situation that may cause a serious impact on Company management.
This allows us to make swift and optimal management decisions and take immediate action so as to avoid or minimize losses. The information thus reported is also used to compile case studies, which are shared to prevent recurrences of the same incident and improve business operation. When a major issue arises, the information is shared with the Corporate Communications Department and disclosed to stakeholders in a timely and appropriate manner.
Compliance promotion system
The Compliance Subcommittee responds to compliance risk across the Group. The subcommittee has set Group standards, including management systems and tools for legal compliance with the Construction Business Act and other laws and regulations, and efficiently responds to compliance risk.
The subcommittee was convened once in the fiscal year ended December 2020 and undertook ongoing improvement of the compliance system such as by studying important legal and regulatory requirements essential for the continuation of business.
Moreover, at a compliance seminar to which external experts are invited as instructors, the subcommittee provides opportunities for individuals in charge of compliance, including individuals working for subsidiaries, to keep up with up-to date knowledge, improve their skill levels, work on the same level as others, and develop a shared awareness of risk. These activities of the subcommittee are reported quarterly to the Board of Directors,
putting a system in place to reflect the findings in business execution. The activities are also reported to the statutory auditors and the Internal Audit Department monthly. Critical Group-wide matters and risk information are shared with the statutory auditors of each Group company through the Group Board of Statutory Auditors. We maintain a compliance promotion framework through an approach on and off the business execution line.
Internal auditing
The Internal Audit Department conducts additional risk assessment for the approximately 200 business sites of the Sumitomo Forestry Group. It selects around 60 business sites every year and conducts an internal audit. These business sites are given priority and selected based on two perspectives: operational risks (performance, scale, business complexity) and risk control (management system for risks). In principle, the auditors travel to the site to check and evaluate the actual documents, but in the fiscal year ended December 2020, to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we included the method of auditing data and written documents without the auditors visiting the site.
The audits are conducted to verify the status of each business site’s business execution, including compliance, and management of administrative actions. The results of these assessments are reported to the president, executive officer in charge of internal audits and statutory auditors as well as managers, executive officers and directors in charge of the offices being audited. In the case that audit findings are made, the Internal Audit Department verifies that improvements are being implemented at the business site by requesting written reports and carrying out quarterly follow-up audits. These actions are reported to the president, executive officer in charge of internal audits, and statutory auditors.

Corporate Governance
  Managing business continuity
System for managing business continuity
Sumitomo Forestry has established the BCM Subcommittee to address risks presented by events or emergency situations which are extremely difficult for a company to prevent on its own , and which can have serious impacts on headquarters’ functions such as, for example, major natural disasters and outbreaks of new strains of influenza. The BCM Subcommittee is responsible for spreading awareness of and strengthening the business continuity management (BCM) structure, formulating, revising and improving business continuity plans (BCP), and conducting drills based on BCP. In the fiscal year ended December 2020, the BCM Subcommittee met twice, providing an opportunity to organize the basic approach to BCM. In addition to encouraging each department and company to tackle BCM proactively and voluntarily, the committee also provided information about the changes the Company has made to the organization of its fire brigade due to the COVID-19 crisis.
Ensuring employee safety and continuation of company operations
The Sumitomo Forestry Group has distributed a portable risk response card to all Group employees in Japan. The card contains instructions to follow in the event of a major earthquake as well as rules for reporting to supervisors in their divisions. All Group companies in Japan have introduced safety confirmation systems linked to weather information, in addition to the emergency contact networks within the organization in order to obtain as much information as possible about the safety of employees before communication lines become congested and restrictions are placed on outgoing communications. These initiatives allow safety confirmations to be made via multiple routes. Furthermore, safety confirmation drills are conducted at domestic Group companies every year. In the fiscal year ended December 2020, a total of 14,860 people participated in these drills.
In response to COVID-19, Sumitomo Forestry introduced a flexible work schedule system Company-wide, and put employees on staggered shifts to reduce the number of people at one workplace at the same time, while encouraging employees to balance working from home with commuting to work. During the state of emergency, employees in regions subject to lockdown were required in principle to work from home.
Initiatives towards supply chain business continuity initiatives
In preparation for the potential disruption of its Housing and Construction Business supply chain following a major disaster, Sumitomo Forestry shares the specifications and processes for
property construction along with site progress statuses and other information with business partners, including component makers and building contractors. By enabling advanced procurement of materials and production, the Company is striving to reduce the risk of a disruption to operations. The COVID-19 outbreak that spread across the world in 2020, however, led to delays in construction projects and parts and materials procurement.
In light of these circumstances, in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, or a fire accident, we asked our suppliers to examine their methods for reporting disasters to Sumitomo Forestry and developing systems for historical records management. We are also endeavoring to build a structure where as a principle we can procure the same parts or material from two or more companies (including two or more production locations for the same part of material) as a way of guarding against such contingencies.
To deal with delays in parts and materials procurement caused by COVID-19, Sumitomo Forestry asked its suppliers to stockpile inventories of materials that experienced delays, as a short-term preparation. For medium- to long-term preparations, Sumitomo Forestry plans to work with its suppliers on reducing risk by geographically dispersing their production bases, moving from having them in a single country toward establishing bases in other countries. Regarding suppliers of construction materials and other materials, Sumitomo Forestry added questions related to business continuity, such as whether alternate supply routes can be ensured during an emergency, to the supplier survey it conducts every year to facilitate decisions on whether to continue transactions with each supplier. Through these efforts, the Company strives to further reduce the risk of business disruption.
Maintaining customer service
Sumitomo Forestry has set up call centers in Tokyo and Okinawa that are able to provide 24-hour after-sales services. We are also developing a mechanism whereby either call center can back up the functions of the other call center in the event of a disaster. We strive to enable a quick response to requests for repairs by managing information for each base through a unified emergency system which allows the Company to share disaster information pertaining to owners nationwide.
Ensuring management transparency
Basic policy on disclosure
To increase transparency in management, we actively disclose not only the information required to be disclosed by various laws and regulations, but also other items deemed useful to shareholders and investors, actively and in a swift and fair manner.
Initiatives to encourage execution of voting rights
The Company sends out notices three weeks prior to the General Meeting of Shareholders so that a greater number of shareholders can participate.
In addition, shareholders can use the internet and other electronic means to exercise their voting rights. We also make use of the electronic proxy voting platform for institutional investors operated by ICJ, Inc. for proxy voting.
Disclosure of a wide range of information
At the General Meeting of Shareholders, we endeavor to provide reports and explanations that are easy to understand. Additionally, we display a wealth of IR information in Japanese and English such as accounting-related information like financial results, Factbooks and summaries of financial results and forecasts on our website along with information about monthly orders in the housing business. We also display detailed information about sustainability initiatives on the website in both English and Japanese.
Since the fiscal year ended March 2017, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has published the Integrated Report with the objective of improving the disclosure of financial information about its initiatives to increase corporate value, as well as non-financial information related to ESG. Apart from the Integrated Report, Sumitomo Forestry proactively offers information by publishing Japanese and English translations of its business activity reports and Notices of Convocation of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, among other documents, in print as well as on its website.
IR activities
The Company is enhancing its IR activities to communicate its management vision, the state of operations, financial position and other information timely and clearly with shareholders and investors.
Separate meetings
After the quarterly announcement of accounts, the Company holds separate meetings for securities analysts and institutional investors. We spoke with a total of 117 companies in Japan and abroad in the fiscal year ended December 2020. In addition to
this, we will also hold small meetings and on-site briefings as appropriate.
Briefings for individual investors
We regularly hold briefings for individual investors. Due to the influence of the spread of COVID-19 in the fiscal year ended December 2020 and the fact that we changed our accounting period, briefings were not held, but in the fiscal year ended March 2020, we held a briefing in Osaka and Nagoya which many individual investors participated in. At these briefings, in addition to giving details about the Sumitomo Forestry Group's businesses, we explain the Group's growth strategy, set up exhibition booths, and introduce the Sumitomo Forestry Group's custom-built detached houses, rental apartments, renovation services, private-pay elderly care facilities and overseas real estate to interested individual investors.
IR activities for overseas institutional investors
and shareholders
We issue English versions of accounting-related material for the benefit of overseas institutional investors and shareholders. Additionally, in the fiscal year ended December 2020, management held an online meeting with institutional investors and shareholders in Europe. There was an exchange of opinions in addition to explanations about business performance and strategy.
In order to provide further opportunities for dialog, we also participate in conferences organized by securities firms.

Management’s discussion and analysis (FY ended December 2020)
Regarding change in fiscal year end
The fiscal year-end of the Company was changed from March 31 to December 31 starting from the fiscal year under review, and the Group’s fiscal year-ends have been consolidated on December 31. As such, since the fiscal year from April 1 to December 31, 2020 resulting from the change of the end of the fiscal year will be an irregular nine-month fiscal year, the percentages of year-on-year changes represent comparisons with the first nine months of the previous fiscal year (from April 1 to December 31, 2019, which will be referred to hereinafter as the “same period of the previous fiscal year”).
For the consolidated results of the same period of the previous fiscal year, the financial statements prepared as of December 31, 2019 are used for the Company and those consolidated subsidiaries with fiscal year-ends in March, and the financial statements prepared as of September 30, 2019 are used for those consolidated subsidiaries with fiscal year-ends in December. However, for the fiscal year under review, the financial statements prepared as of December 31, 2020 are used for the Company and all consolidated subsidiaries.
Net income and cash flow from January 1 to March 31, 2020 at consolidated subsidiaries with fiscal year-ends of December are not included in the results for the fiscal year under review. Instead, the balance of retained earnings and the balance of cash and cash equivalents have been adjusted accordingly.
Market overview
In the period under review, the global economy rapidly plunged into harsh conditions due to COVID-19, but there were signs of economic recovery in the United States and China prompted by enactment of monetary and fiscal policies that brought about a resumption of economic activity. The Japanese economy was also hit hard by the reduced comings and goings, particularly the lodging, transportation, and restaurant industries. However, consumer spending and exports have been trending toward recovery.
In the domestic housing market, the number of new housing starts was sluggish due primarily to weakened consumer sentiment and restrictions on business activities under the declaration of a state of emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, the housing market fell into temporary decline up to the beginning of the fiscal year, but against a backdrop of historically low mortgage rates and low existing home inventory, the market recovered and has been performing favorably overall. Additionally, in Australia, which faced its first economic recession in 29 years, the market was declining initially, but signs of a recovery appeared owing in part to lower mortgage interest rates and the government’s housing construction subsidy program.
In the midst of such business conditions, the Group kept up its business activities, prioritizing the safety of its customers, trading
partners, and its employees and their families while taking the utmost precaution to prevent the spread of the virus. This fiscal year marked the second year of our 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan. In Japan, we made the decision to bring a general contractor into the Group for the purpose of expanding our medium- to large- sized timber constructed building business and also began participating in a wood biomass power generation project in Sendai City. In the United States, we focused on promoting the business for further growth of the Group, including expanding the area of our detached housing business.
Consolidated operating results
Net sales were ¥839,881 million (up 4.6% compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year), operating income was ¥47,462 million (up 24.0%), recurring income was ¥51,293 million (up 19.1%), and net income for the period attributable to shareholders of parent was ¥30,398 million (up 34.4%). Actuarial differences for retirement benefit accounting came to ¥4,823 million, and recurring income excluding actuarial differences was ¥46,470 million.
Return on equity (ROE) was 8.8% (for the nine months from April 1 to December 31, 2020). However, the Company still targets ROE of at least 10%.

Financial position
Total assets totaled ¥1,091,152 million at the end of the current consolidated fiscal year, an increase of ¥86,385 million compared to the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was due mainly to an increase in investment securities from the rise in market value of listed stocks held and an increase in inventories associated with expansion of the overseas housing and real estate business. Liabilities increased ¥43,993 million compared to the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year to ¥691,696 million due mainly to increases in commercial paper issued and debt. Net assets totaled ¥399,456 million, and the equity ratio was 33.7%.
Cash flows
There was a net increase of ¥9,656 million in cash and cash equivalents (hereafter: “cash”) to ¥122,220 million. The increase includes an adjustment of ¥13,170 million in conjunction with the change in fiscal year-end.
A summary of cash flows is presented below.
In conjunction with the change in fiscal year-end, the fiscal year under review is an irregular transition period covering the nine months from April 1 to December 31, 2020. For that reason, no figures are provided for year-on- year comparison.
Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased ¥46,840 million. The increase was attributable mainly to an increase in cash resulting from posting ¥50,211 million in income before income taxes despite a decrease in cash resulting from an increase in inventories associated with expansion of the overseas housing and real estate business.
Cash flows from investment activities
Net cash decreased ¥44,635 million as a result of investment activities. This was due mainly to the use of cash to construct an assisted living facility in Japan and to develop multi-family housing as well as commercial and mixed use complexes, and to take over a spec homes business in the United States.
Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities was ¥6,782 million. This was attributable mainly to an increase in cash from issuance of commercial papers and an increase in debt as well as a decrease in cash from payment of dividends and purchase of additional equity interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
Regarding the capital resources and capital liquidity of the Sumitomo Forestry Group, the Company’s basic policy is to take a flexible approach to optimizing fund-raising methods based on the long/short-term use of funds, while staggering repayment time lines and reducing procurement costs.
risks in fund procurement, such as maintaining business relationships with financial institutions, diversifying fund-raising sources, and setting up commitment lines with a number of financial institutions. As of the end of the fiscal year under review, interest-bearing debt totaled ¥302,933 million, including loans and lease obligations.
Capital expenditures (Capital investment)
The Sumitomo Forestry Group (Sumitomo Forestry and its consolidated subsidiaries) spent ¥21,090 million on capital expenditures. In the Timber and Building Materials Business, capital expenditures amounted to ¥3,027 million, including for the construction of a building materials manufacturing plant and the purchase of machinery and equipment. In the Housing and Construction Business, capital expenditures totaled ¥3,962 million, for investments in areas such as building new model homes.

In Other Businesses, capital expenditures totaled ¥1,150 million, including investments in systems to improve business efficiency.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries As of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020
1. Nature of Operations
Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its affiliated companies (together, the “Group”) are involved in various business activities related to wood and houses, with forestry operations serving as the foundation of its business. Specifically, the Group’s operations encompass forest management as well as timber and building materials- related operations, including procurement, manufacture, processing and sale of timber and building materials; housing and construction-related operations, including construction, maintenance, renovation and landscaping of custom-built and other homes and sale and brokerage of real estate; overseas housing and real estate-related operations, including sale of spec homes, construction of detached houses and development of multi-family housing and commercial complexes; environment and resources-related operations, including biomass power generation business and forestation business; and other businesses, including private-pay elderly care facilities and elderly residence that combines living support service business, insurance agency business and civil engineering and construction work.
2. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries maintain their books of account in conformity with the financial accounting standards of Japan, and its foreign subsidiaries maintain their books of account in conformity with those of their countries of domicile.
Effective April 1, 2008, the Company adopted the “Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries for Consolidated Financial Statements (PITF No. 18).”
In accordance with PITF No. 18, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by using the accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) as adjusted for certain items including those for goodwill, actuarial differences and capitalized development costs.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and consolidated subsidiaries (together, the “Companies”) are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of IFRS and US GAAP, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan.
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include information which is not required under Japanese GAAP but is presented herein as additional information.
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of consolidation and investments in affiliates
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts and unrealized intercompany profits are eliminated on consolidation.
Financial Section
Millions of yen
Thousands of U.S. dollars (Note 4)
Investments in affiliates (15 to 50 percent-owned companies except subsidiaries) in which the ability to exercise significant influence exists are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings (losses). Net consolidated income includes the Company’s share of the current net earnings (losses) of such companies, after elimination of unrealized intercompany profits. As of December 31, 2020, the numbers of consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for by the equity method were 267 and 107 (244 and 100 as of March 31, 2020), respectively. PT. Kubu Mulia Forestry and 28 other companies, whose shares were newly acquired, have been included in the scope of consolidation from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri and 1 other company, which were included as equity-method affiliates in the previous fiscal year, have been included in the scope of consolidation due to the additional acquisition of shares. On the other hand, Paragon Wood Product (Dalian) Co., Ltd. and 7 other companies, which were included in the scope of consolidation in the previous fiscal year, have been excluded from the scope of consolidation due to the completion of liquidation.
VISON Hotel Management Co., Ltd. and 9 other companies, whose shares were newly acquired, have been included as equity-method affiliates from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. On the other hand, PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri and 2 other companies, which were included as equity-method affiliates in the previous fiscal year, have been excluded from the scope of consolidation in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
Among the consolidated subsidiaries, the fiscal year end for 1 domestic consolidated subsidiary and 1 overseas consolidated subsidiary is on March 31. Therefore, the financial statements of those subsidiaries are consolidated using the financial statements based on provisional settlements as of December 31. The fiscal year end for other consolidated subsidiaries is on December 31. In terms of the equity- method affiliates whose fiscal years are different from the consolidated closing date, the financial statements for their respective fiscal year or the financial statements based on provisional settlements as of December 31 are consolidated.
(b) Translation of foreign currency transactions and accounts
Current and long-term receivables and payables in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The Company translates the revenue and expense accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries at the average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The balance sheet accounts, except for the components of net assets, are also translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The components of net assets are translated at their historical rates.
(c) Statement of cash flows
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments, generally with original maturities of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are near enough to maturity that they present only an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(d) Allowance for doubtful accounts
Allowance for doubtful accounts is stated based on the default ratio sustained over a specific period in the past and the estimated uncollectible amount based on the analysis of certain individual accounts, including probable bad debts and claims in bankruptcy.
This amount is considered sufficient to cover possible losses on collection.
(e) Provision for bonuses
Provision for bonuses is stated based on estimated bonuses to be paid to employees, which are to be charged to income in the current year.

(h) Provision for loss on business liquidation
Provision for loss on business liquidation is stated based on the possible losses incurred as a result of business liquidation.
(i) Retirement benefit liability or retirement benefit assets
Retirement benefit liability or retirement benefit assets for employees has been recorded mainly at the amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of the pension plan assets as of the balance sheet date.
The retirement benefit obligation for employees is attributed to each period by the benefit formula method over the estimated years of service of the eligible employees.
Unrecognized actuarial gains (losses) and unrecognized prior service cost are charged to income, with minor exceptions, in the fiscal year in which they arise.
(j) Provision for retirement benefits for directors (and other officers)
Provision for retirement benefit for directors (and other officers) of certain subsidiaries are provided based on the amount required for at year-end in accordance with established internal policies.
(k) Marketable securities and investment securities
Marketable securities and investment securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management’s intent, as follows:
i) held-to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost; and ii) marketable available-for-sale securities, which are not classified as the aforementioned securities, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of net assets.
Non-marketable available-for-sale securities are carried at cost.
The Company determines cost of securities sold by the moving average method.
(l) Derivatives
Derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to profit or loss, except for those which meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
(m) Inventories
Merchandise, finished goods, work in process, raw materials and supplies are stated at moving average cost.
Costs on construction contracts in progress, real estate for sale and real estate for sale in process are stated at cost, which is determined by the specific identification method.
The amount on the balance sheet is calculated using a write-down method based on the decrease in profitability.
The Company recognized ¥715 million ($6,913 thousand) in valuation loss on inventories in cost of sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
(n) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment, including significant renewals and additions, are capitalized at cost. Maintenance, repairs, minor renewals and improvements are charged to income. In the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is computed, with minor exceptions, by the declining balance method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets according to general class, type of construction and use. In its foreign consolidated subsidiaries, depreciation is computed by the straight-line method, with minor exceptions. In the case of retirement or disposal, the difference between the net book value and salvage or sales proceeds is charged or credited to income.
(o) Intangible assets
Amortization of intangible assets is computed by the straight-line method. Internal use software costs are amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years.
(p) Impairment of non-current assets
Non-current assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When amounts of undiscounted future cash flows of non-current assets are less than the carrying amounts, the non-current fixed assets are determined to be impaired. Then, the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is recognized as an impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income. The recoverable amount of non-current assets is the greater of the net selling price or the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the non-current assets.
(q) Hedge accounting
i) Hedge accounting method
The deferred hedge accounting method is applied.
The allocation method is applied to foreign exchange hedging transactions. The exceptional method is used for interest rate swaps if they satisfy the requirements for the exceptional method.
ii) Hedging method
Foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency swaps are utilized to mitigate foreign exchange risks. Interest rate swap transactions are utilized to mitigate interest rate risks.
iii) Scope of hedging
Certain transactions, including planned transactions and borrowings exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk, etc., in accordance with policies laid out in management regulations.
iv) Hedge effectiveness evaluation method
The Companies believe foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency swaps to be highly effective as hedging instruments and the exceptional method is used for interest rate swaps; therefore, effectiveness evaluation is not carried out.
(r) Amortization method and period of goodwill
Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years. Insignificant amounts are charged to income when incurred.
(s) Revenue recognition
The Company adopted “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No. 29, March 30, 2018) and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30, March 30, 2018) from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, as they are applicable from the beginning of fiscal years starting on or after April 1, 2018.
The amount expected to be received in exchange for promised goods or services is recognized as revenue at the time when the control of those goods or services is transferred to the customer.
(t) Income taxes
The Companies accrue income taxes based on taxable income. The Companies include many items for financial reporting purposes which, in the case of expenses, are not currently deductible and, in the case of income, are not currently taxable.
Income taxes based on temporary differences between tax and financial reporting purposes are reflected as deferred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method.
(u) Consumption taxes
Transactions subject to consumption taxes are recorded at amounts exclusive of consumption taxes.
(v) Appropriations of retained earnings
Appropriations of retained earnings reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are recorded upon approval by shareholders as required under Japanese law.
(w) Earnings per share of common stock
The computation of net income attributable to shareholders of parent per share and cash dividends per share is based on the average number of shares outstanding during each period.
(x) Finalization of provisional accounting treatment of business combinations
The revised purchase price allocation arising from the finalization of provisional accounting treatment is reflected on the consolidated financial statements for the period in which the business combination occurs.

i) Overview
Principles for disclosures related to revenue recognition (presentation and notes) were determined.
ii) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
(Accounting Standards for Fair Value Measurement)
The ASBJ issued “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Statement No. 30), “Revised Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories” (ASBJ Statement No. 9), “Revised Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Statement No. 10), “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Guidance No. 31) on July 4, 2019 and “Revised Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19) on March 31, 2020.
i) Overview
The ASBJ developed the accounting standard and implementation guidance on fair value measurement mainly focusing on the guidance and disclosure on the fair value measurement of financial instruments
based in international accounting standards with nearly identical detailed guidance issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) (IFRS 13 by the IASB and Topic 820 by the FASB) and issued them from a standpoint of enhancing comparability between financial statements of companies in Japan and overseas.
As the basic policy of the ASBJ in developing accounting standards for fair value measurement, the ASBJ accepted the basic principle of IFRS 13 from a standpoint of enhancing comparability between financial statements of companies in Japan and overseas with a unified calculation method. Furthermore, the ASBJ added alternative accounting treatment without impairing comparability when there are matters to be considered related to common accounting practices in Japan, etc.
ii) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.
iii) Impact of the adoption of accounting standard and implementation guidance The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of these accounting standards and implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
(Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates) On March 31, 2020, the ASBJ issued “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates” (ASBJ Statement No. 31). i) Overview
Based on requests for disclosing the assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty underlying amounts, which is required in accordance with paragraph 125 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (IAS 1) issued by the IASB in 2003, as highly useful information for users of financial statements, the ASBJ developed and issued “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates”.
As the basic policy of the ASBJ in developing the accounting standard, the ASBJ used paragraph 125 of the IAS 1 as a reference and clarified the principles for the disclosure but did not elaborate on each note, and left for entities to decide the specific details on disclosures in accordance with the underlying principles.
ii) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard from the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.
(Accounting Standard for Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections)
On March 31, 2020, the ASBJ revised “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates” (ASBJ Statement No. 24).
i) Overview
The ASBJ issued “Revised Accounting Standard for Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” in light of proposals to consider the development of notes where accounting principles and procedures based on specific accounting standards are unclear.
In case of developing such notes, the ASBJ decided to apply the policies of note 1-2 on Corporate Accounting Principles in order not to impact treatment where requirements in the appropriate accounting standard are clear.
ii) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard from the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.
(z) Change of Fiscal Year End
Effective from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries changed their fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The change is to align the closing date of the

Integrated Report 2021 102
Financial Section

Companies in order to disclose management information in a timely and accurate manner and to enhance the transparency of management. Accordingly, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, is a nine-month period from April 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, for the Company and its subsidiaries.
Net income and cash flows from January 1, 2020, to March 31, 2020, for foreign subsidiaries, whose fiscal year end is on December 31, were adjusted on the consolidated statement of changes in net assets and the consolidated statement of cash flows, respectively.
4. U.S. Dollar Amounts
The U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for convenience and have been translated, as a matter of arithmetical computation only, at the rate of ¥103.50 =US $1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing in the Japanese foreign exchange market at the end of December 2020. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the yen amounts actually represent, have been or could be converted into, U.S. dollars.
As permitted under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan, amounts of less than one million yen are rounded in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the total amounts in Japanese yen and translated U.S. dollars shown in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts.

The Japanese Corporate Law (“the Law”) enforced on May 1, 2006 provides that an amount equivalent to 10% of cash dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends. Legal reserve and additional paid-in capital may be reversed without limitation and no further appropriation is required when the sum of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock.
The Law also provides that the common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of shareholders.
The balances of the legal reserve of the Company at December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, which were included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were ¥2,857 million ($27,605 thousand) and ¥2,857 million, respectively.
                    105 Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd.
Integrated Report 2021 106
Research and development expenses charged to selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 were ¥1,883 million ($18,190 thousand) and ¥2,271 million, respectively.

Year-end dividends are approved by shareholders at a meeting held subsequent to the fiscal year to which the dividends are applicable. In addition, semi-annual interim dividends may be paid upon resolution of the Board of Directors, subject to limitations imposed by the Law.
13. Finance Leases
(Lessee)
Depreciation costs of finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership are calculated based on the straight-line method over the lease periods of the leased assets, with no residual value of the assets at the end of the lease periods.
Disclosure of information concerning lease transactions as lessor has been omitted, due to insignificance of disclosure of such information in the consolidated financial statements.
14. Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 were as follows:
(b) Details of financial instruments and related risk
Trade receivables are exposed to customers’ credit risk. Short-term borrowings are mainly used for repurchase agreement that has a contract with a financial institution with a rating of more than a certain level, and therefore credit risk is insignificant. Marketable securities are mainly negotiable deposit certificates subject to settlement in the short term. Investment securities are mainly bonds for held-to-maturity and equities of customers and suppliers of the Companies and those are exposed to market price fluctuation risk. Almost all of trade payables have payment due dates within one year. Bank loans and bonds payable are mainly used for operating capital expenses and capital investment. Although bank loans with floating rate interest are exposed to market risk of interest rate fluctuation, the Companies use derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for hedging a part of such loans. Derivative transactions include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency swaps to mitigate market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates related to foreign currency-denominated transactions and interest rate swaps to mitigate market risk of interest rate fluctuation related to interest payments for borrowings.
(c) Risk management for financial instruments
(Credit risk management)
The Companies review due date and receivable balance of each customer in accordance with the Credit Management Guideline. In addition, the Companies monitor credit standing of principal customers at least once a year.
(Risk management of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation and interest rate fluctuation)
With respect to investment securities, the Companies regularly monitor prices and the issuer’s financial status. Except for held-to-maturity bonds, the Companies constantly review investment strategy by taking the market situation and relationship with issuers into consideration. Derivative transactions are executed and managed in accordance with internal rules and policies by the responsible section of each Group Company, and the status of derivative positions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors.
The Companies believe that market risk relating to derivative instruments is very low since the contracts entered into are spread among highly creditworthy financial institutions both in Japan and abroad.
(Risk management of liquidity risk that the Companies cannot meet its contractual obligation in full on maturity dates)
The Finance Department of the Company manages liquidity risk by establishing and revising cash flow plan based on reports from each section.
(d) Supplementary explanation of items relating to the fair values of financial instruments
The fair values of financial instruments include market prices or reasonably estimated values if there are no market prices. Because estimation of fair values incorporates variable factors, adopting different assumptions can change the values.
(e) Fair value of financial instruments
Fair values of financial instruments were as follows. Items for which fair values are extremely difficult to establish are not included in the following table.

Notes:
1. Method of estimating the fair values of financial instruments
and items relating to securities and derivative transactions
(1) Assets
(Cash and deposits, Notes and accounts receivable - trade)
Because these are settled in the short term, fair values and book values are nearly equivalent. Therefore, relevant book values are used.
(Marketable securities and investment securities)
The fair values of equity securities, including shares in affiliates, are based on market prices. The fair values of debt securities are based on market prices or quoted prices obtained from financial institutions. For negotiable deposit certificates, the book value is almost the same as the market value because of their short maturities.
(2) Liabilities
(Notes and accounts payable - trade, Accounts payable for construction contracts)
Because these are settled in the short term, fair values and book values are nearly equivalent. Therefore, relevant book values are used.
(Bonds payable)
The fair values of bonds payable are based on market prices.
(Long-term borrowings)
The fair values of long-term borrowings with floating interest rates approximate book values because the interest rate of long-term borrowings reflects market interest rate quickly and the Company’s credit standing has not changed significantly since implementing the loans. Therefore, relevant book values are used. The fair values of long-term borrowings with fixed interest rates are principally estimated by discounting based on estimated interest rates if similar new borrowings were implemented.
(3) Derivative transactions See Note 17.

16. Financial Instruments
(a) Policy for financial instruments
  The Companies invest temporary cash surplus in financial assets with high degrees of safety and mainly use bank loans and bonds payable in order to raise funds. Furthermore, the Companies use derivative transactions to mitigate the risk of currency exchange rates related to normal foreign currency-denominated transactions and the risk of interest rate fluctuation related to interest payment for loans, and do not conduct for speculative purposes.

2. Financial instruments whose fair values are extremely difficult to determine

The changes in the asset retirement obligations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 were summarized as follows:
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, estimates of asset retirement obligations that were recorded as part of an obligation to restore a site to its original condition associated with the real estate rental agreement have changed due to obtaining new information regarding site restoration expenses and expected usage term. The related asset retirement obligations have increased by ¥343 million ($3,313 thousand) as a result of this change.

(c) Method for estimating a fair unit price for stock options
No stock options were granted in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
(d) Method for estimating the number of vested stock options
Because it is difficult to reasonably estimate the number of options that will expire in the future, the number of options that have been forfeited is reflected.
28. Additional Information
(Effect of COVID-19 on Accounting Estimates)
It is extremely difficult to predict the future spread of COVID-19 and when it will end. Although the transaction volume of the Timber and Building Materials business has decreased, the financial performance of the Overseas Housing and Real Estate business has been favorable mainly in the United States because of the increasing demand for domestic detached houses, which led to a recovery trend in orders received in the Housing and Construction Business that has continued from the middle of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.
To determine the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition of impairment loss, the Company made best estimates assuming that a minor impact would continue based on the information available at the time of preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
However, in the event it is determined that there are major changes in circumstances upon which the estimates were formed, a reversal of deferred tax assets may occur and estimates may be revised considering any changes in the subsequent fiscal year.
29. Subsequent Events

Opinion
Independent Auditor’s Report
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
• Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Corporate Auditor and the Board of Corporate Auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Corporate Auditor and the Board of Corporate Auditors with a statement that we have complied with the ethical requirements regarding independence that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Japan, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sumitomo Forestry Co., Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the nine-month period then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the nine-month period then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Responsibilities of Management, the Corporate Auditor and the Board of Corporate Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as required by accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, matters related to going concern.
The Corporate Auditor and the Board of Corporate Auditors are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

 Addressing the Five Key Issues A Bringing ICT to Farming
Reflecting demographic graying and a shrinking population of farming professionals, dairy farms are seeking to make their operations more efficient and effective. The Kanematsu Group is working with Farmnote Holdings to develop systems that can assist with livestock management by using IoT-connected sensors to identify individual cattle, recognize their behavior using AI, and alert users to abnormalities (such as signs of oestrus or illness). Working together, we aim to realize efficient, next-generation dairy farming through the use of smart barns and other new initiatives utilizing ICT.
Through such initiatives, we will respond to changes in markets and customer needs while contributing to the development of dairy farming by leveraging new, Groupwide perspec- tives and ideas.
C Demonstration Project to Increase Effective EV Range
In northern California, in the United States, Kanematsu is working with Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and Nissan North America, Inc. on a demonstration project commissioned by the New Energy Industrial Technology and Development Organization (NEDO) aimed at expanding the effective range of electric vehicles (EVs).
This project is providing EV drivers with a smartphone app called DRIVEtheARC. Introduced in fiscal 2019, this app allows users to reserve EV charging stations. The projectâ€™s charging infrastructure now includes two CHAdeMO 100 kW high-power fast chargers. Under the project, 57 rapid chargers have been installed at 26 locations in the northern part of the state. The project is expected to
help improve the usability
of EVs and promote their
adoption.
Through such proj- ects, we will continue to work toward the creation of a low-carbon society while preventing air pollution and reducing global warming.

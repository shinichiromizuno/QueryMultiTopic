Sustainable Coffee Plantation-Related Initiatives
Rainforest Alliance is an NGO known around that world that sets exacting standards for environmental, social, and economic sus- tainability and promotes sustainability both in terms of the glob- al environment and within local communities. Since 2003, Kanematsu has been trading with Daterra Coffee of Brazil, the only coffee producer in the world that clears the Rainforest Alliance’s strictest standards, on an ongoing basis; 2018 marked 15 years of doing business together.
The Japanese market consumes more coffee produced by Daterra than any other. Kanematsu trades with beverage makers who deeply sympathize with Daterra’s operating principles and vision on an ongoing basis.
Environmental and local community sustainability in produc- ing regions can only be achieved with the support of sustainable
consumption in consuming regions.
Kanematsu will continue to
provide a bridge between producers and consumers, helping to spread environmentally friendly coffee.

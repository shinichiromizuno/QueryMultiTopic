Progress toward the Medium-Term Vision
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our businesses in many ways. In the ICT solutions business, we faced limitations on business activities, and some aspects of IT investment were restrained, reflecting worsening corporate results. However, demand for strategic IT investment, such as that for remote work, increased, and we strived to further expand sales in VDI environment building, security solutions, and service- based businesses. The mobile business was forced to shorten store hours and faced industry restructuring and the intro- duction of plans available online. Under these
Business Highlight
Sales of Stamping-Type Plating Machines
In the industrial electronics and electronic materials businesses, we began sales of a stamping-type plating machine that enables high-speed plating. This machine was developed by Mikado Technos Co., Ltd., incorporating its proprietary vacuum press technologies and drawing on patents and expertise provided by Toyota Motor Corporation. The product features a revolutionary new technology employing a polymer membrane (solid electrolyte membrane) that allows metal ions to pass through, effectively “stamping” metal plating only on the necessary parts of components. This process eliminates the need to completely immerse components in baths of plating solution, as with conventional processes. As such, it will enable major reductions in emissions of waste solution and CO2, helping to reduce environmental impact.
circumstances, we acquired and promoted the consolidation of mobile phone sales agencies, aiming to increase our market share and thereby secure our position while building a high-revenue business structure.
In the semiconductor component and equipment busi- nesses, we acquired an IC test handler manufacturing busi- ness and made a company that sells laser wafer marking equipment and provides related services a Group company, expanding our business portfolio.

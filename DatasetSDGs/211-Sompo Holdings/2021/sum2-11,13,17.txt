With the recent shift to a new normal climate, characterized by frequent major natural disasters, we believe that the Sompo Group has a responsibility to work on solving issues that will help create a disaster-resilient society. In addition to the traditional role of P&C insurance, which is to provide financial coverage after a disaster has occurred, we would like to take a more proactive approach to disaster prepared- ness to prevent and mitigate disasters and to help ensure a quick recovery after a disaster occurs. Furthermore, we would like to provide new services to our customers by utilizing technology, namely through AI and data. Sompo Japan Insurance has formed a business alliance with Silicon Valley-based disaster prevention start-up company One Concern, Inc. and Weathernews Inc. to jointly develop an AI-based flood and earthquake damage prediction system to contribute to the improvement of regional disaster prepared- ness. This system utilizes AI and a variety of data related to local disaster prevention, including data on weather and buildings, to enable damage prediction and real-time tracking of damage before, during, and after floods and earthquakes by block (parcel). Following verification conducted in
Kumamoto City from March 2019, we aim to develop a disaster prevention and mitigation system unique to Japan.
In cooperation with local governments, we will strengthen our efforts to help create disaster-resilient communities by using this system.

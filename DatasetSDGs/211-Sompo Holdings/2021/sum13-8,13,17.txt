Strategies
Climate change brings not only risks such as the intensification of natural disasters, but also business opportunities such as changes in the industrial structure and new technological innovations caused by the transition to a decarbonized society. The Group is engaged in risk management in our P&C insurance business through stress tests and scenario analysis, and we are also working to provide products and services by considering the various changes associated with climate change to be business opportunities.

The Groupâ€™s P&C insurance business has inherent risks of being affected by the intensification of natural disasters resulting from climate change, and we are working on measures including analysis using climate scenarios.
We conduct stress tests for such risks as windstorms and floods and quantitatively assess the financial impact of the stress scenarios that have a material impact on management if materialize, to verify the adequacy of capital and the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures.
Since 2018, we have been conducting large-scale analysis of typhoons and heavy rains using weather and climate big data from the Database for Policy Decision-making for Future Climate Change (d4PDF).*1 Based on this analysis, we are working to quantify changes in the average trends of natural catastrophes and trends in the occurrence of extreme weather events under climate conditions when temperatures rise by 2oC and 4oC over the medium to long-term.
In the future, we will continue to analyze the impact of climate change using the scenario analysis framework prepared by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which studies financial supervisory response to climate change risks.
The Group participates in the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) insurance working group of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). We are also estimating the impact of typhoons using a simple quantitative model*2 based on the comprehensive guidance published by the working group in January 2021.

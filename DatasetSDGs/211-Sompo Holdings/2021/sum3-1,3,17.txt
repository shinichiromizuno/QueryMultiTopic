We established the Future Care Lab in Japan in February 2019 as a place to demonstrate, experiment, and develop various technologies aimed at shrinking the supply-demand gap of nursing care personnel by increasing productivity through the use of digital technologies and ICT. The lab has conducted joint research and development that combines technologies from startup companies, major manufacturers, and research institutions with the know-how of the Sompo Group, and has evaluated and verified over 350 technologies since its establishment (as of the end of fiscal 2020). In the verification process, the lab not only evaluates the performance, but also the safety, quality of care, and workload reduction of nursing care personnel. As a result, 10 technologies have been implemented in the Sompo Group’s nursing care fascilities as of the end of fiscal 2020.
In addition, in fiscal 2020, the company was selected as
a Living Lab in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare’s Living Platform Creation Project, and is working to contribute to the development of society by supporting companies that wish to evaluate nursing care robot products under development and verify them in nursing care fascilities, as well as planning and implementing pitch contests for start-up companies.

Identifying businesses and sectors that adversely affect the environment and society to utilize the results in insuring, investing and financing
The Group identifies businesses and sectors that may adversely affect the environment and society through the destruction of nature and human rights violations, and is building a database through dialogue with stakeholders and our own unique analysis for use in insuring and in investment and financing decisions.
Insuring, investment and financing restriction policy for coal­fired power plants (first among P&C insurance companies in Japan)
In September 2020, Sompo Japan announced that it would be the first P&C insurance company in Japan not to insure, invest or finance the construction of new coal-fired power plants, which are feared to accelerate climate change. We believe dialogue with stakeholders to be an important opportunity to develop the Group’s business and so, going forward, we will continue to grasp the expectations and demands on the Group through such dialogue, and contribute to societal transformation by promoting initiatives to decarbonize the industry.

ESG initiatives by Sompo Asset Management
Sompo Asset Management participates in Climate Action 100+, an initiative led by institutional investors that collaboratively promotes engagement activities, and actively encourages investment portfolio companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare long-term plans. In September 2017, the company became a signatory to the Montréal Carbon Pledge, which is overseen by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The company regularly calculates and discloses greenhouse gas emissions per 10,000 beneficial interest units of the Japan Value Equity Sustainable fund, which is focused on long-term investment, overall fund emissions and the weighted average carbon intensity of the fund.

Thirty years of environmental education initiatives

Business alliance with Palantir Technologies Inc. and Palantir Technologies Japan for the utilization of real data
To provide new solutions by utilizing the large amount of high-quality real data held by the Sompo Group, we decided to form a business alliance consisting of three companies: Sompo Holdings, Palantir Technologies Inc. (hereinafter “Palantir”), and Palantir Technologies Japan K.K., which
was established last year as a joint venture with Palantir Technologies Inc. Palantir is comprised of the world’s best data analysis professionals, and its founders have a philosophy that “superior technology should be used to make the world and people happy.” The Sompo Group shares this philosophy and is convinced that it is necessary to work hand in hand with partners like Palantir to create new value to further the growth of the Group. By combining Palantir’s technology with the Sompo Group’s valuable real data, we will develop a Real Data Platform (RDP) to provide new solutions and further refine the Group’s problem-solving capabilities.

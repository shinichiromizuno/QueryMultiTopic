Strengths, Opportunities and Risks
As Japan’s population continues to grey, we need to shift
our stance from treating diseases to one focused on preven- tive healthcare so that illnesses do not develop in the first place. In this environment, and guided by the thinking that life insurance should offer not only coverage for the unexpected events, but also support to prevent illness and to help people live longer, we have continued to transform ourselves into a health support enterprise with the goal of helping the people of Japan live long and energetic lives by providing new value of Insurhealth®—a product that offers traditional insurance coverage combined with healthcare support functions.
In the first half of the previous Mid-Term Management Plan, we launched a health support service brand called
Products and services to

• Payment of benefits when falling ill
• Payment of benefits in the unlikely event of an accident or death

Linkx and kicked off initiatives aimed at connecting with, and supporting the health of, customers outside of the insurance domain. Also, the eight Insurhealth® products, in- cluding online-only products, that we launched in fiscal 2018 had grown to account for roughly 60% of all new contracts by fiscal 2020.
In addition, to improve discontinuous productivity, we have pushed ahead with initiatives unshackled from preconceived ideas, including HR system reforms and the concentration of branch office work at the head office.
These initiatives helped adjusted profit reach an all-time high of ¥33.8 billion in fiscal 2020.

    Specific strategies in the new MTMP
1 Insurhealth -driven growth
Life insurance has traditionally played a complementary role
in the social insurance scheme by mitigating negative events and providing economic assistance. During the period of our previous Mid-Term Management Plan, so as to respond to changes in the environment enveloping our customers, we started offering more than just insurance coverage by sup- porting efforts to extend healthy life expectancies and provide unprecedented new value in the form of Insurhealth®, including wealth management services that deliver positive contributions to people’s lives. This will serve as the driving force behind our plan to shore up growth by unearthing new customers.
Toward an age of Insurhealth® in which insurance makes people healthy
Anybody
(diverse methods)
• A hybrid sales style that uses both real and digital tools
• Encourage middle-aged and senior employees to play active roles
Anywhere
(work not limited by location)
• Free address office
• HQ work done online by
employee living in the countryside (HQ anywhere system)
®
® For example, premiums for the first Insurhealth
product “Jibun to Kazoku no Omamori (Protection for you and your
 family),” which went on sale in April 2018, have become cheaper mainly because of improvements in the health of our customers and this product has the added benefit of a refund equivalent to the amount of difference with the cost of premi- ums in the past. As a result, roughly 230 new customers every month are taking steps to improve their health.
This kind of new value goes beyond the boundaries of con- ventional insurance to encourage people to stay healthy and we will utilize digital technology to further enhance it, further evolve our Insurhealth® lineup, and accelerate growth.

And in terms of product development, we will control growth
in interest rate risk by holding mostly protection-type products in our portfolio.
Owing to the fact that long-term policies are key in the life insur- ance business, we will pursue a business structure with which we can continue to protect customers in a stable and sustained manner irrespective of changes in the operating environment.
To that end, we will reduce interest rate risk by expanding our

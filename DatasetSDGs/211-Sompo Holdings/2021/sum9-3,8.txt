Improve engagement and wellbeing
The Sompo Group aims to contribute to creating a sustainable society by placing even greater importance on the happiness at work of its employees, who are among its multi-stakeholders, along with the interests of its customers and shareholders. In addition, we are working to improve engagement and wellbeing, as we believe that increasing the satisfaction and happiness of each employee is the driving force behind high productivity. In the employee engagement survey conducted in fiscal 2020, we received responses from over 23,000 employees at 33 companies (21 in Japan and 12 overseas) across the Sompo Group. Furthermore, from fiscal 2021, we have newly set employee engagement as a KPI for the entire Sompo Group. We aim to further improve engagement and wellbeing by developing various measures aimed at promoting and fulfilling the Sompo Group’s Purpose, and through measures for work-style reform and initiatives linked to promoting health and productivity management.
Promoting health and productivity management
The Sompo Group Health & Productivity Management Declaration formulated in September 2020 is a Group-wide policy that incorporates three key aspects of health and productivity management: (1) embodying the Sompo Group Management Philosophy, (2) improving productivity, and (3) enhancing corporate value. Based on this policy, we are promoting initiatives with a focus on three areas including maintaining and improving employee health, ensuring a vibrant work environment, and data health.
Sompo Holdings has been selected as a Health & Productivity Stock in 2021 for the third consecutive year by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a company that excels in health and productivity management. In addition, 20 Sompo Group companies have been recognized under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organizations Recognition Program.The Sompo Group Health & Productivity Management Declaration

In May 2021, we invested in MPower Partners Fund L.P. (hereinafter “MPower”), the first ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) focused venture capital fund in Japan. The fund aims to support entrepreneurs aiming to solve social issues with the power of technology and promote sustainable growth by integrating ESG into their strategies. The key investment areas are the healthcare and wellness, fintech, next-generation workstyle and education, next-generation consumers, and environment and sustainability domains.
Through our investment in the fund, we will contribute
to the sound development of financial markets and society as a whole by supporting startups with growth potential to achieve sustainable growth by implementing ESG into society. In addition, we will accelerate the Sompo Group’s SDGs in Business Management to create both social and economic value through future-oriented dialogue while actively engaging with the stakeholders participating in the fund.

Sompo Holdings has concluded an agreement on comprehensive mutual cooperation with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (hereinafter “AIST”), one of the largest research institutes in Japan, in order to solve social issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population and the challenges associated with the new normal by leveraging expertise in our own respective fields. The purpose of this agreement is to
  contribute to the growth of the Japanese economy through the effective promotion of joint research and the social implementation of its results.
We provide the business model and the data we possess, and AIST scientifically analyzes and verifies their value. In addition, both parties aim to build a platform for creating new customer value and solutions by forming an ecosystem involving the national government, local governments, and businesses.
The first step will be to develop and standardize methods for assessing nursing care quality, and to develop methods for efficiently grasping the actual state of the nursing care process, with the aim of contributing to solving the problems of our super-aging society, and eventually to disseminate this to the world as a security, health, and wellbeing solution coming from Japan.
We will continue to discuss and add to the agenda of social issues we face, domains of collaboration, and specific research as needed.

In collaboration with local environmental organizations, NPO support centers, and the Japan NPO Center, Sompo Japan Insurance has been carrying out the SAVE JAPAN Project, a nationwide annual biodiversity conservation activity involving public participation. By the end of fiscal 2020, we have held approximately 870 events with over 46,000 participants, using the cost savings gained from customers selecting web-based policy clauses and web-based insurance policy certificates when signing their contract and opting for recycled parts for repairs in the event of an automobile accident as the source of funds for our activities.
The Sompo Group supports the CSO Learning
Scholarship Program implemented by the SOMPO Environment Foundation, which provides internship experiences at CSOs (Civil Society Organizations: a term that describes civil society organizations, including NPOs and NGOs) in the environmental field for university and graduate students. A total of 1,167 students have completed this pro- gram as of the end of fiscal 2020, and we launched a similar program in Jakarta, Indonesia, in February 2019.

In Sustainability (SSP1) scenario, which harmonizes the environment and the economy, a certain level of economic development underpins the effective implementation of climate action, renewable energy and new technological development progresses, and new insurance needs are expected to increase. The Group advances initiatives to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to mitigation of climate change by encouraging switching to and expanding the use of renewable energy.

Group initiatives to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions
In April 2021, we announced a greenhouse gas emission reduction policy, which aims to achieve net zero by 2050. We are working toward a goal of 60% reduction in 2030 (compared to 2017) by promoting measures such as switching
to renewable energy as a source of electricity used by the Group. We are also undertaking initiatives to reduce emissions in collaboration with stakeholders, aiming for net zero emissions in the value chain, including at investment portfolio companies.

ONE SOMPO WIND Services for wind power generation companies
In addition to providing P&C insurance products, we capitalize on the know-how acquired through joint research with universities, research institutions, and other stakeholders to roll out a risk management service that comprehensively covers the value chains of wind power generation businesses. The service targets all phases of wind power generation projects, from project formation and operational start-up through to subsequent removal or replacement.

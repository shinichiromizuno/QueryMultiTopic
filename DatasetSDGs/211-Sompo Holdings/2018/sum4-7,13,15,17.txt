Promoting the Manageability of Global Environmental Issues
Rather than simply viewing climate change and other global environmental issues as risks, the Sompo Holdings Group goes a step forward to provide various solutions for addressing these issues. Examples of these solutions include insurance products and risk consulting services that cover the risks associated with meteorological disasters and renewable energy operations. We also seek to provide products and services that respond to and help alleviate climate change, contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, and promote eco-conscious action. At the same time, we are working together with stakeholders throughout all areas of our business, from upstream areas to downstream areas, to take the initiative in reducing environmental impacts across the value chain. In these ways, the Group is approaching global environmental issues as opportunities to create and grow new markets.
Another area of focus is promoting the resolution of global environmental issues. To this end, we carry out environmental preservation activities and provide opportunities for environmental education to raise interest in and awareness of the environment and thereby increase the number of individuals capable of exercising autonomy in addressing such issues. The Group also collaborates with research and government institutions to conduct research on global environmental issues and transmit the results throughout society.

The Group analyzes huge volumes of accident data (big data) it has accumulated over the years to develop new products and services that contribute to disaster preparedness. In addition, our expertise of risk quantification is utilized to formulate measures for preventing accidents and reducing the damage caused by natural disasters. We also promote disaster preparedness education to improve awareness as many people as possible with accurate disaster preparedness knowledge. Our goal through these efforts is to help combat disasters while reducing the occurrence of secondary disasters.

Empowering Communities and Society
The Sompo Holdings Group sees empowering communities and society as an important corporate responsibility to be fulfilled by identifying social issues through communication with communities and society by the Group and by individual employees. In collaboration with NPOs, NGOs, and various other stakeholders, we take part in various initiatives for fulfilling this responsibility. At the same time, frameworks have been put in place to support all employees in utilizing the skills cultivated through their work to participate in activities for addressing social issues.
We believe that active involvement in the resolution of social issues will help employees grow to be more keenly aware of social issues and thereby facilitate future efforts to address social issues on both a local and global scale. Moreover, we hope that our efforts to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society through the resolution of community and social issues will in turn enable the Sompo Holdings Group to earn greater trust from society while improving its brand value.

Safety and security
In its Group Vision, the Seibu Group has declared commitment to providing safe and comfortable services, with safety as the basis for each of businesses and services at all times. Accordingly, the Group places the highest priority on ensuring the safety and security of train passengers, facility users, and all other customers.
Specifically, the Group earmarks investments for upgrading train systems and facilities with the best available safety equipment. We also conduct onsite safety and emergency drills, and provides employees with training on basic safety and best practices. In these ways, the Group not only maintains the safety and reliability of railway, hotel, and other services, but also provides comfortable and secure environments for customers, whether they are travelers, hotel guests, shoppers, or business people.

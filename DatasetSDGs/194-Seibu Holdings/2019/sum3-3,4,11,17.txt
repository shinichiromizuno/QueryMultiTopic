Community engagement
Abiding by the principles set out in its Group Vision, the Seibu Group is committed to conducting business in an open and fair manner while paying close attention to feedback from customers and local residents. Acting as a member of the local community, the Group proactively collaborates within area and with civil groups as part of efforts to contribute to community development and environmental conservation.
 The Seibu Groupâ€™s railway services are deeply rooted in towns and cities throughout Japan, while hotels collaborate with local communities to attract tourists and real estate development business brings regional investment. From that basis, the Group works together with municipalities situated along railway lines to stimulate regional development. At the same time, the Group tailors services to address the needs of local populations, who are aging at a rapid rate, by making
services more convenient for the elderly and applying universal design to improve accessibility.

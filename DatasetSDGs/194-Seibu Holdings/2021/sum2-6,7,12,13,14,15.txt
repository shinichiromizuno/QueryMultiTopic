Having built up close ties with local communities and society through a wide range of businesses, including railways and hotels, the Group places a high priority on the consideration for the conservation of natural and local environments that will be the foundation for sustainable growth.
In addition to reducing the environmental impact from operations, such as making more efficient use of energy, the Seibu Group works to conserve the environment through business activities and actively communicate with stakeholders. In this way, the Seibu Group will achieve sustainable growth, while fulfilling the obligations of a good corporate citizen on all levels.
● Introducing energy-saving railway cars and equipment, such as Laview Limited Express trains and 40000-series commuter trains (which reduce annual electricity consumption by approximately 60% when compared with the trains that they replaced)
● Promoting renewable energy, such as solar (including solar sharing), hydroelectric, and geothermal power generation
● In addition to promoting energy savings in recently constructed office buildings, promote energy efficiency of all equipment,
including by introducing highly efficient heating systems, for instance by converting to LED lighting
● Reducing food waste by reviewing the size of purchased lots, providing education by putting up posters, and other programs to discourage having leftover food, as well as cutting back on portion sizes
● Contributing to a recycling-oriented society through such initiatives as promoting LOSS TO VALUE, transferring to other companies the railway cars that have been retired or replaced, and making more effective use of wood from tree pruning
● Restricting the volume of tap water by using well water and by reusing wastewater and rainwater
● Supporting water quality programs by donating to local governments that extract groundwater
● Working to protect and expand green spaces through measures such as the management by the Seibu Group of a forest in the Hanno region in cooperation with the local government and civic organizations
● Promoting the banning of plastic straws and disposable plastic bags with the aim of reducing the plastic waste thought to have a negative effect on marine life and ecosystems

  ■ The Seibu Group renewable energy
All over Japan, the Seibu Group uses renewable energy, including energy generated by solar power, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. On April 1, 2021, the Seibu Railway Yamaguchi line (the Leo Liner) began using electricity generated by the Seibu Takeyama Solar Power Station for all of its requirements, effectively reducing the previous 300 metric tons or so of annual CO2 emissions to zero. This is the first time in Japan* that all trains on one line, for year-round operations, have used electricity with non-fossil fuel certificates coming from inhouse solar power.
■ Promoting the LOSS TO VALUE Concept
In September 2020, we began the LOSS TO VALUE project, intended to convert every loss into value. As part of these initiatives, we repurposed cigarette vending machines, which had become surplus to our needs in December 2020, by using them to sell powdered tea in stick form in boxes designed to reflect the local area under the Chabacco brand on stations along the Seibu and Izuhakone Railways. As a new approach to selling souvenirs during the COVID-19 pandemic, this initiative supports producers in every region and helps to invigorate local communities. It also helps people to rediscover the area by conveying information on new regional attractions.

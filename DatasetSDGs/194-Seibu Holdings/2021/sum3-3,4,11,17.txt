Community Engagement
WEB https://www.seibuholdings.co.jp/en/sustainability/communication/     The Seibu Group is working to revitalize local regions through public transportation operations in collaboration with local communities, and by committing to regional economies by promoting hotel and real estate businesses in cooperation with the governments along and around our railway lines. We take the falling birth rate and the aging population as one of the social issues and also are actively applying Universal Design (UD).

■Initiatives in Chichibu (Chichibu Model / traditional farmhouse hotels)
The Seibu Group has increased the number of initiatives that focus on the Chichibu region, a well-known tourist area with good access from central Tokyo, surrounded by nature and blessed with abundant historical and cultural assets. In March 2021, the city of Chichibu announced a program to leverage smart mobility and to help implement a project called the Chichibu Model that blends everyday living, transportation, and logistics. Nine organizations are participating in the project, including Seibu Holdings, Seibu Railway, and Seibu Kanko Bus. The Chichibu region has many places between mountains, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the social infrastructure for day-to-day life or following a natural disaster.
While cooperating with the other participating organizations, the Company will work in the fields of MaaS and mixed transportation of passengers and freight, being responsible for building part of a business model that optimizes and streamlines the movement of people and goods.
Further, we are participating in a project to restore some of the old farmhouses that dot the Chichibu area, and use them as hotels and restaurants, thus stimulating tourist demand in the region.

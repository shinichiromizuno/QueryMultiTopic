[Partnership with Allm]
In March 2021, Seibu Holdings entered into a business partnership with Allm Inc. Using the health and medical ICT solutions provided by Allm will allow us to work together on the development of a range of projects for the post-COVID-19 “new normal.” We have implemented some of these initiatives: opening dedicated PCR clinics in the Shinjuku Prince Hotel and on the concourse at Ikebukuro Station; deploying PCR testing at weddings and MICE events; and introducing infection countermeasures at baseball games before spectators enter the MetLife Dome, the Saitama Seibu Lions stadium.
■ Ensuring operational safety
We implement programs to ensure the safety of transportation and food to enable customers to enjoy the Group’s properties with comfort.
・Reducing accidents at railway crossings by promoting the continuous grade separation
project on Seibu rail lines and by applying safety measures on station platforms, such as installing doors on platforms and setting up detection systems to prevent people from falling into the gap between the platform and the train
・Implementing hygiene control at Prince Hotels following the internationally recognized HACCP approach, and implementing initiatives for food education to ensure food safety
■ Disaster countermeasures, preparations for accidents and emergencies
With natural disasters caused by climate change occurring more frequently, the Group is cooperating with local governments and improving disaster prevention programs such as drawing up disaster plans for facilities that we own, with the aim of contributing to safer and more secure communities.
・We periodically hold BCP training exercises on the Seibu Railway and elsewhere to ensure the safety of customers and employees in the
event of a major natural disaster, and to restore operations as quickly as possible
・In preparation for disasters, we have set up emergency food warehouses, emergency power supplies, and space for anyone having
difficulty returning home, at facilities such as DaiyaGate Ikebukuro, Tokyo Garden Terrace Kioicho, and Grand Emio Tokorozawa ・We have drawn up railcar evacuation plans for the Izuhakone Railway      Basic Policy

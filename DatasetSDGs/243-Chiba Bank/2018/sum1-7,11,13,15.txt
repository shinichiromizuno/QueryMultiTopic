Environment
Viewing global warming and other environmental problems as important issues to address, the Chiba Bank strives to counter global warming by the measure of reducing CO2 emissions through its business activities while encouraging efforts to beautify and greenify local communities.
Contributions to the Environment through Core Businesses
The Chiba Bank provides broad support to customers taking advantage of renewable energy. In December 2017, we redoubled the efforts in this regard by putting together project financing for a biomass power genera- tion project.
The Group’s securities subsidiaries of the banks
in the TSUBASA Alliance jointly sell Green Bonds issued by the World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) in Indian rupees, with the Chiba Bank acting as an intermediary in the sale of these financial instruments. (Chibagin Securities’ total sales of Green Bonds amounted to ¥2,611 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.)
Forest Management Activities
We continuously conduct “Chibagin Forest” forest management activities in various locations throughout Chiba Prefecture. The activities aim to regenerate coastal barrier forests that have been lost to insect damage and tsunami. The Bank’s directors, employees and former employees volunteer regularly in forest nurturing activities such as cutting the underbrush.
During the fifth “Chibagin Forest” event in May 2018, 5,000 saplings were planted. (These included Japanese black pine and Japanese spindle trees.)
Environmentally Friendly Branches
The Chiba Bank has been installing solar power sys- tems at new or relocated branches in a bid to cut CO2 emissions and help preserve the natural environment. As of June 30, 2018, a total of 23 branches have solar panels and solar lighting outdoors. At the headquarters and sales branches, we have 80 electric and hybrid vehicles in our fleet.

 Work style innovation
In order for us to increase our corporate competitiveness, it is vital to transition to workstyles with a strong awareness of time, and with high added value and productivity. Furthermore, we recognize that it is important to achieve work-life balance if we are to have an active, diverse work force.
Therefore, with our basic concept of work style innovation, which is to build a win-win relationship between employees and the company to enable employees to work with a firm sense of fulfillment and produce results, it is our aim that each and every person will fulfill their own roles and produce results in the limited time.
In fiscal 2019, we held a company-wide workstyle reform lecture meeting and invited a world renowned instructor to give a lecture on tips for improving individual strengths based on the idea that enhancing the skills of each and every employee is essential in order to shift to higher productivity work styles. We also implemented hands-on, participation-based time management training to give employees opportunities for improving their own work styles and learning about methods and approaches for increasing productivity.
In order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma recommends the use of teleworking and staggered onsite work systems and has
implemented improvements to the network environment to support teleworking. Going forward, we will pursue even more flexible and high productivity work styles and aim to continue to create workplace environments where employees can exercise their full capabilities and achieve a work-life balance.

Achieving work-life balance
At Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, we consider that it is essential for all employees to pursue transformation and to generate innovative ideas in order to continue achieving our Corporate Mission. To this end, we believe that it is necessary to create an environment conducive to exercising one’s full capacities while effecting a positive cycle connecting work and personal lifestyles for every employee. We have been implementing full-scale work style innovation initiatives since 2017. As part of this, we believe that the presence of “Ikuboss” supervisors, who encourage their subordinates in both their careers and their broader lives, is extremely important in order to balance improving corporate competitiveness with achieving work-life balance.
In fiscal 2019, as the highest level of “Ikuboss,” members of the HR Strategy Meeting* experienced the “Ikuboss Omurice (Japanese rice omelette topped with ketchup) Cooking Event,” and the event was reported to

Environmental management
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma uses energy, water resources, and a variety of chemical substances for R&D and for manufacturing products. The shutdown of operations, administrative penalties, or damage to social trust due to the occurrence of a serious environmental problem or an increase in expenses for environmental protection due to responding to new environmental issues could have a serious impact on operating results. On the other hand, initiatives such as reducing energy costs and the recycling of waste into valuable resources as well as the creation of products that contribute to solving environmental issues are business opportunities that help to make a positive financial impact. Under our Basic Environmental Policies, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma formulates a three-year Mid-term Environmental Plan and an Annual Implementation Plan. We evaluate initiatives at the Environmental and Safety Committee and respond appropriately to risks and opportunities, thereby leading to the enhancement of corporate value.
Contributing to building a low-carbon society
As part of our efforts to build a low-carbon society, which is one of our most important topics in the Mid-term Environmental Plan, we have set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 23% by fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2005. As of fiscal 2019, we had reduced emissions by 34%. In particular, in recent years, we have systematically promoted the installation of LED lighting, and we have also been working to calculate greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain. In addition, we are aiming to obtain Science Based Targets (SBT) certification for our fiscal 2030 GHG emission reduction target during fiscal 2020.

Identifying risks and opportunities
In light of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and concerns about global water risk, we will analyze the identified risks and opportunities related to climate change and water. We conducted risk surveys on water risk, including water supply and demand (current and future) and vulnerabilities in downstream environments, at our main sites in fiscal 2019, which we will analyze going forward.

Boundary of calculation: Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. facilities in Japan only (plants, research laboratories, distribution centers, Osaka Head Office, Tokyo Head Office, branches and business offices). Water withdrawal, total amount of water discharged, and waste excludes branches and business offices. Methods of Calculation and Emissions Intensity, etc.
*1 (Purchased electricity × unit calorific value + purchased heat × unit calorific value + fuel consumption × unit calorific value) × 0.0258 kl/GJ
The unit calorific values and the types of fuel to be calculated are based on “Act on the Rational Use of Energy.” However, when the unit calorific values of
electricity and heat for sites located on the premises of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. are provided by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., those values are used.
*2 Fuel consumption × fuel unit calorific value × fuel CO2 emissions factor
The unit calorific values and CO2 emissions factors are based on “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclosure System” which is provided in “Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures.”
*3 Purchased electricity × electricity CO2 emissions factor#1 + purchased heat × heat CO2 emissions factor#2
Notes: #1 The value (0.33 t-CO2 / thousand kWh) which The Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations of JAPAN has adopted to manage
the progress of its CO2 reduction target
#2 The values based on “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclosure System” which is provided in “Act on Promotion of
Global Warming Countermeasures.” However, we use values provided by Sumitomo Chemical Co, Ltd. for sites located on the premises of
Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.
*4 The amount of water withdrawal from tap water, industrial water, ground water, and other.
*5 Total amount of water discharged into sewerage and public water bodies and so on. As the amount of water discharged is not measured at each facility,
the total amount of water discharged is considered to be equivalent to the total amount of water withdrawal.

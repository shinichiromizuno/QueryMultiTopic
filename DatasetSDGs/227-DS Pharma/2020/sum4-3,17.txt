Research Foundation
Established to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the former Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., the Japan Epilepsy Research Foundation (JERF) works to promote research on treatments in the field of epilepsy, while contributing to the health and healthcare of the public, and running on contributions from Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and other donors. The Foundation provides grants and commendations related to epilepsy. In fiscal 2019, JERF provided 12 research grants, two overseas study grants, and three Japan Epilepsy Research Grants for Inviting Overseas Researchers to Japan.
Advancing patient advocacy in the U.S.
During fiscal 2019, our U.S. subsidiary Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. continued to support the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) walks, while also expanding the Be Vocal partnership between six leading mental health advocacy organizations and Sunovion. Be Vocal is designed to empower people living with mental health conditions to speak up when talking with their support team and to encourage everyone to speak up as a community to advance mental health in America. Sunovion was also involved with Moving Day, a walk to support The Parkinson’s Foundation mission in the U.S., and implemented initiatives to support Epilepsy Awareness and COPD Awareness Months.

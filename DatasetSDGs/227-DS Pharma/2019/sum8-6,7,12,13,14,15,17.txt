Environmental Management
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma recognizes its environmental responsibility and strives to reduce environmental impact in all areas of its business operations.
The Basic Environmental Policies, established in fiscal 2005, express our objectives and initiatives to realize and have served as a pillar for promoting all our environmental activities since they were established. Under the Basic Environmental Policies, we formulated a Mid-term Environmental Plan that specifies issues of special importance and objectives for three years.
In addition, every year we draft an Annual Implementation Plan. This way, we ensure that our environmental activities are systematic and effective.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma has acquired ISO 14001 certification at both of its two plants (Suzuka Plant and Oita Plant).
Contributing to Building a Low-carbon Society
As part of our efforts to build a low-carbon society, which is one of our most important topics, we have set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 23% by fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2005. As of fiscal 2018, we had reduced emissions by 28%. In particular, in recent years, we have systematically promoted the installation of LED lighting, and we have also been working to calculate greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain. In addition, by fiscal 2030 we will reduce CO2 emissions by at least 30% compared to fiscal 2017, and we are reviewing specific reduction rates with the aim of acquiring SBT (Science Based Targets) certification by fiscal 2020.
Promoting Environmental Communication
In fiscal 2018 following on initiatives from fiscal 2017, we participated in verification for the “Environmental Reporting Platform Development Pilot Project - ESG Dialogue Platform” of
Japanese Ministry of the Environment, and engaged in active dialogue with institutional investors. Through this dialogue, we aim to identify and put into practice even better environmental activities which contribute to the preservation of the global environment at the same time as enhancing our value.

Methods of Calculation and Emissions Intensity, etc.
*1 (Purchased electricity × unit calorific value + purchased heat × unit calorific value + fuel consumption × unit calorific value) × 0.0258 kl/GJ
The unit calorific values and the types of fuel to be calculated are based on “Act on the Rational Use of Energy.” However, starting in fiscal 2018, when the unit calorific values of electricity and heat for sites located on the premises of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. are provided by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., those values are used.
*2 Fuel consumption × fuel unit calorific value × fuel CO2 emissions factor
The unit calorific values and CO2 emissions factors are based on “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclosure System” which is provided in “Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures.”
*3 Purchased electricity × electricity CO2 emissions factor#1 + purchased heat × heat CO2 emissions factor#2
Notes:#1 The value (0.33 t-CO2 / thousand kWh) which The Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations of JAPAN has adopted to manage the
progress of its CO2 reduction target
#2 The values based on “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Accounting, Reporting, and Disclosure System” which is provided in “Act on Promotion of Global
Warming Countermeasures.” However, we use values provided by Sumitomo Chemical Co, Ltd. for sites located on the premises of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. (Ehime Plant only until fiscal 2017 and all sites from fiscal 2018)

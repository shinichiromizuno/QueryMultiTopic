In February 2019, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma was recognized for the third year in a row under the “Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organizations 2019 Recognition Program ‘White 500’” promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Nippon Kenko Kaigi for our excellent health management as a large enterprise in coordination with health insurance societies.
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma treats health management for employees as one of the key issues of corporate management. In October 2017, we formulated our Declaration of Health Innovation, and we have taken concrete measures aimed at maintaining and promoting the health of our employees and their families. In
particular, we have been implementing company-wide efforts on smoking cessation advice for some time as an activity aimed at achieving zero smokers among our employees, which we set as a specific initiative in our Declaration of Health Innovation. We have been promoting even more effective efforts by clearly stating our goals in the Declaration of Health Innovation, and we made all of our work sites in Japan completely no-smoking (closed smoking areas) as of March 31, 2019.

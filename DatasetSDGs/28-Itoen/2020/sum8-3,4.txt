Strategies and Initiatives for Creating Value
   Procurement
ITO EN ensures stable procurement of high-quality raw materials and contributes to the development of sustainable agriculture in Japan, by producing high-quality ingredients through collaboration with produc- ers and building strong relationships based on harmonious coexistence and mutual prosperity.

General Manager, Agricultural Technology Department
ITO EN develops optimal raw materials according to the purpose or way in which tea is to be consumed, such as green tea for use with a traditional teapot kyusu or in green tea beverage products. In the Tea-Producing Region Development Project—which we have worked on over many years—we work with producers to create tea cultivation methods to match the purpose of use, and achieve stable procurement of high-quality raw materials and product differentiation. We also contribute to stable tea planta- tion management and effective use of abandoned farmlands by sharing our proprietary technologies and know-how with producers, and adopting a cultivation under contract approach whereby we purchase the full amount of tea leaves produced.
 Processes for Creating Shared Value (CSV)
 Originality and Strengths
Crude tea procurement capabilities accounting for around a quarter of all crude tea produced in Japan
Stable procurement of high-quality tea leaves and cost reductions through initiatives such as the Tea-Producing Region Development Project
Improving product quality, differentia- tion from other companies and estab- lishment of traceability through the development of tea made from special- ized raw materialsEnvironmental (E) and Social (S) Initiatives
Stable and sustainable farm management that is not influenced by market prices
Effective use of abandoned farmlands (new tea plantations business), creation of employment opportunities Environmentally-friendly agriculture through appropriate fertilizer application, etc.
Advancing GAP certification’s acquisitionSustainable competitive advantage
Promoting sustainable agriculture
 Main Initiatives to Secure a Sustainable Competitive Advantage and to Promote a Sustainable AgricultureEnhancing development and procurement of distinctive raw materials
Development of raw materials including tea leaves for specialized beverage use, tea leaves with suppressed amounts of caffeine, and raw materials of matcha meeting the overseas demand
Expanding plantations and production areas
Expanding new tea plantations business in the five prefectures of Kyushu region and in Shizuoka Prefecture, and expanding the Tea-Producing Region Development Project through efforts such as cultivation under contract in Shimane prefecture
Quality and safety
Conducting assessments of suppliers
· Conducting questionnaire-based assessments of suppliers and regular on-site visits based on the Group Procurement Policy
· Continuous improvement of quality through annual quality assurance meetings
· Conducting assessments of primary suppliers and quality assurance meetings once a year with regard to market procurement via wholesalers and trading companies
Advancing GAP certification’s acquisition
Almost all of tea plantations under the Tea-Producing Region Development Project have obtained GAP certification* (ITO EN plans to obtain certification for 100% of them during fiscal 2020)*GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) certifications are granted to farms that engage in food safety and environmental conservation initiatives. In addition to the Global GAP international standard, other schemes include JGAP and ASIAGAP, which are granted by the Japan GAP Foundation. GAP certification here refers to plantations that have obtained one of those three certifications.

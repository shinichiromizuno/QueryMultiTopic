Corporate Strategy
ITO EN Group Medium- to Long-Term
Environmental Goals
Based on its management principle of “Always Putting the Customer First”, the ITO EN Group believes that it is its corporate social responsibility to protect the global environment shared by all of humanity, and pass it on to the next generation. Global environ- mental problems such as the increase in intensely hot weather, floods and landslides as a result of climate change due to global warming, and the problem of marine plastic garbage are now pressing issues for global society.
These kinds of issues are also key issues in the ITO EN Group's business activities. In September 2020, we formulated the ITO EN Group Medium- to Long-Term Environmental Goals with regard to our containers and packaging, and our response to climate change, based on the ITO EN Group Environmental Policy. Through these goals, we are further driving our initiatives to tackle environmental problems, with the aim of contributing to the creation of a sustainable society.

  The CSR/ESG Promotion Committee (chaired by President & CEO Daisuke Honjo) keeps track of the actual state of issues relating to the environment, deliberates on policies, goals and strategic measures to respond to these issues, and reports to senior management (the Board of Directors and the Executive Board).
The ITO EN Group also sets KPIs within its environmental management system, based on the ISO14001 standard, to drive initiatives for achieving its environmental targets. So far, we have obtained certification for our production, sales, and head office divisions, and some of our affiliated companies*.
* In terms of affiliated companies, we have obtained certification for ITO EN Sangyo, Ltd., Okinawa ITO EN, Ltd. and Green Value Co., Ltd.

 Containers and packaging
The ITO EN Group is engaged in proactive efforts such as the development of technologies that contribute to creating more lightweight PET plastic bottles and reducing plastic usage, and introducing environmentally friendly paper containers.
At the same time, in September 2020, we developed the ITO EN Group Policy on Plastics, in an effort to tackle the challenges of transforming into a more environmentally friendly recycling-based society, against the backdrop of problems such as marine plastic garbage, climate change, and other problems which are now pressing issues for global society. By doing so, the ITO EN Group aims to contribute to the creation of a sustainable society by further driving initiatives aimed at achieving more effective utilization of resources and reducing environmental impact throughout the entire life cycles of the products that it sells.
 ITO EN Group Policy on Plastics
Recycling (circulation of resources)
∙ Aim to increase the ratio of recycled materials, including bio-derived materials, used as materials for producing PET bottles to 100% by 2030.
∙ We will promote the use of recycled materials for purposes other than PET bottle production.
∙ We will carry out activities to increase the recycling ratio in collaboration with governments, industry associations and business partners.
Reduce (resource-saving)
∙ We will change container designs and improve produc- tion methods with a view to continuously cutting the weight of containers and packages and reducing their consumption.
Initiatives to create lightweight containers and packaging
Replacing & Reusing (replacing with environmentally
friendly materials and reusable containers)
∙ We will increasingly use bio-derived materials and biodegradable materials.
∙ We will encourage food and drink businesses to switch to reusable containers.
Clean (environmental conservation)
∙ We will encourage sorted collection of plastic waste for effective use of plastic resources, take part in cleanup and other social contribution activities and provide constant support for environmental conservation activities at different locations.
  ITO EN is seeking to reduce the weight of its PET plastic bottles—which account for a large portion of its containers and packaging— through the development of more environmentally friendly PET plastic bottles.

 Corporate Strategy
Response to climate change
CO2 emissions reduction targets
In September 2020, the ITO EN Group highlighted responding to climate change as one of its most important issues, and
set the targets of reducing overall CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 26% and emission intensity for Scope 3 by 26%,
in comparison with FY2018 levels, by FY2030. We also set the targets of reducing overall CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 50% and emission intensity for Scope 3 by 50%, in comparison with FY2018 levels, by FY2050.
So far, we have worked to reduce emissions through efforts such as introducing environmentally friendly bottle-filling systems at beverage production plants, modal shift, promotion of eco-friendly driving of sales vehicles, and the proactive introduction of heat-pump vending machines. ITO EN has adopted a fabless production method, in which it does not possess its own beverage production plants, and instead outsources production to external partners. We are therefore working with around 50 outsourced production plants in five regional blocks, engaging in more cooperative efforts than ever before with a view to achieving our emission reduction targets for FY2030.

Main initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions
 Scope 3 Category 1 (purchased products and services) Category 4 (transportation and delivery (upstream))
Based on the ITO EN Group Policy on Plastics, ITO EN aims to ensure that 100% of materials used in its PET plastic bottles are recyclable materials*1 by 2030. By using recyclable materials, we can expect to see major benefits in terms of reducing CO2 emissions in comparison with virgin plastics.
In addition, the introduction of the NS System*2 room- temperature aseptic filling method developed in collaboration with Toyo Seikan Co., Ltd. in 2010 is achieving reductions in water usage and energy consumption during production.
We have also successfully developed PET plastic bottles that are around 30% lighter than previous designs, contributing to more lightweight products overall and reductions in energy consumption during transportation.
Moving forward, we will continue working to achieve effective use of resources and reduce CO2 emissions throughout product life cycles through cooperation with suppliers.

  Commencing Climate Scenario Analysis
 Analysis of impact on tea leaves
ITO EN procures around one quarter of the total volume of crude tea produced in Japan as raw materi- als for its mainstay products. We therefore recognize the possibility that the effects of climate change on tea leaves and harvest volumes could have a major impact on our business operations, and have conducted cli- mate change scenario analyses using the Aqua Crop model*1. We selected RCP scenarios*2 from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), and conducted both quantitative and qualita- tive analyses of the impact of climate change on tea leaf harvest volume and quality by tea tree variety and picking season under the conditions of each scenario
in major tea producing regions in Japan (the Kyushu region and Shizuoka Prefecture).
Results
Although there were variations by production region, it was found that tea leaf harvest volumes would increase
Harvest volume simulation results
by around 4–7% for
RCP2.6, around 14–23%
for RCP4.5, around 29–36%
for RCP6.0, and around 41–54% for RCP8.5.
In our qualitative analysis—based on various research monographs, articles and other related scien- tific literature—it was found that there was a risk that various exotic pests and disease-inducing bacteria would move northward causing a negative impact on the growth and quality of tea trees. However, we are also taking proactive measures against pests, such as by introducing machinery which uses wind and water to blow away pests at some of our contracted produc- tion areas.
Looking ahead, we will continue to conduct inde- pendent and scenario-based analyses; and to develop new production sites, cultivation management methods and technologies in collaboration with tea farmers based on the results of these analyses.

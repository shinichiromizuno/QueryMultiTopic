Used Tea Leaves Recycling System
 The used tea leaves output by production plants contain large quantities of moisture. ITO EN’s Used Tea Leaves Recycling System prevents the used tea leaves from putrefying and enables their storage, transportation and use as a raw material for industrial products.
In addition to benefits such as deodorizing and antibacte- rial action, used tea leaves are also excellent in terms of resource utilization and environmental aspects, such as in helping to reduce the amount of raw materials used to pro- duce products, and in technologies for fixing the CO2 absorbed by tea trees in various products. So far, ITO EN has developed over 100 types of products made from recycled

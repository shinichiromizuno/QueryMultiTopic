GTL fuel is a replacement for diesel
fuel. Derived from natural gas, it is
a cleaner fuel alternative with
reduced environmental impact.
With properties equivalent to
petroleum-derived products, it
emits approximately 8.5% less CO2
than diesel fuel. In addition, it is
colorless, odorless, non-toxic,
remains serviceable in temperatures
as low as −30°C, and has superior long-term storage stability compared with diesel fuel. Based on these advantages, demand is expected to increase. Itochu Enex began selling GTL fuel in the Chubu and Kansai regions of Japan in 2017, and expanded sales to the Kanto region in 2019.

▶ Reducing the Environmental Impact of Our Business Activities
Renewable Energy Business
The Group is making full use of its financial resources to promote the development of renewable energy. We own a variety of power generation facilities, including wind, hydro and solar power plants. We have been constructing a solar power plant in Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture since 2019, with operation scheduled to begin in FY2021. In addition, we plan to start operating a biomass power plant in Anan City, Tokushima Prefecture, in 2022.
In FY2020, we sold a solar power plant in Matsusaka City, Mie Prefecture, to Enex Infrastructure Investment Corporation, with Enex Asset Management Co., Ltd. as the asset manager.

Forays into untapped areas with environmental products, electric power and various energy sources
TERASEL SOLAR (Solar Power Rental Business for Self-Consumption)
In FY2020, we launched a business for
installing and renting solar power
generation systems for self-consumption
at the factories and commercial facilities
of corporate customers. By developing a rental business that requires no upfront user investment, we are helping to promote the adoption of solar power and reduce environmental impact. We have also launched the same business overseas, in Thailand.
Slop and Sludge Collection and Sale Business
We collect slop (wastewater after washing marine fuel tanks) and sludge (unburnt marine fuel) that have been disposed of as industrial waste, and extract and reuse useful petroleum resources from them.
Fly Ash Recycling Business
We are contributing to the circular economy by recovering and processing fly ash from spent coal and biomass fuels at thermal power plants, and recycling it for use as a roadbed material for asphalt roads, forest roads and other applications.

▶ Reducing the Environmental Impact of Our Business Activities
▶ Preserving Local Environments Water Resource Conservation
Recognizing water as an important resource, we are working to reduce our consumption and ensure appropriate treatment of water in accordance with the Group’s Environmental Policy and soil contamination management regulations. In addition to monitoring water use through our environmental management system, we aim to reduce the volume of water used year on year. At our local office in Thailand, a water- stressed region, we are working to conserve water through the same eco-office activities we implement in Japan.
Environmental Pollution Prevention and
Resource Recycling
Based on guidelines such as the Declaration of the Group Code of Conduct and the Group’s soil contamination prevention regulations, we are working to prevent or reduce our impact in terms of soil and environmental pollution, reduce emissions of air pollutants, and reduce and properly dispose of hazardous substances, various types of waste, and wastewater. In addition, in order to promote the sustainable use of resources in our supply chain, we recycle the coal ash from our coal-fired power into materials for sale, as well as contribute to the circular economy by recycling and reusing marine fuel waste.
Protection of Biodiversity
Our commitment to conservation of
the global environment in our
Environmental Policy includes our
commitment to the protection of
biodiversity. We recognize the
benefits afforded to us by
biodiversity in the form of
ecosystem services, and therefore
strive to minimize any negative
impact on biodiversity and
contribute to its conservation. In
addition, we have joined the
Biodiversity Minato Network to
participate in and disseminate
information on local biodiversity
conservation activities, and are
working to raise awareness of the
importance of biodiversity
throughout the Group. As one
initiative, in order to protect the red-crowned crane, which is designated as an endangered species, we are supporting a community project in Naganuma-cho, Hokkaido Prefecture.
Safety Enhancements
In reviewing the safety systems and revising the manuals of all Group companies, we focus on stepping up inspections and preventing accidents through the standardization and upgrading of safety management systems based on internal safety and maintenance standards.
   Energy-Saving and Greater Energy Efficiency
By installing low-power, wide-area (LPWA) network infrastructure for the meters of LP gas customers, we are saving labor in meter reading, as well as streamlining delivery operations through a system that utilizes IoT and AI. This will help us prepare for future labor shortages and unforeseen circumstances, as well as contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions. (As of March 31, 2021, installed at approximately 27% of the Group's total number of customers.) Group company Itochu Enex Home-Life Tohoku Co., Ltd. aims to achieve a 100% LPWA installation rate by the end of FY2021, and is striving to become a First Authorized LP Gas Distributor (Gold Safety Recognized Service Provider).
Supply Chain Environmental Training
As a Known Shipper under the revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy, we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from product shipping. Each year, we offer eco-driving courses taught by experts to representatives, dispatchers, and drivers at companies to which the Group subcontracts shipping. These courses promote safe driving practices aimed at reducing accidents to zero and support thorough eco-driving, covering such topics as turning off the engine when stopped, fuel-saving driving techniques, and anger management. They are making a positive contribution toward CO2 emission reductions throughout the entire supply chain. In FY2020, although we were unable to hold the actual event due to the impact of the pandemic, we distributed training materials on eco-driving to raise awareness.
Reducing CO2 at the Transport Stage
We are working with other companies in the industry and partner companies to promote the development of delivery networks and build efficient transportation networks.
Group-Wide Eco-Office Activities
The Act on the Rational Use of Energy stipulates a voluntary 1% year-on-year target for reduction in energy intensity, and the Itochu Enex Group continued to apply this target for its eco-office activities in FY2020. An environmental data collection system is used to objectively monitor the status of initiatives at each business location at all times, and quarterly progress inspections support goal achievement. In addition, we are promoting paperless operations through the use of IT during safety inspections and the Sumaho Kyuyu app at Car-Life Stations.

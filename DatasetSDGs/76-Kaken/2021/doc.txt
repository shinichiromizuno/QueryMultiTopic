Our Value Creation Story
A History of Value Creation
Maintaining a deep understanding of patient needs and continuously providing new treatment options
Since its establishment, KAKEN has refined its research technologies to quickly develop and provide products that patients genuinely need. With a desire to fully meet the needs of patients, we have synthesized compounds and commercialized products through our own development that are the first of their kind in Japan, or in some cases, the world. Moreover, we collaborate with overseas companies in joint research and clinical development.
Mentax (anti-trichophyton agent) launched
The world’s first topical anti-trichophyton agent in the benzylamine class. Won the Okochi Memorial Grand Production Prize for the development of butenafine hydrochloride, the active ingredient.
Clenafin (onychomycosis treatment) launched
The first topical agent in Japan for onychomycosis. Its active ingredient, efinaconazole, was discovered by KAKEN. Global sales are expanding through out-licensing to local companies in North America, Asia and Europe.
Hernicore (lumbar disc herniation treatment) launched
A lumbar disc herniation treatment. Provided a new option for hernia treatment that improves symptoms using an intradiscal injection.

    Our Track Record of Creating New Value
Founding Ideas
The origin of Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., can be traced back to the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Riken), which was established in 1917. In 1948, the Company started its business as Kagaku Kenkyusho. The Company’s first president, Yoshio Nishina, who was called the father of modern
physics in Japan, said that his mission was to apply basic scientific research and its findings to industry, and began the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals as a way of implementing theoretical research in business.
1948
Athletan (antifungal agent) launched
Developed following initial formulation in Japan involving an animal testing method for topical antifungal agents, this product became the foundation for current antifungal agent development.
1953
Brufen (anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agent) launched
With ibuprofen as the active ingredient, Brufen has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, making it applicable for a wide range of conditions, including arthralgia and arthritis, in addition to acute upper respiratory tract infection and the common cold.
1971
Launched Penicillin KAKEN
Using the technology of Riken, from which it originated, the Company began the manufacturing and sale of penicillin, which was needed by many patients at the time.
2001
        1993 1992
    1987
            Artz (anti-osteoarthritis agent) launched (1987) Artz Dispo launched (1993)
The world’s first intra-articular injection solution using hyaluronic acid as the main active ingredient. Improves symptoms including those of knee osteoarthritis and shoulder periarthritis, which are common conditions in the elderly.
Fiblast Spray (wound- healing agent) launched
A spray-on product for periodontal regeneration that promotes wound healing. Became a milestone in regenerative medicine.
Regroth (periodontal regenerative agent) launched
Began development with the idea that bFGF, the active ingredient in Fiblast, could potentially be a drug that regenerates periodontal tissue. Used in periodontal flap surgery, it is a safe periodontal regenerative agent.
Ecclock (primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment) launched
Provided Japan’s first external treatment option for hyperhidrosis, for which few options had been available.
       Advancing priority research themes through 2000s organizational improvements and concentration
of resources
 The Drug Research Center and the CMC Center have introduced state-of-the-art equipment and technologies and cooperate in the advancement of drug discovery research. KAKEN focuses its investments and human resources on R&D themes in fields where its experience, technologies and foundations can best be utilized—the immune system, the nervous system and infectious diseases. In FY2017, the Company entered into a collaborative research agreement with Switzerland-based Numab Therapeutics AG—which has a multispecific antibody technology platform—for the identification of a multispecific antibody candidate for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
Based on KAKEN’s belief that the foundation of research and development is people, the Company is promoting human resource development both in-house and externally. As part of that effort, the Company dispatches researchers to research institutions in Japan and abroad to sharpen their expertise, and strives to introduce the latest technologies and knowledge.
 KAKEN’s Technological Foundation
1940s Technologies developed by Riken form the roots of Kaken
Pharmaceutical
With its roots in Riken, which has made many contributions to modern science in Japan, KAKEN has provided medicines to meet the needs of the times based on its technological development capabilities. The Company applied Riken’s culturing techniques to commercialize penicillin, which had been attracting interest as a treatment specifically for pneumonia, an intractable disease at the time. KAKEN took the lead in penicillin production in Japan. Streptomycin, a specific treatment for tuberculosis, led to the development of a variety of fermented products.
1960s Growth driven by establishment of new research facilities and an
upgraded sales structure
Based on ideas from academia, KAKEN developed products from new viewpoints, including Japan’s first digestive enzyme preparation in capsule form and the world’s first oral anti- inflammatory enzyme preparation. The Company also applied its technologies to address social problems. In the case of Minamata disease for example, it successfully synthesized an antifungal agent to replace organic mercury compounds that were the primary medicines for athlete’s foot at the time. In the 1970s, the Company opened new research facilities, and built a system capable of adapting to increasingly stringent laws and regulations, and enhanced its sales capabilities. The Drug Research Center in Kyoto in particular was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and tools, enabling highly reliable safety testing (preclinical studies).
1990s Provided medicines of excellent quality in a drive to be “the best”
In the 1990s, KAKEN expanded its research and development investment and further improved its technologies. The Company became the first in the world to successfully synthesize and develop benzylamine-derived butenafine hydrochloride, which had a chemical structure completely different from that of existing athlete’s foot medicines. It grew into strategic global product Mentax. For Artz, which had been sold in an ampoule, the Company launched Artz Dispo, a kit product with a disposable pre-filled syringe, to reduce the risk of infection. Underpinning the Company at this time was its belief, set forth in the late 1980s, in striving to be “the best company, even if not the biggest.”

  Our Value Creation Story
  Our Business Model: The Source of Value Creation
 1 Involvement on the Frontlines of Healthcare in the Fields We Have Selected
KAKEN has focused on dermatology and orthopedics, backed by efforts to refine technologies and reinforce business operations. By concentrating our efforts in these fields,
we have been able to increase the quantity and quality of information we provide to medical professionals, which has helped us build strong relationships of trust with them. It also allows us to reflect the patient feedback that we obtain from medical professionals in new product development and formulation improvements. Our presence is also valued in surgery. For example, our medical representatives (MRs), whose job is to provide information on our pharmaceuticals and other products to medical professionals, go into operating rooms to explain how to use medical devices such as our anti- adhesion materials, and we contribute to perioperative care with adjuvant analgesics, treatments for skin ulcers after surgery, and other products. These initiatives are rare for a pharmaceutical company, and are one of KAKEN’s defining characteristics.
 Marketing & Sales
  As a market leader, KAKEN conducts disease awareness programs that broadly enlighten the public about diseases and treatment options. These activities can lead those suffering from a disease without knowing it to visit a medical facility and get treatment. In this way, our awareness program helps to contribute to patients’ quality of life.
4 A Solid Financial Foundation through Sound Management and Governance Improvements
 Capital Policy
2 In-house Drug Discovery and Global Sourcing
KAKEN has R&D infrastructure for delivering easy-to-use, distinctive new drugs to patients as quickly as possible. Our R&D staff conduct
 R&D and Business Development
 To sustainably create value, KAKEN maintains the transparency and soundness of its governance system through proactive measures to bring in outside perspectives. These include increasing the number of outside directors and establishing the Nomination and Compensation Committee. Moreover, the Company’s efficient organizational framework, with clear roles based on a simple business structure consisting of the pharmaceuticals and real estate segments, enables quick decision making. In this way, KAKEN is assuredly maintaining its business structure as an R&D-driven pharmaceutical company, and is building a solid financial foundation.

research and development based on evaluation and judgment capabilities that are backed by flexible inventiveness and scientific knowledge. In addition, we in-license products from domestic and overseas companies for development and marketing, and are active in joint research and joint development with other companies, including multinational clinical studies, as well as outsourcing. Another one of KAKEN’s strengths is its ability to develop business by in-licensing innovations not only from established pharmaceutical companies, but also from biotech startups.
We consider it our mission to pursue pharmaceuticals that solve medical issues,
regardless of the product’s sales volume. In addition to our stance and business structure for accomplishing that, our ability to identify and assess promising lead compounds and new technologies in Japan and overseas is another source of our value creation in drug discovery.
Taking further advantage of the properties of this active ingredient, we later created Regroth, a medicinal product for dental regeneration that we also out- license for the treatment of perforation of tympanic membrane, in the field of otorhinology. This ability to apply compound properties to the development of products in other areas is another one of our strengths.
We also use information that our MRs obtain from medical professionals in ideas for product formulations and packaging design. Since the launch of Artz, an anti-osteoarthritis agent, we have continued to make improvements that consider safety and ease of use to meet the needs of medical professionals. As a result, they continue to strongly support this product despite its more than 30 years on the market and the existence of generic versions.
 3 Leveraging Our Unique Insight to Create New Drugs ahead of Competitors
We deliver new value to medical professionals and patients by continuously identifying unmet medical needs, creating advanced new drugs, drawing up medical plans, generating evidence, and disseminating appropriate information. Clenafin, the first topical onychomycosis treatment launched in Japan, holds the top market share among topical onychomycosis treatments. We co-developed the brush with Pentel Co., Ltd. Having it built into the bottle enhances convenience for patients and reduces side effects. Ecclock, a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis, which causes abnormally excessive sweating, comes with an applicator that allows the gel to be applied without any hand contact, thereby lessening side effects.
Fiblast is a pioneering wound-healing agent in regenerative medicine that we developed based on an active ingredient in-licensed from overseas.

Our Value Creation Story
  Priority Issues
The KAKEN Group delivers value to society and contributes to achieving a sustainable society by practicing its corporate philosophy: “KAKEN helps improve the quality of life of patients by serving as many people as possible to return smiles of happiness to their faces, through supplying superior pharmaceuticals.” We believe that this will lead to the sustainable growth of the Group. In order to set out the challenges and initiatives in achieving this objective, we have identified priority issues related to the KAKEN Group’s future value creation.
Process of Identifying Priority Issues
To determine the priority issues to be addressed through KAKEN’s business activities, the Corporate Planning & Coordination Department and the General Affairs Department first identified social issues by taking into account, among other factors, the status of the Company’s business, management plans, GRI Standards, and ISO 26000.
Priority Issues
We identified and mapped social issues on two axes: “Relevance to KAKEN’s business“ and “Impact on stakeholders“ in order to narrow issues down to those with a high degree of importance. From these, we compiled priority issues, their associated risks, opportunities and main initiatives, taking into account KAKEN’s business philosophy.
Mapping of Priority Issues
h Relevance to KAKEN’s business
The items selected were deliberated by management and designated as priority issues for the KAKEN Group.
These priority issues will be reviewed in light of changes in the Company’s operating environment, progress of initiatives, and stakeholder opinions collected through dialogue.

Maximize the Value of Clenafin and New Products
 The targets we had set for FY2021, the final year of the plan, were net sales of ¥94.5 billion, operating profit of ¥25.0 billion and return on equity (ROE) of 12% or more. However, the decline in visits to medical facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and larger-than-expected drug price reductions made achievement of these targets difficult. Therefore, we revised these targets to net sales of ¥79.2 billion and operating profit of ¥18.8 billion.
With a view to overseas expansion, integrate actual marketing data in Japan and analyze market opportunities
Consider measures for maximizing value
Lenabasum (for systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis) → Expand to other intractable diseases, etc. Strengthen and Optimize Marketing Base
FY2020 in Review
In FY2020, we obtained approval for Ecclock Gel 5%, the first topical treatment in Japan for primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and launched it in November 2020. In the R&D pipeline, we are now preparing to advance Ivermectin Lotion, 0.5%, (KAR), a topical treatment for head lice, to Phase III, and to move BBI-4000, a treatment of primary palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, into Phase I as an additional indication for Ecclock Gel. We also formed a co-development and regional licensing agreement with Numab Therapeutics AG for development and commercialization in Japan and elsewhere in Asia of a novel multispecific antibody drug candidate for treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Our Strategy
  President’s Message
12 KAKEN Corporate Report 2021 KAKEN Corporate Report 2021 13
  Hiroyuki Horiuchi President and Representative Director
 We will continuously increase corporate value by applying KAKEN’s unique expertise to help patients live healthy lives,
both in body and mind.
 First, I would like to express my sympathies to everyone who has been affected by COVID-19, and my appreciation for the healthcare professionals and other essential workers who support society. While continuing to take all necessary measures to prevent the spread of infection, we will strive to create social value and increase our corporate value by putting our business philosophy of the “three joys” into practice.
Refine Our Strengths by Combining the Real and Digital Worlds
  In Medium-Term Business Plan 2021, which ends in March 2022, we are focusing on “establishment of foundations for sustainable growth,” and are continuing to carry out reforms to that end. In FY2020, however, results were impacted by various factors, including fewer visits by patients to medical facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reduction of NHI drug prices. While these certainly pose difficulties, we will continue working to improve the quality of life of patients through supplying superior pharmaceuticals. One of the highlights of FY2020 was the launch in November of Ecclock, Japan’s first topical treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We remain committed to addressing unmet medical needs.
Meanwhile, we are currently living in the age of VUCA, which stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Under such conditions, we will strive for sustainable growth going forward by further enhancing KAKEN’s strengths. Reflecting our roots in Riken, our employees are sincere and serious, and thoroughly pursue tasks in their areas of expertise. For example, we are known for our strong sales team. Our medical representatives
(MRs) go so far as to enter the operating room to explain the proper use of Seprafilm, a medical device, and work with doctors in considering the best way to apply the device for each operative method. Our MRs are committed to adapting to changes in the front lines of medicine, so they do more than simply provide drug information to medical professionals. No matter how frequently they may exchange emails and data with doctors online, they cannot see the state of the patient when communicating remotely. When onsite, however, they are able to listen to the views of medical staff and get a clearer picture of the patient’s condition. They cannot achieve this without actually being there. For KAKEN and other companies involved in medicine, whether in research and development or sales, people are ultimately at the center. As the environment surrounding patients becomes increasingly digital, a key question is how we should combine the digital and real worlds. I believe that making the best use of digital technology, while applying the real-world strengths we have cultivated in all of our business activities, will help us accelerate our growth.
 
 Concentrating on Priority Areas to Achieve Well-Being
of possibilities from a global viewpoint to develop and market Ecclock (a primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor; unique to KAKEN worldwide), including cross-licensing with other companies.
Going forward, our corporate image must evolve to fit the times. We have maintained a strong reputation as a traditional and dependable company. We will revamp our image using digital tools and other media.
The key to these changes is the mindset of our employees. As I said at the beginning, we are a company with many sincere and serious employees, but the flipside is that they tend to be quiet and conservative. In today’s society, the ability to step out
of one’s comfort zone is also necessary. If employees are to be individual pieces of our organization, I want each of them to be a professional piece. I always tell our employees that they should not just do the job they have been given, but to optimize the process by exploring different approaches. Given the current circumstances, I cannot speak with employees about this face-to-face, but I am meeting remotely with as many of them as I can. If all employees have this mindset, the whole company will change. I want to make sure that everyone, from the president to the newest employees, shares the idea that “KAKEN Pharmaceutical employees are working for the Company’s corporate value and philosophy as one team.”
  KAKEN conducts its business to create joy for patients, joy as a company, and joy for employees. We do not market many products that affect human life directly, but have narrowed down our drug discovery themes and the fields we focus on in order to concentrate on well-being that helps people lead better lives. Well- being means optimization of daily life, and optimization of human life—in short, enabling people to feel happy. We seek to help people age healthily and live spiritually rich lives. We want them to lead healthy lives in both body and mind, so we develop medicines in fields where there are clear patient needs, even though the market potential may be limited.
The focus of Kaken’s early years was the commercialization of the antibiotic streptomycin and related products and discovery research for antifungal agents, followed by the development of products that are on the market now—Mentax (an anti-trichophyton
agent), Fiblast (a wound-healing agent), Clenafin (an onychomycosis treatment agent), and Ecclock (a primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment). In addition, we have launched products such as Artz (an anti- osteoarthritis agent) and Seprafilm (an absorbable adhesion barrier) through in-licensing from and partnerships with other companies. While these products are not necessarily blockbusters in terms of sales volume, they are all bestsellers, and have continued to sell steadily for a very long time. This is proof that they fit the concept of well-being and are highly valued by society.
At the root of our efforts is a deep commitment to our chosen priority fields, supported by the pursuit of expertise by our sincere and serious employees, as well as the trust we have cultivated with patients and doctors. This commitment sustains the creation of new drugs.
Bringing Smiles to the Faces of All Stakeholders through Innovative Drug Discovery
    Working as One Team, Always Ready to Respond to Change
Change is well on its way at KAKEN. We will continue to create innovative new medicines as a pharmaceutical company that constantly evolves to stay a step ahead of dramatic changes in society. Our people are our most important asset, and the foundation for accomplishing that, so we will work to reform our human resource strategy. We will also respond to environmental issues and work to build strong corporate governance as we lay the groundwork for our evolution.
For our shareholders, we have maintained annual dividends at ¥150 per share in FY2020 and purchased 600,000 shares of Company stock.
Putting our corporate philosophy into practice, we will continue to bring smiles to the faces of patients and all our stakeholders, and grow together with them. Look forward to greater things from KAKEN!
   To prepare for the post-COVID-19 world, we must drastically change the way we do things. Many game- changers will appear, and society is sure to change further. Simply launching new products in response will not be enough; we must change continuously, including by making various internal reforms. We must always use foresight in preparing for the future so that no matter what happens, we will be ready.
The first key point is to maintain a well-stocked development pipeline. To do that, in-licensing will be important in addition to in-house discovery research. We plan to not only in-license assets whose development concepts have been proven valid, but also to increase the number of cases where we in- license and develop candidate compounds in the early phase of clinical development or at the research stage. Second is reform of the Marketing & Sales
Division. Rather than simply delivering information to doctors in practice, it is important to properly provide patients with knowledge about diseases and information on treatment options. Therefore, we are strengthening our disease awareness activities for the general public, including patients. Third, we must increase our ability to maintain steady supplies of drugs that meet patient expectations and needs.
In addition, we need to step up our efforts to expand our presence globally. Unfortunately, the size and background of our company would not allow us to rapidly expand. Nonetheless, overseas commercialization of Clenafin is underway, primarily in Asia, and we are also supplying this product in North America and Europe through partner companies. Our immediate goal is to pave the way with Clenafin, and then use that experience to pursue global expansion. We will consider a variety

Motonori Miyakawa, Ph.D.
General Manager of Business Development Department
Mitsuru Watanuki
General Manager of R&D Division
As a pharmaceutical manufacturer, KAKEN utilizes the technologies it has developed throughout its long history as well as its distinguished R&D staff to advance research and development aimed at continually developing distinctive new drugs. In recent years, we have been working to sharpen our expertise and introduce the latest technologies and knowledge in various ways. For example, we are utilizing outsourcing to conduct R&D more efficiently, and have expanded and integrated our R&D infrastructure to tackle new research fields. In addition, we are dispatching our researchers to research institutions in Japan and abroad.
Topical onychomycosis treatment KP-607 is currently in Phase II clinical trials. We are also energetically conducting in-house drug discovery with multiple projects in the preclinical and discovery stages.
To enhance our development pipeline, in parallel with our in-house drug discovery, we actively engage in collaborative research and development with other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions in Japan and overseas, as well as in-licensing of products under development. In FY2020, we obtained approval for primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment
BBI-4000 (in-licensed from Brickell Biotech, Inc. of the United States), and launched it as Ecclock Gel 5%. A Phase I clinical trial for an additional indication is now under way. KMW-1 (in-licensed from MediWound Ltd. of Israel), an eschar-specific removal agent that was designated an orphan drug in Japan, is currently awaiting approval. In addition, we are preparing Phase III clinical trials for Ivermectin Lotion, 0.5% (in-licensed from Arbor Pharmaceuticals, LLC. of the United States) for the treatment of head lice. In the discovery research stage, we are advancing new modalities in drug discovery with Numab Therapeutics AG of Switzerland, which has a multispecific antibody technology platform.
Going forward, we will make use of AI and big data in drug discovery and other areas, step up external collaboration, and actively utilize clinical trial simulations and real-world data to increase our speed and success rate, the greatest challenge in new drug development. Moreover, collaboration among our drug discovery, clinical development and medical affairs operations will allow us to identify medical needs at an early stage and create a steady stream of distinctive new drugs that are easier for patients to use.
To deliver onychomycosis treatment Clenafin to patients around the world, we have out-licensed it to partner companies in North America and in Asia. Recently, we also selected a partner company (Almirall, S.A.) in Europe, and are steadily expanding our collaborative network. We will continue to seek alliances with new partners and strengthen relationships with existing partners to maximize the value of Clenafin.
Clenafin’s success has significantly boosted KAKEN’s name recognition and presence in dermatology. An increasing number of domestic and overseas companies have approached us about potential partnerships, which may be a ripple effect of Clenafin’s performance. We will take advantage of this opportunity to pursue in-licensing and out-licensing agreements that contribute to KAKEN’s sustainable growth.
Recent In- and Out-Licensing Results
■Out-licensing ■In-licensing
Out-licensing of onychomycosis treatment Clenafin to Asian countries and Europe
Initiated efforts to out-license primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment Ecclock in Asia
We are expanding the scope of our search for in-licensing opportunities, which had been centered on small molecule drugs, to other modalities, and are seeking alliance opportunities. As we broaden our view from dermatology and orthopedics to disease areas associated with those fields, we are looking for products that we can in-license for delivery to patients around the world as well as in Japan.
Regarding out-licensing, we have initiated efforts to out-license primary axillary hyperhidrosis treatment Ecclock in the main countries of Asia, and have been approached by numerous interested pharmaceutical companies in the region. We are now working to develop Ecclock into a product that will contribute to our overseas growth as the next strategic product after Clenafin. In addition, we are focusing on overseas expansion of in-house products Fiblast, a wound-healing agent, and Regroth Dental Kit, a medicinal product for periodontal regeneration.

Marketing & Sales Division
To ensure that the prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices sold by KAKEN are used properly, medical representatives (MRs) provide medical professionals with proper usage information. While providing information, MRs also collect information related to product safety and suggestions for product improvement, and share this information within the Company. These efforts lead to information provision

and product improvements that meet the needs of medical professionals. In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been required to provide high value-added information under greater time constraints due to the introduction of guidelines for ethical drug detailing activities, reform of medical professional work-styles, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Agrochemicals
We conduct integrated operations for agrochemicals, feed additives and veterinary drugs, from research and development to sales and marketing. For agrochemicals, our development and marketing operations both in Japan and overseas focus on original products such as polyoxins, which are fungicides, and Pentoxazone, a
Growth Strategy
Demand for food continues to increase in tandem with global population growth, increasing the importance of agriculture as the foundation of food supply. The role of agrochemicals, which are indispensable to agricultural production, is likely to grow. At the same time, strategic initiatives to realize sustainable societies and reduce environmental impact are under way in Japan and around the world. Among them are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Strategy for Sustainable Food Systems (MeaDRI) in Japan, and the Farm to Fork Strategy in the EU. These initiatives call for environmentally friendly farming. Given such trends, we foresee a
Product Line-Up
We have developed and market polyoxin fungicides and the paddy rice herbicides Pentoxazone and Metamifop. Polyoxins exhibit a unique mechanism of action called chitin synthesis inhibition, and have been well accepted by farmers both in and outside Japan for more than 50 years as fungicides with little impact on humans, animals or the environment. Pentoxazone has excellent herbicidal effects on annual weeds in rice paddies, making it an indispensable ingredient for this
rice herbicide. To enable sustainable agriculture in harmony with nature, we supply eco-friendly, low- residue products that have a low impact on humans, animals and the environment. In this way, our products help contribute to food safety and security.
further increase in needs and expectations for agriculture that is friendly to humans, animals and the environment. To support sustainable agriculture in harmony with nature, we have established a growth strategy based on two pillars: development of agrochemicals that have low impact on humans, animals and the environment, and fermentative production, which can reduce chemical substance waste and energy consumption. By actively researching, developing and commercializing these products and technologies, we will contribute to food safety and security.
form of rice cultivation. Metamifop is highly effective against many weeds of the Gramineae family, including barnyard grass of high leaf age, and is therefore expected to enable more efficient weed control in paddy fields.
In feed additives and veterinary drugs, we support livestock farmers by marketing Salinomycin, an anticoccidial feed additive for chickens, and Uroston, a drug for cattle.
   “All for the Patients!”
Each of us works for patients with a single purpose—to make patients smile!
Chief Officer of Marketing & Sales Division
  Tomoyuki Koseki
To ensure that the prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices we sell are used properly, we provide medical information mainly through three groups: Marketing & Sales, Marketing & Scientific Information and Distribution. In the Marketing & Sales Group, MRs provide medical professionals with proper usage information. While doing so, MRs also collect information related to product safety and suggestions for product improvement and share this information within the Company. These efforts lead to information provision and product improvements that meet the needs of medical professionals. Due to the spread of COVID-19 since last year, pharmaceutical companies have been required to provide high value-added information under greater time constraints. In response to the rapidly changing business environment, we are taking various measures to improve the quality and speed of our information provision, including utilizing digital tools and restructuring our division.
The healthcare industry in Japan is undergoing major changes. In step with the move toward functional differentiation and cooperation among medical institutions, new roles are required to support the integrated care system in community healthcare. Going forward, our MRs will serve as liaisons with community healthcare players that support patients, providing information about medicines from viewpoints such as health economics, safety and adherence in order to achieve continuing care that improves patients’ quality of life.
We want to create an organization in which each MR not only has product knowledge, but also in-depth knowledge of related medical information, and always considers options from a patient-first perspective. To further build our presence in dermatology and orthopedics, the fields of our mainstay become an essential company in community healthcare, we will continue to provide even higher-quality information with a focus on the needs of patients.
     We help improve patients’ quality of life by providing relevant information on medicines and healthcare.
Rie Nozaki
Marketing & Scientific Information Group Manager, Marketing & Sales Department, Marketing & Sales Division
 In the Marketing & Scientific Information Group, we work every day to promote and maximize the value of products by ensuring that the information we provide is optimal, efficient and takes into account the product’s unique characteristics.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ways in which medical professionals obtain information have diversified. We are responding to their needs by swiftly ramping up our use of multiple channels of communication. In addition to conveying information through our website, we are making changes such as
using the industry’s most advanced virtual reality technology to provide information, and developing a patient adherence app.
While we are carrying out digital transformation, we believe that when all is said and done, providing detailed information face-to-face is essential. That’s why we are also focusing on helping MRs acquire not only in-depth product knowledge, but also in-depth knowledge of related healthcare information and other matters, so that medical professionals will recognize them as partners in healthcare.

  Corporate Governance
 Tetsuo Onuma Chairman and Representative Director
(Chairperson of the Board of Directors)
Corporate Governance System
KAKEN has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system, taking into consideration the scale of its business, management monitoring functions and other circumstances. Four Audit & Supervisory Board members, including two outside members, attend all important meetings, including Board of Directors meetings, and actively express their opinions. Outside Audit & Supervisory Board members provide their opinions from a neutral standpoint. KAKEN therefore considers its management monitoring functions to be fully functional under its current auditing system.
Corporate Governance System
In addition, KAKEN has adopted the executive officer system to speed up decision making and to clarify responsibility for the functions of supervision and execution of business.
Board of Directors meetings are regularly held once a month, and extraordinary meetings are held when necessary. Three of the directors are outside directors. Furthermore, Audit & Supervisory Board members, including outside members, and corporate officers attend Board of Directors meetings. In this way, the Board of Directors ensures the thorough implementation of management policies and the fairness and transparency of its decision-making.

Board of Directors
Companywide organizations, Group companies
 In recent years, corporations have been called on to further strengthen their governance to facilitate transparent, fair, speedy and resolute decision-making that considers the position of shareholders and other stakeholders.
In 2018, we established the Nomination and Compensation Committee, a majority of which is comprised of outside directors. In 2019, we newly appointed a female outside director, raising the proportion of outside directors on the Board of Directors to over one-third, and took other steps to enhance our corporate governance, such as introducing a Board Benefit Trust stock compensation plan linked to medium- and long-term results.
The revision of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code in June 2021 requires that we take more proactive
measures for sustainability. My role as Chairperson of the Board is to further improve the quality of discussions at Board of Directors meetings by bringing out the multifaceted knowledge of board members backed by their diversity of gender, career history and other attributes, to enable the Company to achieve long-term sustainability through speedy and resolute decision-making.
I will continue to draw on the opinions of stakeholders, further strengthen corporate governance, and build a management system that contributes to sustainable growth and increased corporate value, thus making KAKEN worthy of trust.
The Board of Directors consists of nine directors, three of whom are outside directors. The chairman and representative director serves as chairperson of the board. Board of Directors meetings are normally held on a monthly basis, and extraordinary meetings are held when necessary. As a management decision-making body, the Board of

   Basic Approach to Corporate Governance
24 KAKEN Corporate Report 2021
KAKEN’s business philosophy is centered on what we call the “three joys”—“joy for patients,” “joy as a company,” and “joy for employees.” “Joy as a company” is based on the principle that KAKEN recognizes its social responsibility as a pharmaceutical company, engages in all activities with high ethical standards, and aspires to earn society’s trust. Accordingly, the tasks of enhancing corporate governance and ensuring the transparency of management and providing our stakeholders with proper explanations of the Company’s activities, are placed among our top management priorities.
KAKEN has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system and has four Audit & Supervisory Board Members, including two standing and two outside members. In addition, KAKEN has appointed one alternate outside Audit & Supervisory Board member. Although no staff has been currently assigned as support staff for Audit & Supervisory Board members, the General Affairs Department assists the Audit & Supervisory Board members and Audit & Supervisory Board meetings.
Audit & Supervisory Board members attend important meetings, including Board of Directors meetings, and
Nomination and Compensation Committee
Comprised of a majority of outside directors, the Nomination and Compensation Committee serves as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, deliberating on the nomination of directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members and other members, and on the compensation of directors and other members, as well as providing
audit the execution of duties by the Board of Directors. In this way, they work to ensure fairness and transparency of management decision making and execution.

advice and recommendations to the Board of Directors. Nomination and Compensation Committee meetings are held two to four times a year and further meetings are held on an as-needed basis. All committee members attended all five meetings in FY2020.

 Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
prorating the degree of achievement of the KPIs in the medium-term business plan in accordance with the Rules for Share-based Remuneration for Officers. Linked to medium- and long-term performance, it is intended to contribute to increased corporate value and sustainable growth. The total amount of stock compensation is set within the amount approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders.
It was resolved at the 87th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 28, 2007 that the annual basic compensation for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members shall be ¥330 million or less and ¥70 million or less, respectively. With respect to performance-linked stock compensation, it was resolved at the 99th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2019 that the maximum amount to be contributed to the trust (covering three fiscal years) shall be ¥141 million for directors.
The ratio of directors’ compensation by type is examined by the Nomination and Compensation Committee, which uses similarly sized companies in related industries and lines of business as benchmarks and considers factors such as compensation levels and the Company’s performance to date. The Board of Directors (or the delegated representative director and president, as specified below) respects the Nomination and Compensation Committee’s recommendations and uses the committee’s recommended ratio of compensation by type as a reference point when determining the structure of compensation for individual directors. As a
rule of thumb for the ratio of compensation types, KAKEN uses a ratio of 6:3:1 for basic compensation, performance-linked compensation and non-cash compensation (assuming 100% achievement of KPIs). In FY2020,the Nomination and Compensation Committee meeting regarding directors’ compensation was held in March 2021. The committee deliberated the draft of basic compensation and performance-linked compensation for individual directors in accordance with the above criteria.
Based on a resolution of the Board of Directors, President and Representative Director Hiroyuki Horiuchi has been delegated to decide the specific details of compensation for individual directors. He has authority over the amount of basic compensation of each director, as well as the evaluation and allocation of bonuses and stock compensation based on the performance of the divisions that each director is responsible for. The representative director and president was delegated with this authority as he is the most appropriate person for evaluating the divisions that each director is responsible for while maintaining a broader view of the Company’s overall performance. To ensure that the representative director and president properly exercises this authority, the Board of Directors consults with and receives recommendations from the Nomination and Compensation Committee, of which outside directors comprise a majority. The delegated representative director and president takes these recommendations into consideration when making decisions.
 The Company has appointed three outside directors and two outside Audit & Supervisory Board members.
The role of outside directors is to provide advice and supervision, based on their expertise. They contribute to the Company’s sustainable growth by directly engaging in decision making of the Board of Directors, as well as to appropriately reflecting the opinions of stakeholders, including minority shareholders, at Board of Directors meetings from a neutral and independent standpoint.
The role of outside Audit & Supervisory Board members is to strengthen the auditing function and ensure the
transparency and objectivity of management by auditing the execution of duties by directors, based on their expertise and from a neutral and independent standpoint.
The Company has not set criteria, etc., for appointing outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members. However, in making appointments, the Company pays due consideration to their independence from the Company so that the neutrality of their role will not be impaired. There is no special interest between the Company and any of the outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members.

Officer Compensation
In an effort to provide an incentive to contribute to the sustainable growth of KAKEN, the compensation for the Company’s directors comprises basic compensation, bonuses and stock compensation, which are determined by comprehensively taking into consideration the Company’s medium- to long-term performance as well as past payment amounts, in addition to the responsibilities of the directors. Basic compensation is a fixed amount, while bonuses and stock compensation are linked to the Company’s business performance. However, bonuses and stock compensation are not paid to outside directors, as they are responsible for supervision and monitoring of management from an independent standpoint.
Basic compensation is fixed monthly compensation, and is determined by taking into consideration the director’s position and responsibilities, compensation
and appropriate manner. Specifically, outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members provided a wide range of opinions and questions without being constrained by Company norms. Taking into account this situation and referring to the self-evaluation based on questionnaire surveys conducted for each director as well as interviews with the chairperson of the board, the Board of Directors has evaluated that its effectiveness is secured.
levels at other companies, the Company’s performance, and the director’s salary as an employee. The total amount of basic compensation is set within the amount approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Performance-linked compensation is cash compensation that reflects key performance indicators (KPIs). It is intended to increase the commitment of directors to improving performance for each fiscal year. An amount calculated based on year-on-year comparisons of consolidated operating profit and consolidated net profit is paid as a bonus for each fiscal year upon approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Non-cash compensation is paid in the form of stock compensation by a Board Benefit Trust, which is a stock compensation plan linked to business performance that provides stock and other benefits upon retirement. Stock compensation is calculated using coefficients obtained by

Reason for Selection
  Outside Director’s Message
I strictly supervise KAKEN’s management while supporting the president’s “KAKEN One Team” concept.
In FY2020, KAKEN, like many other companies, was severely impacted by the global spread of COVID-19. I would like to express my sympathy to all stakeholders. In these circumstances, KAKEN quickly reconsidered its meeting committee structure, and held hybrid Board of Directors meetings when necessary. As a result, governance was not hindered. Under Chairperson and Representative Director Tetsuo Onuma, important management-related matters are discussed and decided by President and Representative Director Hiroyuki Horiuchi and (compared with before) a slightly younger group of directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members and corporate officers. Occasionally, questions that we outside directors posed have sparked heated discussions during online meetings.
In addition, interviews for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors were conducted
properly as in past years.
  Regarding the promotion of the active participation and advancement of women in the workplace, my view is that it is not about making workplaces more supportive just for women. Arranging a pleasant work environment for women and men alike, as well as for people with diverse attributes, helps to attract and retain talented people, which ultimately leads to the sustainable growth of the Company. I offer advice at Board of Directors meetings and elsewhere to encourage management to take the Company beyond the requirements of the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace by setting up workplace systems that accommodate employees at various life stages—not just when they are rearing children, but also when they are providing nursing care for a family member or when they themselves are ill. I believe that doing so will enable the Company to achieve its target for the percentage of women in management positions, which is a current issue.
Highlights of FY2020 included the appointment of President and Representative Director Hiroyuki Horiuchi and the launch of Ecclock Gel 5%. How will the Company develop over the next year? We three outside directors, including newly appointed Outside Director Yasutomo Inoue, are committed to strictly supervising management while supporting the president’s “KAKEN One Team” concept to increase the Company’s corporate value.

 The Foundation for Creating Value
  Compliance and Risk Management
1. The Company has established a system to identify and manage risks that the KAKEN Group is exposed to under a system in which a risk management officer is appointed and the Corporate Planning & Coordination Department is designated as the responsible department.
2. The Company classifies risks and manages them by designating the responsible departments, respectively.
3. The Board of Directors makes management decisions on the handling of material risks from the perspective of the
KAKEN Group’s management, and such risks are managed by the responsible departments.
4. The Internal Audit Department audits the status of risk management at the KAKEN Group and reports the results to
the president, the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board.
The Company has formulated the Regulations for Risk Management and carries out risk management activities such as
identifying risks, taking countermeasures and providing education for each division and department. At the same time, the Risk Management Committee has been set up, chaired by the Risk Management Officer appointed by the Board of Directors. In such ways, the Company has established a system to manage risks on a Companywide basis. Important matters deliberated at Risk Management Committee meetings are submitted for approval or reported to the Board of Directors.
   Basic Approach and System for Promoting Compliance
KAKEN believes that compliance-based management is fundamental to earning the trust of society and promoting the healthy development of the Company. KAKEN promotes compliance-based management based on this principle.
KAKEN has appointed a compliance officer to promote compliance-related initiatives on a Companywide basis and has designated the Legal Affairs & Intellectual Property Department Compliance Group as the unit responsible for promoting compliance.
Activities to Promote Compliance
To address changes in the operating environment of the pharmaceutical industry and the Company, in January 2021 we established the KAKEN Charter of Corporate Behavior and Code of Conduct, which are revisions of KAKEN’s Activity Principles and Guidelines and KAKEN’s Code of Conduct, which were established in April 2002. The KAKEN Charter of Corporate Behavior and Code of Conduct are the basis for making decisions and taking actions in the performance of duties by executives and employees toward the achievement of the corporate philosophy and business philosophy. The charter and code comprise guidelines to be followed by both executives and employees, and expresses KAKEN’s basic position on compliance. The KAKEN Charter of Corporate Behavior is disclosed on the Company’s English website
Ethical Considerations in Animal Testing
In developing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, animal testing is indispensable for verifying the safety and effectiveness of drugs.
The Company has formulated internal regulations that fully reflect the intent of “the Act on the Welfare and Management of Animals,” “the Standards relating to the Care and Keeping and Reducing Pain of Laboratory Animals,” and “the Basic Policies for the Conduct of Animal Experiments in Research Institutions under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare,” and gives full consideration to the utilization of alternatives to animal testing, the reduction of the number of animals used, and the mitigation of pain.
In conducting animal tests, the Company complies with relevant laws and regulations and internal
and both the charter and the code are disclosed on the Company’s Japanese website.
We have created panels displaying the corporate philosophy, business philosophy and the KAKEN Charter of Corporate Behavior, as well as a Compliance Check Card and Compliance Guidebook to help executives and employees of the Company and subsidiaries practice compliance. In addition, KAKEN provides compliance education based on position and workplace, and through the Company intranet distributes messages from the compliance officer and provides related information from the Legal Affairs & Intellectual Property Department Compliance Group as appropriate to improve compliance awareness.
regulations, gives due consideration to animal welfare, and carries out examinations by the Animal Testing Committee to ensure that the tests are appropriately carried out from a scientific point of view.
Self inspections and self assessments on the status of animal testing are carried out every year to verify the appropriateness of the tests.
In addition, the Company’s initiatives for animal testing have been assessed by an external party as being appropriately carried out in accordance with the policies of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. In January 2019, KAKEN received the Accreditation of Animal Experimentation Facilities from the Japan Health Sciences Foundation for the third time.
Principal Risks
Major risks recognized by the management as those that materially affect the financial position, business performance and cash flows are as follows.
The forward-looking statements contained herein reflect the judgment of the KAKEN Group (KAKEN and its consolidated subsidiary) as of March 31, 2021.
   Major Risks
Status of Major Risks
            Basic Approach and System for Promoting Risk Management
Risks related to legal regulations and administrative developments such as policies to curtail public healthcare expenditures
Risks related to
new drug development
Risks related to side effects
Risks due to competition
Risks related to intellectual property rights
Risks related to litigation
Risks related to delay or interruption of product supply
Risks related to IT security and information management
Risks related to large-scale disasters
Risks associated with the spread of COVID-19
The pharmaceutical business in Japan is subject to various regulations under the pharmaceutical regulatory system. In addition, various medical system reforms are underway as part of policies to curtail public healthcare expenditures, such as revisions of the drug price standards and measures to promote the use of generic drugs. Revisions of these related laws and regulations and developments in the administrative policies related to the medical system and health insurance could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition.
Considerable financial investment and development periods of more than 10 years are required for the research and development of drugs; however, the probability of these efforts coming to fruition as a new product or technology is not high. The Company carefully develops new drugs while taking the efficacy and safety of each drug into full consideration, but development could be halted before completion if the expected efficacy cannot be proven or a safety issue is identified. Such cases could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition.
Pharmaceutical products are approved and marketed only after sufficient safety tests and thorough review; however, only a limited number of patients are administered experimental drugs during clinical trials undertaken in the development stage. In order to supplement these clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance is conducted after products are launched. If unexpected side effects are identified in post-marketing surveillance, the Company may be compelled to recall the product or discontinue its sales. Such cases could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition.
The pharmaceutical industry is very competitive. Competition with competing products that have similar efficacy and effect and with generic products launched after patents expire may result in declines in sales of our products, which could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition.
The KAKEN Group manages its intellectual property properly and takes precautions against infringement by third parties. If a third party infringes the Group’s intellectual property rights, the Group may file a lawsuit against the third party to protect such rights. The outcome of such litigation could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition. The Group also pays close attention to ensure that its projects do not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party. However, if such an infringement occurs, it may result in a dispute and subsequent compensation for damages and cancellation of the project, which could materially affect the KAKEN Group’s business performance and financial condition.
As a company conducting business in both Japan and abroad, KAKEN is at a risk of litigation instituted for side effects of its pharmaceutical products and issues concerning product liability, labor, the environment and fair trade. Such litigation could materially affect the Group’s business performance and financial condition.
Delay or interruption of product supply due to problems with the Company’s manufacturing facilities or its suppliers, or delays in the procurement of raw materials, or product recalls due to quality problems could materially affect the Group’s business performance and financial condition.
The Group uses various information systems; therefore, our business operation may be hampered by system failures, computer viruses and cyber-attacks, and other factors. If confidential information including personal information in our possession is leaked to any third party, the Group would face compensation for damages, administrative action, and loss of public trust. These events could materially affect the Group’s business performance and financial condition.
The occurrence of natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons, accidents such as fires, or pandemics could cause extensive damage to the KAKEN Group’s offices and business partners. The resulting disruption to business activities or considerable expense required to repair damaged facilities could materially affect the Group’s business performance and financial condition.
Despite the efforts of the KAKEN Group, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic that are more serious or persistent than the Company expects could materially affect the Group’s business performance and financial condition. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic is curbed or contained, the pandemic may continue to have an impact for an extended period of time.
 KAKEN engages in risk management initiatives with the aim of fulfilling its social responsibility and contributing to sustainable corporate value improvement by appropriately

 The Foundation for Creating Value
  Human Resource Strategy
Job Creation, Worker Retention and Diversity
Occupational Safety and Health
Based on the Regulations for Safety and Health Management, which are aimed at preventing occupational accidents and illnesses and creating a comfortable work environment, we hold Safety and Health Committee meetings on a monthly basis at all offices and other workplaces. We work to eliminate occupational accidents by implementing safety inspections and remedial measures at each facility and workplace. We also actively work to improve the work environment by conducting regular questionnaire surveys of our employees.
At the Shizuoka site, health supervisors strive to ensure occupational health and safety through efforts such as holding regular meetings, formulating annual health plans, and conducting tours and onsite inspections of workplaces and work environments. Furthermore, in conjunction with the safety and health week, the site holds various lectures jointly with the employee health insurance association, and conducts activities to promote awareness of safety and physical and mental health issues.
    Engagement with Employees
Creation of a Workplace Free from Discrimination and Harassment
  In order to create a work environment in which all employees are highly motivated, we believe it is important to respond flexibly to and constantly evolve new working styles in light of legal reforms. In addition,
we are implementing diversity management and work-style reforms, including promotion of women’s participation and advancement.
The Company is obligated to provide all employees with equal employment opportunities based on employment agreements and a comfortable work environment that is free from issues including discrimination, abuse of authority, sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination.
We work to enhance awareness of the prevention of discrimination and harassment among all employees
through means such as the Rules of Employment, Regulations for Rewards and Punishments, the Compliance Guidebook, information meetings for employees in managerial positions, and regular postings and education via the in-house intranet. We also keep employees informed of internal consultation channels.
 ■ Enabling Work-Life Balance
As part of efforts to create worker-friendly environments where employees can work efficiently, in December 2020 we adopted a flextime system Companywide, except for the Production Division and MRs.
 Employee Health Management
As for employee health management, we provide access to health checkups every spring and lifestyle disease-related examinations (complete medical checkup/brain checkup) every fall. In cooperation with industrial physicians, nurses and medical examination centers, we conduct follow ups for employees whose checkups reveal health problems. In addition, to help prevent illness and maintain and improve the health of our employees, we cooperate proactively in the specified health checkups and health guidance provided by the health insurance association.
In terms of mental health measures, we have introduced a program in partnership with an outside organization for the purpose of preventing, detecting and responding to mental health problems at an early stage. In addition to conducting annual stress checks required by law, to support measures for employees’ mental health we offer simple
stress checks that employees can perform voluntarily and provide a wide range of learning materials including a variety of e-learning programs.
The Shizuoka site is taking various steps to improve the work environment. It has appointed a person in charge of promoting mental health measures at each workplace and holds roundtable meetings attended by health supervisors. The site also endeavors to maintain and improve the health of its employees. For example, it has designated a month in spring to promote the health benefits of walking, and in the fall it conducts a physical fitness test as a health campaign. The Company remains committed to the management of employees’ physical and mental health in cooperation with industrial physicians while utilizing the external consultation desk at the health insurance association and counseling services.

KAKEN Corporate Report 2021 31
As a company that emphasizes “joy for employees,” KAKEN places great importance on employees’ human rights, health, safety and hygiene, and promotes the creation of a work environment in which every employee can work with peace of mind and a sense of fulfillment. We also place importance on human resource development and education to create an environment where our employees can grow and fully demonstrate their capabilities.
■ Support for Childcare and Nursing Care
We have established various systems such as leave of absence, days off and shorter working hours, based on the Regulations for Childcare Leave and the Regulations for Caregiver Leave, so that employees who have difficulty working under normal conditions due to childcare or nursing care issues can continue to work without worry. In FY2021, we established a system in which employees can take special paid leave for the purpose of caring for a family member or for a child’s gradual entry into a new nursery school.
Developing the Next Generation of Human Resources
 Human resource development is a fundamental part of corporate management, and the growth of each employee leads to the sustainable growth of the Company. Our basic policy is to foster employees with distinctive capabilities who will be responsible for the future of the Company.
We provide comprehensive education and training by employment year and position to foster employees who can make the most of their capabilities to achieve results
at each stage of their careers while gaining experience as members of society.

Local Community-related Activities of the Shizuoka Site ■ River Beautification Activities
The Shizuoka site has benefited from the waters of the Oi River, a Class A river in Japan. The site works to protect the environment of the Oi River through river beautification activities conducted every April. While these activities are carried out as part of the site’s efforts to contribute to society, they are also an opportunity to foster friendly relationships with newly hired employees. In addition, the site is registered with Fujieda City’s “Adopt Program,” and in FY2020 the site’s support team conducted 19 cleanups of sports fields along the river.
■ Environmental Report Meetings
The Shizuoka site holds environmental report meetings every year for local residents. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY2020, information was shared by circulating the report documents from resident to resident. Reports present various statistics on relevant matters, the status of employee education, and other activities for compliance with laws and regulations. Through this report, the site promotes better understanding of the Company’s environmental initiatives.
■ Hosting Elementary School Field Trip
With an eye to contributing to the growth of children who will shape the future, for the first time, in FY2020, the Shizuoka site hosted an elementary school field trip. The tour was a friendly and lively event from start to finish, introducing the children to KAKEN, talking about medicine in a quiz format, and showing them the manufacturing process of Clenafin. Some of the questions they asked were hard even for adults to answer!
Local Community-related Activities of the Drug Research Center in Kyoto ■ Environmental Beautification Activities
As a member of the Yamashina Beautification Promotion Corporate Council, the Drug Research Center in Kyoto participates in the beautification campaign for the Lake Biwa-Yodo River water system. A cleanup of Shinomiya River, which runs near the site, is held every spring and fall, and is one of the leading beautification activities for the Lake Biwa-Yodo River water system. In addition, the site conducts flower-planting along Sanjo Street, and has made cleaning up around the site an environmental improvement target. Since October 2014, from 9:00 a.m. one day each month, two teams of employees have cleaned the roads around the site.
Firefighting and Disaster Prevention Drills and Local Agreements for Disaster Prevention and Cooperation
The Head Office provides a standard first aid course every September with the cooperation of the Tokyo Disaster Prevention & Emergency Medical Service Association and the Hongo Fire Station, and was awarded the Certificate of the Excellent Completion of a First-Aid Course from the Tokyo Fire Department in recognition of its active involvement in life-saving training.
In addition, firefighting and disaster prevention drills are carried out at each of our sites every November in conjunction with the Autumn Nationwide Fire Prevention Campaign, so as to heighten awareness of fire and disaster prevention and enhance safety measures. The Drug Research Center in Kyoto has concluded local agreements for disaster prevention, focused on supplying personnel in the event of a disaster, with two neighboring school districts based on the lessons learned from the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake.
  KAKEN is committed to realizing its corporate philosophy and management policy and supplying superior pharmaceuticals. To achieve that, KAKEN will carry out the following activities in serious recognition of the fact that it is engaged in the pharmaceutical business, it pursues higher ethical standards and it places primary and constant emphasis on quality during the course of activities including drug discovery, exploratory research, development, clinical trials, manufacture, post-marketing surveillance, the provision of pharmaceutical information, and other matters.
  Quality Assurance Policy
 1 Recognizing that product quality assurance is one of the most important issues related to management responsibility, KAKEN will establish a pharmaceutical quality system that covers all the products it sells.
3 In order to supply patients with superior pharmaceuticals, KAKEN makes it a basic rule to comply with laws for ensuring the quality, effectiveness and safety of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and other products, as well as other relevant laws and regulations. In addition, KAKEN follows good practices, including good laboratory practice (GLP), good clinical practice (GCP), good manufacturing practice (GMP), good quality practice (GQP) and good vigilance practice (GVP), and assumes responsibility for its own actions.
Product Quality Assurance
KAKEN works to return smiles of happiness to the faces of as many patients as possible by supplying superior pharmaceuticals that help improve their quality of life. To that end, we believe that it is absolutely essential that we have a quality assurance system in which both our Head Office (a manufacturer and distributor of pharmaceuticals) and our factory (a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals) fulfill their respective responsibilities and maintain close coordination. At our factory, competencies and appropriateness of each manufacturing process and facility are evaluated to ensure
2 KAKEN will provide a warranty on product quality in response to demands of customers and society.
4 KAKEN aims to establish a quality assurance system that promotes not only conformance with the standards and specifications required by regulatory authorities, but also continuous improvements that take the technological standards of the times into account.
that suitable manufacturing and quality management practices are followed.
The Quality Assurance Department of the Head Office evaluates and confirms these activities, which we believe results in the creation of a more stringent quality assurance system. Coordinated activities have not been limited to the departments in charge of quality, but have been expanded to the R&D Division, the Production Division and the Marketing & Sales Division to guarantee the highest quality throughout all stages of a product’s lifecycle.
With the aim of deepening engagement with local communities as a good corporate citizen, our employees give consideration to how they can contribute to society as individuals, and are proactively engaged in environmental issues familiar to them. In addition, to improve awareness of disaster prevention and strengthen safety measures each of our sites, including the Head Office, undertakes initiatives such as the provision of a standard first aid course and various other drills.
 Activity Policy
    Safety Assurance for Pharmaceuticals after Launch
  Pharmaceuticals receive regulatory approval after undergoing evaluations based on the results of clinical trials, which have a limited scope in regard to such considerations as patient age, gender, complications and concurrent medications. After launch, pharmaceuticals are used by a wider range of patients, which can reveal unexpected side effects. For this reason, we are required
Pharmaceuticals Information Service Office
Accurate information is essential for the proper usage of prescription drugs. We provide and collect information pertaining to the proper usage of our pharmaceuticals mainly through medical representative (MR) activities; however, we also proactively provide and collect such information through the Pharmaceuticals Information Service Office, a consultation desk related to pharmaceuticals, and via our website. The office promptly and accurately informs customers about proper usage of pharmaceuticals
to collect comprehensive safety information, accurately evaluate it and take necessary response measures.
With the establishment of the Pharmacovigilance Department, we strive to minimize the safety risks of patients by collecting and evaluating data regarding the safety of pharmaceuticals from the development phase to post-marketing, and by providing medical professionals with information regarding proper usage.
and reports their valuable opinions and suggestions on pharmaceutical formulations and other matters to relevant departments in the Company, thereby helping to improve pharmaceutical formulations and enhance product information for the benefit of customers.
We receive most inquiries by phone; however, we provide a form on our website for receipt of inquiries, even outside office hours, with the aim of enhancing convenience for customers.

Develop eco-friendly products and technologies
As we develop products, we shall work actively to protect the environment. We shall consider the environmental impact of our products over their lifecycles, from research and development, production, sales and distribution to end-of-use/end-of-life (EOU/EOL).
The generation of waste is unavoidable in the manufacturing of products from raw materials. However, the development of a circular economy requires that the generation of waste that ends up as final landfill disposal be reduced to the greatest extent possible. To this end, the Shizuoka site and the Drug Research Center in Kyoto act in accordance with the Basic Act on Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society and is actively practicing the 4Rs (refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle).
In FY2020, the total amount of waste generated by the Shizuoka site was 544 tons. Of this, 42% was sludge
Efficient Use of Water Resources
The Shizuoka site benefits from abundant water resources from the nearby Oi River, but the possibility of a shortage of water resources in the future due to climate change and other factors is also a concern. The Shizuoka site, which includes a factory, switched its water pump to an inverter type to enable fine adjustments in the amount of groundwater drawn. Through this and other steps,
produced during the treatment of wastewater and residues from fermentation processes (animal and plant residues). The entire amount of sludge and residues generated was used as composting and related materials. We are also working to recycle other wastes and collected 34 tons of valuable materials (accounting for 11% of total other wastes). The amount of final landfill disposal was 18 tons. Going forward, we will continue to conduct activities promoting the reduction and recycling of waste.
such as stopping unnecessary drawing of well water, the site is working to use water resources more efficiently.
We will continue to promote efficient use of water resources from the standpoint of business sustainability.
 1 management system
We shall establish an environmental management system and take initiatives to protect the environment. Led by our Environmental Committee and Environmental Measures Task Force, these initiatives shall be systematic and continuous.
2 Comply with environmental laws and regulations
We shall comply with environmental laws and regulations at the national and local levels. We shall further establish independent standards as we strive to protect the environment.
3 Reduce environmental burden
We shall set concrete targets for all aspects of our business activities and practice the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle). Aiming for continuous improvement, we shall periodically revise our targets with respect to climate change, waste and chemical emissions.

OUTPUT
Reduction of CO2 Emissions and Energy Saving
   We participate in the Commitment to a Low-Carbon Society, a plan that the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations of Japan helped to create, and have worked toward achievement of the federation’s target of reducing Japan’s pharmaceutical industry CO2 emissions in FY2020 by 23% compared with emissions in FY2005. At the Shizuoka site, which consumes the most energy of any of our sites, we are taking proactive
Supply of Eco-Friendly Agrochemicals
Polyoxins, which are agricultural fungicides, are safe for humans and animals, and are a natural substances confirmed to be broken down easily by water, light and microorganisms, and present no risk of being long-term residues. As such, they are eco-friendly agrochemicals. Because they use natural materials as their principal raw materials, fermentatively produced polyoxins help to reduce environmental burden in manufacturing as well. Compared with conventional chemically synthesized agrochemicals, producing polyoxins uses a smaller amount of petrochemical raw materials and generates a smaller amount of waste chemical substances. Currently, our polyoxins are sold in 17 countries, and we are conducting development so that these environmentally friendly products can be supplied to more countries.
measures such as installing high-efficiency equipment, and are carrying out ongoing energy-saving activities.
At the Kyoto site, Head Office and branch offices, we are taking various measures to reduce electricity consumption, including replacing fluorescent lights with LED lights and installing heat pumps in air conditioning systems. As a result of the success of these measures, we exceeded the aforementioned CO2 reduction target.

  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of KAKEN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiary (collectively the “Group”) are prepared on the basis of the accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to the 2020 financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2021.
As permitted by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan, amounts of less than one million yen have been omitted. As a result, the totals shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (both in yen and U.S. dollars) do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts.
The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated from Japanese yen amounts solely for convenience of readers outside of Japan at ¥110= U.S.$1.00, the approximate rate of exchange prevailing on March 31, 2021. This translation should not be construed as a representation that Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above or any other rate.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had one consolidated subsidiary as follows:
KAKEN PHARMA CO., LTD.
For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no affiliate accounted for using the equity method.
All significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized profits or losses among the Group have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of cash on hand, bank deposits which are able to be withdrawn within three months, and short- term investments with original maturity of three months or less and are considered to have minimal risk from market fluctuations.
(c) Marketable and Investment Securities
Securities are classified into one of the following three categories: (1) Trading, (2) Held-to- maturity debt securities, and (3) Available-for-sale securities. Trading securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in the current year’s earnings. Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are expected to be sold in future and those whose fair values are readily determinable are carried at fair value and the related unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, are included as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income” under net assets. Available- for-sale securities without market quotations are stated at cost determined by the moving average method.
(d) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined by the gross average method, or net selling value, which is defined as the selling price less additional estimated manufacturing costs and estimated direct selling expenses.
(e) Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
The range of useful lives is 3 to 60 years for buildings and structures, and 2 to 8 years for
machinery, equipment and vehicles.
(f) Intangible Assets
Software for internal use is amortized over the estimated useful life (5 years) using the straight-line method.
(g) Long-Term Prepaid Expenses
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method.
(h) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To cover losses due to bad debt, allowance for doubtful accounts is provided at the amount determined based on the historical write-off rate for ordinary receivables and the estimated uncollectible amount determined based on the analysis of individual recoverability for specific doubtful receivables such as debt with a possibility of default.
(i) Provision for Bonuses
Provision for bonuses to directors and employees is provided at the amount estimated as of the balance sheet date.
(j) Provision for Sales Returns
In order to cover losses on sales returns after the balance sheet date, provision for sales returns is provided at the total amount of gross profits on estimated sales returns and losses on disposal of returned inventories.
(k) Provision for Sales Rebates
In order to cover expected sales rebates after sales, provision for sales rebates is provided at an amount calculated by multiplying the balance of trade receivables as of the balance sheet date by the estimated sales rebate rates.
(l) Provision for Share Awards
In order to prepare for the granting of the Company’s stock to directors and corporate officers pursuant to the rules on share distribution to officers, provision for share awards is recorded at an estimated amount of share awards obligations as of the balance sheet date.
(m) Retirement and Pension Plan
The Company applies the benefit formula basis as the attribution method for estimated retirement benefits.
Unrecognized prior service cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period within the average remaining years of service of the employees (10 years) from the year in which it arises. Unrecognized actuarial gain or loss is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period within the average remaining years of service of the employees (10 years) from the year following the year in which it arises.

Financial and Corporate Data
  (n) Income Taxes
Income taxes–deferred are determined using the asset and liability approach, where deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the consolidated financial statements.
(o) Consumption Taxes
Consumption taxes withheld and consumption taxes paid are excluded from revenues and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The net balance of consumption taxes withheld and consumption taxes paid is included in current liabilities of the consolidated balance sheets as of the end of the fiscal year.
(p) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting
Derivative instruments, which include forward foreign exchange contracts, are used as a part of the Company’s risk management of foreign currency risk exposure of its financial assets and liabilities.
Forward foreign exchange contracts:
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to limit risk exposure, affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, on trade receivables and trade payables and cash flows generated from forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. For forward foreign exchange contracts which are designated and are effective as hedges of such foreign currency risk on existing assets and liabilities, the Company adopted the accounting method whereby foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are measured at the contract rate of the respective forward foreign exchange contract. With respect to such contracts for forecasted transactions, the contracts are marked-to-market and the unrealized gains/losses are deferred in the balance sheet to be released to income when the exchange gains/losses on the hedged items or transactions are recognized.
Hedge accounting:
Hedging instruments and hedged items, hedging policy, method for assessment of hedge effectiveness, and other matters related to hedge accounting are as follows:
(1) Hedging instruments and hedged items
Hedging instrument: Forward foreign exchange contracts
Hedged items: Foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, and
forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
(2) Hedging policy
Hedging instruments are used within the amounts of foreign currency denominated transactions, and the Company makes it a policy not to use derivatives for speculative purposes.
(3) Method for assessment of hedge effectiveness
Since material terms related to hedged items and hedging instruments are substantially identical, and the market fluctuations is expected to be completely offset continuously at the time of and after the inception of the related hedge, assessment of hedging effectiveness
is omitted.
Assessment of effectiveness is omitted also for the forward foreign exchange contracts, under which the hedged items are translated using the forward contract rates.
(q) Appropriations of Retained Earnings
Appropriations of retained earnings at each year-end are reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the following year upon shareholders’ approval.
(r) Shareholders’ Equity
Japanese companies are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Act”). The Act provides that an amount equal to 10% of the amount to be disbursed as distributions of capital surplus (other than the capital reserve) and retained earnings (other than the legal reserve)
be transferred to the capital reserve and the legal reserve, respectively, until the sum of the capital reserve and legal reserve equals 25% of the stated capital. Such distributions can be made at any time by resolution of the shareholders or by the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met. The above-mentioned legal reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
(s) Dividends per Share
Cash dividends per share shown for each year in the accompanying consolidated statements of income represent dividends approved or declared as applicable to the respective years.

9. Financial Instruments
(a) Outline of financial instruments
(1) Policy for using financial instruments
The Group is managing its cash surplus in the form of low-risk financial instruments with high liquidity, while raising short-term working capital through loans from financial institutions including banks. Derivatives are used, not for speculative purposes, but to manage exposure to financial risks as described below.
(2) Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
Trade receivables such as notes and accounts receivable–trade are exposed to customers’ credit risk. Trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuation risk. Marketable and investment securities are mainly held-to- maturity debt securities and equity securities, which are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations.
Payment terms of trade payables, such as notes and accounts payable–trade and electronically recorded obligations–operating, are mostly less than one year. Trade payables in foreign currencies in connection with the import transactions of raw materials are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuation risk. Bank loans are used for short-term working capital.
Derivative transactions used by the Company are only forward foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign exchange fluctuation risk of trade receivables and trade payables denominated in foreign currencies. Please see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (p) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting for details.

  (3) Risk management for financial instruments
a. Credit risk management (customers’ default risk)
For the purpose of managing credit risk of trade receivables within the Group, each concerned department, according to the credit management rules, is managing payment terms and balances of each major customer by regularly monitoring their status, in an effort to achieve early identification and mitigation of default risk of customers arising from their deteriorating financial condition and other factors.
Held-to-maturity debt securities held by the Company are, under the short-term investment rules, restricted to those with superior ratings only, involving minimal credit risk.
The Company enters into derivative transactions only with high credit rating financial institutions to mitigate the counterparty risk.
b. Market risk management (foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuation risks)
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts as appropriate to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk associated with trade receivables and trade payables denominated in foreign currencies.
With respect to marketable and investment securities, the Company is periodically monitoring fair values and financial positions of the related issuers (business counterparties), etc.
Derivative transactions are conducted under the authority of the general manager at each concerned department, in accordance with the forward foreign exchange contracts management rules, and the execution result of derivative transactions is reported to the Accounting Department and other concerned departments, as each transaction takes place. At the end of each month, the outstanding balance of forward foreign exchange contracts is reported to the directors in charge, as well as to other concerned departments. The consolidated subsidiary is not engaged in derivative transactions.
c. Liquidity risk management on fund-raising
The Company manages its liquidity risk by the Accounting Department preparing and updating the cash management plan as appropriate based on the report from each concerned department.
(4) Supplementary explanation concerning fair values of financial instruments
Fair values of financial instruments comprise values determined based on market prices, if available, and reasonably determined values if quoted market prices are not available. Since variable factors are incorporated in computing the relevant fair values of financial instruments whose quoted market prices are not available, such fair values may vary depending on different assumptions.
(5) Concentration of credit risks
As of March 31, 2021, 61% of all trade receivables was with specific major accounts.
(b) Fair values of financial instruments
Carrying amount, fair value, and difference of the financial instruments as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows. Financial instruments whose fair values are extremely difficult to determine are excluded from the following table:

The Group’s reportable segments are those for which separate financial information is available and regular evaluation by the Board of Directors is being performed in order to decide how resources are allocated within the Group.
The Group produces and sells medical products, medical devices and agrochemicals and rents real estate, operating each business by category of industry. Each business operates on its own initiative, and creates comprehensive business strategies in conducting its business activities. The Group consists of segments by category of industry based on the operation
of business; therefore, it consists of two reportable segments: “Pharmaceuticals” and “Real estate.”
“Pharmaceuticals” mainly produces and sells medical products, medical devices, and agrochemicals.
“Real estate” mainly rents out Bunkyo Green Court.
(b) Method of calculating net sales, profit, assets, and other items by reportable segment
Accounting policies for the reportable segments are consistent with those described in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Profit by reportable segment is based on operating profit.
Corporate assets are not allocated to each reportable segment. However, related expenses are allocated to each reportable segment using reasonable criteria.

The AEON MALL Group is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living. Under
this management philosophy, we aim to be a company that touches the hearts of the 5 billion people throughout Asia. Accordingly, in FY2018, we began publishing an integrated report for our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders to encourage a better understanding of our initiatives toward corporate value creation over the medium and long term.
In editing this integrated report, we have provided information we deemed important from the standpoint of medium- and long-term corporate value creation. Our efforts referenced the International Integrated Reporting Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Among other topics, this integrated report addresses our strengths developed as a retail-based mall business, our value creation process and future strategies, business activities forming the foundation of value creation, and ESG initiatives. Further, we provide information related to those ESG initiatives that have a significant impact on corporate value creation based on considerations of materiality. Please see our CSR/ESG Report (overview of CSR activities), CSR website, and IR website for more information related to ESG.

 Value Creation Story
Our History of Value Creation
AEON MALL continues to evolve in response to changing lifestyles.
As ever, we remain committed to growing and developing, both in Japan and overseas.
1992–
2000–
Ongoing need to revitalize communities
A community-based space offering a wide range of lifestyle services
As we expand to residential and business districts throughout Japan, AEON MALL has extended beyond the framework of commercial facilities. We have evolved into infrastructure for local communities, offering entertainment, public administrative and community functions, and disaster relief support. We played a role in reactivating communities by responding to calls for opening AEON MALL shopping centers.
Three Laws Related to Town Development
Deregulation resulted in examining large-scale stores according to social vectors, including the impact on the economy and living environment. Authority shifted from the national to the local level.
*The Three Laws related to town development are defined as the (1) City Planning Act, which governs zoning (land use regulations), (2) the Large- scale Retail Location Law, which sets up systems to coordinate with local communities, and (3) the City Center Revitalization Act, which supports the revitalization of city centers.

Environmental management system ISO 14001 certification
 The rise of motorization
Innovating customer shopping experiences through malls in suburbs across Japan
The first AEON MALL location, AEON MALL Tsugaru Kashiwa (Aomori Pref.), opened in 1992 amid growing domestic motorization. A mall with a large parking
lot and diverse tenants offering a wide variety of merchandise in a suburban area proved successful from the aspect of town planning in attracting customers who drove to the store in their own cars. It was the harbinger of an era in which lifestyles shifted from urban areas and train stations to the suburbs.
Large-Scale Retail Stores Law
Audits required for large store openings for store area, closing time, number of days closed, etc. In 1994, restrictions on store size, application procedures, closing times, and closing days were eased.

A growing community presence in Japan and overseas
2017–
A growing middle class in Asia
Becoming the dominant commercial developer in Asia, striving to resolve local issues in Japan and overseas
In China and the ASEAN, AEON MALL serves as a partner urban and regional development. We build malls that respond to strong consumer markets. In Japan, AEON is confronting the challenge of weakened connections within communities due to declining
birth rates and an aging population. Here, we pursue value by working with local governments as a leader in regional revitalization.
Unique malls tailored to the characteristics of each region and country
Shopping centers throughout Japan became more homogenized and subject to even more competition. AEON MALL developed unique malls that focused on localization, pursuing a strategy of opening in growth areas of Asia seeing an expansion of the middle class. We are increasing our presence in local communities both in Japan and overseas.

  Value Creation Story
The Strengths of AEON MALL
AEON MALL has cultivated six strengths as we continue to grow along with the communities we serve.
We will endeavor to further deepen the foundations of our business by improving on these strengths.
5 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT
  Strength
1
Ability to generate and procure funds for growth
We generate cash flows through managing and operating shopping malls. This allows us to maintain a consistently sound financial position and leverage borrowing capacity to procure funds. We generate growth funds through the sale of mall land and buildings to real estate investment trusts and the
use of development leases. These vehicles allow us access to flexible investments
in growth, while accelerating the speed of return on investment and improving asset efficiency.

Robust network
AEON MALL has built a nationwide network in Japan together with our tenants. Through these close strategic partnerships, we advance initiatives designed to meet local needs. We use a customer service role playing contest to build a stronger awareness of customer service and help staff share best practices and expertise that transcend any one particular line of business. These contests lead to higher

  In these times of climate change and COVID-19, we will only solve social issues and provide new value by appreciating the connections between all and by leveraging AEON MALL as a social foundation.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
     My Responsibilities as President
I was appointed president and CEO in March 2020. Today, we face unprecedented social structure reform, business innovations driven by digital technology, and many other incredible changes. Since my appointment, we have been threatened by the spread of COVID-19 and a seeming mountain of other issues to resolve.
It is against this backdrop that I assumed leadership of AEON MALL, and I am resolved to not only overcome these issues, but also humbled to take the helm leading our future.
I joined AEON MALL in 2005 after working at a development consulting firm. Having worked in new property market analysis, concept, budget planning, and other planning and development, I was called to oversee development in the Eastern Japan area.
The Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 occurred during my tenure. I remember vividly the devastation in the disaster area. I also remember clearly searching for ways every day to contribute to recovery and reconstruction
through our work.
In 2016, I received an unexpected
assignment to head up our local entity in Vietnam. I realized then that AEON MALL was a company that encouraged its people to take on interesting and new challenges not normally experienced. I learned that overseas, people will not provide their support for a new action without a clear reason why. In this sense, I was fortunate in working overseas to learn how to lead others from the perspective of a manager. I came to experience and understand how to move an organization.
When I assumed this new position, I presented two perspectives for achieving our Vision for 2025: (1) How do we provide new value to the markets and continue to create customer value and (2) How do we increase not only economic value, but also social value.
I believe we are a company that seeks diversity among our employees and places the utmost importance on what we think and do. I also believe we foster our people based on these principles. If I were to point out
an issue upon my return to Japan, I would say that it is the issue of homogeneity. Even

 Value Creation Strategies
Message from the President and CEO
 when an individual has different thoughts or ideas, it is easy for us to fall into the trap of feeling pressure to conform within a large organization. Outside perspectives are important to respond flexibly to changes
in society. However, organizations tend to develop cultures that discourage things that aren’t normal or commonly done within the framework. I don’t like the word normal , myself. In this rapidly changing market, we must avoid being caught up in our own way of thinking, and I believe this attitude is what our organization expects of me. I am aware that my role requires me to keep an eye on the market, responding quickly and flexibly.
The most important aspect of managing our local subsidiary in Vietnam was my desire to keep our employees employed and house d, no matter what. I believe that a company must grow in line with the growth of its employees, maintaining employment and offering fair opportunities leading to positions commensurate with motivation and performance.
My motto is, It always seems impossible until it's done, a quote from former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. I understand this to mean one can either envision a future and work to make it a reality or not. To achieve something requires all members of a team to
desire change, working together to achieve something as yet unseen. We tend to think innovation is about making dramatic changes. In fact, innovation is the accumulation of 10% or 15% advancements, rather than a sudden change. The accumulation of small changes leads to big innovations. I believe this quote encompasses this meaning.
This is the foundation of our approach
to ESG management. What is a corporate philosophy? When we think about the purpose of a company's existence, we think of working hard for the benefit of our customers and the community, creating value that brings joy
to everyone, rather than pursuing profit and working hard for money. I believe that profit
is like the fuel that runs an engine sustaining our desire to provide value to society. In our approach to ESG management, in other words, in the process of solving social issues and securing continued existence, we consider non-financial information to be a compass
for assessing corporate risks and determining action. How we balance the present and the future is the essence of our business, and in
a large real estate business such as ours, we invest looking ahead 10 or 15 years into the future. In this decision-making process, it is important to find a balance between financial information and non-financial information, or
in other words, be wary of making decisions
of making decisions based on numbers alone. This is an absolute requirement for a company to be sustainable, and I believe the companies that survive over the long term are the ones

     committed to these standards.
In terms of ESG initiatives, environment
(E) is simple and straightforward. We are also moving forward in improving governance (G). Society (S) may be the area in which we are weakest. People often forget the purpose behind what they have been doing. What they do often becomes the purpose itself. It's very important to clarify the purpose behind what we are doing. The value of a company's existence is the link between responses to social issues and management decisions. This means providing solutions to the needs and issues of our customers and communities. We must pay close attention to these social issues and offer clear answers.
<The impact of COVID-19 on Our Businesses>
An outbreak of a global crisis exactly of the type of the COVID-19 pandemic results in the closures of all stores in Japan and overseas. This reminds us that the world is one and that crises have an enormous impact on business activities.
We are taking measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, China, and ASEAN. In particular, our response in China taught us about COVID-19 preventive measures and customer trends during the pandemic. Through this process, we were able to respond more quickly in Japan than our competitors,
and our initiatives have become a standard.
<Rent Reductions and Exemptions>
Reducing rents temporarily for our specialty retailers was an extremely pivotal business decision. While the impact on our performance this year was not insignificant, we made this decision based on a longer-term vision. As mall traffic declines and we see more constraints
on business operations, our first priority is to support the ongoing business of our business partners and the continued employment of their employees. Our malls engage in mall management and operations together with our tenants. While we will not know whether our decision to reduce rents was correct until next year—or maybe even the year after next—the decision was not made from the standpoint of investment. We made the decision because this was the stance we knew we should make for our business partners.
<Growing Business in the Post-COVID-19 Era>
I presented my management policy in 2018, when I was in charge of our Vietnamese subsidiary. Even at that time, I stated that we must deal with the new normal. From a global perspective, I am talking about Industry 4.0 . In the future, we must prepare for initiatives that are relevant to a new era in terms beyond quarantines. The first challenge is customer experience. How do we provide value to customers at our malls? This is a question that has never changed, whether pre- or post- COVID-19.

 Value Creation Strategies
Message from the President and CEO
 Obviously, we must also move ahead
with digital transformation (DX). Our current three-year medium-term management plan begins this fiscal year, fiscal 2020. This is
an extremely important three-year period
that will bridges to our next medium-term management plan leading up to 2025. The fact that we must transition structurally came suddenly and unexpectedly with COVID-19. Over the course of three short months,
the lifestyles of our customers underwent inevitable change. Remote work and the expansion of online shopping will no doubt see continued improvements in quality and users will continue to increase in number. Knowing this, we must analyze trends carefully and rethink what we should be as a business. I have no doubt that there is no growth without change. It is important for us to provide value
through new initiatives, combining real-world experiences and DX.
<Revised Financial Indicators (FY2025 Targets)>
The main reason for revising our financial indicators is the application of IFRS 16 at overseas subsidiaries beginning in fiscal 2019. As we enter a new growth stage, it will be difficult for us to measure our future initiatives and investments under our old financial indicators. Overseas, in particular, cash flow is important. Although our basic philosophy has not changed, we will focus more on growth potential as we engage in dialogue with external parties. Our target financial indicators

     leading to fiscal 2025 will be EPS growth of
7% (annualized growth between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2025), net interest-bearing debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times or less, and return on invested capital of at least 5%.
<Vision for 2025>
This is our Vision for 2025 (see P.19). In our basic approach to achieving this vision, our business requires significant investment, which also involves a great deal of risk. In addition
to our ongoing views of this risk, we must be transparent and accountable for the investments we make. In this way, we will create social value and economic value, achieving sustainable growth in partnership with our local communities.
<Performance Targets (FY2020-2022)>
Our numerical plan for fiscal 2022 is to
achieve operating revenue of ¥390 billion and operating income of ¥74 billion. One major key to achieving these targets is how we approach our investments in the post-COVID-19 era. We must perform a careful review of investment quality, structural reform, and our business portfolio itself. I believe we will need to change our approach if we are to achieve our targets.
COVID-19 will have an enormous impact on fiscal 2020. We expect consumption trends will be extremely challenging and that we must implement different measures to achieve our
fiscal year earnings plan. Continuity in tenant behavioral changes, even in the most trivial details and careful considerations on a day-to- day basis, will become very important. As well, agile initiatives that are executed quickly and revised as necessary will lead to better results. Engaging with speed to address risks and social issues will lead to achieving or even exceeding our earnings plan. And achieving our earnings plan will be a sign that we have changed the mindset of our entire organizations.
<Growth Measures (FY2020-FY2022)>
Our three-year medium-term management plan focuses on four growth initiatives: (1) Achieve high profit growth overseas; (2) Achieve stable growth in Japan; (3) Build a finance mix and governance structures supporting growth; and (4) Pursue ESG-based management.
• Achieving high profit growth overseas AEON MALL Hoang Mai (tentative name), scheduled to open in 2022, will be our third mall in the Hanoi area and located roughly 6 km south of Hanoi City center. The site offers excellent access, including National Route
1 serving as the entrance to central Hanoi,
and a transportation terminal consisting of a bus terminal with routes to train stations and suburbs and a taxi drop-off point. This is a station area under rapid development. Given the nature of the location, we will offer parking for roughly 3,000 vehicles (lack of parking in central Hanoi is quite a social issue today) and office space on the upper floors of the facility. We intend to create a shopping environment

 based on careful market research that offers new experiences and excitement to customers. In addition, we plan to obtain LOTUS* and other environmental standards certifications in a first attempt of its kind for the AEON Group in Vietnam. It is extremely important that we focus carefully on investment quality in this way overseas. Post-COVID-19 will change our overseas businesses in significant ways. Market research will be even more important, as the markets change more dynamically overseas than in Japan. We will monitor local market trends carefully, making investment decisions while taking into account the risks involved.

• Achieving stable growth in Japan
Our core strategy for stable growth in Japan remains to create dominant malls in each region. At the same time, COVID-19 has caused certain changes, and we must consider the messages we convey to the market. AEON MALL will continue to proceed steadily in investments, although we will need to change our investment style and quality. We will
need to look at our ideal Vision for 2025 and perform backcasting once again.
•Building a financing mix and governance
structures supporting growth
While our overseas businesses have been funded by investments from Japan, cash flows are expanding in both China and ASEAN. Here, we must build a cash management system
that emphasizes efficiency and safety through
a global finance mix, including a mechanism
to use cash generated in one country across other countries. We will also strengthen our management system for faster decision-making, while building a governance system that responds to the advance of globalization.
<Pursuing ESG-based management>
As I mentioned earlier, our mission with respect to ESG-based management is to consider
the value we should offer together with our partners as we monitor changes in the social environment, providing safe, secure, and comfortable lifestyles for the customers and the communities in every country in which
we do business. To this end, we will leverage the diversity of our employees and create an environment in which everyone can fulfill their potential. At the same time, we will deepen our relationships of trust with customers, local communities, business partners, and other stakeholders, striving to enhance the value of the AEON MALL further.
<Public Listing of Parent and Subsidiary>
Our parent company, AEON Co., Ltd., owns the majority of AEON MALL shares. We recognize that the relationship of a publicly traded
parent and subsidiary is of great interest to our shareholders. While companies in the AEON Group appear to be similar in ways, in fact we occupy different positions and conduct business across a wide range of areas. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, each company executes its own best strategy while coordinating with
17 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT

       other companies in the AEON Group. We are in an unprecedented environment and times of rapid change and uncertainty. It is extremely important to make decisions with a sense of urgency, recognizing the social nature of a corporation and our role in society. I want to make it clear to our stakeholders that, as a publicly traded company, we make certain decisions with speed and based on our sense of social responsibility.
Our business model is to make our malls a part of the social infrastructure, and make this social infrastructure a part of the local community. As IT and DX advance, climate change, COVID-19, and other real-world matters have brought
unprecedented experiences. It is precisely in times like these that human connections are so very important. We want the members of our organization to understand each other, leveraging their strengths, and emphasizing the value produced through co-creation. Our business cannot merely serve as a platform to accomplish our own vision; it must be an open platform for society. It must also be a platform rooted firmly in the community.
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of the shopping center industry does not necessarily look bright. But there are many things yet we can do—must do—to solve social issues. Here is where the purpose of our existence, our social role, and social responsibilities lie. I ask for the understanding and support of you, our stakeholders, as we move forward.

One of our growth policies is to achieve high profit growth overseas.
The two main pillars in pursuit of this goal are accelerating new mall openings and strengthening the earning power of existing malls.
Further Expansion of Operations in China and ASEAN
Overseas
COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since the beginning of 2020. Despite these circumstances, we remain convinced that globalization will not roll back, even by COVID-19, and that Asia will become the center of the world in the post-COVID-19 era. Therefore, we plan to expand our overseas business spurred by our recognition that Asia will remain a growth market and that the development of the world depends on the development of Asian countries such as China, Southeast Asia, and India, where the majority of the world’s population live.
We will increase our dominance in areas where

we already operate malls and actively enter new areas at the same time. In China, we will focus on building new malls, particularly in the inland areas where market growth is higher than in the coastal areas. In ASEAN, we plan to continue accelerating mall openings in Vietnam, our highest priority area. We aim to operate 35 malls in ASEAN by FY2025, out of which we plan to operate 20 malls in Vietnam. Moreover, we have decided to open our first mall ever in Myanmar in 2023. We will establish a joint venture company with the largest real estate developer in Myanmar and develop properties to open more locations.

    AEON MALL Overseas Strengths and Growth
We have five strengths that help us expand our overseas business:
(1) Large parking capacity in response to motorization
(2) Ability to create a sales area localized to the community
(3) More entertainment options to meet the demand for experiential consumption
(4) Events that attract customers
(5) Safe, secure, pleasant facilities
The expertise in mall management and operations we developed in in Japan allows us to develop competitive malls overseas. While overseas developers tend to emphasize efficiency, our malls in China and ASEAN feature large flat parking areas, reflecting our understanding of the future growth of motorization
in these regions. These parking lots also serve as a competitive advantage for use in future expansion.
■Profit Growth Model (¥100 million)
We conduct mall management and operations that compare favorably with our malls in Japan, offering safe, secure, pleasant facilities on par with those in Japan. This is another factor that contributes to our superior market position.
In addition to our strengths noted above, our unique growth model for malls will contribute in significant ways to future business expansion. Costs remain at a constant level under this growth model,
as real estate costs account for the majority of mall operating costs. At the same time, we grow operating revenue from commission rental income and revisions in rental fees tied to increases in sales. In this way, mall revitalizations generate further profit improvements in the time after the expiration of three-year tenant lease agreements. In so doing, we can post the same level of profits as those of our malls in Japan within seven or eight years after opening.

Accelerating New Mall Openings
Search for and secure properties to accelerate future mall openings
AEON MALL engages in three measures to create systems that accelerate new mall openings overseas. The first measure is to create an organization education system. In particular, we cultivate human resources capable of working overseas. We established a human resources program that we call the Global Human Resources Course. We also pursue mall management localization by developing local managers. The second measure is to foster partnerships with local communities. From this perspective in China and ASEAN, where economic policy focuses on the development of social infrastructure, we are developing properties in urban development areas with advancing urbanization. The last measure is financing. An investment of several tens of billions of yen is required to open a large mall, and return on investment requires an extended period of time. Therefore, efficient fund-raising is an essential factor in opening more locations. We will accelerate new mall openings in ASEAN under our new three-year plan and the following three-year plan. We also plan to open master lease malls (as in China), in addition to directly managed malls.

     Strengthen the Earnings Capacity of Existing Malls
Expansions and renovations
Our overseas malls are growing at a faster pace than the overall macro trends prevailing in each country. One reason is the active expansions and renovations we conduct in locations with high potential growth rates. We operate 30 malls overseas. We must build profits through top line growth at our existing malls. Tenant lease agreements expire in three years overseas. When agreements expire, we replace a large number of tenants to enhance the freshness of our malls. By doing so, we continue to grow sales overseas, where changes are more drastic than in Japan.
Creating mall environments via utilizing digital technology/live commerce
To meet the growing needs for digitalization in China and ASEAN, we focus on creating mall environments via digital technology. In March 2020, we initiated live commerce in China. This program offers a new shopping experience through the integration of in- person and online shopping. Live commerce is a
new sales approach that combines video and online shopping. Influencers or tenant employees appear in live broadcasts to sell products online. We installed live broadcast booths in our malls, available to tenants free of charge. We plan to create more points of contact with customers in the future through digital transformation.
Live broadcast booth installation and use free of charge
Improving customer service, operational efficiencies, etc.
We will increase support for our malls overseas by creating the same level of mall environment and providing the same level of operations as in Japan, using the most advanced digital technologies. We will also conduct periodic educational programs for staff members to improve customer service.
Customer Service Role-Playing Contest, in which tenant employees compete by displaying the customer service skills acquired through educational seminars (Vietnam)

Priority Measures in Japan
We pursue three pillars in our domestic business to achieve stable growth: (1) strengthen the earning power of existing malls, (2) open new malls, and (3) improve profits for our urban shopping center business.
Strengthening the Earning Power of Existing Malls
 Japan
 Securing a position as the overwhelmingly dominant mall in the region
To strengthen the earning power of existing malls, we will continue to emphasize profitable mall revitalization projects, attract new customers, and explore potential consumer demand. Tenant lease agreements expire
in six years in Japan. When agreements expire, we replace existing tenants with popular tenants or tenants in high demand among customers in the region.
In this way, we continue maintain and improve the
freshness and attractiveness of our malls. We leverage floor space expansions to strengthening the already overwhelmingly dominant mall in each region, achieving even higher levels of dominance. We plan to expand floor space at eight malls under our current three-year plan and renovate 10 malls each year.

       Adding functions to create new incentives for customer visits
We are expanding mall functions to offer new incentives for customers to visit. The family segment in Japan is contracting due to a decreasing population, declining birth rate, and aging population. At the same time, consumer behavior is diversifying in conjunction with the advancement of e-commerce. Faced with these changes,
Happiness Mall
We pursue the Happiness
Mall project, which provides opportunities for mall walking, relaxation, and excitement through experiences of live music and art. Happiness Malls support the good health and wellbeing of customers in community. Our goal is to provide commercial facilities that put more smiles on the faces of customers and encourage good health.
Expanding Public Functions
AEON MALL is adding more public functions for customer convenience, including post offices, administrative services branch offices, libraries, and polling stations for early voting. We also work with the Japan Red Cross to provide blood donation centers at our malls throughout Japan, and we raise awareness of the need for blood donations from people of all ages, particularly younger donors.
Creating Smart Malls
we sponsor various events for health and wellness for our new target segment, the senior market. We also offer public functions and facilities that serve as a foundation for local communities and create smart malls that provide an easy-to-shop environment through digital technologies.
In this way, we enhance mall functions through new incentives and conveniences that attract customers, and by attracting customers, we improve profits.

Priority Measures in Japan
Japan
Opening New Malls
Construction costs remain high in Japan. From a standpoint of efficiency, we plan to open new malls in unserved areas and develop malls based on new ideas that utilize the assets of the AEON Group. Specifically, we will open new malls based on new formats, renovate malls utilizing existing assets, and build malls that offer attractions only available in person. One example of new mall development model, is the Yahata Higashida Project, where we will open our second location (THE OUTLETS) on the site of the former Space World amusement park in the City of Kitakyushu. The City of Kitakyushu plans to move its New Science Center to the site. Our new location will be an upgraded version of our first in Hiroshima, THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA. This new facility will be located adjacent to AEON MALL Yahata Higashi. We plan to enhance the ordinary function of this traditional mall to create a synergy effect with the non-daily concept of THE OUTLETS.
We will connect this property and AEON MALL Yahata Higashi by a pedestrian deck to operate as an integral unit. We also plan to open AEON MALL Shinrifu South Wing, which will focus on entertainment events, in the winter of 2020. This mall will be one of the largest in
the Tohoku region. We have taken the concept from our experience with AEON MALL Sen Sok City in Cambodia, where customers reacted enthusiastically to the entertainment-forward merchandising and experiential nature of the mall that far exceeded expectations. As with the Yahata Higashida project, we will strengthen daily functions of the adjacent AEON MALL Rifu and provide non-daily, experience-oriented functions to secure an overwhelming position in the region.

         Improving Urban Shopping Center Business Income
Our urban shopping center business plans to improve profits through comprehensive renovations, limiting the number of new openings. Our first order of business is
to reactivate existing facilities. We began focusing on reactivating existing shopping centers in FY2019, and
we intend to continue this approach. Second, we intend to improve profits by changing ownership formats, management, and operating schemes. We plan to improve profits at Yokohama World Porters, where OPA operated a facility, by converting original developer YOKOHAMA IMPORTMART INC. into a subsidiary. In this way, we will manage facility operations directly. We will close Tenjin VIVRE temporarily due to construction on the Tenjin Big Bang Project, a large redevelopment project
in the Tenjin and Hakata area in the city of Fukuoka. We intend to reactivate this location through participation in the project. Third, we plan to improve profits through
our assets by leveraging the characteristics of land near railway stations, for example, offering shared office space. Through these initiatives, we will expand the efforts to improve profits that we started in FY2019.

     Mall Operations for the With-COVID-19 Era
As part of the measures for living with COVID-19, we have implemented anti-infection measures in a continual manner, rather than as a temporary initiative. We have already established the COVID-19 Protocol for Infectious Disease Control to strengthen anti-infection measures
in our malls and anywhere else for employees and customers and ensure safe shopping environment.
The aims of the COVID-19 Protocol for Infectious Disease Control are to (1) create a society where anti- infection measures are an ordinary part of life, (2) protect the health and lifestyles of our customers and employees, and (3) work together with customers to the safe and secure lifestyles of regional communities. We drew up the protocol under the supervision of three experts in anti-infection measures. Our intention is to establish clear anti-infection criteria based on anti-infection measures that we had implemented to date and use the criteria to educate employees on the
prevention of epidemics. At the same time, we are raising customer awareness about the issue.
One of the specific initiatives in our malls is to improve ventilation. We have generated better air circulation in mall facilities by controlling air balance, which is achieved by raising positive pressure through the intake of outside air. To create more comfortable shopping environment, we have increased the volume of outside air intake for even better ventilation.
Furthermore, we have implemented the following eight measures to ensure safe and secure shopping at all AEON MALLs.
 1 Check employee temperatures as they enter the facilities.
2 Install hand sanitizer stations at all entrances and exits.
3 Thoroughly disinfect all high customer contact areas throughout our facilities.
4 Run the facility ventilation systems at full power and create air flow throughout the facilities for ventilation.
5 Install acrylic panels, vinyl curtains, and other barriers for face-to-face customer service to prevent droplet infection.
6 Ensure ventilation and seat separation in food courts and other restaurants.
7 Post notices asking those with fevers or other symptoms to refrain from entering the facilities.
8 Implement a customer count system to monitor the
number of customers in the facilities and restrict the entry of customers when the specified number is exceeded.

Building a Financing Mix and Governance Structure
AEON MALL has established a financing mix and governance structure to support measures for growth. We are focusing on three measures designed to establish a global management system that responds to the expansion of our businesses overseas.
 Global Financing Mix
We procure funds as an integrated entity, both Japan and overseas. In other words, we are pursuing a global financing mix. While expanding our base of loans from domestic banks, we also identify overseas local banks for future sources of financing. We continue to issue domestic retail bonds on a regular basis. In addition, we offer a variety of other bonds in response to growing
Optimizing Cash Management
As our businesses overseas grow and transition to a stage of profit generation, cash balances in certain areas are growing significantly. We will consider efficient cash management methods moving forward, potentially shifting cash from areas with excess funds to areas with stronger needs for cash.
Movement of Excess Cash
Advanced Risk Management
The Risk Management Committee identifies risks in business activities in Japan to understand the probability and impact of individual risks, while improving risk management in China and ASEAN. We plan to bolster our management, focusing specifically on risk management, including operation risk, security risk, social risk, and political risk. We gather information in advance using past experience in cooperation with local governments, public safety commissions, our legal advisers and AEON Group companies to identify operation risk that may have a significant impact on mall development and business. At the same time, we eliminate risk through coordination with government-related entities. Regulations and directives issued by the authorities related to firefighting
interest in ESG among investors. We remain aware
of financial soundness and pay attention to our ratio
of debt to equity. We consider equity financing as a direct method to expand equity. Here, we continue to monitor movements in the stock market and investigate the potential for equity financing overseas.
In building our global cash management system, we recognize the need for stronger cash monitoring functions from the standpoint of governance and fraud prevention. We plan to investigate various measures, including the adoption of external systems.
Invest, Lend Within the Group
have become more stricter. Meanwhile, we are seeing increased scrutiny on ESG-based management, focusing on environmental protection (waste separation, smoking areas, and waste water treatment), interactions with local communities and organizations, and corporate governance. In response to these developments, AEON MALL began creating specific action plans regarding a total of 58 risk items in FY2018. Committee members have been working on action plans and exchanging opinions to examine their effectiveness. In FY2019,
we established and implemented the Emergency Management Manual (in Japanese, Chinese, and in the languages of ASEAN member countries) and Basic Policy for Preventing Bribery (in Chinese)

     Pursuing ESG-Based Management
In 2019, AEON MALL identified Materiality as a priority measure, reflecting the perspective of ESG in maximizing the economic and social values we create through the integration of growth strategies and ESG-based management. This approach is driving us to achieving our goals for 2025.
We pursue management based on a perspective of ESG to achieve sustainable growth and higher levels of corporate value. In addition, we have leveraged COVID-19 as an impetus to seek reform based on ESG concepts, striving to create economic value, social value, and environmental value for our stakeholders.
The current business environment surrounding AEON MALL reflects the emergence of modern shopping centers and high-growth retail markets in connection with overseas GDP growth on the one hand, and accelerated mall openings by competing developers and concerns about a slowing Chinese economy on the other. Other emerging factors include demographic changes in Japan (declining population, aging society, low birthrates), as well as changing family compositions, and changes in consumer behavior, including e-commerce, budget-mindedness, sharing economies, etc. In this changing environment, we will
strive to achieve ESG-based management, defining materialities in terms of regional and social infrastructure development, local community ties, the environment, diversity, work-style reform, and responsible business.
Our Vision for 2025 encompasses more than generating profits from malls in Japan. We aim to build a portfolio consisting of multiple businesses, while becoming a top-class global commercial developer with consolidated operating income in excess of
¥100 billion. Further, we plan to be active in floor space expansions and renovations, evolving into the overwhelmingly dominant mall in each region. In our overseas business, we are targeting an operating margin of 20% across 70 malls, operating at the same level of efficiency and scale as our domestic operations. We are also targeting operating revenue of ¥500 billion and operating income of ¥100 billion.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
   Monthly AEON MALL CSR Council to Achieve ESG-Based Management
AEON MALL believes that solving community social issues is part of our mission as a business. Based on this belief, we aim to achieve the goal of Creating Shared Value (CSV), conducting business integrated with the principles of CSR. The AEON MALL CSR Council, chaired by the president
of our company, meets monthly to discuss details
and progress of important issues related to four areas represented by the Environment (E) Social (S), Governance (G), and Communication, (C). The CSR Council establishes individual committees to oversee progress in certain areas,
such as social contribution and environment.
Under this system, we discussed the installation of
EV chargers and our response to United Nations SDGs in FY2019. The United Nations askes companies to clearly state which SDGs they will pursue and describe how the company will contribute to achieving the SDG in question. AEON MALL intends to conduct more extensive discussions on this topic in the future. We will continue to not only reduce the environmental and social impact of our business activities, but also remain conscious of social demands related to CSR. At the same time, we will seek to further define the direction of and strengthen our activities.

On September 9 and 10, the Boso Peninsula Typhoon landed in the Kanto are of Japan, causing extended power outages, water supply disruptions, the collapse of houses, and other extensive damage in Chiba Prefecture. AEON MALL Kisarazu (Chiba Pref.) fulfilled its function as part of the regional infrastructure, playing a role as a base for recovery activities.
Smart Mall Initiatives
AEON MALL aims to create smart malls that use digital technology for more convenient shopping experiences. AEON MALL Makuhari Shintoshin (Chiba Pref.) is serving as a pilot mall for a variety of leading-edge technologies.
Encouraging the Spread and Use
of Electric Vehicles (EV)
In 2008, AEON MALL began installing EV recharging stations at our malls. We encourage the use of low-CO2 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as one measure
to preserve the global environment create sustainable societies. As of the end of February 2020, we have installed 1,837 recharging networks at 138 malls throughout Japan. We have also installed 564 units at 14 malls in China and three units at two malls in ASEAN. AEON MALL Ha Dong (Vietnam) offers 20 EV bike chargers for guests.
Polling Stations
As one way to improve lifestyle services for the community, AEON MALL locations offer polling stations during elections. Our polling stations serve as comfortable environments for customers to exercise their voting rights with access to large parking areas and shuttle buses. Our polling stations also provide a convenient way for employees working at our malls to vote. For the 25th regular election of members of the House of Councillors in July 2019, AEON MALL and AEON shopping centers offered poll locations for early voting (and same-day voting in some locations).

   Evolving AEON MALL Walking in Collaboration With Industry, Government, and Academia
To support the healthy lifestyles of our customers, we offer AEON MALL Walking at nearly all malls in Japan. These malls feature a walking course in which customers can enjoy shopping and physical exercise regardless
of the season, weather, or time. In collaboration with the Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University, AEON MALL Miyazaki (Miyazaki Pref.) and AEON MALL Higashiura (Aichi Pref.) offer a Spatial Design Program based on Primordial Prevention to promote health awareness. AEON MALL Miyazaki is also working to raise awareness of health in cooperation with the official Miyazaki Prefecture walking smartphone application SALKO, which features a pedometer and ranking functions.
Supporting the Sport in Life Project
We have been cooperating with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Japan Sports Agency in their efforts to promote health. In 2019, we endorsed the new Sport in Life project advocated by the Japan Sports Agency. For two months beginning in July, we implemented a sports experience event called Mall de Sports. This event used the cool and
comfortable mall environment at nearly 150 malls for customers to experience the fun of moving their bodies while attending sports experience events and shopping.
Supporting Refugee Aid Activities
As an opportunity to deepen our understanding of refugees around the world, we conducted a campaign in collaboration with the UNHCR Association, the official support agency of UNHCR (UN High Commissioner
for Refugees), during the period before and after the June 20 World Refugee Day, sponsored by the United Nations General Assembly. We set up booths at 29 malls to provide information about refugees and raise funds. We also invited a lecturer to give a speech at AEON MALL Kyoto Katsuragawa (Kyoto Pref.) and AEON MALL Tamadairanomori (Tokyo).
Sustainable Town Development
Agreement With Saiseikai
AEON MALL entered into an agreement with the Social Welfare Organization Saiseikai Imperial Gift Foundation, which embodies social inclusion through the comprehensive provision of medical, health, and welfare activities. Through this support, we contribute to local town development where AEON MALL and Saiseikai have operations. As the first step in our contribution activities in June 2019, we sponsored a health-themes AEON MALL Walking event and medical field career experience for children at AEON MALL Takaoka (Toyama Pref.).

Eliminating Plastic Straws at all Malls
and Working toward a Complete Ban
on Disposable Plastic Products
In recent years, we have seen a worldwide rise in initiatives to reduce the use of plastic products, considered to have a negative impact on ocean life and marine ecosystems. We are doing our part for the cause, achieving a 94.9% recycling rate for waste plastics in fiscal year 2019. In this and other ways, we are striving to create sustainable malls and conserve the global environment. Our ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the use of disposable plastic products. As the first step, we discontinued providing plastic straws in eating and drinking facilities at all malls on March 16, 2020 (some exceptions applied). For customers who wish to use straws, we offer paper straws and other environmentally friendly alternatives. We will continue to work together with store operators to reduce the use of plastics.
Utilization of Solar Energy
Using solar energy systems at 88 malls
We deployed solar power system at 71 malls in Japan and 17 malls overseas, demonstrating leadership ahead of other commercial facilities. Some of our malls incorporate a system for uninterrupted electricity in the case of a power failure. We installed a 1MW rooftop solar power system and a high-efficiency chiller in our AEON MALL Sen Sok City facility in Cambodia, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 1,564 tons per year.
Driving Energy Conservation
Initiatives Forward
We are striving to reduce energy use by 50% compared
to the year 2010, as specified in the AEON Eco Project launched in 2012. As a new initiative, the AEON Group
is aiming to achieve a decarbonized society by the year 2050, as described in the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050 announced in March 2018. The group plans to accomplish this goal by promoting energy conservation, the use of renewable energy, and other measures. To date, 13 facilities in the AEON Group, 12 of which are operated by AEON MALL, have become environmentally friendly model facilities. We are currently developing the Next- Generation Smart AEON program, a further evolution in our decarbonization. For example, AEON MALL Zama (Kanagawa Pref.) has significantly reduced CO2 emissions compared to standard AEON stores.
AEON Hometown Forest Project
The AEON Hometown Forest Project began in 1991 in Malaysia. The AEON Group regards the tree planting initiative as an activity to embody a philosophy centered on pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always from the customer’s point of view. Every time a new mall
is opened in Japan or overseas, AEON hosts a tree planting ceremony, working with customers to plant native trees most appropriate for the local natural environment. We planted about 28,700 trees at four new malls opened in Japan and overseas in fiscal 2019. As of the end of February 2020, the AEON Group has planted a total of nearly 12.12 million trees.

     Waste Reduction and Recycling
To reduce waste generated from malls, it is important to clearly understand what is disposed of, where, and how much, engaging the help of tenants and making them aware of the issue. Each mall has a system to classify waste into 18 basic categories and measure weight by category. Each tenant measures the weight of waste
by category, and then affixes a label indicating that the weight has been measured. Tenants then place waste in the location designated for each category for disposal. Segregated waste that is recyclable is recycled to the greatest extent possible. We calculate the recycling rate for each category.

Response to Climate Change
As one measure for ESG-oriented management, AEON MALL aims to help create a carbon-less society by the year 2050. In June 2020, we declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD was established in 2016 by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB). In the future, we will be using the TCFD framework to disclose information appropriately.

Carbon pricing
Two types of carbon pricing are anticipated; one is a carbon tax that is applied to crude oil and energy (electricity, gas, and fuel) and the other is cap-and-trade, under which charges vary depending on business-related GHG emissions
We expect tighter restrictions based on the regulations of
the current Energy Saving Act (METI), the Building Energy Efficiency Act (MLIT), and the Act on Rational Use and Appropriate Management of Fluorocarbons (MOE). We also reflect expectations for the establishment of new related laws.
We consider two types of energy prices. One type varies
in response to the unit price of electricity, accounting for about 90% of total GHG emissions discharged from business activities. The other type reflects prices for fossil fuel energy and renewable energy.
We project changes in the geographical suitability of manufacturing and processing related to perishable food raw materials, water resources, and products in Japan and overseas. We must also consider changes in supply and demand due to population increase, which serves as an indirect indicator. These changes impact anchor stores and specialty stores.
Customers refers to citizens, including consumers and ordinary citizens. Changes refers to changes in consumption behavior and awareness.
A risk of operational interruption of a certain number of
stores (areas are unidentifiable) caused by weather damage
is anticipated every year. We use a certain ration to project costs and time for recovery related to malls affected by flood or other physical damage. We project market area contraction some areas due to frequent weather disasters or changes in demographics.

  Providing Comfortable Work Environments
Overseas malls create work opportunities
Since opening our first mall in Beijing in 2008, we
have opened a total of 21 malls in China and nine in Indonesia, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Our basic policy for operating malls overseas is to delegate the operation to local staff members who have a deep understanding of
our philosophy. We focus on the education of human resources in each country. We are also
active in promoting local staff members to management positions.
Initiatives for tenants
We adopt digital technology to improve efficiencies
(e.g. AEON MALL Works in-store tablets), reduce the burden on tenant employees, and promote labor- savings. Labor shortages have become a social issue. As developers, we believe we have a responsibility to create workplace environments that support the long-term careers of tenant employees at our commercial facilities and improve employee satisfaction. We have introduced various measures in pursuit of this belief.
gain experience overseas. We believe that the experience of working with local staff gives Japanese employees the chance to grow and develop in their own careers.

Diversity Policy
The promotion of diversity has a great significance for our business. Diverse human resources are necessary to implement our policy that the customer comes first. This is because a diverse range of customers come to our malls. Creative ideas are born through the active exchange of opinions from diverse points of view. Many highly motivated female employees pursue
Globalization of Human Resources
Our basic policy is to engage in management tied
to local communities by hiring local staff overseas who have a deep understanding of the AEON MALL philosophy. We promote individuals who generate results to management positions, regardless of nationality. In China today, locally hired individuals serve as general managers at seven malls. As well, we are making progress in ASEAN to promote local staff to senior management positions. Meanwhile, we create opportunities for our Japanese employees to
at our malls to contribute to the health and wellness of our customers in local communities. At the same time, we enhance health management by improving work systems and workplace environments in an effort to maintain and improve the health of our employees.

We are building a foundation for comfortable work environments upon which employees can develop their careers.

Accountability in Business
Human Rights Policies, Systems, and Training
   The unwavering principle of AEON is pursuing
peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always from the customer's point of
view. To honor these principles we will comply with
all relevant laws and regulations, while dealing with all people honestly and sincerely through proper behavior. The AEON Code of Conduct was enacted in April
2003 on the basis of these values. In September 2014, AEON codified a philosophy of human rights and the workplace producing AEON's Basic Human Rights Policy in support of the AEON Code of Conduct.
AEON MALL follows this philosophy and these
policies in respect for human rights. The company aspires to create an organization that allows all people, regardless of their gender or nationality, to participate in the development of the company. We strive to create workplaces that enable all employees to perform to the highest level of their abilities.
All AEON MALL employees must attend an annual human rights training. We also provide employees with a handbook that lists both internal and external help desks. This handbook provides clear information about respect for human rights, prevention of discrimination, and other matters in the context of the AEON MALL employment rules.
 AEON Code of Conduct–Our Commitment
1. AEON people are always grateful to the many other individuals who provide support and help, never forgetting to act with humility. 2. AEON people value the trust of others more than anything else, always acting with integrity and sincerity in all situations. 3. AEON people actively seek out ways to exceed customer expectations.
4. AEON people continually challenge themselves to find new ways to accomplish the AEON ideals.
5. AEON people support local community growth, acting as good corporate citizens in serving society.
 AEON Human Rights Policy
In accordance with this policy, all of AEON executives and employees (AEON People) deepen further their understanding of human rights and help achieve a society that respects these rights.
This policy applies to all AEON People, and we share this policy with all business partners.
1. Our Approach to Human Rights
AEON has established the Aeon Basic Principles and the Aeon Code of Conduct. We also subscribe to the United Nations Global Compact, which we joined in 2004. In accordance with these principles and in compliance with domestic laws on human rights and labor, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the rules on human rights set forth in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, we respect the rights of all individuals who are impacted by our businesses. In addition, we support and follow the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
2. Respect for Human Rights in Business Activities
We will respect the privacy of individuals as well as their diverse values and personalities and never discriminate against anyone for any reasons, including discriminatory treatment based on race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, place of birth, religion, educational background, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
In addition, we remain mindful of the positions of others
and respect them as our equals.
• We treat all customers in a fair and impartial manner and
provide them with safe, reliable products and services, as
well as related information.
• We actively communicate with local community members
to ensure that we respect their human rights.
• We comply with sound corporate ethics and workplace
environment-related laws, regulations, and international standards in our business activities by dealing with business partners fairly. Moreover, we improve our performance in this regard continually.
• We listen to our coworkers, respect the human rights of each coworker, and create workplace environments that
are free of harassment, safe, and employee-friendly. At the same time, we train and educate all AEON People to further their knowledge and understanding of human rights.
3. Implementation of Human Rights Due Diligence
We conduct due diligence regarding the human rights impacted by our business activities to contribute to achieving a society in which human rights are respected.

        Value Creation Story
Value Creation Management
  We respect the human rights and the occupational safety and health of all stakeholders. When selecting a general contractor for mall development in overseas, our selection criteria emphasizes the contribution of general contractors to regional development, including the active hiring of local workers and measures for environmental conservation. As the party contracting for services, AEON Mall strives to execute contracts that share the risk burden equally with the contractor, maintaining a high level of fairness between parties.
Moreover, we are committed to the protection of human rights, requiring ID checks for people entering and existing from the work site
to prevent child labor and illegal employment. We also require health checkups of workers.
We pursue initiatives to enhance compliance. We provide compliance training for managers and general employees at each mall and business unit once every year. Participants share the basic knowledge and case studies on violations based on laws, regulations, and internal rules. About two-thirds of employees at a
new AEON MALL facility are newly hired employees. We provide comprehensive employee education at the initial stages to create compliance awareness by interviewing individuals within one year after opening the mall. In the case of harassment or other unfair treatment, tenants and external venders can use our system to report incidents to the compliance division directly via email or phone.

   Executing Fair Contracts for Mall Construction
  Building Internal Control Systems in China and ASEAN
We have established internal control systems in both China and ASEAN to ensure compliance. We have also established a risk management system and conduct audits through our Japanese internal audit division. China
In 2013, we established AEON (China) Investment Co., Ltd. to provide head office functions for China as part of
a structure to manage our business in China centrally. Beginning in FY2014, we have been creating and improving regulations and rules related to of investment companies and other affiliates in China. These measures include the building of an internal control system. We have identified organizational issues and practical operations necessary to observe compliance, implementing key measures steadily. We are addressing risk areas that include operation risk, security risk, social risk, and political risk to bolster risk management. In FY2019, we established and implemented the Emergency Management Manual (in Japanese, Chinese, and the languages of ASEAN countries) and Basic Policy for Preventing Bribery (in Chinese). We created a progress management table to visualize the progress of our (1) Current understanding and issues, (2) PDCA progress results in FY2018, (3) PDCA progress targets in FY2019, and (4) vision for the end of FY2019. We monitor and advise the risk management committees within local affiliates for improvement.
ASEAN
With respect to country risks in ASEAN, we have determined eight common issues to be addressed
by three ASEAN countries. We manage these risk scenarios, the details of activities, and results of the three countries in parallel. Each ASEAN country holds a risk management committee meeting twice every year. In these meetings, risk management results from the previous year are reviewed and confirmed. Next, members set action plans for the next year, which are monitored via the PDCA cycle. These risk management activities are reported to management at board of director meetings in each country. In FY2019, we established Corporate Risk Management Rules and
the Emergency Management Manual for our overseas affiliates with help from General Affairs Department
in Japan and the ASEAN group. The ASEAN group created a mailing list to ensure that critical accidents and incidents occurring at overseas subsidiaries are shared swiftly and put to use in each country. The ASEAN group collects information regarding risk management, incidents, and accidents for inclusion in meeting minutes and reports. This information is submitted to the head office Risk Management Committee in Japan on a timely basis.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
       Group Governance as a Publicly Listed Subsidiary
Watanabe: Over the past few years, we have seen more in the way of corporate governance reform. AEON MALL has worked on various initiatives, as well. In conjunction with the June 2019 cabinet decision on the government’s Action Plan of the Growth Strategy, we have held more intense discussions regarding group governance and governance as a publicly listed subsidiary. The governance structure of a publicly listed subsidiary should be even better than that of other listed companies. Publicly listed subsidiaries must be independent
from parent companies, usually the major shareholder, protecting general shareholders and engaging in independent decision-making. At the same time, experts have pointed out governance structure issues at publicly listed subsidiaries. These issues include fewer independent outside directors and members
of the Audit and Supervisory Board when compared to publicly listed companies without a parent. At this point, I would like to hear your thoughts on this issue from the perspective of governance for publicly listed subsidiaries. Taira: I was appointed an independent outside member of the Audit and Supervisory Board
in 2011. With the 2015 establishment of the Corporate Governance Code, the role of independent outside directors has become more important. We have also seen more discussions about governance for publicly listed subsidiaries and the advisability of parent-subsidiary public listings. (As specific examples), questions arise as to whether brand royalty payments to AEON or lease payments received from AEON Group tenants (AEON Retail Co., Ltd.) are reasonable.
In the time since, AEON MALL has made significant progress, including rules and checklists for transactions with affiliated
companies. I have come to feel that the awareness of our directors encompasses
not only the parent company, but has also shifted toward a certain level of consideration for minority shareholders and general shareholders. Going forward, I think it is important for independent outside directors
to check whether AEON MALL management resources are being allocated in ways that increase company value. At the same time, I think it is also necessary to increase the ratio of independent outside directors to communicate that the company has a system in place to monitor the risk of conflicts of interest with the parent company.
Watanabe: As an aside, when a major new transaction is being considered between parent and subsidiary or between AEON Group
 subsidiaries, the relevant department in AEON and the subsidiary confer with AEON finance and management departments. The details compiled by the subsidiary are examined by the parent company, which may seek the opinion of outside specialists in tax and accounting. As Director Taira said, there were certainly cases in the past in which sufficient documentation was not provided. However, AEON provides guidance and emphasizes objectivity in intra- group transactions, responding to the need for improved tax governance, as well as groupwide initiatives related to financial statement audits. Kawabata: Following what Director Taira said about brands, I think the current AEON brand

 Management Supporting Value Creation
Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
  image campaign is interesting. The brand image is AEON, but it is also AEON MALL. It’s good to see both parent and subsidiary working to improve brand image. Although AEON MALL alone has limited resources,
the company has signed brand royalty agreements related to the AEON Group
with the parent company. This allows AEON MALL to use the brands in a variety of brand activities, which shows the strength of the parent-subsidiary relationship. AEON MALL is able to leverage the AEON brand as a group member, while at the same time contributing to a stronger brand for AEON as a whole. This synergistic effect leads to very strong brand power.
On the other hand, the presence of AEON MALL as an independent company in the capital market is important. I hope AEON MALL continues to make strides in communicating
its brand to the media and consumers. Being listed on the stock exchange provides social credibility. This credibility, in turn, attracts talented people. In fact, the better AEON MALL performs based on our efforts, the higher the bonuses available in comparison to other companies. This leads to increased employee motivation and a sense of responsibility to be a leader in value creation.
Matsumura: I think AEON MALL has established, and continues to improve, governance with respect to being a publicly listed subsidiary. In short, the problem of parent-subsidiary listings is a moral hazard issue. The purpose of corporate governance
is to prevent moral hazards. As a result of pursuing economic rationality, the different standpoints of each company cause something of a crack or a split. This is the moral hazard
in a wide sense, and when the goals of
the customer and the service provider are mismatched, you see asymmetry between incompatible goals and information, which results in the moral hazard. This is the basic focus of the issue in parent-subsidiary public listings. This might sound blunt, but I think people outside the company such as us must monitor whether major company decisions are impacted by a hidden agenda.
However, I think AEON MALL does well in listening to outside voices. This is likely due to the fact that AEON MALL is a developer in the retail industry. Obviously, a retail business can't survive if it doesn't take customer feedback to heart. This culture of listening to the opinions of others developed through its business in retail is built in to the company’s DNA. It's true that the issue of publicly listed subsidiaries has become a hot topic among global investors.
I think there are positive aspects to parent- subsidiary listings as well.
Torii: I was appointed an independent outside member of the Audit and Supervisory Board
in May 2019. I want to provide some of my impressions from that time. First, board meetings featured prior briefings to outside directors
and auditors and exchanges of opinions with internal directors providing thorough checks of projects involving group companies and intra- group transactions. I also had the impression that internal directors were very receptive to
our opinions. The company fostered a positive atmosphere, answering questions in good faith.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
     Most impressive to me was that AEON MALL was very conscious of governance
as a publicly listed subsidiary. When I was interviewed as a candidate for independent outside member of the Audit and Supervisory Board, they asked directly about my thoughts on the issue of parent-subsidiary listings, showing a keen awareness of the subject. I don't think parent-subsidiary listings are bad in and of themselves. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize corporate value. It’s a matter of the best way to achieve that goal. However, it is important to establish clear institutional guarantees. I think AEON MALL should increase the ratio of independent outside directors to at least one-third, if not one-half. Hopefully sooner, rather than later.
Watanabe: Changes in the business environment surrounding Japanese companies, including increasingly complex management issues and corporate governance reforms, have increased the importance of risk management. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has had
an impact on AEON MALL business in Japan and abroad. What is your assessment of the company's response to the pandemic from a risk management perspective?
Taira: When we checked, infectious disease on the scale of AEON MALL risk management was a relatively low risk level of 3. I would like to see the company reexamine this risk. But I believe the company responded appropriately, creating policies beginning in late February to suspend mall events and engage in other measures to prevent the spread of infection. I was pleased to see that AEON MALL created a flowchart to deal with any infections. In the future, I hope COVID-19 serves some good as an opportunity to reexamine efforts to prevent the spread of
infectious disease at meetings of the board of directors and Audit and Supervisory Board. Kawabata: AEON MALL divides risks into three categories. The Risk Management Committee addresses management strategy risk, compliance risk, and accident/incident
   Shifting From Risk Management to Crisis Management in the Wake of COVID-19
risk. You mentioned the treatment of infectious disease as a relatively low risk. I think that if this risk is viewed as a management risk for
the Management Council to address, rather than as infectious disease risk, then we will
see more active discussions on the matter. Questions will always arise about a company’s stance in response to something that has already happened. However, I believe the AEON MALL response in this case was very smart. The president himself communicated frequently with management in Wuhan to issue instructions and confirm safety. Human life comes first and we never want to allow anyone to become infected. In that sense, I think the company set a good example.
Muramatsu: Looking at the response to COVID-19 in Japan and overseas, it appears to be more a matter of crisis management than risk management. Risk management is about minimizing risk and taking steps beforehand. Crisis management in terms of this crisis is about how to minimize the damage and loss
in response to the situation. In medicine, risk
2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 46
 
 Management Supporting Value Creation
Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
 management entails preventive medicine, while crisis management is the domain of emergency medicine. In that sense, this situation is a bit different. I think we need to research and study our responses to emergencies in some more detail.
Torii: AEON MALL risk management consists
of Rules to Manage Business Risk Management and Risk Management Rules. These extremely detailed rules include assigning departments in charge of each risk and other measures. AEON MALL recognizes that risk management is not only the domain of management, but also an issue for operating departments. The company reviews rules on a continual basis, conducting risk surveys, creating risk maps, and studying specific action plans. As you mentioned, however, issues such as COVID-19 must be approached with crisis management beyond risk management. In this case, the situation may not have been fully addressed in the beginning.
AEON MALL is expanding aggressively overseas to achieve its Vision for 2025. At the same time, the need for risk management
is rising in importance. Risk literacy among middle management in particular is important from the perspective of risk management. Risk management won’t function if the communication of information stops with middle management.
As the number of local employees increases overseas, the company will need to emphasize risk literacy.
Watanabe: The face of AEON presented to customers and tenants is unavoidably that
of the AEON Group. In this context, AEON
Mall represents the core of the AEON Group developer business, which demands the exercise of leadership. Because of this position, AEON MALL must keep records of experiences and conduct training to respond to situations
at a moment’s notice. In addition to disaster prevention and firefighting drills, AEON MALL should conduct crisis management drills. AEON MALL has its CSR Committee that discusses
CSR matters, as well as groups that address
ESG and the SDGs. I encourage the company
to view these risk-related initiatives as part of corporate value. AEON MALL has had a system for coordination between the board of directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board in place for some time. The company also has a mechanism to provide feedback regarding management risk and other topics to the board and management. These structures and issues also relate to company independence, and I believe AEON MALL is on the right track in this respect.
Watanabe: In March of this year, AEON MALL appointed a new president and CEO.
The company established the Nomination and Compensation Committee last fiscal year. What are your expectations and advice Mr. Iwamura as a new president?
Taira: The Nomination and Compensation Committee began activities in January 2019. Since that time, the committee has performed evaluations of director performance, engaged in succession planning, and provided
reports related to elections of independent outside directors. Further, the committee
  Expectations for a New President to Helm ESG-Based Management

       Value Creation Story

Value Creation Management
Financial Information/ Company Overview
     has conducted a wide range of discussions
to strengthen the company’s governance structure, including the makeup of the board of directors. At present, we cannot say for sure whether the committee has functioned completely independently. However, we have discussed various issues as we go through this trial-and-error process.
With regard to the replacement of the president, our discussions had focused on fostering candidates from the perspective
of future AEON MALL succession. The announcement of the new president came a
bit out of the blue for us. In the end, I believe the company selected the right person to take over as president in line with past committee deliberations into the qualifications, character, and other factors required of a successor. I urge the new president to achieve the company’s Vision for 2025 and push forward through to the year 2030.
Kawabata: When we launched the committee, we discussed creating a clear skills matrix. While the same can be said for outside directors, the idea here was to ensure we fostered internal directors with experience from a variety of divisions, rather than persons specialized in one area of business. The new Nomination
and Compensation Committee was already discussing the necessity of the election of a new president when then-president Yoshida was appointed executive vice president at AEON Co., Ltd.
The committee discussed the importance of appointing a president who could take responsibility to achieve the clearly defined AEON MALL Vision for 2025. The individual would also have to be young and energetic enough to formulate the next medium-term business plan carrying the company through to the year 2030. This lead to the appointment of the new president. In light of what I said earlier, Mr. Iwamura has a proven track record as the head of development in Japan, as well
as the top post in Vietnam, the most important country in ASEAN. These experiences made him an ideal executive for the future of
AEON MALL. At the time of his appointment, President Iwamura said, “We will engage strategically in ESG-based management.” I believe this statement reflects the birth of a new type of leader. I will do my best to support President Iwamura in the future.
Muramatsu: I think President Iwamura was
an extremely appropriate choice to succeed President Yoshida. I think the appointment was largely due to his experience in Vietnam, where he refined his foresight and management skills. I think the appointment of the president of
the Vietnam operations as president of AEON MALL sent a strong message to the employees in Vietnam, to our business partners, to the markets, and to political leaders. AEON MALL made a clear statement about the importance of Vietnam to the company. I think the choice was timely, not to mention based on President Iwamura’s personal qualities. When he returned from Vietnam, he felt that there was a gap between him and the head office. He had a sense of discomfort that the organization he had taken for granted until then was no longer in step with the times. I asked the president to engage in different initiatives to capitalize on this discomfort he felt.
 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 48
 
 Management Supporting Value Creation
Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
 Torii: I want to address the merits of President Iwamura’s appointment. One very important point refers to the topic brought up in this discussion: parent-subsidiary public listings.
I think this topic also leads to the issue of a conflict of interest between a parent and a subsidiary. In March 2019, former president Yoshida was called to serve concurrently as an executive vice president for AEON Co., Ltd.
In this dual role, President Yoshida was very conscious of the issue of conflict of interest, and he engaged in management with the perspective of general shareholders in mind. The appearance, however, gave general shareholders significant concerns about the risk of conflicts of interest. In this regard, President Iwamura has never served as a director at any other group company. Appointing an individual with this high degree of independence brings a significant benefit in terms of parent-subsidiary public listings.
The Japanese domestic market will no doubt shrink in the future; now is the time to re-examine the AEON MALL business model. In his inauguration speech and in a message for the employees, as well as at the first Nomination and Compensation Committee held after his appointment, President Iwamura expressed his intention to engage strategically in ESG-based management and to redefine
the AEON MALL business domain, or in other words, the scope and fields of the AEON
MALL business activities. He also stated that he planned to share his vision for the future goals and shape of the company with the employees. I received these speeches as very promising for the future.
Watanabe: Last, do you have any advice for points on which to focus in the future, initiatives related to evaluations of board of director
effectiveness, or other comments?
Taira: I have continued to say that AEON MALL can reinvent itself, can withstand change, can pivot with speed, and can correct its course while still forging ahead. For example, I think the company has true strengths in terms of governance and in establishing systems on the go for the ever-increasing number of overseas subsidiaries. I encourage the company to be bold in self-transformation in the future. Kawabata: I also think AEON MALL has a need for self-transformation. President Iwamura was appointed at the right time, and he has been clear in his intent to redefine the company’s business fields. In Japan, AEON MALL may
be able to develop new properties, expand floor space, and otherwise remodel existing malls through the year 2025, even amid the sense of crisis that the country is gradually
that the economy of the country is gradually shrinking. However, what lies ahead of us will be difficult to overcome simply through multi- purpose developments. In the end, executing overseas strategy is important. We see Vietnam as the most important country, so we must increase the pace of local development there. AEON MALL has established a model for success that can be expanded horizontally. In addition, I think the company should consider strengthening operations in Cambodia and Indonesia, and even expansion into other ASEAN countries.
And the board of directors must function properly to develop medium- and long-
term strategies in support of this expansion. Executive directors can offer strong positions on their respective fields of expertise. However, they may not always have a mindset for what
is best or most advantageous for the company as a whole. Executive directors serve the same role as executive officers. They think about management, think about companywide strategies, and monitor the business in addition. I believe a board of directors must

Financial Information/ Company Overview
     consist of these types of individuals.
We must think about how to strike an ideal balance between monitoring and management in our board. Another pressing issue is how
to create a board that consists of at least one- third independent outside directors. The AEON MALL board of directors functions properly
and fosters a culture in which each director
can discuss medium- to long-term strategy candidly. I intend to continue to offer advice and voice concerns and I encourage President Iwamura to exercise strong leadership in his position. Given the four years he was away from the head office, I think we are in for a refreshing change. I also encourage President Iwamura to evolve and adapt to change. At the same time, I hope to see the board of directors respond to these changes through self-transformation. Muramatsu: Darwin said something to the effect that the only animals that survive are
the ones who can change. Not the strongest. Not the most clever. Only the ones who can change. We have discussed management versus monitoring. In my opinion, AEON
MALL tends to emphasize management over monitoring. This is probably unavoidable
for a developer that makes such enormous investments. However, as the company grows and the organization grows, at some point
the head office will become unable to make
all of the decisions. There are misgivings that
a failure to shift the center of gravity toward governance will result in the collapse of an organization. Of course, matters could evolve in this direction. From this perspective, I wonder whether the human resources system can remain as is or whether drastic changes must be adopted. I have seen and heard of situations in which individuals within the company possess outstanding knowledge, but that knowledge
is not accumulated or used effectively. I feel sometimes that this knowledge is not made universal and converted into organizational knowledge. Moving forward, the board of
directors will be asked to operate from this perspective, ensuring knowledge is passed on and used by the organization. An executive officer system may be necessary in this respect. Torii: I am very interested in the future of governance and the structure of the board
of directors. I also understand that this is
a challenge. I think that AEON MALL has adapted well through the management approach to date, but this approach will become more difficult over time as AEON MALL grows. I would like to see the Nomination and Compensation Committee discuss a transition to the monitoring approach more actively in the future. We will have even deeper discussions about governance for publicly listed subsidiaries and revisions to
the Corporate Governance Code this year. I encourage us all to pay more attention to these areas in conjunction with the AEON MALL governance structure. Last, I want to say that cultivating human resources is an important issue as the company grows its business. In particular, AEON MALL needs to strengthen employee training related to overseas business, while also accelerating the advancement of risk management overseas.
Watanabe: It’s important to confirm that the policies of the new leadership integrate well with the tangible and intangible assets built
to date as we advance to the next stage. In addition, as a full-time member of the Audit and Supervisory Board, I will provide information to our independent outside directors and conduct audits of initiatives for improving board of director effectiveness as a publicly listed subsidiary, which has been the focus of this discussion. As well, we will audit whether PDCA is in place and working effectively to ensure
risk management that anticipates change in the business environment.

Internal Controls System
■Basic Policies and Organization for Internal Control Systems
AEON MALL emphasizes compliance and respect for the AEON Code of Conduct, fostering improving relations with local communities and meeting our social responsibilities. We have established a Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the general manager of Administration Division. The role of this committee is to ensure group compliance with laws, regulations, our corporate charter, and internal rules. The committee is also responsible for identifying problems and advancing discussions to resolve said problems. Committee proceedings are reported to the Management Council, and matters of note are elevated to the board of directors. Additionally, we have set up the AEON
MALL HR 110 helpline as an internal reporting contact
point to protect whistleblowers. Our subsidiaries have helplines that mirror the AEON MALL system. Where unacceptable behavior is proven, we take disciplinary action according to internal rules. We (or the department in question) also draft measures to prevent recurrence, shared for company-wide implementation. The Compliance Committee also receives a report of the measures. The internal audit division determines whether the company and subsidiaries are managed appropriately. The division conducts audits based on Internal Audit Rules, presenting the results to the CEO and full-time members of the Audit and Supervisory Board according to the Internal Audit Rules. ■Operational Status of Internal Control Systems AEON Mall determines whether our internal control systems function based on a checklist to ensure appropriate operations. The following is a summary
of the principle operational status of the company’s internal control systems for the period under review. Drawing on the results of the risk survey we conducted in fiscal 2016 and our responses to major incidents, new business domains, and environments, we are building
a more effective risk management system by classifying risks according to importance and the need to take countermeasures. We also hold intensive discussions in our Risk Management Committee regarding initiatives implemented by departments responsible. We take measures in advance to mitigate the severity of fires and natural disasters by focusing on safety measures. The company has set up a new Information Security Committee in response to the growth of digitalization and stronger information security measures. This committee has started to hold meetings in conjunction with the Risk Management Committee.

Corporate Governance
To prevent violations of laws, regulations, and internal rules that pose compliance risks, the Compliance Committee discusses case studies of past violations
that have occurred within the company. In this way, we develop measures to prevent recurrence. Discussions during the period under review have centered on measures to prevent harassment in response to changes in relevant laws. We have also addressed approaches
to improving workplace environments when AEON Mall properties undergo renovation. To prevent harassment, discussions focused on the status of whistleblowing, the results of morale surveys, and the implementation of compliance training. By reporting the results of these deliberations to the Management Council and the board of directors, we strive to develop more effective initiatives to prevent harassment.
Managing Board of Director Meetings
In addition to holding regular board of director meetings monthly, AEON MALL convenes extraordinary meetings of the board of directors as deemed necessary. Decisions encompassing substantial risk threatening far-reaching impact on the group are brought to the Management Council for discussion. These decisions are then approved by the CEO and/or by resolution of the board of directors. Executive authority is delegated along with clear management accountability according to Rules
for Organization Management, Rules for Segregation of Duties, Rules of Jurisdiction, Rules for Approval Requests, and Rules for Management of Affiliates.
Strengthening Our Organization to Improve Global Governance
The AEON MALL Group strives to achieve further improvements in global governance. In 2018, we implemented a level of internal control systems in China which are comparable to the systems in Japan. We have also formed a Risk Management Committee and Compliance Department in China. Our Internal Audit Department in China works to strengthen internal control systems in cooperation with the Internal Audit Department in Japan. Risk assessments by the Risk Management Committee were also conducted in ASEAN countries in fiscal 2018. We began building internal control systems in ASEAN in fiscal 2019.
Outside directors inspect our overseas properties in person once or twice annually. Outside directors provide a wide range of advice on the cultivation of human resources, overseas governance, rule-making, and useful case studies.
Through these efforts, we strive to respect human rights and strengthen compliance.
Criteria for Appointing and Dismissing Officers
The president and CEO proposes director candidates according to the following criteria. The Nomination and Compensation Committee, which consists mainly of outside directors, discusses nominations, which are then presented to the board of directors as agenda items for the general meeting of shareholders. The board makes the necessary resolutions which are submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for approval.
(Policies for the nomination of director candidates)
• Internal directors must have the ability, knowledge, experience, and achievements required for their field of specialization. These individuals must also have a sense of balance and judgment that enables them to understand and act across all aspects of business operations.
• Outside directors must have abundant experience and insight in professional specialization. These individuals must have sufficient time to carry out their duties as company directors and possess qualities to provide independent advice and recommendations on the appropriateness of decision-making by the board of directors.
(Policies for the nomination of Audit and Supervisory Board candidates)
• Candidates must be aware of business issues based on experience in general business management.
• Candidates must have no interests or business relationships that may affect their execution of duties as a member of the Audit and Supervisory Board.
• Candidates must have considerable knowledge of finance and accounting, or skills, expertise, and experience in a specialized field.
The board of directors elects a CEO who will contribute to effective corporate governance and sustainable growth in medium- and long-term corporate value. The appointment and dismissal of the CEO is decided by a resolution of the board of directors. A candidate for CEO must have an appropriate breadth of experience, insight, and advanced expertise.
The CEO must also have managerial ability and leadership skills sufficient to achieve continuous growth in the company’s business.

The company judges that Masato Nishimatsu’s broad understanding and specialist knowledge gained in the AEON Group companies would help him provide supervision and effective advice related to company management. Accordingly, the Company nominated him as a candidate for member of the Audit and Supervisory Board.

Board Member Training Policies, Outside Director Support System
AEON MALL provides senior manager training and other opportunities for directors and members of the Audit and Supervisory Board to cultivate stronger leadership skills and strategic business thinking, as well as to gain a stronger understanding of compliance and governance. These trainings include seminars for newly appointed officers and top company management.
Newly appointed outside directors and outside members of the Audit and Supervisory Board are provided with mall tours and training to develop an understanding of the industry, history, businesses, financial situation, strategies, and organization of the AEON MALL Group and the AEON Co., Ltd. Group. The Company provides overseas tours of business operations at least once per year to outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board. The purpose of these tours is to deepen an understanding of our overseas strategy, which is a foundational part of our corporate policy.
The General Affairs department provides support to outside directors and outside members of the Audit and Supervisory Board. In addition, the department assigns two staff members responsible for assisting members
of the Audit and Supervisory Board (including outside members). To ensure effective discussions within the
  55 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT

       limited time of board of director meetings, we provide directors with agenda materials and explanations prior to meetings, as well as other appropriate information when deemed necessary.
Succession Plan
We have established Nomination and Compensation Committee, consisting mainly of outside directors, to investigate training and other programs addressing standards, career paths, and training necessary for individuals with management responsibility (including candidates). Combined with board of director meeting deliberations, the system is designed to ensure highly transparent and fair procedures.
Evaluating Board of Director Effectiveness
To ensure effective and strong corporate governance, the company verifies the degree to which directors contribute to the board of directors. Further, the board of directors itself analyzes and evaluates its own effectiveness by identifying issues and implementing improvements.
1. Analysis and Evaluation Process
The company conducts questionnaire-based self- assessments regarding the effectiveness of the board of directors, working with third-party organizations
to analyze the responses obtained. Responses are
also verified and discussed at meetings of the board
of directors through an exchange of opinions and discussions led by outside directors.
2. Overview of Analysis and Evaluation Results
Board of director meetings function appropriately. Board meetings follow proper agendas and allow sufficient time for active discussions among directors and corporate auditors who have a diverse background of opinions and experiences.
3. Response Going Forward
AEON MALL strives to enhance the quality of deliberations conducted by the board of directors
and the board’s effectiveness by working to improve global governance and risk management to support appropriate risk-taking as we expand the scale of
our overseas operations. Moreover, the company implements measures to improve the functions of the board of directors.
Officer Compensation
Director compensation consists of a base component and a performance-linked component, the maximum amounts of which are determined via resolution at the general meeting of shareholders. Payments are made within the scope approved and in consideration of job responsibilities, earnings performance, and other factors.
The Nomination and Compensation Committee focuses mainly on outside directors and reviews the adequacy of director evaluations, compensation
rates and levels, and specific compensation amounts. Compensation for members of the Audit and Supervisory Board is made within the scope approved at the general meeting of shareholders, subsequent to negotiations with said members.

 Value Creation Management
Corporate Governance
Cross-Shareholdings
The AEON MALL policy on cross-shareholding is to
hold shares for the purpose of contributing to improved AEON MALL Group corporate value over the medium
and long term. This policy considers a number of factors including business strategy and business relationships. We review individual cross-shareholdings on an annual basis, considering the purpose for holding shares, whether share dividend income exceeds the cost of capital, risks involved in holding shares, and transactions with the issuing party. These factors are part of determining the overall benefits
of holding shares for the long term. This annual review is conducted by the board of directors, the final determination of which we disclose publicly. When exercising voting rights of cross-held shares, we verify whether each proposal contributes to the medium- and long-term improvement in AEON MALL corporate value and whether said proposal holds the potential to damage our corporate value. As necessary, we hold discussions with the issuing company as part of our overall decision-making process.
Policy on Measures to Protect Minority Shareholders in Conducting Transactions with the Controlling Shareholder
AEON MALL belongs to a corporate group consisting
of AEON Co., Ltd. (pure holding company) and AEON Co., Ltd. consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates. The AEON Group provides comprehensive financial, development, services, and other businesses focusing on retail in the GMS sector. AEON MALL is a core group company responsible for the development business. AEON Co., Ltd. is responsible for developing group strategy, allocating group management resources optimally, overseeing and instilling group management philosophies and basic principles, and providing shared group services to maximize group synergies. At the same time, AEON MALL and other group companies strive to become more skilled in our respective specialties and engage community-focused business to reach new levels of customer satisfaction. AEON MALL leverages the more than ¥8 trillion in group revenues to increase customer drawing power, using the AEON Group infrastructure, including the AEON Card and the WAON electronic money service, to conduct marketing promotions.
The Company makes our own independent management decisions related to daily business operations.
We confer with or report to AEON Co., Ltd. concerning key management issues. AEON MALL maintains a close and cooperative relationship with AEON Co., Ltd. and other group companies, embracing a mutual respect for self-reliance and independence as we collectively strive for sustainable growth, development, and improved earnings.
We believe that cooperating with group companies and maximizing synergies in this way will yield benefits to minority shareholder interests.
Related-Party Transactions
AEON MALL has established a system to ensure transactions with officers or major shareholders (related- party transactions) do not infringe on the interests of the company or our shareholders.
We carefully investigate in board of director deliberations whether competitive transactions by directors and transactions involving conflicts of interest with directors and AEON MALL infringe on the interests of AEON MALL or our shareholders. Our investigations include consulting with experts regarding the reasonable nature of the transactions in question. We ensure fairness in this process through a number of means, including recusing directors having special interests in transactions with AEON MALL from voting in the resolution.
When we enter into transactions with related parties, we clarify the identity of such parties in our Related Party List according to the provisions of our Rules for Managing Related Party Transactions. We ensure objectivity in transaction terms through rules that include providing comparison tables in period-end financial reports that show examples of transactions with non-related parties. According to the importance and nature of the transaction in question, we comply with our Authority Rules in soliciting opinions from outside directors and members of the Audit and Supervisory Board during board of director meetings regarding the rationality (business purpose) and reasonable nature of the transaction terms. On an annual basis, we investigate the rationality and reasonableness
of transactions, issuing a report on the annual increase or decrease in transactions with related-party companies.
Compliance Promotion System
The Company emphasizes compliance and respect for the AEON Code of Conduct, fostering improving relations with local communities and meeting the
    57 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT

       company’s social responsibilities.
AEON MALL has established a Compliance
Committee, which is chaired by the general manager
of Administration Division. The role of this committee is
to ensure group compliance with laws, regulations, our corporate charter, and internal rules. The committee is also responsible for identifying problems and advancing discussions to resolve said problems. Committee proceedings are reported to the Management Council, and matters of note are elevated to the board of directors.
In addition, we have introduced the Helpline AEON MALL HR 110 Hotline (our labor union has launched a separate Union 110 Hotline). We will install similar helpline systems at our subsidiaries in the future. We ensure
that users of this helpline are not subject to reprisal. In
the event a report is filed via this hotline, we carefully investigate the details reported. Where unacceptable behavior is proven, we take disciplinary action according to internal rules. We (or the department in question) also draft measures to prevent recurrence, shared for company-wide implementation. The Compliance Committee also receives a report of the measures.
Initiatives to Prevent Corruption
All executives and employees agree that the group will not pursue profit through bribery or other fraudulent means under any circumstances.
Although group officers and employees abide by internal rules and regulations established by AEON MALL and each group company, each individual in our group promises to consider, judge, and take action
in line with social justice when asked to comply with a demand by public officials or others.
Group executives and employees must not damage our corporate culture by furnishing benefits, paying expenses, making donations, or providing aid for improper purposes. Executives and employees must also refrain from improper behavior that could impede the healthy advancement of any particular country or region. Finally, executives and employees recognize that any such behavior will have an adverse effect the group's approach to compliance.
Group officers and employees affirm their strong commitment and dedication to high ideals, approaching anticorruption in a serious and sincere manner.
Toward the implementation of these principles, AEON MALL has established the Basic Rules for the Prevention of Bribery. Officers and employees of the group comply with
and follow these rules as a code of conduct.
To instill and enshrine corporate ethics in our
company, we provide training to directors and employees at every level of our organization. We also incorporate corporate ethics into the behavior evaluation sections of our goal management system.

Risk Management
■ Risk Management Promotion Structure
The president and chief executive officer is responsible for overall risk management. In addition, the head of each business unit is responsible for risk management at each unit. The structure provides a system and environment ensuring business continuity and the safety of human life. The group has created Rules
to Manage Business Risk Management to prevent crises and minimize damages in the event of a crisis, striving to reduce risk and mitigate any damages. We have established teams to address risk management by category, and we strive to prevent damage to our brand value and improve overall corporate value by managing risks of loss for the group as a whole. When an emergency presents the risk of significant loss,
we engage in appropriate information sharing and decision-making according to our Rules to Manage Business Risk Management, taking proper steps to minimize damage.
The group has established the Risk Management Committee, chaired by the HQ general manager of administration, as an organization to manage risk
for the group. This committee is responsible for identifying issues related to risk management at the group level, engaging in discussions for potential solutions. Reports of the Risk Management Committee proceedings are provided to the Management Council, which is an advisory body to the CEO consisting of directors above the rank of executive managing director, full-time members of the Audit & Supervisory Board, and individuals appointed by the CEO. In addition, important issues are also reported to the board of directors and presented in our annual report. The department in charge of internal auditing creates an annual audit plan according to the Internal Audit Rules and conducts internal audits to enhance the effectiveness of risk management. The department also reports the results of the annual audit to the board of directors.
■ Business Risk
We focus on major issues, such as those included under Business Overview and Financial Information in our securities report that may have an important impact
on investor investment decisions. However, risk and uncertainty that may influence future performance
and financial condition may not be limited to these risks. Matters in the report regarding the future are determined by AEON MALL Group as of the date that the Securities Report was submitted (May 20, 2020).
1. Relationship with AEON Co., Ltd. and affiliated companies (“AEON Group Companies”)
Risks related to business transactions with AEON Co., Ltd., and AEON Group Companies
AEON Retail Co., Ltd. accounted for 10.4% of the operating revenue of AEON MALL Group for the fiscal year ending February 2020. AEON Group Companies excluding AEON Retail Co., Ltd. accounted for 10.7%. The role of strong anchor tenants that attract customers is extremely important in mall development. The AEON MALL Group utilizes our close relationship with AEON Co., Ltd. to work with AEON, a supermarket operated by AEON Retail Co., Ltd., as an anchor tenant. We expect the supermarket to continue to be an anchor tenant at the shopping malls that our group develops in the future.
As described above, the relationship of AEON MALL Group with AEON Co., Ltd. and AEON Group Companies is beneficial for mall development by AEON MALL Group in attracting anchor tenants. However,
the business performance, store opening and closing policies, etc., of AEON Group Companies may influence the business performance of AEON MALL Group.
2. Risks to business growth related to securing human resources
The AEON MALL Group grows our domestic business through the increase of business locations and enhancement earnings capacity. We are also building a foundation for expansion in China and the ASEAN
 59 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT

       region, which are new growth markets.
We aim to secure human resources in connection
with business expansion through in-house training, enhancement of recruitment by the Group, and the recruitment of employees from AEON Co., Ltd. and AEON Group Companies. However, if sufficient human resources cannot be secured, achieving the expected growth may be a challenge.
3. Legal regulations
(1) Restrictions set by the City Planning Act and Large- Scale Retail Stores Location Act
AEON MALL Group pursues community-based
mall development through cooperation with local governments. The City Planning Act limits large-scale stores exceeding 10,000m2 to commercial districts, neighborhood commercial districts, and quasi-industrial districts. Large-scale stores are not permitted in districts not designated as any of the above. Construction of
a large-scale store in non-zoned city planning district
or quasi-city planning district requires a special permit issued by the governor of the relevant prefecture, etc., or relaxed zoning restrictions by district planners. Such legal restrictions could adversely affect plans for AEON Mall openings.
(2) Changes to real estate tax laws
Changes in real estate tax laws could result in higher costs for real estate acquisition and sales. Such increases could adversely influence the business performance of AEON MALL Group.
4. Business
(1) Period required for a mall development
Mall development requires time to complete a broad range of preparations in the leadup to store opening. Preparations include market surveys, site selection and procurement through negotiation with the landowners, legal procedures, construction, and tenant recruitment. Lack of progress or interruptions in mall development could adversely affect the business performance of AEON MALL Group.
(2) Risks accompanying the increase of real estate prices, etc.
The AEON MALL Group acquires or leases real estate in the form of land and buildings. If the price of real estate increases, costs related to the acquisition or lease of real estate can also be expected to increase. This increases the risk of holding real estate due to
the revision of real estate-related laws and accounting standards, which could adversely affect the business plans, financial condition, and business performance of the group.
(3) Environmental pollution at mall development sites previously used for industrial purposes
The AEON MALL Group uses industrial sites for
mall development. If environmental pollutants are identified through environmental surveys, we remove the pollutants and costs are borne by the seller of the land or the landowner. However, the discovery of new pollutants slows the speed of mall development, and this could adversely affect the business performance of the group.
(4) Risks related to usability of the land for mall
development
Business growth of the group depends on the continued development of new malls. A slowdown in plans for large-scale mall development could reduce the speed of development by the group.
(5) Risks related to domestic market/economic trends
and population shifts
Major group mall tenants are engaged in the retail and service industry. Demand tends to be influenced by economic and personal consumption trends. Therefore, a worsening of the Japanese economy, unexpected stiff competition with other malls, or changes in markets could adversely affect the business performance of the group.
(6) Risks related to unseasonable weather and the
increase of consumption tax rate
A decrease in consumer spending during an unseasonably cool summer or warm winter, or an increase in consumption tax leading to a slump in
Value Creation Story
Value Creation Strategies
Value Creation Management
Financial Information/ Company Overview
    2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 60
 
 Value Creation Management
Corporate Governance
tenant sales and decrease of rent income for AEON MALL, could adversely affect the business performance of AEON MALL Group.
(7) Risks related to competition with other companies Intensified competition with other real estate developers and general retail operators could have a negative influence on the projects, financial condition, and business performance of the AEON MALL Group. (8) Risk related to business partners
The AEON MALL Group has paid security and other deposits to the owners of the land and buildings that we rent. We also hold accounts receivable from mall tenants. While we conduct appropriate partner credit management, a worsening of the financial condition of the owners of land and buildings could make it difficult to recoup lease and security deposits. A worsening in tenant credit could result in credit losses. Any of these factors could adversely affect the business performance of the group.
(9) Risks related to tenant management
Tenants opening stores at our malls cover a wide range of business. Examples include clothing, general merchandise, food, etc. While we make every effort
to ensure that tenants exercise sufficient quality management of products, services, and hygiene control, a loss of customer confidence due to failures or defects in products and services could reflect poorly on our reputation and adversely influence the business performance of the group.
(10) Risks of information system stoppages
Information systems have been increasing in importance in the business activities of the AEON MALL Group. We have endeavored to protect systems and data through the aggregation of data into a data center, the multiplexing of servers and networks,
and security improvements. However, damage to
the data center by large-scale earthquake or other natural disasters or failures occurring in the information system may interrupt business activities and adversely influence the business performance and financial condition of the group. To mitigate this risk, we established the Data Center No.2 as a backup center in west Japan during the fiscal year ended February
2013. This data center redundancy allows for the stable operation of our information systems, even if one data center is damaged or rendered inoperative. We have further enhanced the business continuity plan (BCP) of the group to minimize the impact of emergencies on business activities.
(11) Personal information management
We manage personal information obtained from customers through the strict implementation of in- house regulations and management manuals, as well as thorough employee education. Unexpected accidents that lead to the leakage of personal information could undermine the credibility of the group and adversely influence business performance.
(12) Risks related to compliance
The AEON MALL Group conducts business in accordance with the laws and regulations specified
by individual countries and regions. AEON MALL established a Compliance Committee to increase employee awareness of compliance both at home
and abroad. However, there is always the possibility
of risk in our management system. Problems in our management system related to the violation of laws and regulations could adversely affect business activities and the performance of the group. In addition, illegal acts by employees could adversely affect business performance and the social credibility of the group.
(13) Risk related to natural disasters and accidents
The AEON MALL Group operates three malls in Wuhan, China, where suspensions of public transportation, restrictions on non-essential travel outside the home, school closures, and government office closures have continued since December 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
The risk of infection is increasing in Japan, and there are concerns about the overall impact on consumer activities due to the nationwide closures
of elementary, junior high and high schools, the cancellations of various large-scale events, telework and stay-at-home rules, and travel bans. In addition to the major social impact of this pandemic, fires, earthquake disasters, riots, or terrorist acts could interfere with the
61 2020 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT

       group's ability to conduct business. Such damage, fire destruction, or deterioration could interfere in mall operations for a certain period of time.
The AEON MALL Group conducts seismic retrofitting, improves and communicates Risk Management Rules to respond to natural disasters,
the outbreak of disease, and accidents, and conducts disaster prevention drills to prepare for large-scale earthquakes and terrorism. We enhance and improve our risk management structure to minimize damage in emergencies. However, depending on conditions, such risks could adversely affect the business performance of the group. The AEON MALL Group has fire insurance that covers the malls we operate and profit insurance that covers loss of rent due to fire, flood, and other large-scale disasters. However, no insurance company is capable of offering earthquake insurance under financially sustainable conditions due to the large size of our malls. Therefore, we do not have earthquake insurance that compensates completely for maximum damage. Damage, loss, and deterioration of SC buildings caused by large-scale earthquakes could adversely affect business performance of the group. (14) Overseas business expansion
The AEON MALL Group expands mall business in overseas markets as part of our business strategy, focusing on China and ASEAN. Overseas business activities could adversely affect the business performance of the group due to social, political or economic conditions caused by economic trends, changes in exchange rates, unexpected changes in laws and regulations regarding investment, trading, competition, taxation, and foreign exchange, differences in business practices and labor- management relations, the occurrence of terrorism and civil war, COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, abnormal or unseasonable weather, etc.
5. Finances
(1) Changes in performance due to interest rate conditions
The AEON MALL Group pursues fixed-rate loans to raise funds from financial institutions. As of the end of
the fiscal year ended February 2020, ¥549,428 million (99.9%) of ¥550,096 million in outstanding debt, including commercial paper and corporate bonds, is
in fixed-rate loans. If interest rates increase or interest related to variable interest rate loans increases, costs to procure funds for refinancing and new development could adversely affect the business performance of the group.
(2) Risks related to exchange rate fluctuations
The AEON MALL Group has 37 overseas consolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the fiscal year ended February 2020. Foreign currency-denominated
figures related to the overseas subsidiaries shown in the consolidated financial statements of the group
are converted into Japanese yen. Therefore, our consolidated financial statements are affected by changes in exchange rates between Japanese yen and other currencies. A significant change in exchange rates could adversely affect the financial condition and business performance of the group.
(3) Capital procurement
AEON MALL Group may add more debt or increase capital for mall development based on our growth strategy. However, a general recession in market conditions or economies, damage to group credibility, or a negative business forecasts could raise barriers to obtaining financing under favorable conditions for the group in a timely manner. These factors may prevent us from procuring capital.
(4) Risks related to asset-impairment accounting
The Group applies the Accounting Standard for Impairment of Fixed Assets (“Impairment Accounting Standards,” below), first announced in August 2002. Operating losses at each business location, significant declines in market prices for land, vacancies caused
by the closing of tenant stores, or a significant deterioration in the business environment could cause impairment losses and adversely affect the financial condition and business performance of the group.

in land-use rights under “Other” within investments and other assets in prior years) and acquired property, plant and equipment in the amount of ¥80,444

 Financial Information/Company Overview
Financial Performance
■ Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents (“cash”) as of the end of the current consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥114,368 million, an increase of ¥58,954 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year.
Cash flows in the period under review are as follows.
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥133,645 million, compared to cash flows of ¥90,600 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result
is mainly due to income before income taxes and
other adjustments of ¥54,019 million (¥47,683 million
in the prior consolidated fiscal year), depreciation
and amortization of ¥56,858 million (¥42,640 million
in the prior consolidated fiscal year), and an increase
in deposits received from specialty stores of ¥23,074 million (¥3,597 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year). At the same time, income taxes paid amounted to ¥15,701 million, compared to ¥17,194 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year.
Net cash used in investing activities amounted
to ¥95,783 million, compared to ¥176,189 million in
the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result is mainly due to purchase of property, plant and equipment
of ¥97,192 million (¥207,522 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year) due to payments for equipment at malls opened in the prior consolidated fiscal year (THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA, AEON MALL Iwaki Onahama, AEON MALL Tsu-Minami) and expanded in the current consolidated fiscal year (AEON MALL Higashiura, AEON MALL Natori), as well as payments in advance for land for development.
Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ¥22,808 million, compared to net cash provided of ¥91,199 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result is mainly due to proceeds from issuance of bonds in the amount of ¥80,000 million (¥80,000 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year) and proceeds from long-term debt of ¥8,500 million (¥61,159 million in
the prior consolidated fiscal year). During the same period, the company made cash outlays for repayments of long-term debt of ¥24,015 million (¥35,759 million
in the prior consolidated fiscal year), ¥15,000 million
in redemptions of bonds (no outlays during the year- ago period), ¥6,000 million in repayments of short-term loans and commercial paper (¥5,000 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year), and payments of dividends in the amount of ¥8,872 million (¥8,642 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year).
Outlook for FY2020
In FY2020, the COVID-19 outbreak spread across the world. We reduced mall operating hours or closed malls temporarily in China, ASEAN, and Japan in response to government requests, as well as our own considerations in preventing the spread of infection. When reopening our malls in each country, we implemented measures
to prevent infection and ensure safety and security, placing the highest priority on the safety of our customers, tenant staff, and other mall employees.
In China, in conjunction with the January 24 quarantine of Wuhan City due to the spread of COVID-19, tenants in our three malls in the city instituted temporary closures. Through mid-February, as many as 11 of our 21 malls in China closed temporarily due to the spread of COVID-19 across the country. From February 22 through March, we began
to reopen in stages, finally seeing all 21 malls open
for business again on April 1. Of our existing malls,
we intend to attract more customers to AEON MALL Wuhan Jinyintan (Wuhan City, Hubei Province) through a floor space expansion and renovation, events, and sales promotions. Our future activities will place the highest priority on safety and security, while keeping a close eye on the post-COVID-19 situation after the virus spread has been stopped. In June, we renovated the food sales zone of AEON MALL Wuhan Jinqiao (Wuhan City, Hubei Province), expanding from 20 stores to 26.

       Subsequently, Japan phased out its state of emergency and we began reopening our businesses on May 13. By May 28, all of our facilities were open for business. Specialty store sales of our malls in Japan and overseas that have declined temporarily due to the spread of
COVID-19 are on a recovery trend. Meanwhile, though the peak of COVID-19 has passed, the impact of the virus pandemic on our business is expected to decline but continue until the end of the fiscal year ending February 2021.

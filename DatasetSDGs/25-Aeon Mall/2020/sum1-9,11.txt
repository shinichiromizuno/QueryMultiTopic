On September 9 and 10, the Boso Peninsula Typhoon landed in the Kanto are of Japan, causing extended power outages, water supply disruptions, the collapse of houses, and other extensive damage in Chiba Prefecture. AEON MALL Kisarazu (Chiba Pref.) fulfilled its function as part of the regional infrastructure, playing a role as a base for recovery activities.
Smart Mall Initiatives
AEON MALL aims to create smart malls that use digital technology for more convenient shopping experiences. AEON MALL Makuhari Shintoshin (Chiba Pref.) is serving as a pilot mall for a variety of leading-edge technologies.
Encouraging the Spread and Use
of Electric Vehicles (EV)
In 2008, AEON MALL began installing EV recharging stations at our malls. We encourage the use of low-CO2 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids as one measure
to preserve the global environment create sustainable societies. As of the end of February 2020, we have installed 1,837 recharging networks at 138 malls throughout Japan. We have also installed 564 units at 14 malls in China and three units at two malls in ASEAN. AEON MALL Ha Dong (Vietnam) offers 20 EV bike chargers for guests.
Polling Stations
As one way to improve lifestyle services for the community, AEON MALL locations offer polling stations during elections. Our polling stations serve as comfortable environments for customers to exercise their voting rights with access to large parking areas and shuttle buses. Our polling stations also provide a convenient way for employees working at our malls to vote. For the 25th regular election of members of the House of Councillors in July 2019, AEON MALL and AEON shopping centers offered poll locations for early voting (and same-day voting in some locations).

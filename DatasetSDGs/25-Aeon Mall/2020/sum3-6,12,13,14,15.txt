Eliminating Plastic Straws at all Malls
and Working toward a Complete Ban
on Disposable Plastic Products
In recent years, we have seen a worldwide rise in initiatives to reduce the use of plastic products, considered to have a negative impact on ocean life and marine ecosystems. We are doing our part for the cause, achieving a 94.9% recycling rate for waste plastics in fiscal year 2019. In this and other ways, we are striving to create sustainable malls and conserve the global environment. Our ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the use of disposable plastic products. As the first step, we discontinued providing plastic straws in eating and drinking facilities at all malls on March 16, 2020 (some exceptions applied). For customers who wish to use straws, we offer paper straws and other environmentally friendly alternatives. We will continue to work together with store operators to reduce the use of plastics.
Utilization of Solar Energy
Using solar energy systems at 88 malls
We deployed solar power system at 71 malls in Japan and 17 malls overseas, demonstrating leadership ahead of other commercial facilities. Some of our malls incorporate a system for uninterrupted electricity in the case of a power failure. We installed a 1MW rooftop solar power system and a high-efficiency chiller in our AEON MALL Sen Sok City facility in Cambodia, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 1,564 tons per year.
Driving Energy Conservation
Initiatives Forward
We are striving to reduce energy use by 50% compared
to the year 2010, as specified in the AEON Eco Project launched in 2012. As a new initiative, the AEON Group
is aiming to achieve a decarbonized society by the year 2050, as described in the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050 announced in March 2018. The group plans to accomplish this goal by promoting energy conservation, the use of renewable energy, and other measures. To date, 13 facilities in the AEON Group, 12 of which are operated by AEON MALL, have become environmentally friendly model facilities. We are currently developing the Next- Generation Smart AEON program, a further evolution in our decarbonization. For example, AEON MALL Zama (Kanagawa Pref.) has significantly reduced CO2 emissions compared to standard AEON stores.
AEON Hometown Forest Project
The AEON Hometown Forest Project began in 1991 in Malaysia. The AEON Group regards the tree planting initiative as an activity to embody a philosophy centered on pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always from the customer’s point of view. Every time a new mall
is opened in Japan or overseas, AEON hosts a tree planting ceremony, working with customers to plant native trees most appropriate for the local natural environment. We planted about 28,700 trees at four new malls opened in Japan and overseas in fiscal 2019. As of the end of February 2020, the AEON Group has planted a total of nearly 12.12 million trees.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
     Waste Reduction and Recycling
To reduce waste generated from malls, it is important to clearly understand what is disposed of, where, and how much, engaging the help of tenants and making them aware of the issue. Each mall has a system to classify waste into 18 basic categories and measure weight by category. Each tenant measures the weight of waste
by category, and then affixes a label indicating that the weight has been measured. Tenants then place waste in the location designated for each category for disposal. Segregated waste that is recyclable is recycled to the greatest extent possible. We calculate the recycling rate for each category.

Response to Climate Change
As one measure for ESG-oriented management, AEON MALL aims to help create a carbon-less society by the year 2050. In June 2020, we declared our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD was established in 2016 by the international Financial Stability Board (FSB). In the future, we will be using the TCFD framework to disclose information appropriately.
Governance
AEON MALL recognizes that climate change is an important management issue. We report our related initiatives and results regularly at board of director meetings, ensuring a system of board oversight.

Carbon pricing
Two types of carbon pricing are anticipated; one is a carbon tax that is applied to crude oil and energy (electricity, gas, and fuel) and the other is cap-and-trade, under which charges vary depending on business-related GHG emissions
We expect tighter restrictions based on the regulations of
the current Energy Saving Act (METI), the Building Energy Efficiency Act (MLIT), and the Act on Rational Use and Appropriate Management of Fluorocarbons (MOE). We also reflect expectations for the establishment of new related laws.
We consider two types of energy prices. One type varies
in response to the unit price of electricity, accounting for about 90% of total GHG emissions discharged from business activities. The other type reflects prices for fossil fuel energy and renewable energy.
We project changes in the geographical suitability of manufacturing and processing related to perishable food raw materials, water resources, and products in Japan and overseas. We must also consider changes in supply and demand due to population increase, which serves as an indirect indicator. These changes impact anchor stores and specialty stores.
Customers refers to citizens, including consumers and ordinary citizens. Changes refers to changes in consumption behavior and awareness.
A risk of operational interruption of a certain number of
stores (areas are unidentifiable) caused by weather damage
is anticipated every year. We use a certain ration to project costs and time for recovery related to malls affected by flood or other physical damage. We project market area contraction some areas due to frequent weather disasters or changes in demographics.Policy and legal riskRegulations on energy conservation/ CFC alternativesMarket riskEnergy priceMarket risk and technical riskSupply and demand balance of food and raw materials Market risk and reputation risk

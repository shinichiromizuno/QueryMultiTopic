Value Creation Results          Materialities
AEON MALL has identified Five Materialities in the context of business strategy for achieving
our long-term vision P.29
Developing Community and Social Infrastructure
     Safe, secure, and pleasant facilities
In 2005, AEON introduced universal design in the development of malls in Japan to ensure all customers enjoy safe and pleasant shopping experiences. Subsequently, we have conducted regular customer surveys soliciting customer
opinions, making ongoing improvements in both tangible and intangible aspects of mall design.
Overseas, we were among the first to develop malls with large parking facilities in response to rising motorization.
AEON MALL Zama (Kanagawa Prefecture)
In 2018, AEON MALL Zama received the Barrier-Free Town Planning Award from Kanagawa Prefecture. This award recognized the mall for innovative design accommodating all shoppers, including guests with disabilities and seniors.
         Malls that reflect the unique character of a community
AEON designs malls to reflect the particular community to be served and local market characteristics. To the greatest extent possible, we create design concepts that incorporate what makes an area unique and attractive. We will continue to produce uniquely appealing facilities by embodying these concepts in exterior and interior designs, leasing, and daily events.
We also create concept zones in each of our malls
that encourage visitors to rediscover the attraction of their communityâ€™s culture, industry, tourism resources, and more. By reflecting the unique features of the region in the design of each facility, AEON MALL instills a sense of community pride that results in residents taking personal ownership of the mall.
THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA (Hiroshima Prefecture)
The first "THE OUTLETS" concept mall is a regional innovative commercial facility completely different from conventional malls. The facility features an outlet zone with nearly 120
brand shops, along with entertainment facilities that include Wonder Rink, the only year-round ice-skating rink in Hiroshima Prefecture. With the support of local community and Hiroshima City, this mall offers shops and information resources that communicate the attractions of the surrounding region.

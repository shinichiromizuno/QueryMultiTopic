Editorial Policies
The AEON MALL Group is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living. Under this management philosophy, we aim to be a company that touches the hearts of the 5 billion people throughout Asia. Accordingly, this fiscal year we have published an integrated report for our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders to encourage a better understanding of our initiatives toward corporate value creation over the medium and long term.
In editing this integrated report, we have provided information we deemed important from the standpoint of medium- and long- term corporate value creation. Our efforts referenced the International Integrated Reporting Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Among other topics, this integrated report addresses our strengths developed as a retail-based mall business, our value creation process and future strategies, business activities forming the foundation of value creation, and ESG initiatives. Further, we provide information related to those ESG initiatives that have a significant impact on corporate value creation based on considerations of materiality. Please see our CSR/ESG Report (overview of CSR activities), CSR website, and IR website for more information related to ESG.

Management Philosophy
AEON MALL is a Life Design Developer*,

• Ultimately, our challenge is to be consistent in localization to enhance the attractive aspects of various regions by working in tandem with partners.
• As Life Design Producers, we will go beyond working in a conventional commercial context and keep our company growing by opening up business opportunities to produce future ways of living.
• We will solidify and strengthen our financial and business foundations by taking full advantage of our company's assets, including our worldwide malls and capabilities, to continue our growth.
• We are a company of professionals that continue to innovate.
• We see and consider life from customers’ perspectives so that we can share the best, most memorable
moments of life with those customers.

     Value Creation Story
           Our History of Value Creation
AEON MALL continues to evolve in response to changing lifestyles.
As ever, we remain committed to growing and developing, both in Japan and overseas.
1992
The first AEON MALL location, AEON MALL Tsugaru Kashiwa (Aomori Prefecture), opened in 1992 amid growing domestic motorization.
A mall with a large parking lot and diverse tenants offering a wide variety of merchandise in a suburban area proved successful from the aspect of town planning in attracting customers who drove to the store in their own cars. It was the harbinger of an era in which lifestyles shifted from urban areas and train stations to the suburbs.
Large-Scale Retail Stores Law
Audits required for large store openings for store area, closing time, number of days closed, etc. In 1994, restrictions on store size, application procedures, closing times, and closing days were eased.
Operating Income
2000
AEON MALL began serving as infrastructure for local communities, offering entertainment, public administrative and community functions, and disaster relief support. We played a role in reactivating communities by responding to calls for opening AEON MALL shopping centers.
Three Laws Related to Town Development
Deregulation resulted in examining large-scale stores according to social vectors, including the impact on the economy and living environment. Authority shifted from the national to the local level.
* The Three Laws related to town development are defined as the (1) City Planning Act which governs zoning (land use regulations), (2) the Large-scale Retail Location Law, which sets up systems to coordinate with local communities, and (3) the City Center Revitalization Act, which supports the revitalization of city centers.

                         2011
A growing community presence in Japan and overseas
Unique malls tailored to the characteristics of each region and country
Shopping centers throughout Japan became more homogenized and subject to even more competition. AEON MALL developed unique malls that focused on localization, pursuing a strategy of opening in growth areas of Asia seeing an expansion of the middle class. We are increasing our presence in local communities both in Japan and overseas.
Revised City Planning Act
2017
A growing middle class in Asia
Becoming the dominant commercial developer in Asia, striving to resolve local issues in Japan and overseas
In China and the ASEAN, AEON MALL serves as a partner urban and regional development. We build malls that respond to strong consumer markets. In Japan, AEON is confronting the challenge of weakened connections within communities due to declining birth rates and an aging population. Here, we pursue value by working with local governments as a leader in regional revitalization.
With no sign of ending in the decline of city centers, the development permitting system under the City Planning Act was revised in 2007. Regulations were tightened for the opening of stores having a total floor space of 10,000m2 or more.

     Value Creation Story
           The Strengths of AEON MALL
AEON MALL has cultivated six strengths as we continue to grow along with the communities we serve. We will endeavor to further deepen the foundations of our business by improving on these strengths.
Strength
We generate cash flows through managing and operating shopping malls. This allows us to maintain a consistently sound financial position and leverage borrowing capacity (net debt-equity ratio of about 1:1) to procure funds. We generate growth funds through the sale of mall land and buildings to real estate investment trusts and the use of development leases. These vehicles allow us access to flexible investments in growth, while accelerating the speed of return on investment and improving asset efficiency.
• EBITDA: ¥101.7 billion (Overseas: ¥14.7 billion) • Equity ratio: 31.9%
• Net D/E ratio: 1.1 times
Strength
We use the expertise gained through operating more than 200 locations worldwide to develop and operate comfortable, safe, and secure malls that meet the needs of a wide spectrum of customers. We focus intently on
the unique characteristics and needs of each community. Our Happiness Malls community initiatives and public functions coordinated with local government provide sustainable malls that become the first choice of both customers and tenants.

13 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT
Q In what important ways does the AEON MALL management philosophy reflect corporate value?
AEON MALL is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living. This is our management philosophy. We began as a developer specializing in shopping
mall development, management, and operations. We incorporate community design into the development of our shopping malls, and we have continued to grow by creating new residential areas in outlying suburbs, contributing
to regional reactivation. Over the years, declining birth rates, aging demographics, e-commerce, and more have changed the social environment. In response, we have shifted to incorporate the idea of Life Design in helping customers create their own lifestyles. We have evolved with the times. Although our Basic Principle that the Customer Comes First will never change, the concept of helping our customers discover new lifestyles has become another part of our philosophy.
AEON MALL engages in business from the perspective of a retailer, which means we listen to customer feedback to learn about their lives. Beyond that, we want to provide other suggestions and insights about living. We want to be a consultative company that creates spaces attractive to customers. This concept is always at the forefront of my thinking.
This approach of proposing new ideas is particularly important overseas, where we compete against home- grown companies. As emerging countries ride a wave
of economic development to catch up to the advanced nations, we must create shopping malls tailored to the local community, while offering all the benefits of the Japanese- style shopping experience. We must create facilities that are attractive to the people of these nations. We want to create value by incorporating our unique character and expertise.

Managing and operating more than 150 malls in Japan
at this point, we have accumulated a wealth of expertise in shopping mall management. We hope to leverage this expertise in China and the various ASEAN countries, which are expected to see growth of the type that Japan experienced in the past. In Vietnam, for example, we see the same trends developing that we saw when we began opening malls in suburban Japan. We see the rise of young families, the accompanying needs for motorization, and growing demand for family entertainment. The Vietnam of today is seeking facilities that offer safety, security, cleanliness, and space for everyday enjoyment. Our strategy to leverage our track record in Japan in our overseas business is a tremendous strength here.
Now is the perfect time to entrench deeply in the markets of Asia. It will be too late to wait until after the markets mature. However, the speed of change in Asia
is incredibly fast, which means instead of adopting the Japanese model as-is, we must always look one step ahead. We need to use our successes from Japan as a base upon which we add new concepts for these markets.
In Cambodia, many consumers want to purchase physical goods. However, our second mall in Cambodia, AEON MALL Sen Sok City, opened in 2018, offers many intangibles beyond merchandise. More specifically, the facility is home to a water park, an indoor amusement park, a TV studio and broadcast center, and many other amusement and entertainment options. This was the first time that the local community had seen such a facility. Perhaps this leading-edge concept was slightly ahead of its time for the region, but this is our key to beating the competition. At the same time, we are adapting knowledge learned from challenges overseas to use in our new malls in Japan. Integrating our overseas business and domestic
business is sure to become a significant strength for AEON MALL.
However, it takes several years for malls overseas to become profitable. We must exercise patience as we wait for returns on our advance investments. Once we train local staff and foster local talent to become mall general managers, then we will have created a completely localized structure for mall management. Having exercised patience in seeing a return on our investments in development and training, we were proud to announce that our overseas business as a whole reported profit for fiscal 2018. I believe we can expect steady profit growth from here on out.

 Q What is AEON MALL doing to instill its management philosophy, management vision, and values throughout your company?
If we are to instill our management philosophy throughout the company, each employee must develop an attitude
of ownership. For example, when we think about localization, we must create a mechanism by which local staff take ownership in planning and communicating with the local community. Further, to engage in ESG-based management, we must undertake initiatives to teach
each employee exactly what this means. At present, we announce policies, hold regular morning meetings, and sponsor conferences to this end. Employees participate in activities that contribute to the environment, which include tree planting, afforestation, and cleaning activities. Through these activities, employees take ownership of the E aspect of ESG.
A company must also define concrete targets based on philosophies and visions, using quantifiable numbers to measure progress toward goals. As departments conduct their business in the pursuit of their own goals, these departments must also consider specific ways to achieve profits and our management philosophy.

 15 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT
Our Vision for 2025 is a long-term vision consisting of
four major goals. Our medium-term management plan is
a three-year plan we developed through backcasting to achieve our long-term vision. It’s important to focus on the job in front of you. At the same time, however, we must manage our business looking ahead to medium- and long- term targets, rather than just short-term ones.
The first step in our long-term vision is to build a

                 Value Creation Story

Value Creation Management
Value Creation Results
Financial Information/ Company Overview
        portfolio of multiple business models. This means that we respond to the risk of market contraction in Japan due to the declining and aging population via a multiple number
of business models. First, we must secure our format overseas, rather than placing all our weight on the back foot in Japan. And in Japan, we think we can build a third pillar by establishing a new urban-style format in addition to our suburban business.
Second, we have set a goal to generate consolidated operating income of ¥100 billion. This goal will put us among the top class of global commercial developers. Overseas, major companies in America generate profits in this range.
Third, we will strengthen our shopping mall business at home. We intend to become the overwhelmingly dominant mall in each area in Japan. This means opening new malls and renovating and expanding existing malls to generate greater activity and excitement. The declining and aging population, as well as the advance of e-commerce, have produced challenges to our business and increased competition within our areas of operations. We believe that, in the future, people will gather together in spaces that offer the most outstanding services and the most outstanding content. This is why we continue to expand and renovate existing malls to outclass any other competitor, even for our malls that are already the most popular in their market area. Of course, our malls will offer shopping. But, beyond that, we are creating facilities that offer entertainment, dining options, health clinics, rest areas, and other services that meet the needs of our customers. Please don’t misinterpret what I say to mean that we our expanding blindly. We understand how important it is to deliver content that matches the characteristics of a local community. We
also understand how important it is to respond to the changing times with flexibility and speed, which is why we continuously review and revise the makeup of our tenants within our malls.
The average age of AEON MALL structures is 10.9 years. •VAiaprepvriotaliczhatiton,Rfuervthitearlieznahtaionncement of value.

Fourth, we have set a goal for overseas operating income of ¥35 billion. At this level, our overseas business will be operating at the same level of efficiency and scale as our business in Japan. Our regional focus is on Asia. At present, we operate malls overseas in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia. We are conducting feasibility studies*1 as we look into new markets as well.
The AEON MALL three-year plan for accomplishing our long-term vision consists of five main pillars: (1) Capture growth opportunities in Asia; (2) Develop latent sources
of domestic demand; (3) Become the overwhelmingly dominant mall in each region; (4) Capture urban growth opportunities; and (5) Implement an optimal financing mix and build organizational structures that support growth.
Among these pillars, our top priority is on investment overseas. Timing is important when investing in rapidly growing markets. Once a market matures, land prices begin to rise, as do construction costs. More competitors enter the picture as well. We believe we must exercise foresight and make the first preemptive move.
Fiscal 2019 is the final year of our current medium- term plan and an extremely important year for us to achieve our intermediate goals on the way to our long-term targets in the year 2025.
*1 An examination conducted when planning a new business to determine the likelihood of success.
 Vision for 2025
(1) Build a portfolio of multiple business models, rather than rely on domestic malls as a single source of profit generation.
(2) Make AEON MALL a leading global commercial developer with consolidated operating income of ¥100 billion.
(3) Conduct floor space expansions and renovations in Japan to become the dominant mall in each area.
(4) Target overseas operating income of ¥35 billion (operating margin 20%) across 70 malls, operating at the same level of efficiency and scale as our domestic operations.

     Value Creation Strategies
           Message from the President and CEO
Q How does the AEON MALL business model address social value creation?
I think you can say our business model is social infrastructure. Our Happiness Mall initiatives are built first on the principle of Health. Next is Wellness, followed by Community, and then Opportunity. These are all principles deeply desired in Japanese society. Even in today’s information society, people want physical and mental health. They want easy access to the arts and culture. They want more opportunities to interact with others.
Our Happiness Malls provide spaces that satisfy these wants. We offer safe indoor AEON MALL Walking available regardless of weather, yoga classes, Opera de AEON MALL, and so much more. AEON MALL facilities create social value for customers through spaces that fulfill their desires and contribute solutions to many other issues.
Last year, Japan experienced a number of natural disasters. In times of earthquake, typhoons, heavy rains, landslides, intense heat, or other extreme conditions, communities and local citizens want somewhere to find relief. For example, western Japan experienced disastrous heavy rains in July 2018. Although we had closed our
malls in the area, we opened up the rooftop parking area and let in nearly 2,300 cars, allowing people to spend the night. At present, we have signed general cooperative agreements and disaster response agreements with most local governments where AEON MALLs are located. This
is true overseas, as well. During the heavy rains in Vietnam, 200 people or so evacuated to the local AEON MALL. Serving as a refuge in times of disaster like this is another important role we provide as social infrastructure. Providing infrastructure in the format of a shopping mall is something that fulfills the needs of society and is something that we want to do to an even greater degree.
Q What are the strengths that make AEON MALL the preferred choice of customers?
The sheer scale of the 150 malls we manage and operate throughout Japan serves as an enormous foundation. Beyond that, we engage in business activities at our locations that are rooted in the local communities. We also develop friendly, cooperative relationships with local governments and organizations. These local relationships are another significant strength.
Another strength is our ability to attract customers. On an annual basis, we welcome 1.2 billion customers
to our nearly 150 locations across Japan. A business environment allowing a company to interact with 1.2 billion customers throughout the year is extremely rare. So, how does one make the most of this strength? We develop numerous ideas tailored for the changing times. Designing mechanisms to communicate with 1.2 billion people and encourage them to remain loyal customers is another factor that leads directly to greater strengths. Another strength
of ours is the business relationships we have established with the 30,000 tenants—representing nearly 8,000 companies—in our malls.
Our people represent another important strength.
We make diversity work for us. Our employee distribution shows a significant number of younger employees, as
well as many female and non-Japanese employees. We intend to focus even more on the effective use of human resources and diversity as we increase our global presence.
Q
 17 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT
What challenges do you see on the way to achieving your long-term vision?
As we grow, one challenge will be how to foster the next generation of leaders capable of guiding this expanding entity. The larger a company becomes, the greater the risk associated with the time required to respond to changes in the external environment. We must develop an organizational structure capable of responding to changes in the environment.
Another issue for the company such as ours, which has done business in the “real” world historically, is how we integrate digital technologies. E-commerce and cashless systems are becoming more prevalent. We must adapt

     Financial Information/ Company Overview
            Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategies Value Creation Management Value Creation Results
         and develop business models tailored to this era to offer customers the most convenient mix of online and offline shopping. We are also thinking of ways to create a stress- free environment in our malls through the use of digital technology. One example is developing AI-embedded information boards that provide instant access to real-time information about the mall. We also believe that work-style reform in both front-line and back office functions can be accomplished through digital technology.
Q How would you score your progress toward your medium-term management plan?
We are progressing generally in line with plan. Although many seem to be concerned about the impact of slowing in the Chinese economy, we haven’t suffered any damage to date. Our mall renovations and other projects we conduct on three-year cycles have been successful so far. In Japan, activities to establish ourselves as the overwhelmingly dominant mall in each region secured customer traffic
at the same level as the prior fiscal year. Further, our Happiness Mall initiatives have been well-received in all corners.
Q What measures are you taking toward ESGs and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (SDGs)?
More recently, the social spotlight has focused on ESG, but these are really matters that the AEON Group has exercised as part of our corporate culture for a long
time. AEON MALL has established policies for corporate activities related to society, the environment, and ethics. The AEON MALL Corporate Social Responsibility Council meets on a monthly basis to manage the implementation of these policies and make timely decisions in managing the progress of, and solving issues related to, our CSR activities. For example, we are installing charging stations for electric vehicles at our malls and we were the first Japanese company to declare participation in EV100*2. These are just a few instances of how we embody the E
in ESG. In fact, we have installed 2,332 electric vehicle chargers across 158 malls in and outside of Japan. We were recognized for the fourth consecutive year as a Green Star company under the GRESB*3 real estate benchmark.
For many years, the AEON Group has fostered the S of ESG (Social) deep in the roots of our organization. Our business features both aspects of BtoC and BtoBtoC. BtoC is where customers come to our malls. BtoBtoC is the point at which we interact with customers through our tenants.
Without communities and a customer-first approach, we wouldn’t be in business at all. It’s only natural that
we value our communities. For example, we have
signed disaster prevention agreements with many local governments. For the 2018 House of Representatives
 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 18
     
     Value Creation Strategies
           Message from the President and CEO
election, we provided 31 polling stations across Japan for early voting. In the April 2019 nationwide local elections, we similarly provided 44 polling stations.
We have opened 25 AEON Yume-Mirai Nursery Schools at malls throughout Japan, available to both AEON employees and employees of our tenants. For the third consecutive year, we were selected as a Nadeshiko Brand, an honor which recognizes publicly traded companies that encourage the participation of women in the workplace. We are the only company in the real estate sector to be so honored in three consecutive years.
As much as possible, we rely on our local operations to provide employee training, which helps instill a value
for customer first and an appreciation for the community. Training extends beyond classroom learning. We try to let our young employees take responsibility for projects as much as possible. As they meet and overcome obstacles, they build a portfolio of success, which helps them develop as professionals.
Finally, we practice corporate ethics that emphasize the importance of governance and compliance in our work—the G of ESG—from the standpoint of a retail business. We continue to strengthen our other group governance functions, including our overseas subsidiaries. More specifically, we are building up our audit and management division functions to collect information from local operations with greater speed.
• Social Functions of AEON MALLs
Engaging in serious ESG management leads naturally to the SDGs. ESG will be an integral part of our entire business, as long as senior management promotes policies and consistently practices every aspect. At the same time, it is crucial that we clearly prioritize our ESG initiatives.

*3 An international benchmark measuring the performance of real estate portfolios and infrastructure assets in terms of environmental, social, and governance considerations.
Q What can you tell us about the AEON MALL fiscal 2019 policies and the outlook for future growth beyond fiscal 2019?
Fiscal 2019 will be a very important year for us. Profit growth slowed during our fiscal 2011 to 2013 and fiscal 2014 to 2016 medium-term plans. However, profit growth ratios are rising under our current three-year plan (launched in fiscal 2017) as compared to the two fiscal years prior, periods in which we incurred advance costs toward future growth. This next fiscal year will be a crucial concluding chapter of this installment. Our overseas business has turned a profit, and now we are entering a stage in which we will recover our investment. And, fiscal 2019 should bring a significant increase in profits. This is a year in
which we are focused on executing our plan toward

AEON MALL conducts business with an eye toward the medium and long term. At the same time, we will see short-term factors during fiscal 2019, including a new imperial era and revised consumption taxes in Japan. We will do everything in our power to identify signs of change in the external environment and in customer behavior, responding with agility and expending every effort to grow AEON MALL profits.

 Finally, we confirmed the relevance (materiality analysis process and results) of these topics from the standpoint of our outside independent directors and in consideration of the unique AEON MALL business model. We revised group-wide materiality based on these opinions, and then confirmed the topics in a meeting of the CSR Council.
* AEON MALL engages in business localized to the communities we serve, and we believe solving community social issues is part of our mission as a business. The AEON MALL CSR Council, chaired by the president of our company, meets monthly to ensure we make progress toward our ideal of Creating Shared Value (CSV), conducting business integrated with the principles of CSR. The council discusses details and progress related to four materialities, represented by E (environment), S (social), G (governance), and C (communication).
  We used our management philosophy and medium- term management plan to ascertain the importance of these topics to AEON MALL.

     Value Creation Strategies
           Our Profit Model
To achieve the AEON MALL medium- to long-term business plan, we plan to grow our earnings capacity and increase corporate value, while improving investment efficiency and maximizing cash flow. We work to build a sound and strong financial foundation to support our growth strategy.
 Mall Operations Profit Structure
Most of AEON MALL's operating revenue is derived from
the rental income paid by our mall tenants. Real estate rental income consists of a fixed rental income and a commission rental income, which fluctuates according to the retail sales of tenant specialty stores. With commission rental income, AEON MALL operating income also increases as the retail sales of tenant specialty stores increases.
In many cases, minimum guaranteed retail sales are set on a monthly or yearly basis for commission rent. This way, minimum rent is guaranteed, even if the tenant is temporarily unable to exceed a certain level of retail sales.
Operating costs, which are the expenses directly related to mall management and operations, include personnel expenses for full-time mall employees, facilities maintenance
• Japanese operating revenue and expense structure
Selling, general and administrative expenses
expenses and utilities for mall facilities, rent paid to the owners of the mall land and buildings, and depreciation and amortization expenses for facilities. The expenses that make up the highest proportion relative to operating income are rent and depreciation and amortization expenses.
In China, on the other hand, government-affiliated developers handle the development of roads and towns as
a whole. AEON MALL serves as a master lessee recruitng tenants for our commercial facilities. While we receive
rental income from tenants, the burden of operating costs
is significant. Typically, malls take several years to become profitable. However, since the greatest portion of operating costs consists of real estate costs, expenses do not increase significantly. Operating revenue will grow for several years stemming from commission rental income and revisions in rent fees tied to increases in sales.

Looking at future economic growth, we are constructing spacious facilities with large parking lots on par with those in Japan. At present, real estate costs are high, leading to low profit levels. However, these facilities enjoy high growth rates and growing operating revenues. Costs consist largely of real estate costs that remain flat over time, resulting in high profit growth.

         Financial Strategy for Stronger Profit Structure
In recent years, construction costs have remained high in Japan, making it difficult to improve the efficiency of new stores. Given these circumstances, AEON MALL reduced the number of new mall openings to one in FY2019. If construction costs continue to remain high, we will limit new location openings to around two or three per year.
Meanwhile, we have studied properties that lend themselves to expansion of floor space. We are conducting floor space expansions at a rate of three or four malls per year. AEON MALL facilities feature flat parking lots, zoned at the time of construction to accommodate future mall expansion.
In Japan, a process of elimination for malls has begun. Mall- opening strategies for specialty store operators is shifting from growth via numbers to a priority on efficiency. AEON MALL has a track record of creating malls that are the overwhelmingly dominant malls in their regions. Specialty store operators
know that AEON MALL facilities attract customers and that
we can increase retail floor area and remodel malls, while also generating sales growth through synergistic effects derived from attracting other tenants.
Overseas, our plans call for 70 malls by 2025. We will focus on area-dominant store openings in four areas: Beijing/ Tianjin/Shandong; Jiangsu/Zhejiang; Hubei; and Guangdong. In ASEAN, we will focus on Vietnam, Indonesia, and
Use of WACC at AEON MALL
We consider internal rate of return to be the equivalent of
net present value. Accordingly, we deem any investment in which internal rate of return exceeds the cost of capital to be a proper investment. When investing overseas, we use the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and an overseas risk premium to make investment decisions, balanced by country
Cambodia. We recorded net operating income in our Overseas business for the first time in FY2018. We are now at a stage where increasing profits here will be the driver of growth for the company. At the same time, the weight of our overseas assets will continue to increase. In China, our basic approach will
be to lease assets. In ASEAN, as well, we will create leasing schemes similar to those we use in China.
In support of this strategy, the AEON MALL three-
year plan for FY2017-2019 calls for ¥575 billion in capital investment. A total ¥445 billion of this spending will be in Japan (¥275 billion for new malls, ¥150 billion for existing malls, ¥20 billion for OPA). We will invest ¥130 billion overseas (¥30 billion in China and ¥100 billion in ASEAN).
We intend to procure ¥270 billion of these funds from our operating cash flow, with another ¥15 billion from funds on hand for a total of ¥285 billion. The remainder will be covered with debt and REITs. The company will maintain a net debt- equity ratio of approximately one times.
For AEON MALL, a one times net debt-equity ratio is an important indicator of our discipline. Although we recorded
a negative free cash flow this year, our overseas operations will begin generating a cash flow in FY2019. Accordingly, we anticipate free cash flow will turn positive during the course of our next medium-term management plan (FY2020 to FY2022).
risk considerations.
We calculate WACC according to the weighted
average of borrowing cost and cost of shareholders’ equity. Shareholders' equity cost is the anticipated yield required by investors when issuing shares. We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model to calculate the investor's anticipated yield for the market price as of the closing date of our fiscal year.

     Value Creation Strategies
           Building on Our Strengths
Several AEON MALL Group directors shared their views on the strengths of their divisions and the supporting AEON Group strategies.
 Maximizing Potential as a Developer
Kaoru Iwamoto
Vice President, Development Officer
One of our greatest strengths as a retail business that integrates general financing and services is our ability to develop properties leveraging the AEON Group brand, infrastructure, and assets. Further, we can adopt the best practices from China and ASEAN into our Japanese businesses, while at the same time extending our expertise in Japan to those regions. This integration of overseas and Japanese expertise is a major advantage. In 2018, we combined our overseas planning functions into the Development Division, generating greater synergies through closer coordination between Japan and overseas. Another competitive strength is our ability to create new businesses completely in-house, as we tend to avoid outsourcing.
The mission of the Development Division is location selection. Our area strategy calls for tailoring our content to specific communities. To achieve this strategy, we will train our staff with greater skills to produce new ideas from the planning
Attracting Customers Through Economies of Scale From 153 Malls Across Japan
Akio Mishima
Managing Director, General Manager of Sales Division
Our mission is to maximize revenues and profits through more customer traffic. And, our greatest advantage here is the 153 malls we own and operate throughout Japan. This is a strength unique among developers in our space. Another advantage is how AEON MALL strives to localize our malls to the needs and preferences of the local community. This creates an advantage in our ability to combine goods and services organically in a fun space via a BtoBtoC business model. Specific instances of this localization include our Happiness Mall initiatives, carefully planned special customer events, points programs, and more. The Sales Division consists of more than 1,500 employees. We divide this large organization into smaller areas overseen by a division general manager. I believe this size and structure offer another advantage to AEON MALL over the competition.
In the future, we intend to raise our presence as part of the community infrastructure, using AEON MALL spaces for
stages to completion. To improve training requires a more stable system that uses manuals and other standard practices. Human resources strategy will be a key for brick-and-mortar businesses to win in this digital era. We also intend to improve our decision-making practices to reflect the type of speed required by landowners, governments, and others in the community. And, in terms of the environment and society, we will continue to obtain environmental certifications and create spaces that foster community-building in response to lower birthrates and aging demographics.
Our key policies over the medium and long term consist of leveraging the urban assets of the AEON Group. We see multi-use commercial complexes as a key growth area. Here, office workers will become repeat, steady customers for shopping, dining, and entertainment in the same facilities. We intend to recruit talent from outside the company as one means to achieve this goal.
disaster-relief, early voting, and other public benefits. In times of disaster, AEON MALL can be a location to safely evacuate, offering confidence and safety. We can offer nursery school and other support to facilitate work-style improvement among employees of our tenants.
We can foster deeper ties to our communities by proving ourselves an indispensable part of the local infrastructure, integrating brick-and-mortar with e-commerce and other digital technologies to create a hybrid virtual-real space. AEON MALL plans to offer even faster support to our tenants, rolling out QR code-based cashless payment systems and planning sales promotion activities that correspond to major developments such as consumption tax increases.

         Cultural Integration and an Overwhelming Sense of Scale
Mitsuhiro Fujiki
Managing Director, General Manager of Leasing Division
One important mission of the Leasing Division is to find outstanding tenants. We strive to find new business partners and create stronger communities with our tenants as part of our responsibility for the real estate operations of a shopping mall development company. At the same time, another important part of our job is to go out and gain a sense for what is happening “now” in society. Leasing Division staff must go out and talk with people, observe behavior, and get a personal sense of the community. Staff in charge of restaurants must go out and eat. Staff in charge of fashion must read voraciously, go window shopping, and research the latest trends. We have to be sensitive to the newest developments and information out in the world. And, perhaps most of all, we must challenge ourselves always to try something new. This is the type of organization to which the Leasing Division aspires.
Our relationship with the nearly 8,000 tenants of the AEON Group is our strength. This major asset represents an
Using Digital Technology for Outstanding Brick-and-Mortar Experiences
Akiko Nakarai
Director, General Manager of Digital Promotion Management Department
We promote digital advancements along three vectors: (1) Developing an omnichannel approach to commerce; (2) Raising customer satisfaction through stress-free environments; and (3) Improving labor productivity. As Japan’s online business begins to reach a saturation point, we are working with platform providers to combine digital technologies with real-world AEON MALL assets. Meanwhile, we are making progress in our online business overseas in various ASEAN countries. One strength of digital promotion at AEON MALL is our access to 1.2 billion records of consumer transaction data in Japan, which we can use to create future business opportunities. Another strength is our access to partnerships, leveraging assets and relationships throughout the AEON Group.
Malls of the future must offer systems and digital-based conveniences, including maps, cashless transactions, highly
overwhelming scale only dreamed of by our competitors. Our advantage is the sheer number of malls located in areas from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south. AEON MALL is home to people with a wide variety of backgrounds. This diversity and variety helps us expand our perceptions.
Presently, our target is the second-generation baby boomers and their families, a wider cross-section of the population pyramid. Today, the most fashion-conscious age group is the group in their 50s, just entering our target zone. We hope to exploit this trend for further growth. At the same time, we plan to strengthen our strategy to raise added value and create a smoother cycle between the consumption of goods and the consumption of services. Here, we aim to capture a larger volume area of the market for seniors.
visible electronic signage, and stress-free cash register transactions. We are already conducting proof-of-concept tests for QR code-based cashless transactions, other digital infrastructure, and personal mobility.
Other important future topics include creating a digital network across the AEON Group for easy access by and convenience to customers. We plan to utilize our storehouse of data to identify the most appropriate services in this respect. As of the end of 2018, nearly every AEON MALL has been outfitted with Wi-Fi equipment, allowing online access throughout Japan. Looking ahead to 2020, we intend to welcome the opportunities offered by inbound tourist traffic to provide stress-free online environments for customers from overseas, adding to the excitement and enjoyment of their experience in ways unique to AEON MALL.

        Sustainable Growth and Social Value Creation: The Social Significance of AEON MALL
Watanabe AEON MALL defined a long-term vision in Vision for 2025, aiming to implement our management philosophy more precisely and drive greater growth in the face of rapid changes in our business environment. At present, we are executing on the third year of a three-year business plan based on this long-term vision. Our outside officers provide their input about this plan and related policies at the company’s Policy Meeting.
In today’s round table discussion, we will address ESG-based management topics as they relate to the AEON MALL medium- and long-term strategies. I want to start with everyone’s thoughts on the social significance of AEON MALL from the standpoints of sustainable growth and social value creation.
Taira One of our best-known initiatives is our Happiness Mall events and services that build on the important ties to the local community. We are creating community-based malls that serve as a center for encouraging interactions among people in the local community. People say that neighborhood relationships have become weaker in this age of the internet. Our initiatives to create stronger bonds within the community are perfectly in line with our business concept of building malls that grow together with the community.
AEON MALL sponsors events that provide an opportunity and space for the community to come together in love and support. In this way, we help the people of our communities live happier lives. Many of our tenants say that they want to participate, too. These events create more value around the AEON brand, which leads to more profits and so on in a virtuous cycle. Isn’t this what we want when we talk about creating sustainable social value growth?
As one measure toward diversity, we offer AEON Yume-Mirai (Dreams for the Future) Nursery Schools. At present, the AEON Group operates 25 nursery schools,
18 of which are in AEON MALL facilities. The nursery school isn’t just for working mothers. They are every bit as necessary for working fathers and every person who works in the mall, which is a wonderful support mechanism. The schools are open during mall hours, which lets employees work without worrying about the time. Not many other nursery schools can provide this benefit. In the future,
I hope to see people from the local community taking advantage of our nursery schools as well.
Kawabata I want to address three topics related to the environment. First, I want to stress that AEON MALL makes good on our promises about the environment. The AEON Group business cards are printed with the slogan, “Planting
  2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 36
     
     Value Creation Management
           Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
Seeds of Growth.” This refers to our extensive tree planting activities. We have even declared that we manage our company based on principles of sustainability.
Prior to opening a new mall, we work with families in the community to plant trees in and around the area. This AEON Hometown Forestry Program has been a policy at AEON MALL for many years. In June 2018, nearly 700 people came to plant 7,000 trees at the AEON MALL Iwaki Onahama complex. More recently, we planted cherry
trees in Vietnam, supporting the Hanoi City 1 Million Tree Plan. Japanese cherry trees don’t thrive in the Vietnamese climate, so we have planted a special variety for three years running. When these trees finally blossom, I think people will recognize the wonderful contribution we have made to the city and the country.
Second, we have launched several energy initiatives to prevent global warming. AEON MALL has set numerical goals for CO2 emission reductions, aiming to halve our energy usage by 2020 as compared to 2010 levels. One specific tactic is the use of LED lights in the common areas of our malls. We have also noted the global growth of electric vehicles. Here, we have installed 1,829 electric vehicle chargers across 146 malls in Japan. In China, where EV is growing rapidly, we have already installed 503 chargers across 12 malls. I can say clearly that we are promoting environmental preservation within and through our business activities.
Third, we offer our communities an enjoyable, comfortable environment. Rather than environment per se, I should say that we are starting a revolution in hygienic environments. We are known in Asia, in particular, as having clean, easy-to-use bathrooms in our malls. When
I visited Cambodia in January of this year, I was deeply impressed to hear the locals use the term “pre-AEON/post- AEON.” We aren’t just famous for our bathrooms, either. AEON MALL Sen Sok City, our second mall in Cambodia, features a brilliant combination of sports and entertainment facilities. Local citizens have never seen the likes of the
lifestyles encouraged by this advanced shopping complex. After opening our first location in Phnom Penh in 2014, more than ten other modern commercial facilities have been constructed. The local media is saying the city has gone through a complete change. The opening of an AEON MALL has raised the bar for hygiene and lifestyles in the local community. I have come to understand the important role AEON MALL’s business plays in the social infrastructure.
Watanabe I visited Cambodia in 2014, but the city
was completely different when I went again last year.
I truly experienced the meaning of pre-AEON/post- AEON. I gained a new appreciation for how important our contributions can be in a developing economy.
 37 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT
Ichige I want to talk about how the AEON MALL business model itself contributes to society. In the ASEAN countries, recent conflicts have meant that many in the working-age generation have lost their lives. Today, the average age in Vietnam is 30 years, while the average age in Cambodia is around 25. The populations of these countries skew very young. We expect the economies of these countries to develop in the future. At the same time, these countries have a deep desire for peace. They want happiness. They want to smile.
Our role in delivering value is as a Life Design

     Financial Information/ Company Overview
            Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategies Value Creation Management Value Creation Results
        Developer creating the future of community living. I think there is no better place than these countries for us to do so. In Japan and overseas, we raise the quality of life for local communities, setting a higher standard for happiness. I believe our initiatives in pursuit of this vision line up perfectly with ESG-based management.
After becoming president, Mr. Yoshida invited a variety of opinions before announcing our Vision for 2025. I think it is excellent that we have attached numerical targets to each step along the path toward practical achievement of this vision. Of course, we are not simply forging ahead to achieve numbers. When we perform a rolling update to our medium- term plan, we must look back on the relationships to our philosophy and core values, focusing on what we can do as a Life Design Developer to reach our long-term vision.
Muramatsu Looking back over the past 10 years in Japan, we see that more companies are trying to figure out how to highlight their CSR activities. More companies are incorporating CSR into the mainstream of their corporate activities. Looking at AEON MALL CSR activities from this perspective, as Director Kawabata said, we have already been engaged in socially significant initiatives for quite some time. I think highlighting these activities will lead to improved recognition and approval of our brand.
I have experience working in several outlying regions in Japan, and I have felt personally the importance of AEON MALL to these communities. AEON MALL is more than
just a shopping center. AEON MALL represents part of the surrounding social infrastructure, playing a role just as crucial as the public roads. Even more, AEON MALL serves as a focus for public activities, including blood drives, early voting, tax return filings, and more. Of particular note is the number of post offices located at AEON MALL facilities. These types of public services could be a key to our future growth.
Watanabe The company policy when I joined Jusco, the precursor to AEON Co., Ltd., was to serve local
communities through commerce. I think this fits with the S component of ESG. The AEON Group reinvented itself over a short span of time by responding to changes in society and always focusing on the customer first.
In fact, the AEON MALL basic philosophy now is
The Customer Comes First. We have a mission to use the stage of our malls to share the best, most unforgettable experiences with our customers by working together with our tenants, who are members of AEON Store Association group. Our reward is the smiling faces and sincere words of gratitude from our customers.
I think respect for our customers, our partners, our vendors, our employees, and other stakeholders is the S in ESG; our contribution to society. Our mall business, with deep roots in retail, must always be a human- and peace- centric industry.
Next, I want to guide the discussion toward governance, which warrants a growth policy that capitalizes on the strengths of our business model. In that light, let’s take a look back on fiscal 2018 and our assessment of the board of directors, areas of improvement, major discussions, and significant issues. Can you talk about contribution
and controls related to the evaluations of the effectiveness

     Value Creation Management
           Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
A Governance Structure Ensuring Growth Policy That Leverages the Strengths of the AEON MALL Business Model
Ichige When we talk about G [Governance], we usually talk about complying with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code. However, I wonder whether we are missing the point of governance in the first place. Some say governance is
to prevent the all-too-frequent occurrences of corporate fraud and scandal. The preamble to the code says to “boost corporate profitability through aggressive governance.” I think these are two sides of the same coin. We shouldn’t forget that governance is to secure the effectiveness of corporate policies and growth strategy, while strengthening defenses at the same time.
Our Management Vision and Management Philosophy, serve as a foundation for growth strategy. From there, we must address how to implement board of director oversight and board member diversity with respect to our strategy. We must talk about what skills, experience, and character are required for the job. We established a Nomination and Compensation Committee in fiscal 2018. Here as well, it
is important that we discuss the type of people needed
to support growth, assuming our existing corporate
growth strategies. Another issue with the Nomination and Compensation Committee is evaluating the performance
of those in charge of running the business. Our managers should be evaluated not only on current issues, but also
on how well they perform their assigned mission in the context of growth and business strategies. Decisions about compensation and nomination (for board members) should be based on this evaluation.
President Yoshida was correct to outline our growth strategy as his first matter of business. The next step after growth strategy is to put together a governance structure ensuring the execution of this strategy. I think we are in this phase now.
At the same time, new areas of business and new business models entail risk. We must raise our level of internal controls and risk management to deal with these risks. I think the greatest legal risks when entering markets overseas are risks related to corruption and bribery. Last year we established a basic policy for preventing bribery. Now, we are conducting training based on this policy. Outsiders have commended us on our very detailed risk management structure and comprehensive rules. The next important item on our agenda is creating a mechanism for the board of directors to monitor our business.

     Financial Information/ Company Overview
            Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategies Value Creation Management Value Creation Results
        Muramatsu In June 2018, the Tokyo Stock Exchange published its Revised Japan’s Corporate Governance Code. The same month, the Financial Services Agency issued and enacted Guidelines for Investor and Company Engagement. These new rules gained considerable attention for the use of the phrase “cost of capital.” AEON MALL is a business in which many investors and financial institutions entrust their capital, which we invest in significant amounts. Naturally, our minimum terms of investment require returns that exceed the cost of capital.
In Japan, soaring construction material costs have meant rising levels of investment per mall. While our businesses in Japan have been working to reduce mall operations costs, greater care in detailed profit and loss management at individual malls is necessary in an era where we can no longer expect rapidly rising growth rates.
At the same time, we are working in developing economies and countries with very strict government
control over business. Here, one key to success is making investments that keep pace with the nation-building policies of the local government. Some business practices still
reflect pre-modern customs, which can lead to corruption.
If a fraudulent act is uncovered, it may not only affect a company’s reputation, but also cause significant losses
in a worst-case scenario. As we expand our presence overseas, the actions of our employees worldwide affect more than just their own personal lives. We must emphasize in the strongest terms, time and again, that the actions of employees can threaten the very existence of their employer.
Watanabe I see various on-site issues and problems when I go out and visit our operations. I understand it takes extra energy for employees overseas to hold to the Japanese sense of morals. Here, the company must provide proper support, rather than leaving such things to the individual alone. I think this point is reflected in President Yoshida’s remark about emphasizing communication due to the distances involved.
Taira In addition to board of director meetings, I also attend the Management Council as part of my duties. I’m
a bit concerned about how much time is spent in these meetings discussing operations. I think we should set more time aside to discuss important management issues and goals.
Our Corporate Governance Report includes a section titled, "Policy on Measures to Protect Minority Shareholders in Conducting Transactions With a Controlling Shareholder." This policy states, "[The Company] makes our own independent management decisions related to daily business operations...embracing a mutual respect for self-reliance and independence as we collectively strive for sustainable growth, development, and improved earnings. We believe that cooperating with group companies and maximizing synergies...will yield benefits to minority shareholder interests." In the discussion of the practices related to publicly traded subsidiaries, I think we should also address how to preserve unique identities while pursuing growth.
Today, four women serve as officers in AEON MALL. I was the first and only female officer for some time. We have certainly made progress in raising the number of female officers, but I still think there’s room for more. Our Vision for 2025 defines a goal to bring our overseas business up to the same scale as our directly managed mall business
in Japan. To achieve this goal, we have to consider adding more diversity to our board of directors, which means
 2019 AEON MALL INTEGRATED REPORT 40
     
     Value Creation Management
           Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
including non-Japanese members.
Kawabata I think creating the Nomination and Compensation Committee is one of the best things we have done for governance. Fiscal 2018 marked the second year we have conducted a survey of board effectiveness. Setting up a Nomination and Compensation Committee was the top priority discussed in the Corporate Governance Code.
Together with Ms. Taira, I also participate in the Management Council. In addition to the discussions there, we observe operations in Japan and overseas, as well
as attend the Policy Meeting. These activities provide wonderful opportunities to meet with many outstanding members of our group. Seeing these energetic leaders gives me great hope about the individuals who will carry AEON MALL forward. The Nomination and Compensation Committee provides more clarity about fostering successors and training board members, and I am more committed than ever to fulfilling my role as an outside director.
We mentioned the composition of the board of
directors. I think the ideal situation will be when we no longer send Japanese to manage overseas operations,
but rather foster talented local leaders who go on to become presidents and board members of our overseas entities. I have high expectations that the Nomination and Compensation Committee will function to make this happen.
Watanabe As a full-time outside member of the Audit
and Supervisory Board, I attend meetings of the CSR Committee, the Risk Management Committee, and the Compliance Committee. The CSR Committee is chaired
by President Yoshida. This committee was launched to promote ESG-based management and to discuss matters related to environmental preservation, social contribution, and internal audits. I feel that we should continue this monthly meeting for our managers to gather and talk about CSR and ESG in our business.
Last, I want to invite any comments about improving the effectiveness of the board of directors or any points to emphasize for future improvement.
Measures for Improving Board of Director Effectiveness
Taira When I had discussions with the coordinating office personnel, we talked about how well AEON MALL puts plans into action due to our background as a developer with deep roots in the retail industry. I think AEON MALL is skilled at responding flexibly to change. I would like us to continue analyzing what is required of our company and of our board of directors, responding to change head-on and without fear.
Kawabata What is important for the board of directors is to narrow the focus of our agenda and encourage more frank discussions. Mr. Muramatsu talked about the cost of capital earlier. AEON MALL invests in 20- and 30-billion yen projects on a frequent basis. I believe we should have in-depth discussions about investment returns from the
stance of capital efficiency.
Take overseas development projects, for example.
We should not only discuss profit plans and investment returns, but also financing mechanisms, financial plans for local entities as a whole, changes in the environment, risks, and other matters. To date, we have secured financing from Japan. But, I believe we should look out over a longer span of time and engage in deeper discussions about how to finance our projects. After all, once we build a mall, we need to operate it effectively for 30 or 40 years.
Looking ahead to the year 2025, and even beyond, our overseas operations are going to grow and become an even larger part of our overall business. As this happens,
I am sure we will have to reconsider our control structure, including the makeup and operating rules of the board of

            Value Creation Story Value Creation Strategies Value Creation Management Value Creation Results
         directors. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry
is drawing up a policy for stronger corporate control over publicly listed subsidiaries. Apparently, the ministry is discussing a rule requiring one-third—or even a majority— of board directors to be outside members with no ties to the parent company. I think we at AEON MALL are already at a crossroads where we should consider the makeup and role of our board.
Ichige We need to move away from traditional business schemes, raising the value of our malls through digital technologies. To accomplish this will require decisive investment at some point. We cannot make this transition without committing people and capital. Historically, we have invested mainly in real estate, but I believe future discussions will have to include changes to our business model.
On March 1, 2019, President Yoshida was called
to serve concurrently as an executive vice president for AEON Co., Ltd. Directors and members of the Audit
and Supervisory Board must be even more aware of the views of AEON MALL shareholders in fulfilling our duties of external accountability. Some situations may seem a conflict of interest at first. However, I believe we can forge paths leading everyone in the same direction if we change our vector and make sufficient adjustments to reflect the opinions of those outside our organization. I want AEON MALL to take the lead in introducing best practices for the governance of publicly traded subsidiaries. I expect our efforts will be appreciated by our investors as well.
Muramatsu Of course, we must be aware of the cost of capital in the future. At the same time, we should do more research into ways of incorporating the cost of capital into our day-to-day management decisions. In Japan, we need to increase added value through our P/L as it relates to the cost of capital. To do this, our front lines must become more familiar with management accounting principles. We shoulder a heavier responsibility as our overseas business becomes a larger part of the company. We become more responsible for employees and tenants. Supply chain procurement risks become more complicated. We must exercise greater care to prevent human rights violations and the related negative impact.
Watanabe I have only been a full-time member of the Audit and Supervisory board for a little less than a year. But, during my time, I have come to feel that AEON MALL is a completely different company than the other members of the AEON Group. I mean this in a good way. Even if we all subscribe to the same basic principles, our management structure is different. We have grown through mergers, meaning our employees have developed different identities while also creating new synergies.
We must understand this about our company each year as we audit the process that takes us closer to our Vision
for 2025. I hope to work closely with our outside directors
to monitor AEON MALL through a corporate PDCA cycle that ensures effectiveness among our board in executing our medium-term management plan. In this way, I am convinced we will inspire greater confidence among our stakeholders.

In this way, we contribute to better lifestyles and community growth in terms of economy and culture. We recognize the importance of corporate governance in accomplishing this vision and we work continually improve our corporate governance structure.
Adopting the Corporate Governance Code

We review individual cross-shareholdings on an annual basis, considering the purpose for holding shares, whether share dividend income exceeds the cost of capital, risks involved in holding shares, and transactions with the issuing party. These factors are part of determining the overall benefits

           Corporate Governance
  Related-Party Transactions
AEON MALL has established a system to ensure transactions with officers or major shareholders (related-party transactions) do not infringe on the interests of the company or our shareholders.
We carefully investigate in board of director deliberations whether competitive transactions by directors and transactions involving conflicts of interest with directors and AEON MALL infringe on the interests of AEON MALL or our shareholders. Our investigations include consulting with experts regarding the reasonable nature of the transactions in question. We ensure fairness in this process through a number of means, including recusing directors having special interests in transactions with AEON MALL from voting in the resolution.
When we enter into transactions with related parties,
Compliance Promotion System
We emphasize compliance and respect for the AEON Code of Conduct, fostering improving relations with local communities and meeting our social responsibilities.
AEON MALL has established a Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the general manager of Administration Division. The role of this committee is to ensure group compliance with laws, regulations, our corporate charter, and internal rules. The committee is also responsible for identifying problems and advancing discussions to resolve said problems. Committee proceedings are reported to the Management Council, and matters of note are elevated to the board of directors.
Initiatives to Prevent Corruption
All executives and employees agree that the group will not pursue profit through bribery or other fraudulent means under any circumstances.
Although group officers and employees abide by internal rules and regulations established by AEON MALL and each group company, each individual in our group promises to consider, judge, and take action in line with social justice when asked to comply with a demand by public officials or others.
Group executives and employees must not damage our corporate culture by furnishing benefits, paying expenses, making donations, or providing aid for improper purposes. Executives and employees must also refrain from improper behavior that could impede the healthy advancement of any particular country or region. Finally, executives and employees
we clarify the identity of such parties in our Related Party List according to the provisions of our Rules for Managing Related- Party Transactions. We ensure objectivity in transaction terms through rules that include providing comparison tables in period-end financial reports that show examples of transactions with non-related parties. According to the importance and nature of the transaction in question, we comply with our Authority Rules in soliciting opinions from outside directors and members of the Audit and Supervisory Board during board of director meetings regarding the rationality (business purpose) and reasonable nature of the transaction terms. On an annual basis, we investigate the rationality and reasonableness
of transactions, issuing a report on the annual increase or decrease in transactions with related-party companies.
In addition, we have introduced the Helpline AEON MALL HR 110 Hotline (our labor union has launched a separate Union 110 Hotline). We will install similar helpline systems at our subsidiaries in the future. We ensure that users of this helpline are not subject to reprisal. In the event a report is filed via this hotline, we carefully investigate the details reported. Where unacceptable behavior is proven, we take disciplinary action according to internal rules. We (or the department in question) also draft measures to prevent recurrence, shared for company-wide implementation. The Compliance Committee also receives a report of the measures.
recognize that any such behavior will have an adverse effect the group's approach to compliance.
Group officers and employees affirm their strong commitment and dedication to high ideals, approaching anti- corruption in a serious and sincere manner.
Toward the implementation of these principles, AEON MALL has established the Basic Rules for the Prevention of Bribery. Officers and employees of the group comply with and follow these rules as a code of conduct.
To instill and enshrine corporate ethics in our company, we provide training to directors and employees at every level of our organization. We also incorporate corporate ethics into the behavior evaluation sections of our goal management system.

     Value Creation Management
           Stronger Global Governance for Long-Term Value Creation
AEON MALL continues to enhance corporate global governance to steadily capture growth opportunities in Asia as we pursue our management vision to become a company that touches the hearts of the 5 billion people throughout Asia.
   Special Feature
 The Role of Asia in the AEON MALL Business Strategy
The AEON MALL Group has identified expansion in the markets of Asia as a growth driver for sustainable growth over the medium and long term.
We have been active in opening new locations in China and ASEAN in particular, where the middle-class segment continues to spread. To date, we have opened 27 malls in this region of the world. Through malls that meet active consumer demand and as a partner supporting community building and development, we work with local governments and businesses in the pursuit of value, serving as a flag-bearer for regional

activation and raising our profile in the communities we serve. In FY2018, we generated further branding advantages
through area-dominant store openings, while our Overseas business achieved net positive operating income.
Our Overseas business is poised to enter a new stage of profit expansion as a growth driver for the company, in response to new store openings, renovations for new tenants in existing malls, and initiatives to improve our level of operations.

• Areas with growing motorization
Overseas Business Investment Strategies
Two major factors that contribute to our success in Asia are the high regard for Japanese-style malls and the impact of area branding through our strategy to dominate selected regions. We are beginning to see the results of our efforts. These successes reflect our securing expansive land for facilities, building enormous parking lots, and creating the largest malls in selected areas that offer more than 200 stores in one location. At the same time, we have been rewarded for
• Implement measures to increase operating revenues • Promote local management
• Areas of community-building in suburbs • Areas lacking competing retail facilities

taking risks in making up-front investments for malls in high- growth markets.
At present, we operate mainly through master lease arrangements in China, which requires limited initial investment. In ASEAN, we have a growing number of self-managed malls. However, we intend to use external capital and vary our mall formats to reduce the burden of investments required.

   Encouraging Localized Management
AEON MALL employs a number of local attorneys to reduce risk related to laws and government administrations overseas.
Further, our basic policy is to engage in management tied to local communities by hiring local staff overseas who have a deep understanding of the AEON MALL philosophy. We promote individuals who generate results to management positions, regardless of nationality. In China today, locally hired individuals serve as general managers at seven malls. As well, we are making progress in ASEAN to promote local staff to senior management positions. Moving forward, we will take further steps toward local management, including selecting
Building a Stronger Global Management Structure
The AEON MALL Group strives toward stronger global governance in our business. In China during FY2018, we adopted a system of internal controls on par with our system in Japan and established a Risk Management Committee and a Compliance Department. The Management Auditing Department in China works with our Japanese Management Auditing Department to strengthen this internal control system. In FY2018, we began conducting risk evaluations in ASEAN through a Risk Management Committee. During FY2019, we
locally hired individuals to serve as presidents of local entities responsible for area management.

Bridging Current and Future Lifestyles for Local Communities
Hisayuki Sato
Managing Director, General Manager of China Division
Chinese Business as the Leading Driver of Growth
Our first-ever mall in China was the 2008 opening of AEON MALL Beijing International Mall. Since that time, we have pursued a strategy of area-dominant store openings for community building, expanding to our present operations in the four regions of Beijing/Tianjin/Shandong, Jiangsu/ Zhejiang, Hubei, and Guangdong. To thrive in a new region with a different culture, language, and environment requires an attitude of acceptance and willingness to learn. Establishing friendly relationships with local authorities is also very important. Over the past several years in China, we have raised the value of the AEON MALL brand, winning greater recognition among customers and tenants. I feel we have made progress in establishing systems to achieve our Vision for 2025 (long-term vision).
Anticipating the Expectations of Chinese Society Through ESG
One of our greatest strengths in China is our support of motorization via large-scale parking facilities. The size of a parking lot has a significant influence on customer traffic in the Chinese suburbs, where we see greater progress in community building. In addition, we conduct market research into future trends and incorporate the customer traffic generation expertise developed in Japan to create malls that anticipate constantly changing customer needs. Our efforts here have led directly to increased tenant revenues. In particular, the Chinese shift in consumer behavior from goods toward services has been even faster than in Japan. We are responding by combining our knowledge and experience from Japan with merchandising tailored to local markets. As an example, we are bolstering our entertainment functions, including expanded dining and food sales zones, the most feature-rich kids zones in the area, and sports zones. Further, large-scale spaces bigger than those in Japan allow us to offer amusement facilities and other features unique to brick-and-mortar malls in a market where e-commerce is even more popular than Japan.
In this increasingly strict time of environmental regulations, we are setting environmental standards even higher than Japan for our mall development activities. In addition to our response to environmental regulations, we

established stronger risk management and compliance systems during FY2018. We also launched localized education activities in cooperation with AEON Group headquarters to encourage a greater acceptance of our corporate philosophy. Another new program we introduced for employees was a promotion test system to encourage staff training. As we pursue fair and highly transparent hiring and promotion systems, we also offer incentives for staff reassignments, making it easier for personnel to move to different areas. These and other new systems designed to shore up our organization have led to increased retention of talented local employees. As result of our efforts to date, seven of our 19 malls across China are headed by locally hired general managers.
Governance will play an even bigger role in ensuring policies that support future growth. For example, the viewpoints of local staff are invaluable in conducting risk assessment. This is one other reason why we must transition to more localized management.
The Advantages of Japan Quality in Building Deeper Community Infrastructure
Our customers in China sincerely appreciate Japanese quality in terms of cleanliness, service, safety, confidence, and high-quality goods and services. I believe this is a persistent competitive advantage we have in China. We must understand that the presence of an AEON MALL itself is part of a community’s infrastructure and that we are a leader in community building. I am convinced that this mindset ties directly to creating malls that contribute to improved lifestyle quality for local citizens. And in return, we receive the support of our local customers. We will continue to introduce measures leading to greater advancements in Japanese quality in the future.
Despite concerns of slowing economic growth, one must remember that even at a slower growth rate, the GDP of Guangdong is equal to that of Canada. Compared to most of the rest of the world, the Chinese market is orders of magnitude larger. We intend to seize on the opportunities presented by accelerating urbanization in China, positioning our business as a principal driver of AEON MALL growth in the future.

Japanese-Style Malls Contribute to the Development of Three ASEAN Countries
Mitsugu Tamai
Managing Director, General Manager of ASEAN Division
Opening Malls in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia
Our ASEAN business began in 2014 with the openings of our first and second malls in Vietnam and one mall in Cambodia. Our Japanese-style mall caused quite a stir in Cambodia, where first-year customer traffic outpaced the entire 15-million-person population of the country. Local media have come to use the term “pre-AEON/post-AEON,” reflecting the impact we have had on the country. We opened our first mall in Indonesia in 2015, selecting the suburbs of Jakarta for our location. AEON has enjoyed high name recognition, differentiating ourselves from other facilities by creating attractive malls that highlight our strengths as a developer with a background in retail.
At present, we have eight malls across three countries in ASEAN. We aim to grow in ASEAN by offering not only goods and services, but also vital social infrastructure functions.
Localized Business Models and Governance
Each country in ASEAN has its own language, culture, political system, economic situation, and market environment. Accordingly, needs vary country to country. In Vietnam, where the history of national development mirrors that of Japan, we have incorporated our Japanese- style expertise without reservation. In Cambodia, we have chosen to focus on metropolitan areas, rather than our Japanese strategy of expansion in the suburbs. Here, we are growing in popularity among the wealthy class by offering products in Phnom Penh that were only available in Thailand or Singapore in the past. Zones housing on-site passport centers, driver license renewal offices, financial institutions, and other public functions are being used by customers as an alternative to government offices. As in the pre-AEON/post-AEON turn of phrase I just mentioned, AEON MALLs in Cambodia are viewed as national projects, receiving the strong support of local governments.
We are shifting toward greater delegation of authority to local management, while at the same time building a governance structure sensitive to the unique risks among ASEAN countries. Our governance structure includes adopting the minimum required in internal controls at our ASEAN head office.
Adopting Japanese Best Practices in ASEAN
We expect ASEAN economic growth to continue for the time being. In particular, the region is still developing in terms of retail and shopping malls. Here, we are adopting the business model we developed in Japan to grow together with our tenants in win-win relationships. This is a strength we have as a developer with roots in retail that doesn’t exist among other property developers.
One program we sponsor together with tenants is our customer service role-playing contests. Staff from tenant stores representing a wide range of goods and services bring their customer-service skills to the competition. The shared experiences and expertise help raise the level of all stores within the mall. Prior to AEON MALL, Cambodia had no real concept of customer service. Accordingly, we introduced customer-service contests in 2016 to encourage a better understanding and practice of customer service among local employees. As result, customer service is now becoming a more integrated part of the social norm. We rolled this contest out in Vietnam and Indonesia in 2018.
In addition to these soft skills, we also introduced best practices from Japan in terms of hard skills. One example is our clean, easy-to-use bathrooms and powder rooms. The average age in ASEAN is comparatively young, and these countries have many families with small children that make frequent use of public bathrooms and powder rooms. Through social media and other word of mouth, AEON MALLs have become known widely for having clean, accessible bathrooms and powder rooms. As more local customers become familiar with and appreciative of Japanese-style malls, our intermediate goal is to grow our mall business into an integral part of local society.

           Reports by Business Segment (Japan)
AEON MALL continues to renovate and open new malls in Japan, tailored purposefully to the character of each local community.
 Overview of FY2018
We are increasing the number of malls that are dominant in their respective regions of Japan. This high level of customer support creates a stronger competitive advantage throughout the Japanese shopping mall market.
Our medium-term management plan (FY2017–FY2019) calls for expanding floor space at eight malls, renovating 32 malls, and opening 10 new malls. In FY2017, we expanded two malls, renovated 12 malls, and opened five new malls. In FY2018, we expanded two malls, renovated six malls, and opened four new malls.
In March 2018, we reopened the AEON MALL Miyazaki (Miyazaki Pref.) after an expansion and remodel. The mall features a new wing built on the south side of the mall, which had formerly been a parking lot. A total of 63 specialty stores opened in the new wing. Major renovations to the existing wing of the mall covered a total of 92 stores. As a result, the mall now has a total rentable area of 84,000m2 (an increase of 14,000m2) and room for 250 tenants (increase of 70 stores) total.
AEON MALL Kumamoto (Kumamoto Pref.) reopened in stages following the Kumamoto earthquakes of April 2016. The earthquake-damaged anchor tenant zone on the west side of the mall was enlarged significantly and opened as an expanded wing in July 2018. As a result, the mall now has a total rentable area of 84,000m2 (an increase of 11,000m2), with space for 200 tenants (an increase of 45 stores). To prevent damage from disasters like large-scale earthquakes, we reassessed the materials and construction methods for facilities within the mall to improve safety and strengthen earthquake resistance in our buildings.
Expanded floor space at each of the two malls mentioned above has secured an overwhelmingly strong position as
the dominant mall in their respective regions, building upon already sizable market shares. Our tenants enjoyed solid sales performance in the 22 existing malls where we expanded
floor space or conducted renovations in FY2017 and FY2018. Specialty store sales grew a strong 8.0% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
We opened four new malls in FY2018: AEON MALL Zama (Kanagawa Pref.) in March, THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA (Hiroshima Pref.) in April, AEON MALL Iwaki Onahama (Fukushima Pref.) in June, and AEON MALL Tsu-Minami (Mie Pref.) in November.
For AEON MALL Zama, we used part of the grounds
of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.’s Zama Operation Center, which allowed us to reduce the mall’s impact on the environment. Solar panels on the building roof and walls generate up to
one megawatt of electricity, enough to power 300 ordinary households for a year. Using LED lights throughout the mall has reduced the use of electricity by 40% compared to lighting in a conventional mall.
THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA will draw customers from
a wide area as it targets not only customers in Hiroshima Prefecture, but also tourists from other parts of Japan and overseas. Features include an amusement facility developed in collaboration with a local professional baseball team and a zone offering a variety of regional foods and specialties. These features and others combine to provide visitors an opportunity to experience the local flavor of Hiroshima.
One major feature of AEON MALL Iwaki Onahama is its function as a disaster-ready mall. In the event of an earthquake or other disaster, the mall’s inside walkways, halls, and rooftop can be opened to house evacuees temporarily, even after business hours. The most important sections of the facility are built above the level of the highest anticipated waves in the case of tsunami flooding. In addition to disaster-preparedness, the mall sponsors localization initiatives in partnership with
a nearby aquarium and other tourist facilities, with local businesses, and with educational institutions. These events
are effective in promoting the attractiveness of the surrounding community.
AEON MALL Tsu-Minami was rebuilt on the site of the former AEON Tsu-Minami Shopping Center SUNVALLEY,
which first opened in 1978. The mall was closed in 2016 for the expansion project and grand reopening. The mall’s event space offers the latest in digital content, with a large 270-inch LED display. Nearly 60 digital signs are located throughout the building, providing visitors with the latest in digital content.

           Reports by Business Segment (Overseas)
The AEON MALL overseas business reported net profits for the year, leveraging brand power and area-dominant store openings in China and ASEAN.
 Overview of FY2018
Our overseas business has become a growth driver, poised for future profit growth in response to new store openings, renovations timed to tenant changes in existing malls, planned expansions, and initiatives to improve our level of operations.
Although economic growth has slowed in China, we continue working to keep our malls feeling updated. We are taking advantage of the managing and operating expertise developed in Japan to bolster customer drawing power through sales promotions and events designed to encourage purchases. At the same time, we ensure that our Chinese malls are as clean, safe, and comfortable as those in Japan. Further, we have timed mall renovations to extensive, strategic turnover in mall tenants. Thanks to these efforts, specialty store sales at our 17 existing malls have grown in the double digits.
Our current medium-term management plan (FY2017– FY2019) calls for opening eight new malls in China. We opened four malls in FY2017. In FY2018, we opened two more malls: AEON MALL Yantai Jinshatan in May (Yantai City, Shandong), our first mall in Shandong Province, and AEON MALL Guangzhou Jinsha in November (Guangzhou City, Guangdong), our third mall in Guangdong Province and second in Guangzhou City.
The ASEAN nations are expected to experience a

growing middle-income class and a rising population of new families. We are anticipating future market needs in the region, offering not only physical merchandise, but also the latest
in amusement facilities, services, and regional infrastructure functions.
Our current medium-term management plan calls for opening four new malls in ASEAN. We opened one mall in Indonesia in FY2017. In May of FY2018, we opened AEON MALL Sen Sok City (Phnom Penh City), our second mall in Cambodia.
In Vietnam, we began construction on AEON MALL Ha Dong in Hanoi City (fifth mall in Vietnam; scheduled to open in FY2019) and AEON MALL Hai Phong Le Chan in Hai Phong City (sixth mall in Vietnam; scheduled to open in FY2020). In addition, AEON MALL Tan Phu Celadon (Ho Chi Minh City), our very first mall in Vietnam, is scheduled to reopen in the first half of FY2019 after an expansion and renovation. The mall will offer a total 70,000m2 of total rentable area (an increase
of 35,000m2), with room for 210 tenants (increase of 90 stores).
In Indonesia, we are currently constructing AEON MALL Sentul City (West Java), which is scheduled to open in FY2019. This will be our third mall in Indonesia. We have now secured tenants for AEON MALL Tanjung Barat (southern Jakarta district; scheduled for an FY2020 opening), our fourth mall in Indonesia.

AEON MALL has identified Five Materialities in the context of business strategy for achieving
our long-term vision P.29
Developing Community and Social Infrastructure
     Safe, secure, and pleasant facilities
In 2005, AEON introduced universal design in the development of malls in Japan to ensure all customers enjoy safe and pleasant shopping experiences. Subsequently, we have conducted regular customer surveys soliciting customer
opinions, making ongoing improvements in both tangible and intangible aspects of mall design.
Overseas, we were among the first to develop malls with large parking facilities in response to rising motorization.
AEON MALL Zama (Kanagawa Prefecture)
In 2018, AEON MALL Zama received the Barrier-Free Town Planning Award from Kanagawa Prefecture. This award recognized the mall for innovative design accommodating all shoppers, including guests with disabilities and seniors.
         Malls that reflect the unique character of a community
AEON designs malls to reflect the particular community to be served and local market characteristics. To the greatest extent possible, we create design concepts that incorporate what makes an area unique and attractive. We will continue to produce uniquely appealing facilities by embodying these concepts in exterior and interior designs, leasing, and daily events.
We also create concept zones in each of our malls
that encourage visitors to rediscover the attraction of their community’s culture, industry, tourism resources, and more. By reflecting the unique features of the region in the design of each facility, AEON MALL instills a sense of community pride that results in residents taking personal ownership of the mall.
THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA (Hiroshima Prefecture)
The first "THE OUTLETS" concept mall is a regional innovative commercial facility completely different from conventional malls. The facility features an outlet zone with nearly 120
brand shops, along with entertainment facilities that include Wonder Rink, the only year-round ice-skating rink in Hiroshima Prefecture. With the support of local community and Hiroshima City, this mall offers shops and information resources that communicate the attractions of the surrounding region.

         The Environment
Responding to climate change and global warming
      In March 2018, the AEON Group announced AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050. The goal of this initiative is to achieve a decarbonized society by the year 2050 by promoting energy conservation, the use of renewable energy, and other measures.
To date, 11 facilities in the AEON Group, 10 of which are operated by AEON MALL, have become environmentally friendly model facilities. We are currently developing the Next-Generation Smart AEON program, a further evolution in our decarbonization. As an example, AEON MALL Zama
(Kanagawa Prefecture) has achieved a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions compared to standard AEON stores.
In FY2018, AEON MALL was awarded a score of B by
the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)*1 in recognition of the
our response to climate change and our disclosure of carbon emissions data. This score places AEON MALL at the third position in an eight-level scale, the highest we have ever achieved.
*1 The Carbon Disclosure Project is an international NGO that promotes climate change disclosures on behalf of over 800 institutional investors representing holdings of $100 trillion. The CDP conducts annual surveys of companies around the world. In FY2018, over 6,800 companies responded to the survey.
    AEON MALL Sen Sok City (Cambodia)
This mall features a nearly 1MW solar power system and high-efficiency chillers, targeting a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 1,564 tons per year. The AEON MALL Sen Sok City solar power system and high-efficiency chillers qualified the mall for selection as a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) assistance project*2 for FY2016 by the Japan Ministry of the Environment.
*2 The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is a program organized by the Japanese government. This program contributes to the global spread of advanced Japanese low-carbon technologies and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and encourage sustainable development among emerging economies. These efforts are assessed according to the quantitative volume of emissions reductions, helping Japan accomplish its greenhouse gas reduction targets.
    AEON Hometown Forest Project (biodiversity)
The AEON Hometown Forest Project is a forestry initiative that embodies the AEON Group’s basic philosophy. The project has been ongoing since 1991. AEON works with customers to plant trees on land considered most appropriate for the local natural environment. As of February 28, 2019, the AEON

To foster a recycling oriented society, AEON MALL launched a zero emissions program to recycle all waste generated by our malls.
AEON MALL Okayama (Okayama Prefecture)
AEON MALL Okayama operates a program in which waste
is collected from each tenant, weighed with measuring instruments, correctly sorted, and recycled under the guidance of a specialist. This initiative was honored by receiving the Okayama City Waste Reduction and Resource Development for Business Award.

Globalization of Human Resources
Our basic policy for overseas human resources is to hire
local staff who have a deep understanding of AEON MALL principles and who can engage in business rooted deeply in the local community. We promote people who produce results to senior management positions without regard to national origin. In China, seven AEON MALL facilities are overseen by general managers who were hired locally. In ASEAN as well, we are active in promoting local staff to senior positions.
Meanwhile, we create opportunities for our Japanese employees to gain experience overseas. We believe that the experience of working with local staff gives Japanese employees the chance to grow and develop in their own careers.

Aiming to increase the ratio of female managers in our company, AEON MALL is building systems that allow employees to balance work with family and child care responsibilities. We are also generating a visual representation of work hours to reduce overtime work. Further, we are developing indicators designed to enhance work efficiency, making AEON MALL a company at which women can enjoy long-term careers. AEON MALL has been recognized as a Nadeshiko Brand for three consecutive years. This status recognizes publicly traded companies that actively encourage female participation.
Japanese Employees Working Overseas With Local Staff Members
Iku Navi is an internal guidebook for employees who wish to return to work while maintaining a healthy balance between child-rearing and work.
            Improving Employee Satisfaction for Tenant Employees
Labor shortages have become a social issue in Japan. As developers, we believe we have a responsibility to create workplace environments that support the long-term careers of tenant employees. We also believe sponsoring initiatives for
employee satisfaction is part of our responsibilities.
With these goals in mind, we present awards for best
practices at our malls, recognizing efforts in employee break room renovations and employee-only menu options, for example. We catalog these best practices and roll them out throughout the rest of our organization.
AEON MALL Fukutsu (Fukuoka Prefecture)
In response to interviews with employees, AEON MALL Fukutsu is enhancing employee privacy by increasing the number of private carrels, providing more electrical outlets to recharge electronic devices, and improving the quality of powder rooms. Employees appreciate these improvements, with 88 percent reporting that facilities are easier to use than before.

Human Rights Policies, Systems, and Training
The unwavering principle of AEON is pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always from the customer's point of view. To honor these principles we will comply with all relevant laws and regulations, while dealing with all people honestly and sincerely through proper behavior. The AEON Code of Conduct was enacted
in April 2003 on the basis of these values. In September
2014, AEON codified a philosophy of human rights and the workplace producing AEON's Basic Human Rights Policies in support of the AEON Code of Conduct.
AEON MALL follows this philosophy and these policies
in respect for human rights. The company aspires to create an organization that allows all people, regardless of their gender or nationality, to participate in the development of the company. We strive to create workplaces that enable all employees to perform to the highest level of their abilities.
All employees of the company attend an annual human rights training. Moreover, all employees are provided with a handbook that lists both internal and external help desks. This handbook provides clear information about respect for human rights, the prevention of discrimination, and other matters in the context of the AEON MALL employment rules.
    AEON Code of Conduct–Our Commitment
1. AEON people are always grateful to the many other individuals who provide support and help, never forgetting to act with humility. 2. AEON people value the trust of others more than anything else, always acting with integrity and sincerity in all situations. 3. AEON people actively seek out ways to exceed customer expectations.
4. AEON people continually challenge themselves to find new ways to accomplish the AEON ideals.

 AEON Human Rights Policy
In accordance with this policy, all of AEON’s executives and employees (AEON People) will further their understanding of human rights and help realize a society that respects these rights.
We will adopt this policy for all AEON People and share it with all business partners.

Further, we will support and follow the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
2. Respect for Human Rights in Business Activities
We will respect the privacy of individuals as well as their diverse values and personalities and never discriminate against anyone for any reasons, including discriminatory treatment based on race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, place of birth, religion, educational background, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Further, we will remain mindful of the positions of others and respect them as our equals.

  Total assets stood at ¥1,203,211 million, up ¥79,430 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result is partly explained by the openings of new malls and advance acquisitions of land for future development, including acquisitions of property, plant and equipment in the amount of ¥157,521 million. This increase was partly offset by depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the amount of ¥42,640 million and sales of property, plant and equipment of ¥31,680 million.
Total liabilities stood at ¥809,151 million, up ¥70,932 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated
fiscal year. This increase was mainly due to an increase
of ¥80,000 million in bonds (including the current portion
of bonds), a ¥26,225 million increase in long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt), an increase
of ¥4,076 million in lease deposits from lessees, and an increase of ¥3,317 million in deposits received from specialty stores. These amounts were partly offset by a ¥5,000
million net decrease in commercial paper, a ¥38,929 million decrease in accounts payable-other on facilities (new mall openings, etc.), and a ¥798 million decrease in income taxes payable.
Net assets totaled ¥394,059 million, up ¥8,498 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result was mainly due to an increase in retained earnings as a result of ¥33,538 million in net income attributable to owners of parent, partly offset by dividend payments of ¥8,642 million and a decrease of ¥14,974 million in foreign currency translation adjustments.

     Financial Information/Company Overview
           Financial Performance
 Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents (“cash”) as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥55,414 million, an increase of ¥1,191 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. Cash flows in the period under review were as follows.
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted
to ¥90,600 million, compared to ¥80,616 million for the prior year. This result was mainly due to income before income taxes and other adjustments of ¥47,683 million (compared to ¥45,061 million in the prior year), depreciation and amortization of ¥42,640 million (compared to ¥38,443 million), and an increase in deposits received from specialty stores of ¥3,597 million (compared to ¥3,045 million). At the same time, income taxes paid amounted to ¥17,194 million (compared to ¥15,956 million).
Net cash used in investing activities resulted amounted to ¥176,189 million (compared to ¥142,009 million for the prior year). This result was mainly due to payments for facilities at malls opened during the prior fiscal year (AEON MALL Tokushima in Tokushima Pref., AEON MALL Matsumoto
in Nagano Pref.) and malls opened during the current fiscal year (AEON MALL Zama in Kanagawa Pref., THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA in Hiroshima Pref., AEON MALL Iwaki Onahama in Fukushima Pref., and AEON MALL Tsu-Minami in Mie
Outlook for FY2019
Our Domestic Business plans to open one new mall. We will continue activity in mall expansions and renovations, with four existing malls slated for floor space expansion and 10 for renovation.
The government of Japan is planning to raise the consumption tax in October 2019. In response, we will work to secure sales with measures designed to motivate consumers to make purchases. We will also make greater use of digital technologies, partly to answer the government’s push for cashless payments. Further, AEON MALL plans to take advantage of demand associated with inbound tourism growth in Japan.
At the same time, we will promote our Happiness Mall program and greater localization through bargain sales and events capitalizing on local characteristics. This is one way in which we will create a stronger drawing power in our malls and
Pref.), as well as cash outlays for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment from such expenses as acquiring land for development, coming to ¥207,522 million (compared
to ¥186,525 million in the prior year). These outlays were somewhat offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment in the amount of ¥36,287 million (compared to ¥40,293 million in the prior year) and proceeds from lease deposits from lessees in the amount of ¥14,914 million (compared to ¥13,975 million in the prior year).
Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ¥91,199 million (compared to ¥44,841 million in the prior year). This result was mainly due to proceeds from issuance of bonds in the amount of ¥80,000 million (compared to ¥50,000 million in the prior year) and proceeds from long- term debt of ¥61,159 million (compared to ¥48,290 million in the prior year). This was partly offset by cash outlays for repayment of long-term debt of ¥35,759 million (compared to ¥52,563 million in the prior year), cash outlays for repayments of short-term debt and commercial paper of ¥5,000 million (compared to ¥11,000 million in proceeds from debt during the prior year), and dividends paid in the amount of ¥8,642 million (compared to ¥6,708 million in the prior year).
drive greater sales growth. The company will build earnings through improved operating efficiencies that take advantage of the economies of scale of our more than 150 malls in Japan. We also plan to implement measures for low-cost operations, including reduction of electricity consumption with the introduction of energy-saving equipment.
In our Overseas Business, we plan to open two new malls in China, one in Vietnam, and one in Indonesia. We are entering the stage where our overseas business is becoming a growth driver that will expand profits. In addition to new mall openings, we will step up the pace of renovations timed to tenant turnover in existing malls, planned expansions, and initiatives to improve our level of operations.
Given the preceding, our FY2019 earnings forecast calls for operating revenue of ¥326,000 million, operating income of ¥62,000 million, and net income attributable to owners of

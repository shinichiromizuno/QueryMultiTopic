The AEON MALL Group is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living. Under this management philosophy, we aim to be a company that touches the hearts of the 5 billion people throughout Asia. Accordingly, in FY2018, we began publishing an integrated report for our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders to encourage a better understanding of our initiatives toward corporate value creation over the medium and long term.
In editing this integrated report, we have provided information we deemed important from the standpoint of medium- and long-term corporate value creation. Our efforts referenced the International Integrated Reporting Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Among other topics, this integrated report addresses our strengths developed as a retail-based mall business, our value creation process and future strategies, business activities forming the foundation of value creation, and ESG initiatives. Further, we provide information related to those ESG initiatives that have a significant impact on corporate value creation based on considerations of materiality. Please see our ESG Report, sustainability webpage, and IR webpage for more information related to ESG.

Value Creation Story
 Our History of Value Creation
AEON MALL continues to evolve in response to changing lifestyles.
As ever, we remain committed to growing and developing, both in Japan and overseas.
 1992–
The rise of motorization
2000–
Ongoing need to revitalize communities
A community-based space offering a wide range of lifestyle services
As we expand to residential and business districts throughout Japan, AEON MALL has extended beyond the framework of commercial facilities. We have evolved into infrastructure for local communities, offering entertainment, public administrative and community functions, and disaster relief support. We played a role in reactivating communities by responding to calls for opening AEON MALL shopping centers.
Three Laws Related to Town Development
Deregulation resulted in examining large-scale stores according to social vectors, including the impact on the economy and living environment. Authority shifted from the national to the local level.
* The Three Laws related to town development are defined as the (1) City Planning Act, which governs zoning (land use regulations), (2) the Large- scale Retail Location Law, which sets up systems to coordinate with local communities, and (3) the City Center Revitalization Act, which supports the revitalization of city centers.
Listing on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Environmental management system ISO 14001 certification
Innovating customer shopping experiences through malls in suburbs across Japan
The first AEON MALL location, AEON MALL Tsugaru Kashiwa (Aomori Pref.), opened in 1992 amid growing domestic motorization. A mall with a large parking lot and diverse tenants offering a wide variety of merchandise in a suburban area proved successful from the aspect of town planning in attracting customers who drove to the store in their own cars. It was the harbinger of an era in which lifestyles shifted from urban areas and train stations to the suburbs.
Large-Scale Retail Stores Law
Audits are required for large store openings for store area, closing time, number of days closed, etc. In 1994, restrictions on store size, application procedures, closing times, and closing days were eased.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
 2011–
A growing community presence in Japan and overseas
Unique malls tailored to the characteristics of each region and country
Shopping centers throughout Japan became more homogenized and subject to even more competition. AEON MALL developed unique malls that focused
on localization, pursuing a strategy of opening in growth areas of Asia seeing
an expansion of the middle class. We
are increasing our presence in local communities both in Japan and overseas.
2017–
A growing middle class in Asia
Becoming the dominant commercial developer in Asia, striving to resolve local issues in Japan and overseas
In China and ASEAN, AEON MALL serves as a partner in urban and regional development. We build malls that respond to strong consumer markets. In Japan, AEON is confronting the challenge of weakened connections within communities. Here, we pursue value by working with local governments as a leader in regional revitalization.
Revised City Planning Act
2020–
Toward Sustainable Societies
Becoming a Life Design Developer Offering Solutions for the Future of Community Living
In a business environment of increasing uncertainty and accelerating change,
we aim to become a business that provides solutions to issues faced by local communities and society, without being bound to the framework of a commercial facility. In so doing, we will establish ourselves as core facilities and social infrastructure in local communities.
 With no sign of ending in the decline of city centers, the development permitting system under the City Planning Act was revised in 2007. Regulations were tightened for the opening of stores having a total floor space of 10,000m2 or more.

Value Creation Story
 The Strengths of AEON MALL
AEON MALL has continued to grow in step with the growth of our communities through shopping mall development, management, and operations.
By building on our six strengths, we intend to establish an even stronger management foundation.
123
   Ability to generate and procure funds for growth
We generate cash flows through managing and operating shopping malls. This allows us to maintain
a consistently sound financial position and leverage borrowing capacity to procure funds. We generate growth funds through the sale of mall land and buildings to real estate investment trusts and the use of development leases. These vehicles allow us access to flexible investments in growth, while accelerating the speed of return
on investment and improving asset efficiency.
AEON MALL Hai Phong Le Chan (Vietnam)
EBITDA: ¥92.9 billion (Overseas: ¥22.0 billion)* *Simplified operating cash flows
Equity ratio: 27.1% Net D/E ratio: 1.5 times
(as of end of Feb, 2021)
Overwhelming scale of operations and ability to attract customers
AEON MALL manages and operates more than 160 malls in Japan, serving nearly 1.2 billion customer visits annually. We leverage the retail-based development expertise we cultivated in Japan through localized operations to expand in China, ASEAN, and other countries overseas.
Diversity of staff driving growth
We strive to create an environment in which a diversity of human resources can maximize their abilities regardless of gender, age, or nationality. Along with giving our Japanese employees the opportunity to obtain business experience overseas, we strive to promote overseas local staff to senior management positions. Our growth is linked directly to this interaction among AEON people.

Value Creation Management
Financial Information/ Company Overview
   Sustainable malls that coexistent with local communities
We use the expertise gained through operating nearly 200 locations worldwide to develop and operate safe, secure, and comfortable malls that meet the needs of a wide spectrum of customers. We focus intently on the unique characteristics and needs of each community. Our Happiness Malls community initiatives and public functions coordinated with local government provide sustainable malls that become the first choice of both customers and tenants.
Robust network
AEON MALL has built a nationwide network in Japan together with
our tenants. Through these close strategic partnerships, we advance initiatives designed to meet local needs. We use a customer service role playing contest to build a stronger awareness of customer service and help staff share the best practices and expertise that transcend any one particular line
of business. These contests lead to higher levels of service quality throughout the AEON MALL organization.

We are working to save energy, reduce CO2 emissions, and decrease waste emissions. We also act as centers of
the community in the areas we serve, conducting environmental communication activities for our customers, educational visits for elementary school students,
and more. At the same time, we foster stronger environmental management through acquiring ISO 14001 certification and other initiatives.

AEON MALL engages in three measures to create
systems that accelerate new mall openings overseas
(1) In creating an organization education system,
we are in particular cultivating human resources capable of working overseas, and have established a human resources program that we call “the Global Human Resources Course”
(2) In fostering partnerships with local communities, we are promoting property development in China and ASEAN where economic policy focuses on the development of social infrastructure
(3) In financing, given that efficient capital procurement is an essential factor in opening more locations, we also plan to open master lease malls, in addition to directly managed malls

Fiscal 2020 Review
COVID-19
and a Year of Challenges
My Second Year in Office
When I began serving as president on March
1, 2020, we were already in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. My first mission was
to ensure a correct response. The spread of COVID-19 in many countries caused enormous changes in our environment. These changes included upheaval in lifestyles and limitations on the scope of activities among all stakeholders, including consumers and communities. Other changes included a return of consumers to rural regions of the country and a decrease
in inbound demand. This was a fiscal year in which we responded to these environmental changes, executing a variety of measures in full consideration of short-, medium-, and long-
term risks. We also learned much about the issues within our businesses. Responding to an extraordinary, unprecedented event, we engaged in much trial and error in terms of changing work styles and even changes in everyday private lives, such as voluntarily limiting time spent outside
of the home, etc. Even in 2021, the spread of COVID-19 continues to one degree or another in every country. These countries are seeing second and third waves with no predictable end to the pandemic. For this reason, we have prepared
and rededicated ourselves to confronting this pandemic throughout fiscal 2021.
Fiscal 2020 Consolidated Income
Looking back on our earnings performance
for fiscal 2020, we understand how the global outbreak of COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on operating revenue. The pandemic caused us to close malls and shorten business hours temporarily in every country where we operate, we missed missed many business opportunities, and customer traffic fell as consumers refrained from travel outside the home. In particular, the spring 2020 declaration of a state of emergency in Japan had a profoundly negative impact, as our tenants closed and we reduced
or exempted rents during the period of closures. As a result, not only did we record lower revenue and income, but net loss attributable to owners
of parent amounted to ¥1,860 million, our first net loss since our initial public offering in 2002.
In offering tenants rent reductions and exemptions, we understood that our business is supported by each of the partners in our store association. We provided these reduction and exemptions knowing that these relationships are extremely important to us. I am convinced that this was the right decision for us to make as a management team from a medium- and long-term perspective. In the future, we must deepen ties with our partners even more to create new value together under the AEON MALL banner.

 Message from the President and CEO
 Long-Term Vision and Medium- Term Management Plan Progress
Becoming a Solutions Company That Addresses Local Community Issues in Earnest
Doing Business Under the New Normal
When discussing our Long-Term Vision and future plans, we must first establish a firm grasp of the important changes in the current environment. We must accept that COVID-19 has become a critical management issue. In the past, natural disasters and other events have forced us to close certain malls on a temporary basis. But in a global crisis of the scope of COVID-19, our malls in Japan and overseas faced closures entailing real threats to business survival. We realized that this was not
a crisis of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, but rather an incident calling for crisis management in response to the spread of a serious infectious disease. We came to understand the need
for business continuity planning in preparation
for emerging crises. In other words, we are a corporate entity that operates large-scale facilities
designed to attract customers. To this end, we must permanently engage in measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some people believe that COVID-19 spurred approaches to the new normal. But the concept of the new normal was already well known back
in 2013, when discussions of Industry 4.0—or
the fourth industrial revolution—began in earnest. We should keep in mind that many companies have been making serious efforts as early as 2014 to shift business structures in advance of the coming era of the new normal. We can think of the changing environment in terms of pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19. But we have already seen major shifts in consumer purchasing behavior, including the rise of e-commerce, a shift from
the consumption of goods to the consumption
of services and experiences, and a rise in health consciousness. Efforts to commercialize solutions to community issues and contributions to regional revitalization were already underway prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lifestyles have changed at unimagined speeds with the adoption of remote

 work and other measures to meet the rising importance of fighting the spread of infection. But we should understand that many of these changes existed already. COVID-19 merely accelerated some of these changes. It is true that COVID-19 caused rapid changes in our environment. Companies which deliver results even under such circumstances are those that have responded
the most quickly to social change. We must recognize the remarkable difference between these companies and those that have been slow to respond.
Vision for 2025
We defined our Long-Term Vision through the fiscal year ending February 2026 (FY2025). Under this vision, we will pursue our management philosophy and achieve further business growth. We will achieve our vision through transparency and accountability regarding large-scale investments and related risks. In this way, we will create social value and economic value, achieving sustainable growth in partnership with our local communities. Our target financial indicators leading to fiscal 2025 will be EPS growth of 7% (annualized growth between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2025), net interest- bearing debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times or less, and return on invested capital of at least 5%.
Redefining the Mall Business
Customer behavior has changed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, we must expand the relationships between the AEON MALL businesses and the lives of our customers. Leveraging our strengths as a real-world location, we intend to establish new business models and create new businesses with our partners, not only acting as a land leasing business, but leveraging the AEON MALL asset value to the greatest extent possible. Our goal is to make AEON MALL a solutions-oriented business, creating central community facilities and securing a position as part of the social infrastructure. To make our
presence an indispensable part of daily life, we must make our malls more functional and provide higher levels of added value for customers and
the community. What is important here is that we act not only as a mall developer and operator, but also as a solutions company that goes beyond the framework of the shopping mall, responding to the issues faced by our communities.
To offer solutions for communities, we
intend to create facilities social infrastructure
that provide public functions as well as social services, including education, medical care, and social welfare. Next, we will establish our malls as multifunction complexes. Rather than acting solely as a conventional property leasing business,
we intend to transform our malls into facilities
with functions across a wide range of business models, business formats, and service functions. Here, we will work with different partners who
can extend the breadth of our services in creating new malls and new businesses. For example,
we will suggest new lifestyles via editorial-model stores that portray concepts and ideas clearly. We will offer comprehensive health services through zoned concepts, combining drug stores, sports gyms, general hospital satellite clinics, and more. We will leverage the ICT environment to create new types of future entertainment, while also updating and upgrading other services. This transition of malls into multifunction platforms will happen not only in Japan, but in all countries in which we operate malls.
Ultimately, we intend to expand our business domains from inside the mall to outside the mall, working with new business partners to build mall lifestyle zones and AEON lifestyle zones as we solve social issues.
We will support national and local government policies through our own business expertise, regardless of the involvement of AEON MALL facility functions. We will work in urban and regional revitalization projects, and engage in public-private partnerships to commercialize

 businesses offering new value to our communities.
Three Initiatives for Achieving Digital Transformation
I have a strong sense of urgency that relying on the traditional business of attracting customers, expanding sales, and raising sales commission rates will not be sustainable in the future.
Even large-scale facility industries such as ours can be affected severely in a short period of time—even a few months—if we cannot respond to social paradigm shifts. In this environment, we cannot survive without practicing nimble change- responsive management. Digital influences are expanding in our daily lives in more ways than
we could have imagined. Customer consumption and purchasing trends are changing, specialty store corporate strategies are changing, and the boundaries between industries and business models, between online and offline, and between countries are becoming weaker throughout the world as competition rises dramatically. In the midst of these drastic changes, we must make the most of the physical and human assets in which we have invested to date, and continue to create and offer new value to the communities, partners, and customers AEON MALL serves. We must
Three initiatives to realize a digital transformation (DX)
deepen relationships in the communities we serve, aiming to improve corporate value.
I believe that digital transformation (DX) is not about the pursuit of tangible goals. Digital transformation is the act of achieving the ideal of what we should be through people-centered DX. We will work on three measures to this end.
The first is to put our management philosophy and vision into practice. We must define clearly the ideal state we wish to achieve through digital technology, establishing a deep understanding within our organization and taking action. The second is to respond to a digitalized society.
To grow our businesses in the future, it will be important for us to create new opportunities by collecting, processing, and analyzing the data assets we collect via big data. Therefore, we must integrate our data collection systems, adopt new systems, and launch new business processes. On this path, we will consider what to outsource and what to produce in-house, establishing corporate operating systems capable of responding to changing times over the long term. Third, and most important, is mindset reform. Even with a clear shared management vision and outstanding operating systems, we cannot achieve true transformation if the mindset of our employees is

inflexible. The most important thing now is for us to become an organization in which each individual thinks about the “why” as a starting point and then acts with a sense of urgency.
Pursuing ESG Management
ESG Management is Focusing on a Future Ideal, While Contributing to Society and Engaging in Profit-Generating Activities
ESG-Based Management
The definitions and details of the SDGs are
not what is most important when thinking
of sustainable growth and corporate value improvement. Rather, it is more important that a company defines the future it wants to achieve as a corporate entity, given this social context. The essence of corporate activities is to generate profit by contributing to society in collaboration with stakeholders, using the company’s physical and human resources. This is the AEON Philosophy, and engaging in corporate activities based on
this idea will accomplish the objectives of ESG and the SDGs. In return, society will recognize AEON MALL as a sustainable company. In
the future, social demands on companies to address ESG issues will only increase and only accelerate. In response to these trends, we intend to make strategic efforts to strengthen our ESG management and enhance corporate value.
To pursue ESG management requires more than an awareness among managers. ESG management must be understood by and foremost in the minds of all employees. To this end, we believe that corporate branding is
extremely important. We are striving to strengthen not only external communications, but also inner branding among our employees. Under our management philosophy of being a Life Design Developer, we have coined the phrase “Heartful and Sustainable” for our activities as a corporate citizen that contribute to the development and revitalization of communities and society. We
are involved in many initiatives that help create sustainable societies. AEON MALL facilities host events and projects that embody our philosophy of being a Life Design Developer. We have coined and branded the phrase Happiness Mall, engaging in a variety of activities that offer unique value to communities available only through real-world malls, aiming to create spaces for the happiness of our customers and local communities.
Measures Addressing Materiality
Among the many social issues we face, we have selected materialities from among those issues that are of particularly high importance to us and our stakeholders and that are closely related to our daily corporate activities in the context of Heartful and Sustainable. We strive to improve and resolve the social issues related to these materialities. In particular, we have identified measures to combat climate change on a global scale and the problem of marine plastic waste as major issues that must be resolved in global society. Marine plastics pollute the ocean and affect marine ecosystems. Microplastics have become an issue that affects human health. Rising sea levels caused by global warming result in coastal flooding around the world. The linear precipitation belt, which caused last year’s torrential rains in Kumamoto, has been

 affected greatly by global warming.
At the same time, we see efforts around
the world to achieve low-carbon societies and curb greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming. Japan has declared a specific target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, and has set a specific goal to achieve 100% electrification for all new passenger cars by the year 2035. This fiscal year, we established KPIs, or key performance indicators, for materialities to help accelerate our efforts in addressing these issues. Around 20 individuals are participating in this project. These people range from young employees in Japan and overseas to managers in administration and sales. The project team discusses interim targets to achieve by 2030, guiding employee-wide policy according to projections of likely conditions and with an awareness of the indicators for achieving our key targets for reaching an ideal society by the year 2050.
Corporate Governance
We have built upon our strengths as a retail business developer, at the same time striving to localize our malls to the characteristics of each community we serve in Japan and overseas. Moving forward, we intend to stretch beyond the traditional framework of a commercial developer, contributing to better lifestyles and community growth in terms of economy and culture. We are also working to strengthen and raise the level of our corporate governance, which will be critical to putting this approach into practice on a global scale.
Over the past fiscal year, we strengthened
our governance structure to advance our growth initiatives. Our aims here were to enhance the monitoring function of the board of directors and to expand the discretion of executive departments to improve risk-taking capabilities. As part of these efforts, we reviewed the roles and responsibilities of directors. As a result, we consolidated the
structure of division oversight from seven divisions to five per director. This change has created a structure that allows the board of directors to discuss the direction of corporate strategy and engage in more effective supervision. In addition, we delegated executive authority to general managers to speed business decision-making and develop successors. Further, AEON MALL intends to increase the number of independent outside directors who bring diverse perspectives, knowledge, experience, and skills. In so doing, we plan to pursue measures to address issues and growth initiatives.
To Our Stakeholders
Striving to be a Life Design Developer That Creates the Future of Community Living
Our management philosophy states that AEON MALL is a Life Design Developer that works
with communities and produces ways of living
for the future. Here, Life Design extends beyond the framework of the shopping mall. Life Design addresses functions associated with different customer life stages, including not only shopping, but also interaction with other people, cultural development, and other features contributing
to future lifestyles. How should AEON MALL

achieve our vision? I believe we must act from two perspectives: (1) How to provide new value to the markets and continue to create customer value and (2) How to increase not only economic value, but also social value. To put this approach into practice, we launched a new working group called studio LIFE DESIGN. studio LIFE DESIGN will create the future for customers and society, defining the future vision for AEON MALL. This working group will examine perspectives and concepts for the year 2030, not only for AEON MALL facilities, but also regarding the presence and positioning of our company itself in our communities and in society. This working group will provide a basis as we look toward society
in the year 2040 and 2050. In the future, we will expand beyond the framework of shopping malls, embodying the essence of being a solutions company that responds to the challenges faced by our communities and society. To this end, we will anticipate social changes and adopt a backcasting framework that addresses business risks and opportunities from a longer-term perspective.
We must become a company that is in the business of providing solutions to society and to our local communities. We have aimed to become part of the community social infrastructure, offering an open platform. In this capacity we have become rooted deeply in our communities and have been involved closely in the lives of our customers. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 has accelerated and changed the environment
in which we operate. The pandemic will continue to have a significant impact on the shopping center industry. We are a company that has created deep roots in our communities under
this kind of environment. It is because of these relationships that our communities will expect us to offer even more solutions to social issues. The reason for our existence as a company is to work diligently in solving these problems head on. I ask for the understanding and support of you, our stakeholders, as we move forward.

 Special Feature Implementation of Measures to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19
We recognize that COVID-19 is a serious incident and will permanently take measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Response and Management Policies in a Changing Environment (New Normal)
 The global spread of COVID-19 forced malls in Japan, China and ASEAN to reduce operating hours or
close temporarily. In addition, due to the increase in telecommuting and staying at home, the value our customers place on location and time in their daily lives changed dramatically.
In accordance with the AEON COVID-19 Prevention Protocol, a standard for preventative measures established by AEON to protect the health
and livelihoods of customers and employees, as
well as the safety and security of customers and the local community, we will continue to improve the mall environment and mall operations with thorough infection prevention measures. In this era of the new normal,
we also see this as a good opportunity to reinvent our business model by offering new mall concepts and service functions. We will work to create malls that respond to social changes in Japan and overseas.

Countermeasures against infectious diseases based on AEON Prevention Protocol
Reduced rent and other support for specialty stores New work styles, including telework
Corporate officer visits to malls for greater understanding Reiterating policies to employees
Digital, contactless and e-commerce consumption and purchasing behaviors
Avoid services not amenable to the Three C’s (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings) and avoid in-person services
Changes in how time is spent at home and home situations
(More time spent at home, more consumption at home (instead of outside the home) when possible)
Less urban centralization; more decentralization to outlying regions
(Reevaluation of suburban living)
More and new ways to use outside spaces
(E.g., parks, bike rental, sports, nature)
     In pursuit of our management philosophy, we strive to achieve sustainable growth and improve corporate value by solving social issues through our businesses (Management philosophy: AEON MALL is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living.)
Event Response Going Forward
The global spread of COVID-19 forced malls in Japan, China and ASEAN to reduce operating hours or
close temporarily. In response to the declaration of emergency in Japan, we temporarily closed malls and urban shopping centers in seven prefectures beginning April 8th, 2020, and on the 18th of the same month, we temporarily closed all 164 malls across Japan. As Japan phased out of its state of emergency, we began
reopening our businesses on May 13. In light of these restrictions, rents for specialty stores were reduced or exempted at AEON MALLS nationwide for two months starting March 2020. In August, we established the COVID-19 Response Team as a specialized department to work on preventing the spread of infection in malls and within the company.

Creating Mall Environments for the New Normal
By setting up the COVID-19 Response Team, we are creating a safe and secure environment through the implementation and improvement of preventative measures. We have installed hand sanitizers at all entrances and exits, disinfected all areas of the building that come into contact with large numbers of visitors, and facility ventilation systems
are on maximum setting to increase air flow. We have ensured food courts and other restaurants are well ventilated and seats are separated. We have installed acrylic panels, etc. to help prevent airborne infection when directly serving customers.
In addition to advertising entry restrictions such as fever and other
Creating Malls for the New Normal
We are striving to improve Brick-and-Mortar Mall Value Through Localization and Digital Transformation. As part of the localization initiative, AEON MALL Ageo (Saitama Prefecture), which opened in December 2020, is located on the former site of KOSÉ Corporation, which operated locally for 43
years. To honor this, we have included four KOSÉ supervised
symptoms, we have implemented a system of entry control, limiting the number of customers who can be in our facilities at any one time. To manage the health of our employees, we also conducted temperature checks when entering our facilities, noting the results on a check sheet.

 Special Feature Digital Transformation (DX) Initiatives
By pursuing DX, we will provide new services, create new relationships, and introduce new ways of doing business with our customers and partners.
AEON MALL intends to leverage DX to develop new businesses tailored to the life stages of our customers, to create new digital technology and data-based business models together with our communities and partners, to establish operating systems for the next generation, and to improve employee satisfaction (ES).
Direction of DX Initiatives
Our DX Vision
Achieve people-centered digital transformation (DX)
•Improve customer convenience and satisfaction by combining the knowledge gained from real assets at approximately 200 facilities in Japan and overseas with digital technologies to propose new, personalized value attuned to customer life stages and interests.
•Create new business domains and serve as a platform for solutions to regional issues by co-creating with communities and external partners through data collaboration and the use of digital technologies.
•Use the latest in digital equipment and big data to reduce the workload (work hours) in connection with store operations. Provide management support and create new business opportunities that contribute to the sales of tenant companies.
•Pursue operational efficiencies through digital technologies and a review of IT infrastructure. Create an environment in which we can focus on creating new added value based on mindset reform and the development of DX-fluent human resources.

  An Environment to Encourage DX
In April 2021, we established the DX Promotion Department, an organization under the direct supervision of the president and CEO. The department pursues DX to create new value
and to support and coordinate DX throughout
the company. In addition, we have established a Digital Promotion Department for personnel within the existing business divisions to work with the DX Promotion Department in building systems to promote digitalization rapidly closer to the front lines of our businesses. We will establish a Digital Council to discuss the progress of digital initiatives and issues, etc., among divisions. In this way,
we pursue a nimble DX optimized for the entire company, while also responding to changes. To realize our vision, we will continue to recruit and train personnel capable of planning and using DX. We will also improve our IT environment proactively to utilize data and achieve business efficiencies.

Creating Customer Interactions and Improving Convenience Through Real-World and Online Integration
AEON MALL App
In June 2020, we redesigned the AEON MALL app to enhance the customer purchasing experience through digitalization. We made major upgrades to the user interface and added new functions.
As a result, downloads more than tripled compared to the previous version, and we saw a large uptick in user activity. The app received recognition for essential growth, winning the App of the Year Award for Excellence in the App Ape Award 2020, one of the largest app awards in Japan.
We will continue to improve customer convenience and increase sales through digital marketing tailored to individual customers, rather than traditional mass-market approaches.

  Live Shopping and Food Delivery
To provide customers with safe and secure purchasing environments, we developed a live commerce platform that
allows tenants to introduce and sell their products via live video. More than 20 malls nationwide now use this Live Shopping platform.
Working with Demaecan, we have expanded food delivery services with more than 300 tenants participating. AEON MALL will continue to improve customer convenience, while also creating interactions with customers who cannot visit our malls, aiming to increase traffic and sales.
 Tenant Support Through Digital Technologies
AEON MALL Works
We developed a tablet-based app to promote work efficiency for our tenant employees. Digital application forms, etc., allow tenant employees and AEON MALL employees to work together with greater efficiency. We will extend the functionality of the app and strive for greater employee satisfaction, providing temperature checks, online training, virtual meetings, and other measures to reduce personal contact during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Co-Creation With External Partners
AEON MALL Co-Creation Program
AEON MALL leverages the open innovation program managed by Creww, Inc. with an eye toward major changes in local community issues and the consumer environment. We are recruiting start-up ventures to collaborate in businesses that create the new future of living by combining our management resources, outside technologies, and external networks.

 Corporate Strategy to Achieve Our Long-Term Vision
We will steadily implement our business strategy to
achieve our Vision for 2025 by building a business portfolio consisting of multiple businesses in Japan and capturing growing markets overseas.
Looking Back on Past Strategies
We have formulated a medium-term management plan as a backcast with a view to achieving the long- term vision.
     Medium-Term Management Plan FY2014-FY2016
Overview (Target)
Numerical Targets
Operating Revenue: ¥280 billion
(FY2016 Actual: ¥269.7 billion)
Operating Income: ¥46.5 billion
(FY2016 Actual: ¥44.9 billion)
Priority Measures
1.Expansion of new business bases in Japan
2.Improve profitability
3.Establish business foundations in China
and the ASEAN region 4.Omni-channel support 5.Ensure financial discipline
Results
Over three years, we have opened a total of 31 malls, 15 in Japan and 16 overseas. In Japan, we opened new malls based on new concepts, such as those that support consumer spending and locations in front of stations. Overseas, we promoted the expansion of new store openings and the search for properties in China and ASEAN, which will become our new growth drivers.
Issues
Overseas, net loss increased (-¥5.4 billion in FY2015) due to the expansion of new store openings. In Japan, the investment efficiency of new malls decreased due
to soaring construction unit prices. As a result, profit growth for three years slowed to an average of 2.1% per year, and both operating margins and asset efficiency declined.
Medium-Term Management Plan FY2017-FY2019
Overview (Target)
Numerical Targets
Operating Revenue: ¥326 billion
(FY2019 Actual: ¥324.1 billion)
Operating Income: ¥62 billion
(FY2019 Actual: ¥60.7 billion)
Priority Measures
1.Capture Asian Growth Opportunities
2. Develop Latent Sources of Domestic Demand 3.Become the Overwhelmingly Dominant
Mall in Each Region
4.Capture Urban Growth Opportunities 5.Build a Financing Mix and Organizational
Structure Supporting Growth
Results
Over the past three years, we have opened a total of 21 malls, 10 in Japan and 11 overseas. The number of overseas malls opened exceeded that of domestic malls. The shift to overseas is in full swing and we achieved profitability overseas in FY2018. In Japan, we promoted the expansion and renovation of existing malls to strengthen their profitability (eight malls in three years), and the consolidated profit growth in three years was 10.6% on average per year, getting back on the path to growth.
Issues
Performance was sluggish due to the lack of progress in reforming OPA’s business model in the urban business. Overseas business improved profit and became a profit growth trend, but the operating margin and asset efficiency did not improve.
Medium-Term Management Plan FY2020-FY2022
Overview (Target)
Numerical Targets
Operating revenue: ¥360 billion Operating income: ¥68 billion
Priority Measures
1.Achieve high profit growth overseas 2.Achieve stable growth in Japan 3.Build a financing mix and governance
structures supporting growth 4.Pursue ESG-based management
Progress (Actual)
We established preventative measures in the malls we operate based on the AEON COVID-19 Prevention Protocol. In response to the new normal lifestyle, we pursue sales measures leveraging digital technology, including the AEON MALL app and Live Commerce sales promotions.
To achieve our Long-Term Vision, we have positioned ESG management as a measure of growth and defined our materialities.
We established materiality targets (KGIs, KPIs), redoubling our efforts.
Future Strategies
We identified five management issues and formulated a future vision to achieve the four growth initiatives over the three years of our medium-term management plan.
Achieve overseas business operating growth and accelerate new mall openings Maximize the appeal of brick-and-mortar malls through customer experience (CX) Build next-generation malls and pursue the urban shopping center business Digital transformation
Formulate and pursue medium-term strategies, accelerate reforms based on ESG perspectives

Importance to Stakeholders
We used SASB* and other guidelines, as well as categories used by ESG benchmarking organizations, to assess importance to stakeholders.
* US-based Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
Importance to AEON MALL
We used our management philosophy and medium-term management plan to ascertain the importance of these topics to AEON MALL.
Confirm Relevance
Finally, we confirmed the relevance (materiality analysis process and results) of these topics from the standpoint of our outside independent directors and in consideration of the unique AEON MALL business model. We revised group-wide materiality based on these opinions and then confirmed the topics in a meeting of the CSR Council (currently the ESG Promotion Committee).

Creating Materiality/KPIs
Our employees discussed the 10 key initiatives (materialities) that we need to tackle and determined the KGI (final
goals) and KPI (intermediate goals). In line with the KGI
we have set as our goal for 2050, we will set specific KPIs to be achieved by 2030, share the issues throughout the company, and work together to solve them and contribute to local customers and a sustainable society. In deciding how to formulate KGI/KPIs, a diverse group of 22 people, from veterans to young employees, including those from overseas, were selected by the general managers of
each division and through open recruitment. We ran four workshops during a period of about six months starting in July 2020 to examine what each participant thought we should be as a company. Along with the advice of experts, we decided on the KGI/KPIs that would serve as performance indicators for all employees.
Process for Setting KGI/KPIs
Prior to determining the KPIs, we held workshops and received a variety of opinions from the young employees and overseas employees who participated.
I participated in the workshop because I have always wanted to contribute to solving social issues through urban development. I don’t believe that KGI/KPIs are the end of the story, but they are important in disseminating information and aligning vectors so that people can see them as their own.
It was a valuable experience for me to be able to exchange opinions with other employees who want to improve the company, regardless of their age. Through the workshop, I realized that there is a way for the entire community to enjoy working together alongside our customers to conserve resources.
AEON MALL Vietnam is moving to actively engage in social contribution activities, and I participated in this event to gain a deeper understanding of our company's basic ideas and initiatives in Japan. We would like to raise each employee’s awareness and promote activities to achieve our KGI/KPIs.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
   Masahiko Okamoto
For us to be a company that is chosen by customers, tenants, and employees, it is necessary to clearly set forth the guiding principles of the kind of company we want to be. Through discussions with our employees, we have set the company's future vision (KGI)
and intermediate goals (KPI) that will serve as our guideposts. From veterans in key positions to young employees who ran for open positions, employees from all walks of life were able to openly and frankly
discuss the issues, giving each of them a good opportunity to think about the future of the company and listen to opinions that differ from their own. As
a solutions company that provides solutions to local and social issues, we will continue to raise awareness within the company by ensuring that all employees include materiality-related items in their personal goals, and we will actively share information with our customers and tenants.
We will share our KGI/KPI initiatives with our customers and tenants.

Overseas
Given that we consider our overseas business as central to future growth and are aggressively opening new malls, we are working to improve the organizational structure and strengthen the cash management of our overseas business. In particular, in order to cultivate the next generation of local management, we will consider dispatching player managers and will move forward with building a governance system. We will strengthen support from headquarters aiming for rapid expansion of personnel and sales bases together with ensuring localized management functions appropriately and smoothly.
In our Three-Year Plan Growth Policies, we are working on the following three common initiatives for each country — promoting ESG-based management, creating new businesses, and cultivating local human resources.

We are contributing towards sustainable development and urban design in Vietnam, which has seen rapid economic growth in recent years, and are working to expand our business. Indonesia has been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 sweeping through Southeast Asia; however, we are currently working to improve the profitability of existing malls, including the renovation of BSD CITY, and are looking to open in Tanjung Barat. Also in Cambodia, our presence in the country will be further enhanced with the opening of our third mall in 2023. We do, however, need to ensure differentiation in order to prevent cannibalization of existing malls.

AEON MALL Overseas Strengths and Growth
We have the following five strengths that help us expand our overseas businesses, and based around these
we have in place an aggressive policy of opening new stores.
(1) Large parking capacity in response to motorization
(2) Ability to create a sales area localized to the
community
(3) More entertainment options to meet the demand
for experiential consumption
(4) Events that attract customers
(5) Safe, secure, pleasant facilities
The expertise in mall management and operations
we have accumulated in Japan allows us to develop and operate competitive malls overseas. While overseas developers tend to emphasize efficiency, our malls
in China and ASEAN feature large flat parking areas, reflecting our understanding of the future growth of motorization in these regions. These parking lots
also serve as a competitive advantage for use in
future expansion. We conduct mall management and operations that compare favorably with our malls in Japan, offering safe, secure, pleasant facilities on
par with those in Japan. This is another factor that contributes to our superior market position.
In addition to our strengths noted above, our unique growth model for malls will contribute in significant ways to future business expansion. Costs remain at a constant level under this growth model,
as real estate costs account for the majority of mall operating costs. At the same time, we grow operating revenue from commission rental income and revisions in rental fees tied to increases in sales. In this way, mall revitalizations generate further profit improvements in the time after the expiration of three-year tenant lease agreements. In this way, we can post the same level of profits as those of our malls in Japan within seven or eight years after opening.

Accelerate New Mall Openings
We are accelerating new mall openings in China and ASEAN countries. Our original plan called for 70 malls in operation by 2025. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic means negotiations and urban development at planned sites have seen delays so
we revised our goal to 50 malls in operation by 2025. However, by 2025 we plan to secure a pipeline for reaching a 70-mall structure. Overseas, at least three years are required from the securing of development rights through to the start of business, therefore construction commencing in 2022 will only bear fruit in 2025 — this makes the next one to two years vitally important.
With regard to our policy for opening new malls, in order for management plans for opening malls not to be left to local companies and for these plans to be
Mall Opening Plan Through FY2025
properly put in place, we will manage and supervise the development progress of each property, including the schedule for discussions at meetings and the status of negotiations, from the management meetings in Japan. If any delays to this plan occur, we will clarify causes and problems, and work with the relevant departments both in Japan and overseas to resolve them.
In Vietnam, we are signing comprehensive memoranda of understanding with local governments regarding investment and business development for shopping mall development, and are accelerating mall openings. We plan to have 16 malls in operation by FY2025 toward an eventual 20-mall network within Vietnam, and aim to have preparations for this 20-mall structure complete within FY2021.

Use Malls as Vaccination Centers
As one of our activities to combat the spread of COVID-19, we actively provide vaccination sites in response to requests from governments and municipalities nationwide. As of February 2021, the AEON Group has formed agreements with approximately 50 local governments to provide vaccination centers within our facilities. We are also coordinating with other governments and will expand this program as needed.

On December 7, 2020, AEON MALL Uki (Kumamoto Prefecture) opened a branch office of Uki City in an outlying building. The new branch office features
a café operated by a facility that employs disabled individuals to support employment, a large area at which adults raising children can relax, and other services to improve convenience for users and enhance functions for workers.
Expand Functions as Local Community Infrastructure
In order to improve convenience for customers, we have expanded social infrastructure functions such as the permanent installation of post offices in the mall. We offer polling stations for early voting in our facilities, and in cooperation with the Japan Red Cross Society, we provide blood donation centers at malls throughout Japan. We are also working on various initiatives such as providing cinemas as venues for coming-of-age ceremonies.

a new lifestyle and added value. Additionally, AEON MALL’s office brand will go by the name “BIZrium” with a sub-theme of working and living. Looking forward, we will develop the concepts optimized for each region both in Japan and overseas in order to achieve freedom of living and working for each individual.
In business model development, we are developing our outlet business category and plan
to open our second The Outlets regional innovative commercial facility in the Yahata Higashida Project (tentative name) scheduled to open next year. In addition to suburban mall THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA (Hiroshima Prefecture) in Hiroshima, we plan to develop
our outlet business in two other locations, such as our AEON Lake Town Outlets (Saitama Prefecture), in metropolitan areas.
In urban development, on March 1, 2021, we reorganized the OPA Urban Shopping Center Business with the aim of promoting initiatives better tailored to individual localities, and to improve the profitability and efficiency of facilities. The newly established OPA will specialize in the management and operations of urban facilities (8 facilities) mainly located in transportation terminals, creating new value through a concentration of management resources. AEON MALL will absorb consolidated community-based facilities and urban shopping centers (14 facilities) under the AEON MALL business, transforming these assets into facilities that meet customers’ daily needs and working to increase property values. In addition, the AEON Group owns some properties in prime locations in front of stations that are aging, and we hope to actively redevelop these existing properties.

 Promoting Finance Mix and Strengthening
Governance Structure
Promote a finance mix that supports growth strategies and strengthen our governance to maintain financial soundness. In particular, we are working to diversify and sophisticate our fund procurement and optimize cash management with an awareness of investors growing interest in SDGs and ESG, as well as to strengthen our governance with an emphasis on the cost of capital.
Global Financing Mix
We are promoting a global finance mix by diversifying financing that combines indirect and direct financing and real estate securitization in Japan and overseas. Specifically, we are expanding our base of financial institution borrowing and continue regular issuance of domestic retail bonds. In anticipation of the full-scale
arrival of the sustainable finance era, we issued a ¥30 billion sustainability bond in September 2020.
We will continue to use real estate securitization to generate funds for the development of new shopping malls, and we are also considering overseas financing.

  Optimizing Cash Management
As our businesses overseas grow and transition to a stage of profit generation, cash balances in certain areas have increased significantly. We will continue to optimize cash management by shifting cash from areas with excess funds to areas with stronger needs for cash.
An example of this is the cross-border pooling arrangement established in FY2020 between the China
Subsidiary and AEON MALL (Japan), whereby excess cash from the China Subsidiary will be transferred to AEON MALL (Japan) from FY2021 and used to repay existing interest-bearing debt. The cash secured in Japan will be used to open new stores at our ASEAN subsidiaries.

Financial Information/ Company Overview
Emphasis on the Cost of Capital
When investing in the development of shopping malls
in Japan and overseas, we calculate the internal rate of return by discounting the future cash flow to the present value so that the total present value of the future cash flow generated by investment properties each year matches the investment amount. If the internal rate of return exceeds our base rate of investment returns, the investment is considered eligible.
Our base rate for investment returns is determined based on the cost of capital, which is the weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of shareholders' equity calculated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), weighted by interest-bearing debt and market capitalization. The cost of capital is determined by taking into account the country risk premium and market data of each country.
 The higher the future cash flow, the higher the internal rate of return (r).

Value Creation Strategies
 Pursuing ESG-Based Management
In 2019, AEON MALL identified Materiality as a priority measure, reflecting the perspective of ESG in maximizing the economic and social values we create through the integration of growth strategies and ESG-based management. This approach is driving us to achieving our goals for 2025.
We pursue management based on a perspective of ESG to achieve sustainable growth and higher levels
of corporate value. In addition, we have leveraged COVID-19 as an impetus to seek reform based on ESG concepts, striving to create economic value, social value, and environmental value for our stakeholders.
The current business environment surrounding AEON MALL reflects the emergence of modern shopping centers and high-growth retail markets in connection with overseas GDP growth on the one hand, and accelerated mall openings by competing developers and concerns about a slowing Chinese economy on the other. Other emerging factors include demographic changes in Japan (declining population, aging society, low birthrates), as well
as changing family compositions, and changes in consumer behavior, including e-commerce, budget-mindedness, sharing economies, etc.
In this changing environment, we will strive to achieve ESG-based management, defining materialities in terms of regional and social infrastructure development, local community ties, the environment, diversity, work-style reform, and responsible business.
Our Vision for 2025 encompasses more than generating profits from malls in Japan. We aim to

build a portfolio consisting of multiple businesses, while becoming a top-class global commercial developer with consolidated operating income in excess of ¥90 billion. In our Japan business, we are planning floor space expansions and renovations to become the dominant mall in each area. In our overseas business, we aim for an operating margin of 25% across 50 malls, operating at the same level of efficiency and scale as our domestic operations.

             Aeon has established the Aeon Sustainability Principle, which serves as the groupwide policy for the development of sustainable societies. Under this policy, we have established materialities in terms of the environment (achieving a decarbonized society, preservation of biodiversity, promotion of resource recycling) and society (creating products and stores that meet social expectations, engaging in fair business practices that respect human rights, collaborating with the community). In pursuing our responses to
each matter, we seek to conduct sustainable business management. AEON MALL also pursues management based on ESG perspectives, aiming for further development by strengthening our management foundation through expanding earnings and corporate value.

    Value Creation Story
ESG Promotion System
AEON MALL has established policies for corporate activities related to society, the environment,
and ethics. The AEON MALL Corporate Social Responsibility Council meets on a monthly basis to manage the implementation of these policies. Although the council provided timely decisions in managing
the progress of and solving issues related to ESG initiatives, in response to the recent rise in focus on ESG management, we changed our CSR Council to the ESG Promotion Committee in April 2021. This change is designed to enable more prompt decision- making and the pursuit of ESG issues, including CSR.
The ESG Promotion Committee is an organization subordinate to the Management Council. The committee is responsible for formulating strategies and policies
related to ESG management and for monitoring the progress of ESG management. The committee is also responsible for exchanging information, responding
to and discussing inquiries from the president on matters related to ESG, and advising or reporting to
the president on related matters. In addition, we intend to establish an ESG Promotion Subcommittee for the purpose of examining and discussing specific measures related to the policies and reports of the ESG Promotion Committee. The ESG Promotion Subcommittee is charged with making decisions on ESG-related issues in a timely manner, and to create a system to be accepted and promoted internally, thereby leading to the resolution of social issues.

Measures to Communicate With Employees
Every employee must understand their role from an ESG perspective, learning why their role is important, as well as how to think, act, and take responsibility for their part in ESG at AEON MALL. To this end, in fiscal 2021, we began establishing targets based on ESG perspectives as part of our personnel evaluation managed targets (assigning a target weight of 30% or more). In addition, we have assigned a person in charge of ESG to each business unit throughout Japan. In so doing, we are establishing a system to implement
and deepen ESG-oriented initiatives quickly at each mall location.
In January 2021, we held seminars for all employees titled, “The Historical Significance of the SDGs and Demands on Corporations: Becoming the Company of Choice
Through SDGs Management”. We invited Mr. Shiro Tonari, representative director of the CHUBU SDGs Promotion Center, to address our employees participating online from Japan, China, and ASEAN. Numerous employees asked questions during the lecture, and
the seminar provided an opportunity for employees to deepen their knowledge of the SDGs and reconsider how to incorporate the SDGs into their own work.

 TCFD
Based on the Aeon Decarbonization Vision 2050, we are promoting a range of initiatives aimed at achieving a decarbonized society. These include reducing total CO2 and other emissions from our malls to zero by 2050, and setting an interim 2030 goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 35% over 2010 levels. We have also established new targets of operating all malls using CO2-free electricity by 2025.

Board of Directors Role (Environment)
Deliberations by the ESG Promotion Committee and its subcommittees, the Risk Management Committee, and the Compliance Committee are reported to the board
of directors. Additionally, climate-related issues are also incorporated into the annual board of directors’ agenda. It then makes further connections between climate- related issues and the business, and act in a supervisory capacity to ensure that there are no errors.
Every year, as part of our ISO environmental goals, we set company-wide energy-saving targets. Energy- saving initiatives are planned and implemented by each mall, and they manage their own progress. If any of these business units fail to achieve these targets, it will examine corrective measures, and submits a report
to environmental departments. Particularly important corrective measures are reported to the ESG Promotion Committee and its subcommittees, and depending on importance and urgency, to the Management Council and the board of directors.

This section introduces our efforts to address climate change in line with the information disclosure framework recommended by TCFD.
Management Role (Environment)
The role of management in environmental issues
is to make decisions on specific measures related
to the environment, including achieving the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050. The risks and opportunities from climate change have a major impact on business strategy, so the ultimate responsibility for these rests with the president.
The ESG Promotion Committee, a forum for discussions on sustainability, has been established as a subordinate mechanism under the Management Council. The ESG Promotion Committee is chaired by the president and consists of directors and full-time Audit
& Supervisory Board members. In addition to its day- to-day efforts, the committee meets every two months to discuss company internal and external needs and expectations as well as current issues and problems, set targets for initiatives, and manage progress, with a focus on the four areas of environmental issues, social issues, strengthening governance, and communication, aiming for rapid resolution of issues.
In addition, the ESG Promotion Committee also confirms issues and targets, as well as rapidly making decisions on specific measures aiming to achieve the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050 — these include promoting the use of renewable energy and adding more EV chargers.

Major risks and opportunities
AEON MALL has summarized the significant climate change risks and opportunities in Japan, China, and ASEAN countries in which we operate our mall business based upon external information, and has collected forward-looking forecast data on each of these risks and opportunities. Using this, we have studied the
risks and opportunities involved with the transition to a decarbonized society, as well as the physical risks and opportunities stemming from climate change. We have identified the primary risks and opportunities that may impact our business by 2050.
One example is a hypothetical situation which sees the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. In this,
we have identified a risk in which delays in investment
in charging stations may limit our ability to attract customers, countered by the opportunity in which appropriate capital investment will differentiate us from competitors and positively impact our ability to attract customers. We also identified the risk of flooding and power outages within and outside our facilities due to torrential rains and typhoons because of increasingly extreme weather events. However, the installation of watertight panels to prevent flooding and other tangible and intangible disaster preparedness measures may give us a competitive advantage, and by extension increased opportunities for our business partners to use the facilities and better attract customers. Please refer to the table for details.

Towards Achieving a Decarbonized Society
 As one measure for ESG-oriented management, AEON MALL aims to help create a decarbonized society by the year 2050. As a part of these efforts, the AEON MALL Group carried out a scenario analysis. Results
of this showed that on top of transition risks from the addition of a carbon tax to achieve decarbonization and other climate change-related trend changes, physical risks such as rising sea levels and abnormal weather patterns because of global climate change would also have a significant impact on the AEON MALL. In order to construct a resilient infrastructure system, in light of
the recent torrential rains in western Japan and Typhoon No. 24, which caused extensive damage from floods and tornadoes both in Japan and overseas, we have included floods and tornadoes as new risks. Also, based on the responses of individual malls to previous disasters, we have established a range of policies
such as our natural disaster response guidelines. As we continue with scenario analyses, we will carry out not only qualitative assessments, but also quantitative impact assessments so that we can understand the financial impacts of climate change.
By the Year 2025, all AEON MALL Facilities Will Transition to Renewable Energy
The AEON Group continues to engage in energy- saving activities, including the installation of solar power systems and EV chargers, aiming to help create a decarbonized society. In 2018, AEON formulated the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050, aiming to achieve
a decarbonized society by the year 2050 through the pursuit of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy, etc. Our target is to operate all malls using renewable energy by 2025.
AEON MALL Kawaguchi (Saitama Prefecture) has begun operating with virtually zero electricity and gas CO2 emissions. In addition to energy-saving efforts, the mall procures electricity with virtually zero CO2 emissions through the non-FIT non-fossil certificate electric power program*1 offered by TEPCO Energy Partner, Inc. The mall also sources carbon neutral city gas*2 supplied by
Risk Management
The AEON MALL defines all risks, including fluctuations in sales due to competition, fluctuations in exchange rate, reputational damage, as well as earthquakes
and fires. We have elucidated our basic approach to managing these in the Corporate Risk Management Rules. Depending on the nature and type of risk,
these will be handled by different departments, and categorized as the Management Strategy Division, the
Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd.
*1 Non-FIT non-fossil certificate electric power program: A product offering the environmental value procured by Tokyo Electric to the point of customer demand in parallel with grid electricity. This source of electricity is regarded as essentially CO2-free.
*2 Carbon-neutral city gas: Using CO2 credits to offset greenhouse gases (carbon offsets) during the process of extracting natural gas through the combustion of said gas. This process is viewed as producing zero CO2 on a global scale, even through the combustion stage. The CO2 credits are certified by a reliable verification organization assuring the CO2 reduction impact of environmental protection projects around the world.

The AEON Group established Aeon Eco Project energy strategy that was in place from 2012 to 2020, and has set a goal to reduce energy consumption by 50% (per unit of floor space) compared with fiscal 2010.
For fiscal 2020, AEON MALL reduced energy consumption by 55.1% (per unit of floor space) compared to fiscal 2010.
Furthermore, in March 2018, Aeon newly formulated the AEON Decarbonization Vision 2050 aiming to achieve a decarbonized society, is aiming to reduce total CO2 and other emissions from our malls to zero by 2050, and has set a 35% reduction in CO2 emissions over FY2010 levels by 2030 as an interim target.
Aeon has also joined the RE100 initiative and we are committed to converting all of our electricity usage to renewable energy by 2050.
AEON MALL has set a target of having all malls switched to using renewable energy by 2025.
Third-Party Verification
In FY2019, in order to ensure transparency and improve reliability, we received third-party verification of greenhouse gas (scope 1, 2, and 3), water, and waste emissions generated by our company. Using forecasts for improvements derived from this verification, we are working to continuously improve internal information.
2020 saw third-party verification carried out for AEON Co., Ltd. and for consolidated Group companies. Looking forward, we will work to improve the reliability of our data, and to continue with reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions.
*We verify Scope 3 in accordance with the AEON MALL Scope 3 Calculation Rules (updated June 14, 2021). (Scope and verification method are the same as for Scope 1 and 2)

Beyond providing necessary goods and services, help customers feel happier and more inspired with every visit.
Smiling faces. Healthy bodies.
These are the types of happy experience spaces we strive to create.
 Happiness Malls Achieve Our Mission as Life Design Developer
The Happiness Mall is a brand communication message linking AEON MALL with our customers.
Each mall engages in efforts based on a common concept leading to the branding of AEON MALL as the Happiness Mall.
 AEON MALL has established the Happiness Mall as our brand communications concept. Each mall acts individually, taking on
new challenges to offer new experiences and new communications to our communities, making every day healthier and happier. One example is DokodeMall! Tanoshimall! [Mall Anywhere! Let’s Have Fun!]. This program is an online service allowing customers to enjoy events held in AEON MALL facilities from anywhere via the AEON MALL app or website. AEON MALL offers events for customers to become more familiar with cultural and performing arts. These events include story-telling, operas, rakugo, kabuki, and more. In addition, we provide events in which customers can participate online, creating opportunities for happiness and fun. Programs include the “Exercise while you...” program to help relieve sedentary lifestyles, O-warai Hanto Online, a comedy program encouraging customers to laugh and learn, and many other online events. Through these and other activities, we continue to work together with local communities to create a mall that is a vital part of customer lives.

Developing Community and Social Infrastructure
   Established Disaster Prevention Agreements with Almost All Malls in Japan
We are strengthening
cooperation with external
partners, such as governments
and private companies, with
the aim of safe and secure
community building. In Japan,
almost all malls have established agreements with local governments regarding cooperation with disaster prevention activities. AEON
Co., Ltd. has also established agreements with the Ground Self- Defense Force, Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. (JAL), and 10 electric power companies nationwide. Here, we have agreed to provide support in the event of emergencies, including providing infrastructure support and aid supplies, playing a role as a base for recovery activities.
Holding Disaster Prevention Festivals
Since 2018, AEON MALL
Sakai Teppocho (Osaka
Prefecture) has held the
Sakai Teppocho Bosai FES!,
a disaster prevention festival
serving as an opportunity
for local residents to gain a renewed awareness of the importance of disaster prevention. In fiscal 2020, the mall exhibited 1,276 coloring book pages of fire engines at 18 kindergartens and nursery schools. We also held group walks where participants could learn the importance of disaster prevention goods while walking through the building. The event enjoyed a record-high participation of 31 organizations, like neighboring companies, police and fire departments, and government agencies, as it promoted greater public awareness of disaster prevention.
Promoting Smart Malls
We are proactively working
to develop smart malls that
implement cutting-edge digital
technology for more convenient
shopping experiences. At AEON
MALL Ageo (Saitama Prefecture),
which was opened in December
2020, two large 320-inch LED screens have been installed on its outer walls, providing information on specialty stores, seasonal environmental images, news, and more. We have also digitized our customer feedback, which we had previously conducted only through paper forms. This information is now available for browsing via dedicated touch panel signage.
China: Preventing Fires by Implementing Automatic Fire Extinguishing Equipment
In order to prevent kitchen fires, we have introduced automatic fire extinguishing equipment to all restaurants starting in July 2018. After July 2018, new locations may not be opened until they agree to install this equipment. After installation, employees regularly inspected this equipment, leading to stronger awareness toward fire prevention among specialty stores and fewer incidents. We will also continue to strive toward higher levels of safety in our malls overall by taking action such as installing detection devices for gas leak prevention.
Cambodia: Improving Equipment to Ensure High Safety Levels
We conduct monthly disaster prevention drills, and with cooperation from local fire departments, participate in annual large-scale disaster prevention drills in June with participation of around 500 people. By using social media to stream content from the drills, we work to communicate the safety of our malls to local residents. We ensure that
fire safety levels at AEON MALL facilities are matched to our high standards in terms of both tangible and intangible systems. In addition to installing sprinklers at intervals of 1.5 meters to 2 meters,
we also equip
our malls with
fire extinguishing hoses, fire extinguishers, and alarm devices.
Deepening Universal Design
2005 marked our first full-scale universal
design of a commercial facility, intended to
provide a comfortable experience with peace
of mind to all visiting customers. We collect
customer opinions through actions like regular
questionnaires, working toward ongoing
improvement. At AEON MALL Kochi (Kochi Prefecture), which was expanded
in floor space and renovated in September 2020, well-known universal design researcher Naoto Tanaka, Visiting Professor at Shimane University, and Tomomi Oida, Representative Director of NATS Architectural Design, supervised efforts to realize a facility where all customers, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and persons with babies, can enjoy a more comfortable experience.

The Smile Marche Project: A Three-Party Collaboration to Support Hokkaido’s Food Products Business Operators
In order to support food business operators in Hokkaido, where they face challenges in excess inventory due to the spread of COVID-19, Sousei Marche, a food select shop
at AEON MALL Asahikawa (Hokkaido), launched the Smile Marche Project in cooperation with Yamato Transport Co., Ltd. In addition to opening a new special Smile Marche store in the mall that sells products from Hokkaido, we established an online Hokkaido goods exhibition for online sale of these products. Customers from all around the country flocked to the Hokkaido Food Business Operator Support Pack, a combination of meat, fish, cheese, and other products from various businesses, despite not knowing the pack’s exact contents until they’ve received it. The popularity of this pack not only helped spread the word about the appeal of Hokkaido’s ingredients, but also helped increase sales for its food product business operators.
Executing Into Cooperation Agreements for Regional Revitalization
In order to assist in the development of local communities, we promote executing into cooperation agreements with municipal governments. In Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture, we have entered into the Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement on Regional Revitalization. This agreement further solidifies our cooperative relationship, following agreement with the city on health promotion and support in the event of disasters. In addition, we have executed into the Collaboration Agreement on Regional Revitalization in Indonesia. AEON MALL Sentul City (Indonesia), opened
in October 2020, is designed to improve convenience for local residents and to serve as a community hub.
Partnership Agreement to Promote Community Health
We established a mutual cooperation agreement with the Japan Conference for Health Promotion, an organization that provides comprehensive health management services across Japan, with the purpose of improving the rate of health checkups and contributing to health promotion among local residents. In addition to holding mobile health checkups, including women’s examinations, at 19 malls, AEON Lake Town Kaze (Saitama Prefecture) also offers easy cancer screenings for women during their shopping trips. Going forward, we will continue to contribute to the healthy lifestyles of local residents and tenant employees.
  Enhancing Blood Donation Activities at Malls Across Japan
Impact from voluntary restraint of going out during the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the opportunities
for blood drives at companies and schools, resulting in profoundly problematic blood shortages. To help the many people who need blood transfusions, AEON MALL enhanced its intake of blood drives from malls that had reopened
after temporary closures in the April 2020 declaration of emergency. From the following May to June, we received blood from 45,123 donors across 121 malls.

AEON Hometown Forest Project
The AEON Group regards the AEON Hometown Forest Project tree planting initiative, launched in 1991 in Malaysia, as an activity to embody a philosophy centered on pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing
to local communities, always from the customer’s point
of view. Every time a new mall is opened in Japan or overseas, AEON hosts a tree planting ceremony, working with customers to plant native trees most appropriate for the local natural environment. In fiscal 2020, we held the event on a reduced scale at AEON MALL Ageo (Saitama Prefecture) and AEON MALL Shinrifu South Wing (Miyagi Prefecture). In all, 53,948 trees were planted in Japan and
overseas. As of the end of February 2021, the AEON Group has planted a total of nearly 12.23 million trees.
       Ecological Surveys in Surrounding Areas
We conducted an ecological survey of the AEON Hometown Forest at AEON MALL Kurashiki (Okayama Prefecture), which opened in 1999, and THE OUTLETS HIROSHIMA (Hiroshima Prefecture), which opened in 2018. As a result, we confirmed that the forests have grown over time to provide homes for a wide variety of plants and animals, playing important roles as part of local ecosystems.
Accomplishments (Highlights)
Planting
We controlled invasive and increasing non-native plants by planting a high density of evergreen saplings modeled after local natural forests. We confirmed a diversity of
213 plant species at AEON MALL Kurashiki (Okayama Prefecture) 20 years after first planting. About 40% of the plant species are common with those in the natural forest, which is an even higher ratio than in general green spaces in urban areas.
Birds/Butterflies
Forests play a variety of roles, including habitats for grassland and arboreal birds, migration routes, feeding grounds, and breeding grounds for local butterflies. As our forests grow, they become a part of the network con- necting nature in local communities.

China: Careful waste separation according to instruction manuals
Since the opening of our first mall in China in 2008, we have emphasized waste management. In response to stricter laws on waste separation in China in 2019, we created an instruction manual to manage waste on an even stricter basis. We opened AEON MALL Qingdao Xihaian Xinqu (China) in November 2019. Every month, this mall conducts training for tenants and persons responsible for the mall’s waste storage area. Waste is sorted according to our manual, which has been highly praised by the Qingdao City government. We will roll this manual out to other malls in the future.
Vietnam: Communicating importance of recycling
In cooperation with NGOs that contribute widely to
the environment, we conduct educational activities to communicate the importance of recycling. In addition to showing videos encouraging the separation of waste inside
malls, we offer special benefits to customers who bring their own eco-bags. We also hold training sessions for tenants to reduce the amount of waste, and we reward stores that demonstrate successful results. Our efforts to manage waste across entire mall facilities include considerations of direct tie-ups with recycling companies to ensure collected waste is reused.
Cambodia: Supporting education through recycling
Since 2014, we have been providing cardboard and waste plastic to NGOs, using profits from the sale of recycled products to support the education of Cambodian children. In addition to recycling, we educate tenants and mall employees on environmental conservation and hygiene management, as well as waste separation. To reduce the amount of waste plastic, our Cambodian headquarters distributes drink tumblers to mall employees, contributing to a reduction of environmental impact.

Human resources are the most important management resources for sustainable growth. Based on this policy, we pursue growth strategies by investing in our human resources, aiming to be a company that fosters diverse human resources who are healthy and have the opportunity to exercise
their talents. In response to advancing globalization and digitalization of business, we commit ourselves to creating new value by transforming our education system from a traditional single-track specialist education to a double-track

At the same time, we are developing various human resources training and education programs to support human resources development.
growth. In this way, we spur employee motivation and desire to grow, which is the driving force for career advancement.
In addition to promotion tests, we have a self-reporting system that allows employees to express their career aspirations to the company. We believe this system provides fair opportunities regardless of age, gender, or nationality, and enables us to hire and promote talented people.
We provide flexible options to enable all to work flexibly, regardless of gender or life-stage changes, including child rearing or aging parent care. We are building a foundation for comfortable work environments upon which employees can develop their careers.
Cultivating Global Human Resources
Our basic policy for operating malls overseas is to delegate the operation to local staff members who have a deep understanding of our philosophy. We focus on the education of human resources in each country. We are also active in promoting local staff members to management positions.
Currently, 11 malls have local staff members serving as general managers (GM) who are responsible for the malls. In Cambodia, we strive to instill in our employees the
philosophy that the customer comes first. We also teach cleanliness, safety, and various other factors that create customer loyalty. Employees grow through various training programs, using the knowledge and experience they have acquired to create malls that are supported by the local
community.
In China, training programs are held periodically for
local staff to improve their careers. In addition to offering unified programs throughout China, we also provide
training in each area, expanding the best practices to
other malls. Further, we strive to increase motivation by focusing on cultivating human resources through short-term assignments to Japan, as well as through the adoption of an employee performance evaluation system.
We create opportunities for our Japanese employees to gain experience overseas. We believe that the experience of working with local staff gives Japanese employees the chance to grow and develop in their own careers.

Pursuing Work-Life Balance
Supporting Diverse Work Styles According to Different Life Stages
Value Creation Management
Financial Information/ Company Overview
 AEON MALL offers flexible work styles for employees according to various life stages, including marriage, childbirth, childcare, and nursing care for loved ones at home. It is sometimes said that a balance between job satisfaction and productivity is a contradiction. Further, job satisfaction is determined by comfort in the workplace and rewarding work. These elements cannot be provided
 unilaterally by the company, but are created by the company and employees striving together. It is important that employees aim for independent work styles on their own, while supervisors provide guidance and development for employees demonstrating this ambition. We pursue work-life balance based on this concept.
 Encouraging Childcare Leave
To support employees in balancing work with childbirth and childcare, AEON MALL has established various systems to create a workplace environment that encourages the use of childcare leave. In FY2020, 52 employees (including 23 male employees) took childcare leave. We also encourage the active participation of men in childcare.
Ikubos Support Fund System
We have introduced our own Ikubos Support Fund System to provide financial assistance during childcare leave. To support work and family life balance, as well as to encourage Ikubos (bosses who are raising children) individuals who are the primary breadwinners of their families, we provide assistance payments to employees who take childcare leave and who have child dependents registered under their health insurance. We offer a three- month eligible period, beginning the first day of childcare leave, ensuring 80% of the employee’s regular wage by paying the difference on top of the employment insurance compensation (for childcare leave; equivalent to 67% of monthly pay).
Expansion of Aeon Yume-Mirai Nursery Schools
As part of our
efforts to create an
environment where
people of child
rearing age can
continue to work
with confidence, we
opened the Aeon
Yume-Mirai Nursery School, an on-site nursery available
to employees of AEON Group companies, specialty store tenants, and local community residents. Tenants hire staff members who are balancing work and childcare, and we support them in creating a work-friendly atmosphere for their employees for long-term employment. We create opportunities for children to grow both mentally and physically through events and activities based on the local community that are not affected by weather and that can be held only at a mall-based daycare center. The AEON Group operates 31 nursery schools, 21 of which are operated by AEON MALL commercial facilities (as of end of Feb, 2021).

Improving Work Environments for Employees
of Specialty Store Tenants
As the shortage of human resources has become a social issue, we believe that it is our responsibility as a developer to enhance ES (Employee Satisfaction) by creating
an exceptional working environment that encourages employees of our specialty store tenants to stay longer-
term. In addition to separate convenience stores and powder rooms, our employee break rooms are equipped with free massage chairs, creating and providing an environment where employees can relax mentally and physically. In addition, we roll out the best examples of ES improvement measures to other malls.

Human Rights Policies, Systems, and Training
   The unwavering principle of Aeon is pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always from the customer’s point of view. To honor these principles we will comply with all relevant laws and regulations, while dealing with all people honestly and sincerely through proper behavior. The AEON Code of Conduct was enacted
in April 2003 on the basis of these values. In September 2014, AEON codified a philosophy of human rights and the workplace producing AEON's Basic Human Rights Policy in support of the AEON Code of Conduct.
AEON MALL follows this philosophy and these policies
in respect for human rights. The company aspires to create an organization that allows all people, regardless of their gender or nationality, to participate in the development of the company. We strive to create workplaces that enable all employees to perform to the highest level of their abilities.
All AEON MALL employees must attend an annual human rights training. We also provide employees with a handbook that lists both internal and external help desks. This handbook provides clear information about respect for human rights, prevention of discrimination, and other matters in the context of the AEON MALL employment rules.
 AEON Code of Conduct–Our Commitment
1. AEON people are always grateful to the many other individuals who provide support and help, never forgetting to act with humility. 2. AEON people value the trust of others more than anything else, always acting with integrity and sincerity in all situations.
3. AEON people actively seek out ways to exceed customer expectations.
4. AEON people continually challenge themselves to find new ways to accomplish the AEON ideals.
5. AEON people support local community growth, acting as good corporate citizens in serving society.
 AEON Human Rights Policy
In accordance with this policy, all Aeon executives and employees (AEON People) further deepen their understanding of human rights and help achieve a society that respects these rights. This policy applies to all AEON People, and we share this policy with all business partners.
1. Our Approach to Human Rights
Aeon has established the Aeon Basic Principles and the AEON Code of Conduct. We also subscribe to the United Nations Global Compact, which we joined in 2004. In accordance with these principles and in compliance with domestic laws on human rights and labor, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the rules on human rights set forth in the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, we respect the rights of all individuals who are impacted by our businesses. In addition, we support and follow the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
2. Respect for Human Rights in Business Activities
We will respect the privacy of individuals as well as their diverse values and personalities and never discriminate against anyone for any reasons, including discriminatory treatment based on race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, place of birth, religion, educational background, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
In addition, we remain mindful of the positions of others and respect them as our equals.
• We treat all customers in a fair and impartial manner and provide them with safe, reliable products and services, as well as related information.
• We actively communicate with local community members to ensure that we respect their human rights.
• We comply with sound corporate ethics and workplace environment-related laws, regulations, and international standards in our business activities by dealing with business partners fairly. Moreover, we improve our performance in this regard continually.
• We listen to our coworkers, respect the human rights of each coworker, and create workplace environments that are free of harassment, safe, and employee-friendly. At the same time, we train and educate all AEON People to further their knowledge and understanding of human rights.

To prevent situations with potential human rights violations and build a sustainable value chain,
AEON MALL established our own Guidelines on Sustainable Transactions (“Guidelines”), based on
the AEON Human Rights Policy and AEON Supplier Transaction Code of Conduct. Our Guidelines ensure a comprehensive inclusion of international norms and industry human rights matters related to human rights
and labor. At the same time, these guidelines identify matters that should be included in our own guidelines based on an assessment of importance.

Formulation of Guidelines for Sustainable Transactions
https://www.aeonmall.com/esg/society/02/#human_rights_guide
Formulation Process
We worked with external experts and engaged in the following process to formulate our Guidelines.
1. Confirm human rights matters based on
international norms, etc.
We referenced the International Bill of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and other international norms on human rights and labor when considering the elements to include in our Guidelines.
2. Confirm human rights matters in our industry
In addition to international norms, we confirmed the matters related to human rights and labor that are emphasized in our industry when considering the elements to include in our Guidelines.
Future Implementation
In the future, we intend to share our guidelines with group companies and business partners, asking them to comply with these guidelines. We will also strive to understand the status of implementation, aiming to manage and reduce human rights risks in our supply chain.
3. Assess importance
We assessed the importance of human rights elements identified in steps 1 and 2, defining important matters to reflect in our own guidelines, including child labor, forced labor, working hours, discrimination, and health and safety.
4. Prepare guidelines and requirements for each human rights matter
We prepared guidelines and detailed requirements for each matter.

  Identify actual conditions and conduct gap analysis
Identify human rights issues
Conduct risk assessment and identify impact
Consider mitigation measures
We took inventory of our existing human rights-related activities in Japan and overseas, striving to understand the actual situation. Next, we conducted a gap analysis comparing external demands and our actual situation with respect to policy disclosures on child labor, forced labor, and other human rights risks, as well as systems and operational structures, including access to emergency relief. Based on the results of our gap analysis, we confirmed the key points for further disclosure and initiatives in the future.
We then referenced international norms and guidelines, including the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In addition, we identified industry-specific issues and identified human rights risks from a larger number of issues related to our company and value chain. These risks included the prohibition of discrimination, equality before the law, and procurement practices.
Based on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we plan to assess the risks of the human rights issues identified in terms of severity and likelihood of occurrence. To reflect our real-world situation more accurately, we will conduct interviews and a written survey on the status of human rights initiatives, including the status at overseas group companies. During the process of risk assessment, we will identify the negative impacts of human rights issues.
We will identify matters of particularly high impact as priority issues, considering mitigation measures that include responses, preventive and corrective measures, and operating systems.

  Recognizing that the pursuit of diversity is an important management
issue, we asked our outside directors and outside members of the Audit
& Supervisory Board to meet with employees, exchanging opinions and listening to real feedback from employees across a variety of life stages and diverse backgrounds. Since the meeting was held online, we were able to meet with employees not only from the Kanto area, but also from all across Japan. We divided the participants into groups by generation, holding discussions along certain topics and providing an opportunity for directors and employees to understand issues more deeply. We asked our outside directors to inquire particularly about the utilization of human capital at AEON MALL. We hope to continue opportunities for such dialogues, inviting outside directors to extend beyond their monitoring function and provide advice to management regarding human resources and other issues. The following is an excerpt of the dialogues, covering the current state of human resources at AEON MALL, as well as issues and expectations for the future.

 How can employees build a career at AEON MALL while also respecting one’s spouse’s life and career to achieve a positive work-life balance?
•Topic 1 How to achieve a positive work-life balance while working at AEON MALL •Topic 2 How to build careers for both oneself and one’s spouse
Work-Life Balance and Career Development at AEON MALL
Outside directors and AEON MALL employees engaged in a frank discussion about their current concerns, issues, and future expectations in achieving work-life balance and career development at AEON MALL. As these discussions were conducted across multiple sessions and groups of individuals, we summarized the content and opinions for this article.
Employee Comments and Opinions
I would like to balance childcare and work better, as shift work schedules at the mall mean there are only a few days to spend time with family. It’s difficult to balance family time, work time, and personal time.
I had a hard time finding a new daycare center after being transferred. In particular, employees with preschoolers would probably like to have more time when transferring.
Even though we have a system for working shorter hours, there’s a hurdle in terms of feeling that others in my department will have to pick up the slack. I think the key here is fostering an understanding among co-workers and how supervisors approach the issue.
I want to advance in my career, but I feel that it’s difficult to balance child-rearing with the long and busy hours of a manager position. If there were role models of female managers who were also raising children, I think others might be able to see their own hopes for career advancement.
When an employee follows their spouse on a transfer, perhaps there could be a way to consolidate certain mall-related work that could be performed at home when no mall is nearby.
In Japan, there is a stereotype that women are solely responsible for housework. We need to change that stereotype. I think the company offers some excellent programs, which we should leverage to make changes.
Comments From Outside Directors and Outside Members of the Audit & Supervisory Board
 Topic 1
 How to achieve a positive work-life balance while working at AEON MALL
 Topic 2
 How to build careers for both oneself and one’s spouse
Director A | Most people think of work- life balance based on work and child- rearing, but I think the ideal is to maintain a balance of base time for work and child-rearing, combined with time spent on hobbies or other enjoyable pursuits.
I believe the aim of AEON MALL is to improve so employees can think of
a personal plus-alpha in their time in addition to work and child-rearing. This dialogue was a valuable opportunity to listen to honest opinions, and I found it very helpful.
Director B | We heard some comments from employees worried about the timing of having children. We also heard concerns about the high hurdles to receiving promotions when returning from childcare leave. Others mentioned that having a child might be a hindrance to finding work in certain departments. In the future, we need to have more opportunities to hear from people who have returned to work after taking maternity leave, so we can reflect these experiences in the development of our system.
Director C | I am serving as an outside director for AEON MALL while raising a family. When I understood that raising a family while pursuing a career was one reason for my selection, I was
very happy to know that something
I feared as a career negative was actually regarded as a positive. The understanding and follow-up of the people around you is very important in making children a positive and valuable step. I hope to add my own efforts to spread diversity in the group.

Recommendations for AEON MALL’s Future Management Policy and Strengthening of Our Governance Structure
Three of our outside directors and three of our outside corporate auditors were asked to provide their objective perspectives on the evaluation of our current situation and the issues we face, based on the following themes. 1. Review of fiscal 2020 and future management policies, 2. Medium- to long-term issues facing AEON MALL, and the evaluation and issues related to management policies for our Vision for 2025, 3. Strengthening governance system to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value.
This roundtable discussion was held at AEON MALL Ageo (Saitama Prefecture) on April 9, 2021, with measures taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. This mall is the first commercial facility in Japan to receive the WELL Health-Safety Rating*, a global evaluation measure for COVID-19.
* WELL Health-Safety Rating was established by The International WELL Building Institute in June 2020 based on the findings of public health and other experts. This is a global standard assessment
regarding COVID-19. A third-party verification organization audits facilities to ensure they are managed and operated in consideration of the health and safety of visitors and employees.
 Review of Fiscal 2020 and Future Management Policies in Response to COVID-19
Watanabe: The global spread of COVID-19 infections in FY2020 has had a significant impact on society. Our domestic and overseas malls also shortened their opening hours or closed temporarily. Even after resuming operation, the fiscal year was marked by
difficulties in dealing with the second and third waves of COVID-19. Despite these circumstances, we were able to open AEON MALL Ageo, the venue for today’s event. We are providing a safe and secure shopping environment through preventative measures based
on our COVID-19 Prevention Protocol. Based on our business model, please give us your opinion regarding our customers, employees (including tenant employees), and local stakeholders.

    Value Creation Story

Financial Information/ Company Overview
  Kawabata: The AEON Group has implemented solid preventative measures. 2020 was a year
in which the company steadily implemented measures to ensure safety and security by putting
customers first, as seen in the efforts to strengthen ventilation at AEON MALL Ageo (Saitama Prefecture).
I think this was a year in which AEON MALL, given its mission of being able to maintain the function of social infrastructure was able to provide safety and security as well as cleanliness to customers in Japan and overseas. The new normal indicates that the company can provide a place where customers can shop with peace of mind, enjoy their visit, and ensure their safety and security. And under the leadership of President Iwamura, I realized that all employees share this policy in our efforts to build malls.
Koshizuka: We have implemented rent reductions and exemptions to accommodate the shortened and closed hours of tenant companies, our important business partners. The negative impact of this measure on our business performance is not small. Do we really need a business partner who won’t help us in times of need? Can the partnership be sustained when times return
to normal? When I think about it, I believe that this business decision was the right one, even though our company was also in a difficult situation.
Yamashita: I became an outside director in May
2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was unfolding.
I was impressed by the quick response based on the management philosophy of the customer comes first and contribution to the community, the cooperative system with tenant companies, and the preventative measures for employees. I witnessed how employees responded to these issues even before receiving instructions from head office. I was also impressed by the company’s ability to educate employees daily and carry out crisis response in an organized manner. Muramatsu: This is what I felt before I was appointed as auditor of AEON MALL Kochi (Kochi Prefecture).
This place is truly functioning as a living infrastructure, and I realized firsthand that AEON MALL is necessary for the community. For AEON MALL, I believe that the
S (Society) in ESG has become even more emphasized and clearer in 2020. Going forward, we will take safety and security one step further in the midst of this global COVID-19 pandemic. In this way, I believe that the key words cleanliness and distribution will become more important in the way employees work and the malls operate.
Torii: From a risk management perspective, we are considering adding new business risks in light of the current new normal, risks associated with environmental changes, digital-related risks, and business model related risks. I believe that this was a year that can be evaluated as us taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity for us to move toward further strengthening our risk management. In the future, I expect that the Board of Directors will further discuss management strategy risks in light of changes to lifestyles and business transformations.
Medium and Long-Term Issues, Evaluation and Issues Regarding Management Policies Toward AEON MALL’s Vision for 2025
Watanabe: Thinking about with-COVID-19 and post- COVID-19, what are your thoughts on the issues facing AEON MALL from a medium- to long-term perspective, as well as your assessment of the management policies toward Vision for 2025 and its challenges?
Kawabata: President Iwamura’s vision for the company is to promote ESG management. I believe that this is the key to achieving
sustainable
growth and corporate sustainability. President Iwamura then spoke of the concept of
CSV as AEON MALL becoming a company
that is aware
of its responsibility as an important part of society’s infrastructure, rather than a company that simply grows its business and generates profits. In particular, how will the new normal affect AEON MALL after the COVID-19? We will incorporate areas such as offices, medical care, and education. We will also develop urban businesses taking mixed-use development into consideration for

Round Table Discussion With Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
people of all ages. I appreciate the fact that these discussions were conducted in the Policy Council as well.
Koshizuka: What AEON MALL is aiming for is the evolution of a business model with a customer experience solution-based platform. This means
that both the customers who visit the mall and the tenant companies that open stores are considered as customers of AEON MALL. The idea is that we will be the place where both parties meet. In other words, we will be the platform provider. This model has the
potential to attract an overwhelming number of customers, and it has the potential to expand its domain beyond shopping
to include green deal- like businesses
such as matching and sharing. However, management must make sure that this vision is fully shared by the employees so that it can permeate the organization. I believe this is our biggest challenge.
Yamashita: In fiscal 2020, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a year of constant change. In this context, we held policy meetings for 2021 to share information on a case-by-case basis. I felt that this way of working through a great deal of information to discuss was very successful. Going forward, the Board of Directors will set aside sufficient time to create a
solid vision for the major directions of how AEON MALL will respond to and grow from changes in the external business environment.
Muramatsu: While maintaining consistency of the
idea that a mall is an integral part of the community
and remaining keenly aware of the significance of our business, I believe that the future of AEON MALL will require a flexible response that meets the individual needs of the community, regional characteristics,
and the needs of the time. And people are the key to achieving all of this. I think it is important for employees to implement and customize our management philosophies as a way of life, and this way of thinking will determine the success of the company.
Torii: I
believe that
strengthening
our compliance
system will
be extremely
important in
implementing
our future
growth initiatives.
Overseas,
we frequently
open AEON MALLs in areas that are about to undergo development. In opening a store, we will work with the government and local administration to understand the city’s development plans and local information to promote development. In doing so this will also increase transactions with local companies. To ensure implementation of growth measures in such environments, I feel it is extremely important to consciously strengthen our compliance system and encourage all employees to raise their awareness
of compliance, especially for our overseas business development.
Strengthening Governance System to Achieve Sustainable Growth and Enhance Corporate Value
Watanabe: Next, under the theme of strengthening governance system to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value, please tell us about the efforts the Board of Directors have taken to establish and operate an effective corporate governance system and how you would evaluate it.
Kawabata: It has been six years since I was appointed as a director and I believe the important thing I have done during this time is establishing the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee. We began our activities at the beginning of 2019 and have been involved in the election of directors and other matters. We recently conducted a year-end evaluation of the executive directors for 2020. As members of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, the independent directors have been able to evaluate the activities of each executive director. In doing so, we have been able to carry out performance evaluations which I believe to be a very significant achievement. Koshizuka: I believe that the evaluation of the

    Value Creation Story

Financial Information/ Company Overview
  effectiveness of our Board of Directors is working to
a certain extent. However, one thing I would like to point out is the concept of an advisory board, which is more of an executive board, and a monitoring board, which emphasizes supervision. Currently there is a tendency to emphasize monitoring boards. The reason for this is that there is a growing view that the Board of Directors needs to focus more on corporate value and medium- to long-term growth potential as its function, while transferring some of its authority to the executive. Management issues need to be addressed from the perspectives of both short and long term, urgent and important, defensive and offensive. The perspective
of long-term growth is a very significant role for the Board of Directors. So, when it comes to the discussion of evaluating the Board’s effectiveness, it is a matter
of what they choose for the board meeting agenda. Understanding what the important issues are that
need to be decided is the key to making the Board of Directors more effective.
Yamashita: I think it is important to explain board meeting proposals to external directors and corporate auditors in advance. I feel it’s also useful if we consider it to be an environment that supports appropriate risk- taking by senior management. On the other hand,
if the role of the Board of Directors is to determine major directions of corporate strategy and to provide highly effective supervision of management from an independent and objective standpoint, then advance detailed explanation should be avoided because that tends to lead to discussions that are in line with the company’s intentions. Going forward we need to keep this in consideration.
Muramatsu: In terms of investment profitability
criteria, as each mall requires a large amount of capital
investment, we use investment payback period, EBITDA, IRR, and other criteria to make investment decisions. Each indicator has its advantages and disadvantages, and that is
why we need to consider them from multiple perspectives. In our
company, various departments, including development, leasing, sales, and finance, work together
to promote
projects.
However, along
with evolving
changes to the
business environment, such as changes in the market and consumer needs, I think we should set simpler criteria for investment profitability. For example, “If we invest 10 billion yen, how much will we get back?” This is a standard that the staff on the work site can feel and understand in raw numbers.
Torii: I believe that it will be very important in the
future to understand how to make internal control
and governance work for the entire group, including domestic and overseas subsidiaries. For overseas operations, each country has its own internal control system in place. However, as the number of malls increases in the future, further improvement is necessary. In President Iwamura’s policy announcement, he mentioned promoting the localization of mall management. However, Group governance will become increasingly important, including the strengthening
of human resources and employee training. Also, to implement the internal control system PDCA cycle, the way employees working in the field perform their daily tasks is of utmost importance, and I believe that the need for education for local employees will increase. Watanabe: What I felt from listening to the opinions on this policy was that the ultimate goal is that the customer comes first, and that goal is global. We all need to
think about why we operate malls for the benefit of our customers and local communities. I think that by doing so, we will be able to see what we need to work on in
the future. I felt the most important thing was making
our stores more accessible, convenient, and a place of relaxation for our customers by using advanced tools such as digital technology. I believe that we need to innovate
to become a platform where we fulfil the role of bringing customers and tenants together. I was also reminded that the most important factor in achieving sustainable growth and increasing corporate value is undoubtedly people. Thank you very much for your time today.

Corporate Governance
AEON Mall is building systems to strengthen our corporate governance and speed decision-making to enhance stable, long-term corporate value.
Basic Approach
Aeon Mall is a Life Design Developer, creating the future of community living as we pursue our basic principle that the customer comes first.
Life Design extends beyond the framework of the shopping mall. Life Design addresses functions associated with different life stages of our local customers, including not only shopping, but also interaction with other people, cultural development, and other features contributing to future lifestyles.
AEON MALL builds upon our strengths as a retail business developer, at the same time striving to localize our malls to the characteristics of each community we serve. In this way, we contribute to better lifestyles and community growth in terms of economy and culture. We recognize the importance of corporate governance in accomplishing this vision and we work continually improve our structure.
Corporate Governance Structure
AEON MALL established the Management Council to serve as an advisory body for the president and CEO.
This council consists mainly of managing directors and higher, full-time members of the Audit and Supervisory Board, and individuals appointed by the president and CEO. The purpose of this council is to strengthen business strategy functions and ensure a more efficient decision- making process. We bolster management and supervisory functions by holding at least one meeting of the board of directors per month, chaired by the president and CEO.
In addition to these mechanisms, we strive to disseminate information through committees led by

Internal Controls System
Basic Policies and Organization for Internal Control Systems
AEON MALL emphasizes compliance and respect for the AEON Code of Conduct, fostering improving relations with local communities and meeting our social responsibilities. We have established a Compliance Committee, which
is chaired by the general manager of the Administration Division. The role of this committee is to ensure group compliance with laws, regulations, our corporate charter, and internal rules. The committee is also responsible for identifying problems and advancing discussions to resolve said problems. Committee proceedings are reported to the Management Council, and matters of note are elevated to the board of directors. Additionally, we have set up the AEON MALL HR 110 helpline as an internal reporting contact point
to protect whistleblowers. Our subsidiaries have helplines that mirror the AEON MALL system. Where unacceptable behavior is proven, we take disciplinary action according to internal rules. We (or the department in question) also draft measures to prevent recurrence, shared for company-wide implementation. The Compliance Committee also receives a report of the measures. The internal audit division determines whether the company and subsidiaries are managed appropriately. The division conducts audits and presents the results to the CEO and full-time members of the Audit and Supervisory Board according to the Internal Audit Rules.
Operational Status of Internal Control Systems
AEON Mall determines whether our internal control systems function based on a checklist to ensure appropriate operations. The following is a summary
of the principle operational status of the company’s internal control systems for the period under review. Drawing on the results of the risk survey we conducted in fiscal 2016 and our responses to major incidents, new business domains, and environments, we are building a more effective risk management system by classifying risks according to importance and the need to take countermeasures. We also hold intensive discussions in our Risk Management Committee regarding initiatives implemented by departments responsible. We take measures in advance to mitigate the severity of fires
and natural disasters by focusing on safety measures. The company has set up a new Information Security Committee in response to the growth of digitalization and

stronger information security measures. This committee has started to hold meetings in conjunction with the Risk Management Committee.
To prevent violations of laws, regulations, and
internal rules that pose compliance risks, the Compliance Committee discusses case studies of past violations that have occurred within the company. In this way, we develop measures to prevent recurrence. Discussions during the period under review have centered on measures to prevent harassment in response to changes in relevant laws. We have also addressed approaches to improving workplace environments when AEON Mall properties undergo renovation. To prevent harassment, discussions focused on the status of whistleblowing, the results of morale surveys, and the implementation of compliance training. By reporting the results of these deliberations to the Management Council and the board of directors, we strive to develop more effective initiatives to prevent harassment.
Managing Board of Director Meetings
In addition to holding regular board of director meetings monthly, AEON MALL convenes extraordinary meetings
of the board of directors as deemed necessary. Decisions encompassing substantial risk threatening far-reaching impact on the group are brought to the Management Council for discussion. These decisions are then
approved by the CEO and/or by resolution of the board
of directors. Executive authority is delegated along with clear management accountability according to Rules for Organization Management, Rules for Segregation of Duties, Rules of Jurisdiction, Rules for Approval Requests, and Rules for Management of Affiliates.
Strengthening Our Organization to Improve Global Governance
The AEON MALL Group strives to achieve further improvements in global governance. In 2018, we implemented a level of internal control systems in China which are comparable to the systems in Japan. We
have also formed a Risk Management Committee and Compliance Department in China. Our Internal Audit Department in China works to strengthen internal control systems in cooperation with the Internal Audit Department in Japan. Risk assessments by the Risk Management Committee were also conducted in ASEAN countries in fiscal 2018. We began building internal control systems in ASEAN in fiscal 2019.
Outside directors inspect our overseas properties in person once or twice annually. Outside directors provide a wide range of advice on the cultivation of human resources,
overseas governance, rule-making, and useful case studies. Through these efforts, we strive to respect human
rights and strengthen compliance.
Criteria for Appointing and Dismissing Officers
The president and CEO proposes director candidates according to the following criteria. The Nomination and Compensation Committee, which consists mainly of independent outside directors, discusses nominations, which are then presented to the board of directors as agenda items for the general meeting of shareholders. The board makes the necessary resolutions which are submitted to the general meeting of shareholders for approval.
(Policies for the nomination of director candidates)
• Internal directors must have the ability, knowledge, experience, and achievements required for their field of specialization. These individuals must also have a sense of balance and judgment that enables them to understand and act across all aspects of business operations.
• Outside directors must have abundant experience and insight in professional specialization. These individuals must have sufficient time to carry out their duties as company directors and possess qualities to provide independent advice and recommendations on the appropriateness of decision-making by the board of directors.
Nominations of candidates for members of the Audit & Supervisory Board are proposed by the president and chief executive officer according to the standards provided below. Nominations are determined by board resolution after discussion with the Audit & Supervisory Board, and are presented to the annual general shareholders’ meeting for approval.
(Policies for the nomination of Audit and Supervisory Board candidates)
• Candidates must be aware of business issues based on experience in general business management.
• Candidates must have no interests or business relationships that may affect their execution of duties as a member of the Audit and Supervisory Board.
• Candidates must have considerable knowledge of finance and accounting, or skills, expertise, and experience in a specialized field.
The board of directors elects a CEO who will contribute to effective corporate governance and sustainable growth in medium- and long-term corporate value. The appointment and dismissal of the CEO is decided by a resolution of the board of directors. A candidate for CEO must have an appropriate breadth of experience, insight, and advanced expertise.
The CEO must also have managerial ability and leadership skills sufficient to achieve continuous growth in the company’s business.

These trainings include seminars for newly appointed officers and top company management.
Newly appointed outside directors and outside members of the Audit and Supervisory Board are provided with mall tours and training to develop an understanding

Succession Plan
We have established a Nomination and Compensation Committee, consisting mainly of outside directors, to investigate training and other programs addressing standards, career paths, and training necessary for individuals with management responsibility (including candidates). Combined with board of director meeting deliberations, the system is designed to ensure highly transparent and fair procedures.

1. Analysis and Evaluation Process

an exchange of opinions and discussions led by outside directors.
2. Overview of Analysis and Evaluation Results
Board of director meetings function appropriately. Board meetings follow proper agendas and allow sufficient time for active discussions among directors and corporate auditors who have a diverse background of opinions and experiences.
3. Response Going Forward
AEON MALL strives to enhance the quality of deliberations conducted by the board of directors and the board’s effectiveness by working to improve global governance and risk management to support appropriate risk-taking as we expand the scale of our overseas operations. Moreover, the company implements measures to improve the functions of the board of directors.

Cross-Shareholdings
The AEON MALL policy on cross-shareholding is to hold shares for the purpose of contributing to improve the AEON MALL Group corporate value over the medium and long term. This policy considers a number of factors including business strategy and business relationships. Our board
of directors meets to review individual cross shareholdings on an annual basis, considering the purpose for holding shares, risks involved in holding shares, the cost of capital, and other economic rationale on a comprehensive basis, determining the reasonableness for cross-shareholdings. We consider selling shareholdings when deemed as having little significance, considering the impact of such sales on the markets. We disclose the results of such sales publicly. When exercising voting rights of cross-held shares, we verify whether each proposal contributes to the medium- and long-term improvement in AEON MALL corporate value and whether said proposal holds the potential to damage our corporate value. As necessary, we hold discussions with the issuing company as part of our overall decision- making process.
Policy on Measures to Protect Minority Shareholders in Conducting Transactions with the Controlling Shareholder
Aeon Co., Ltd. is the parent company of the company, holding 58.22% of the company’s voting rights (as of February 28, 2021).
When the company conducts transactions with
Aeon Co., Ltd. or AEON group companies, we obtain approvals at a meeting of the board of directors attended by independent outside directors to ensure the fairness and rationality of the transaction from the perspective
of enhancing Company corporate value. In this way, we ensure appropriate supervision of transactions according to importance.
AEON MALL works with Aeon Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary, general retail operator AEON Retail Co., Ltd.,
as well as other group companies, conducting shopping mall management and operations in various regions. While AEON MALL signs building lease agreements with AEON Retail Co., Ltd., we enter into agreements will transaction terms similar to general agreements of the type in question. Therefore, we recognize that we have secured a certain degree of independence from Aeon Co., Ltd. and group companies.

AEON MALL has established a system to ensure transactions with officers or major shareholders (related- party transactions) do not infringe on the interests of the company or our shareholders.
We carefully investigate in board of director deliberations whether competitive transactions by directors and transactions involving conflicts of interest with directors and AEON MALL infringe on the interests of AEON MALL or our shareholders. Our investigations include consulting with experts regarding the reasonable nature of the transactions in question. We ensure fairness in this process through a number of means, including recusing directors having special interests in transactions with AEON MALL from voting in the resolution.
When we enter into transactions with related parties, we clarify the identity of such parties in our Related Party List according to the provisions of our Rules for Managing Related Party Transactions. We ensure objectivity in transaction terms through rules that include providing comparison tables in period-end financial reports that show examples of transactions with non-related parties. According to the importance and nature of the transaction in question, we comply with our Authority Rules in soliciting opinions from outside directors and members of the
Audit and Supervisory Board during board of director meetings regarding the rationality (business purpose) and reasonable nature of the transaction terms. On an annual basis, we investigate the rationality and reasonableness
of transactions, issuing a report on the annual increase or decrease in transactions with related-party companies.
Compliance Promotion System
The company emphasizes compliance and respect for the AEON Code of Conduct, fostering improving relations with local communities and meeting the company’s social responsibilities. In addition, in order to prevent bribery, we are improving our internal structures within the Group and conducting education based on the Basic Rules for the Prevention of Bribery.
AEON MALL has established a Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the general manager of the Administration Division. The role of this committee is
to ensure group compliance with laws, regulations, our corporate charter, and internal rules. The committee is
also responsible for identifying problems and advancing discussions to resolve said problems. Committee proceedings are reported to the Management Council, and matters of note are elevated to the board of directors.

    Value Creation Story
The company has established a help line (Aeon Mall Hotline) for internal reporting. The company’s labor union has likewise established its own Kumiai 110 help line. Subsidiaries have also established help lines equivalent to the company’s. We ensure privacy protection for users of this help line and that they are not penalized. Additionally, we investigate any problems reported to the company through this help line. If wrongdoing is confirmed, we take necessary actions in line with our internal rules. The issue in question is reported to the Compliance Committee and the company implements Group-wide measures to prevent recurrence in the future.
Initiatives to Prevent Corruption
All executives and employees (“Group Executives and Employees”) agree that the group will not pursue profit through bribery or other fraudulent means under any circumstances.
Although group officers and employees abide by internal rules and regulations established by AEON MALL and each group company, each individual in our group promises to consider, judge, and take action in line with social justice when asked to comply with a demand by public officials or others.
Group executives and employees must not damage our corporate culture by furnishing benefits, paying expenses, making donations, or providing aid for improper purposes. Executives and employees must also refrain from improper behavior that could impede the healthy advancement of any particular country or region. Finally, executives and employees recognize that any such behavior will have an adverse effect on the group’s approach to compliance.
Group officers and employees affirm their strong commitment and dedication to high ideals, approaching anticorruption in a serious and sincere manner.
Toward the implementation of these principles, AEON MALL has established the Basic Rules for the Prevention of Bribery. Officers and employees of the group comply with and follow these rules as a code of conduct.
To instill and enshrine corporate ethics in our company, we provide training to directors and employees at every level of our organization. We also incorporate corporate ethics into the behavior evaluation sections of our goal management system.

Risk Management
Risk Management Promotion System
The company’s president and CEO is the executive officer responsible for risk management under the Group’s rules and other systems for managing risk of loss. The executive director over each business unit is responsible for risk management at the business unit level. This structure provides a system and environment ensuring business continuity and the safety of human life. The group has created Risk Management Rules to prevent crises or minimize damage in the event of a crisis, striving to reduce risk and mitigate any damages.
Specifically, we have selected risk categories
having a high impact on the Group and have established departmental teams to address risk management by category. As each team executes PDCA cycles for risk measures, we strive to prevent damage to our brand value and improve overall corporate value by managing the risk of loss for the Group as a whole.
Furthermore, in the event of an emergency presenting a risk of significant loss, we engage in appropriate information sharing and decision-making according to our Risk Management Rules, taking proper steps to minimize damages.
Establishment of the Risk Management Committee
and Overview of Activities
The company has established the Risk Management Committee, chaired by the HQ general manager. The purpose of this committee is to maintain and improve risk management systems, including determining the status of risk management operation across the Group and reviewing
Risk Management Promotion System Diagram
risk management systems on a continual basis. The details of this committee are as follows. The Risk Management Committee analyzes risk status, conducts ongoing activities to avoid risks, provides opinions to the president and
CEO, and deliberates issues related to risk management promotion systems and measures. The Risk Management Committee discusses risk measures to address major incidents, etc., leading to highly effective risk measures.
Furthermore, for crises that require same-day judgment, e.g., during an earthquake, a separate emergency response office will be established to provide a rapid, appropriate initial response, to prevent escalation, and to aid an early resolution.
Over the most recent three years, the Risk Management Committee held activities approximately
five times each year, with the committee reporting to the board of directors at the beginning of each fiscal year (March) regarding details of initiatives in the previous fiscal year and policy regarding initiatives in the current fiscal year. Domestic and overseas subsidiaries such as OPA Co., Ltd. and companies outside Japan have established Risk Management Committees by country. The details of committee deliberations are shared with the company’s Risk Management Committee.
The members of the company’s Risk Management Committee are as follows.
•Chair: HQ general manager
•Members: A) Heads of supervising departments for risk response
as defined in the Risk Management Rules B) Persons nominated by the chair
•Secretariat: Legal Department
(Note) In order to improve the effectiveness of the risk management system, a responsible member will be selected within the department leading prevention of and response to a given high-impact risk for the Group.

Risk Management Process
To carry out efficient and effective management of various risks, the Risk Management Committee identifies risk items that affect the Group in particular. The committee then makes recommendations to the president and CEO regarding systems for managing said risks. Subsequently, a department to be in charge of handling each risk item is selected. These departments are responsible for planning, executing, and reviewing risk measures, while the Risk Management Committee and internal audits are conducted to monitor the implementation status of the executive body, assessing risk measure effectiveness.
We categorize risks under one of three categories (management strategy risk, compliance risk, other risk) according to the nature of the risk to consider and
Diagram of Risk Management Process
Risk surveys
Identifying Risk
When identifying risks, we narrow risks to those that impact the Group according to their nature. Our identification method is as follows.
Identifying risks
We conduct risk surveys (questionnaires and interviews) with directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members, and employees, assessing risks quantitatively and qualitatively.
Using a risk map to assess risks
Based on the results of risk surveys, we create a risk map based on the frequency and magnitude of damage or impact of
monitor the progress of risk measures at each department related to the risk in question. A director in charge of management strategy risk is designated in accordance with the category. This individual reports the progress
of risk measures to the board of directors on a quarterly basis. Compliance risks are reported at the Compliance Committee, and other risks are reported at the Risk Management Committee, with details and progress of risk measures discussed as necessary. All risk measures for each risk item are eventually aggregated and managed by the Risk Management Committee.
The implementation of risk measures is decided and carried out after internal approval by the respective supervising department for risk response.
each risk. We evaluate risks and identify those risks that require countermeasures.
Establishing priorities using a priority risk measure matrix Based on the status of existing measures for identified risks,
we create a priority risk measure matrix based on the need for
measures, identifying the risks that should be prioritized. Based on the preceding, we have identified 92 risk items and have adopted risk measures according to priority. Risk assessments will change as our business environment changes. Therefore, priority risks measures will be updated as necessary in parallel with risk surveys.

In the Group’s external business environment, certain overseas retail markets exhibit high growth potential due to strong economic development. However, concerns exist related
to accelerated store openings by competing developers
and slowdown in growth due to global economic recession. Japan is experiencing changes in demographics and family structures due to population decline, low birthrates, and an aging population. In addition, there are ongoing changes in consumer behavior, including the expansion of e-commerce, an orientation toward savings, and the rise of the sharing economy.
Major tenants of malls managed and operated by the Group are retail and service companies, which tend to be sensitive to economic and personal consumption trends. Therefore, economic downturns and intensifying competition with other real estate developers and retailers could result in
a negative impact on the Group's business performance or financial position, including a worsening of tenant leasing terms or an increase in vacant spaces.
Measure Urgency High
 Risk Scenarios

 b. Risks related to real estate development and investment
The Group’s business is to provide solutions to issues faced by local communities and society, without being bound to the framework of a commercial facility. We aim to establish shopping malls that serve as a core facility and social infrastructure in their local communities.
Overseas, economic policies continue to develop centered on the development of social infrastructure. Accordingly, we are pursuing property development and opening new locations in areas of advancing urbanization with high market growth potential. We strive to differentiate ourselves from competing developers through competitive malls that leverage our expertise in mall management and operations cultivated in Japan.
In Japan, we secure a market position as the dominant mall in each region, increasing our market share through localization efforts that include revitalizing floor space expansions that meet local needs and expanded regional infrastructure functions. In addition, we expand our business domains by diversifying development patterns according to local characteristics. These patterns include multi- function commercial facilities and innovative regional commercial facilities.
In terms of leasing, we work to create attractive malls from the customer standpoint by attracting new tenants. We provide added value through new business formats, taking advantage of our relationships with tenant companies in Japan and overseas.

Risk Assessment S
Mall development requires significant time and investment
prior to opening. Tasks include market research, site selection, negotiations with landowners, legal proceedings, mall construction, and tenant recruitment. Therefore, recouping investment requires a certain period of time. If the development schedule is delayed due to unseasonable weather, natural disasters, environmental pollution in the development area, delays in obtaining licenses, opposition from local residents,
or other local factors, or if real estate prices rise, the cost of acquiring and renting real estate may increase, potentially having a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
Measure Urgency High
The Group has put in place a system in which each department works together to manage the schedule and progress of future development properties, as well as to identify and analyze possible risk scenarios, formulating plans based on the most appropriate plan in terms of revenue and cost to achieve progress. In addition, for new location openings and floor space expansion revitalization in Japan and overseas, we make decisions after clearly identifying the department responsible for the business plan, and deliberate the appropriateness of the profit and loss plan and the feasibility of the return on investment based on operation under a clear investment profitability standard at meetings of the board of directors and the Management Council.

The Group is pushing forward with the creation of a foundation for the expansion of business bases and the strengthening
of profitability in domestic business and overseas business
in China and ASEAN, which are growth drivers. It will be necessary to secure and develop human resources who can demonstrate strong management skills and leadership from a global perspective.
Particularly in Japan, the working population is decreasing due to declining birthrates and an aging population. If we are unable to secure and train the human resources necessary for business expansion, this may have a negative impact on the Group's business performance or financial position.
Measure Urgency High
In the belief that human resources are the greatest management resource for achieving sustainable growth, the Group seeks to become a company in which diverse human resources can enjoy healthy lives as they continue to demonstrate their talents. We pursue a growth strategy by investing in human resources to this end.
We promote diversity management to respond to rapid social changes and innovate our business model. We are developing systems and work environments by which a diverse base of employees can express their individuality, demonstrate their capabilities, and play active roles.
We have established a wide range of programs for the cultivation and education of our human resources. In addition to employee training based on position and level of growth, we offer personnel exchanges between Japanese and overseas locations to cultivate future leaders in our overseas business. We have also created the AEON Business School (ABS), a program for cultivating future top managers.
We provide senior manager training and other opportunities for directors and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board to cultivate stronger leadership and strategic business thinking, as well as to gain a stronger understanding of compliance and governance. To ensure transparency and fairness in cultivating candidates for management, we also discuss the necessary standards, career plans, cultivation policies, and plans for managers at the Nomination and Compensation Committee, which consists of outside directors primarily.
 Risk Scenarios
 Measures
   d. Risks related to transactions with AEON Co., Ltd. and its affiliates (hereinafter, “AEON Group companies”)
Risk Scenarios
The role of anchor tenants with the ability to attract customers is extremely important in developing malls. We leverage our close relationship with our parent company AEON Co., Ltd. to arrange for AEON and AEON STYLE general merchandise stores, primarily operated by our subsidiary AEON Retail Co., Ltd., to serve as anchor tenants. Going forward, we anticipate that malls developed by the Group will continue to have AEON and AEON STYLE stores serve as anchor tenants.
In this way, the relationship between the Group and AEON Co., Ltd. and AEON Group companies provides advantages in mall development in the form of a stable source of anchor tenants. On the other hand, the business performance, store opening policies, and store closure policies of these anchor tenants may have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
AEON Retail Co., Ltd. accounted for 11.7% of the Group’s operating revenue for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, while the total of AEON Group companies other than AEON Retail Co. amounted to 10.9% of total operating revenue.
e. Risks related to statutory regulation
Risk Scenarios
The Group coordinates initiatives with local municipalities to develop malls firmly rooted in local communities. However, owing to the City Planning Act and the Building Standards Act, construction of large retail facilities exceeding 10,000m2 are in principle not possible except in those areas designated as commercial zones, neighboring commercial zones, or semi-industrial zones as designated by the aforementioned acts. Furthermore, to develop large shopping centers in un-zoned city planning areas or un-zoned areas within semi-approved city planning projects, either a zoning designation or an approval to relax site purpose requirements is needed from the relevant prefectural governor. Therefore, there is the potential that the company’s future plans for new malls could be affected by these legal restrictions.
In the event of a revision of real estate-related tax policies, higher costs associated with ownership, purchase, and sale of assets could have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
Since the Group is expanding its overseas business in China and ASEAN, changes in statutory regulations regarding investment, trade, competition, taxes, foreign exchange, and other topics in countries and regions where new locations are opened could have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.

f. Impairment risks
Risk Assessment S
In the event of ongoing operating losses at malls due to significant worsening of the business environment, increasing vacancies due to tenant closures, etc., or due to a significant drop in market price of mall sites, the resulting impairment losses for fixed assets held by the Group for business purposes could have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance, financial position, or creditworthiness.
Measure Urgency High
The Group formulates plans reflecting optimized costs and revenues after determining and analyzing possible risk scenarios. For investment projects over a certain amount, we also deliberate the appropriateness of the profit and loss plan and the feasibility of the return on investment at meetings of the board of directors and the Management Council. In this way, we strive to improve the accuracy of investment profitability plans.
We verify the operating status of malls that have been opened at company-wide meetings. The results of investment profitability verifications for malls that have been open for a certain period of time are reported to the board of directors. For malls facing possible impairment loss, we form a response project team (value-building project team) to take action, primarily to improve profitability as we strive to reduce the risk of impairment.

The Group procures capital to support mall development based on the Group’s growth strategy, primarily via borrowings from financial institutions, the issuance of corporate bonds, leases, or capital increases. However, instances may occur
in which a destabilization in financial market conditions, worsening in the Group’s business outlook, or deterioration
in the Group’s creditworthiness, etc., may result in the Group being unable to procure funding in a timely manner under desirable terms. In the event of an increase in market interest rates, the increased cost of capital for financing or refinancing mall development and higher rents paid to property owners under lease contracts could have a negative impact on the Group's business performance or financial position.
In addition, the Group is expanding its overseas business
in China and ASEAN, regions driving future growth. This expansion is leading to an increasing volume of foreign currency-denominated transactions in areas like materials procurement for overseas development properties. These transactions are affected by exchange rate fluctuations,
which may have a negative impact on the Group's business performance or financial position.
Operational Risks
Measure Urgency High
In principle, the Group procures capital at fixed interest rates and hedges exchange rate fluctuation risk in part by currency swaps. While we diversify the methods and sources of our capital procurement (borrowings), we make efforts to maintain and improve credit ratings by controlling our balance of interest-bearing debt, etc., to ensure needed financing facility. Furthermore, we have established commitment lines enabling immediate procurement of necessary working capital even during dramatic changes in the financing environment.

Since the Group conducts business both in Japan and overseas, the malls we manage and operate may suffer damage (including damage to reputation), destruction by
fire, deterioration, or other serious harm as a result of events occurring in the respective mall's country or region. These incidents include natural disasters such as large-scale earthquakes, typhoons, and torrential rains, as well as human accidents such as fire and power outages, and even acts of violence or terrorism that endanger human life. Such events could force a suspension of business, having a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
Measure Urgency High
The Group has established and is working to strengthen our risk response systems to minimize harm caused in the event of emergencies. We have established and communicated our crisis management administration rules and Risk Management Rules that address natural disasters, epidemics, accidents, etc. Furthermore, we conduct disaster prevention drills simulating large-scale earthquakes and terrorist attacks.
Measures taken to protect buildings and facilities include seismic retrofitting and fire protection soffit slabs to mitigate harm in the event of a large-scale earthquake. We also install plate water stops in malls at risk of flood damage.
The Group subscribes to fire insurance at all malls we operate, as well as profit insurance to cover lost rent and other expenses in the event of a fire, flood, or other large-scale disaster. The Group subscribes to earthquake insurance jointly with the AEON Group, striving to manage risks associated with earthquakes in an appropriate manner.

Particularly when developing business overseas, the Group pursues business in partnership with local governments, local companies, and other business partners. We strive to collect information through close communication with these parties.
We work to build a system by which we engage in appropriate responses, even in the event of an emergency. This system includes measures such as preparing various rules and manuals, e.g., the Risk Management Rules and emergency response manuals, conducting training based on business continuity plans (BCP) in each country, and educating employees on crisis management.

The Group is engaged in the mall business both in Japan
and overseas. In the event of an outbreak of a large-scale
and severe infectious disease in countries and regions where the Group operates malls, national or municipal government lockdown orders, requests to restrict activities, or other actions could limit customer movement outside their homes. Such developments could lead to changes in customer values and consumption behavior. In the event that the malls managed and operated by the Group are forced to close temporarily, to shorten business hours, or to change plans for mall openings, this may have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused a slowdown in
the global economy and changed customer lifestyles. As it is difficult to predict when the pandemic will subside, we expect uncertainty to remain as to the future business environment.
Measure Urgency High
Based on the AEON COVID-19 Prevention Protocol, a standard for quarantine measures established by AEON to protect the health and livelihoods of tenants and Company employees, the Group continues to establish improved mall environments and operations in the interest of infection prevention measures. We view this as an opportunity to reinvent our business models and create malls that
offer new concepts and service functions in the era of the new normal and in response to changing customer values and consumption behavior. We strive to create malls that respond to social change in Japan and overseas.
We are also working to prevent the spread of infection through rigorous health management, including temperature checks, and we encourage telecommuting, so employees work in good health and safety. We pursue work efficiency through videoconferencing systems and improved remote work environments. We are also moving forward with initiatives toward work-style reforms.

 The importance of the Group’s information systems within our overall business operations has increased dramatically. In the event of a large-scale natural disaster or similar occurrence, data centers could be damaged and information system operations could be interrupted.
If the personal information of our customers or employees, confidential business information, or other information is leaked or altered as a result of cyberattacks or other unforeseen circumstances, the Group’s social credibility may be damaged, and the Group may become responsible for paying significant compensation for damages. Such events could have a negative impact on the Group’s business performance or financial position.
To address the risk of information system outages, we have backup data centers in standby operation at remote locations in addition to data centers in primary operation. By establishing a system allowing recovery, even in the event of failure at the primary data center, we have further strengthened our current business continuity plan (BCP), striving to minimize the impact of large-scale natural disasters on Group businesses.
With respect to risks such as information leakage and alteration, we have implemented a number of measures against cyberattacks. These measures include antivirus software on work computers, logging tools for network communications, and limitations on the use of external recording media in work computers. We have also implemented a variety of measures in our operations. These measures include the latest security patches to applications and other software used, information security education programs for employees, and regular information system security checks.

FY2020 Highlights
During FY2020, due to the global spread of COVID-19, we reduced mall operating hours or closed malls temporarily in China, ASEAN, and Japan in response to government requests, as well as our own considerations in preventing the spread of infection. As a result, operating revenue amounted to ¥280,688 million (-13.4% year on year). Operating income amounted to ¥34,394 million (-43.4%), and net loss attributable to owners of parent amounted to ¥1,864 million (compared to net income of ¥34,239 million in the previous fiscal year). Fixed costs for the fiscal year amounted to ¥16,572 million stemming from temporary closures and other factors. We posted these costs as extraordinary losses due to COVID-19.
on May 13. By May 28, all of our facilities were open
for business. Upon reopening, we installed AI-based thermometers at building entrances and implemented measures to prevent droplet infections in our sales areas and back rooms, including acrylic panels. We also adopted entry restriction standards based on in-store customer management system data. We continue in our efforts
to prevent infection and offer safety and security to our customers, which includes increased internal air circulation in malls through the intake of outside fresh air.
Our Overseas Business recorded ¥43,594 million
in operating revenue, a decrease of 11.3% year on year. Operating income amounted to ¥3,771 million, down 54.6%. Consumption in China and ASEAN declined temporarily due to the spread of COVID-19. Although there were degrees of difference in recovery among countries and areas in which we operate malls, activity has generally improved overseas since we resumed operations, and we aim to continue delivering high growth in these regions.
Our China Business recorded operating revenue of ¥31,353 million, a decrease of 12.5% year on year, while operating income amounted to ¥2,296 million, down 59.1%. In conjunction with the January 24 quarantine of Wuhan City due to the spread of COVID-19, tenants in our three malls
in the city instituted temporary closures beginning in mid- February 2020, and as many as 11 of our 21 malls in China closed temporarily due to the spread of COVID-19 across the country. Beginning February 22, 2020, through March, we resumed operations in stages, having reopened all 21 malls for specialty store business by April 1, 2020. On July 20, we began reopening movie theaters, which had been closed due to government orders. By early August, theaters were once again open at all malls.
Our ASEAN Business recorded operating revenue of ¥12,241 million, a decrease of 7.9% year on year. Operating income amounted to ¥1,474 million, down 45.1%. We closed specialty store operations at four malls temporarily
in Vietnam beginning March 28, 2020, due to government regulations associated with COVID-19. In April 24, 2020, we resumed operations, with all five malls in Vietnam opened. Although customer traffic and sales dropped temporarily due to the spread of COVID-19 in late July, traffic returned quickly due to the strict virus containment measures in the country. Specialty store sales performance for the existing four malls in Vietnam recovered and increased 1.4% year-on-year for the stand-alone fourth quarter. In Cambodia, we shortened mall operating hours at our two existing malls due to COVID-19 for a time until returning to normal in June. In August, we

of emergency in Japan on April 7, 2020, we temporarily suspended the management and operations of AEON MALL specialty stores and urban shopping centers from April 8, 2020 and closed all 164 malls across Japan on April 18, 2020. Subsequently, Japan phased out its state of emergency and we began reopening our businesses

reopened mall movie theaters. Although COVID-19 had a minimal impact on operations, many foreign nationals living
in Cambodia returned to their home countries, which limited specialty store sales performance for the consolidated fiscal year to 75.1% of the prior fiscal year at our existing two malls.
In Indonesia, on June 15, we reopened specialty store operations for two existing malls that had been closed temporarily since March 31, 2020, due to large-scale government social restrictions associated with the spread
of COVID-19. However, with the increase of COVID-19 patients continuing to grow in Indonesia, conditions were challenging, and customer traffic declined 50% like-for-like at our two existing malls. Here, we introduced food delivery discount promotions in collaboration with local companies and engaged in other measures to secure sales at our malls.
Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets
Total assets amounted to ¥1,394,199 million, up ¥12,981 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. This increase was mainly due to an increase of ¥73,159 million in cash and deposits, mainly as a result of a decrease of ¥63,400 million yen in deposits paid to affiliates, and ¥79,212 million in advanced purchases
for activating existing malls and acquisition of land for development. These increases were offset in part by depreciation and amortization of ¥58,586 million.
Total liabilities stood at ¥1,006,712 million, up ¥30,017 million from the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result was mainly due to an increase of ¥45,000 million in bonds (including current portion) and an increase in
lease obligations of ¥11,254 million. These increases were offset in part by decreases of ¥12,671 million in long-term debt (including current portion), ¥5,203 million in deposits received from specialty stores, and ¥3,490 million in accounts payable-other (related to facilities).
Net assets totaled ¥387,486 million, down ¥17,035 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result was mainly due to a decrease in retained earnings of ¥1,864 million in net loss attributable to owners of parent, a decrease in retained earnings of ¥9,100 million due to dividend payments, and a decrease of ¥6,036 million in foreign currency translation adjustments.

Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents (“Cash”) as of the current consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥124,080 million, up ¥9,711 million compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year. The following text describes cash flows for the period under review:
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥61,621 million, compared to cash flows of ¥133,645 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result
was mainly due to income before income taxes and other adjustments of ¥4,268 million (¥54,019 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year) and depreciation and amortization of ¥58,586 million (¥56,858 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year). These amounts were offset in part by decreases in income taxes paid in the amount of ¥11,528 million (¥15,701 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year) and deposits received from specialty stores in the amount of ¥5,184 million (increase of ¥23,074 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year).
Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to ¥12,244 million, compared to net cash provided of ¥22,808 million in the year-ago period. This result was mainly due to proceeds from issuance of bonds in the amount of ¥60,000 million (¥80,000 million in the prior consolidated fiscal
year) and proceeds from long-term debt of ¥23,734 million (¥85,000 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year). During the same period, the company made cash outlays for repayments of long-term debt of ¥35,774 million (¥24,015 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year), ¥15,000 million in redemptions of corporate bonds (¥15,000 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year), and payments of dividends in the amount of ¥9,100 million (¥8,872 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year).
Net cash used in investing activities amounted to ¥64,444 million, compared to ¥95,783 million in the prior consolidated fiscal year. This result was mainly due to purchases of property, plant and equipment in the amount of ¥57,535 million (¥97,192 million in prior consolidated fiscal year) for equipment at malls expanded in the prior consolidated fiscal year (AEON MALL Takaoka) and newly opened in the prior consolidated fiscal year (AEON Fujiidera Shopping Center).
Outlook for FY2021
In FY2021, based on the AEON COVID-19 Prevention Protocol, a standard for quarantine measures established by AEON to protect the health and livelihoods of customers and employees, we will continue to establish improved mall environments and operations that offer thorough infection prevention measures. We view this as an opportunity to reinvent our business models and create malls that offer new concepts and service functions in the era of the
new normal. We will strive to create malls that respond
to social change in Japan and overseas. Through these efforts, we will continue to provide solutions to regional
and social issues, establishing our position through social infrastructure functions to be a central facility for the local community.
We plan to open two new malls overseas in FY2021, one in China and one in Indonesia. Our overseas business has entered a stage of expanding profits as a growth driver for the company, and we will proceed in securing a pipeline to accelerate the opening of new malls in the future. At
the same time, we are moving forward with renovations
for new tenants, floor space expansions, and initiatives
to improve our operations at existing malls. AEON MALL plans to open four new malls in Japan, as well as expand the floor space of two existing malls. We intend to grow earnings by pursuing aggressive floor space expansion and renovation, while opening new malls that take advantage of the characteristics of the locations where they are situated.

   Policy on Dividends
AEON MALL recognizes that returning profits to shareholders through improving earnings power is a
key management priority. Our basic policy on income distribution emphasizes steady dividend payments to shareholders, while using internal reserves to invest in structural business improvements, including investments in growth businesses, new businesses, and other areas that strengthen our operating foundation. We issue dividends twice annually, in the interim and at the end of the fiscal year, according to the provisions of Article 459, Para- graph 1 of the Companies Act. The Company’s articles of incorporation state that dividends paid from surplus are to be determined by resolution of the board of directors.
At a meeting held on April 8, 2021, our board of directors resolved to pay year-end dividends of ¥20 per share, in line with our initial plan. In combination with an interim dividend of ¥20 per share, our annual dividend for the fiscal year amounted to ¥40 per share.
Our policy is to aim for long-term and continuous dividend increases in line with the growth stage of our
company. At a meeting held on April 8, 2021, our board of directors resolved to increase the consolidated payout ratio from 25% to 30% or more.
For the next fiscal year, we plan to pay an annual dividend of ¥50 per share (an increase of ¥10 per share).

In April 2019, Dai-ichi Life established the Alternative Investment Department and the Corporate and Structured Finance Department. We are bolstering our investments in alternative and real assets for diversification to secure stable earnings.
We will take a more proactive approach toward investing in hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture funds in terms of alternative assets and in project finance and real estate in terms of real assets.

Developing Global Human Capital and Accelerating Group Synergies
Promoting the Achievements of Female Employees
Creating a Workplace Environment and Developing Human Capital to Allow Employees to Achieve their Full Potential
The Group promotes initiatives based on three main themes, which are “transforming awareness and culture,” “enhancing skill development,” and “promoting work-life management.” The Group makes particular efforts to develop next-generation female leaders and strives to transform the awareness of female management candidates through directly involving executives in development and providing female role models who are in senior positions. Going forward, we have established a target to increase the percentage of female employees in managerial positions to “more than 25% of all managerial positions during the term of the medium-term management plan” and to “30% by the 2020s,” and we will continue to promote development and establishment of female leaders.

Long-Standing Experience and Skills as Company Assets
The Group has created systems targeting employees after retirement age to allow motivated and capable human capital with experience and skills developed over many years to actively contribute. As part of our career support system for middle-aged and older employees and assistance with post- retirement re-employment, the Group has also established a support program (Master Challenge Program) to enhance experience and skills prior to retirement age leading to smooth re-employment following retirement.
Improving Employees’ Quality of Life
Promoting Work-Life Management
     The Group has strengthened the development of global human capital with various initiatives, including capacity development through the Global Human Capital Development Programs and the intake of foreign students to secure and develop highly competitive human capital from a global perspective. In addition, we regularly hold conferences and training where overseas Group companies come together to engage in level- and function-specific networking and share best practices with the aim to create Group-wide synergies.

The Dai-ichi Life Group considers climate change to be an important social issue and has been working to reduce CO2 emissions. We have set a CO2 emissions reduction target for the entire group (1% reduction compared with the previous year). In order to enhance the reliability of its CO2 emissions performance data, We have received third-party assurance review from the Japan Quality Assurance Organization for Scope 1 (direct emissions from use of gas fuel), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from use of electricity) and Scope 3 (indirect emissions from other business activities) emissions, produced in fiscal 2017.
In addition, The Dai-ichi Life Group will deepen the analysis of the risks and opportunities that impact our life insurance business and asset management business. They include the impact on life and health as a result of natural disasters and infectious diseases caused by climate change as well as the impact on investment and loans due to policy changes accompanying the transition to a low-carbon society.

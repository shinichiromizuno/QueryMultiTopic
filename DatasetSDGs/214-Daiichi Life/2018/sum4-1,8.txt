In anticipation of the completion of post-merger integration, Asset Management One and Janus Henderson, which were launched through their respective management integrations, will shift to the stage of achieving synergies from this integration and aim for profit growth going forward.
In May 2018, the Company completed the conversion of Janus Henderson into an affiliated company, and going forward we will continue to benefit from the high profit growth at both Asset Management One and Janus Henderson, and the two companies will expand their profit contribution to the Group.
We will also work to strengthen collaboration between the companies, including the mutual use of investment products and sales channels, the expansion of cross-selling of mutual funds, and the commencement of co-development of investment products. In addition, we will increase the provision of competitive asset management capabilities and solutions to Group life insurance companies in Japan and overseas, as we continue further accelerating initiatives aimed at Group synergies.

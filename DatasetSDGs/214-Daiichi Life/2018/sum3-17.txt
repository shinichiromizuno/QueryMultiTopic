The domestic low-interest-rate environment is expected to continue for some time. In order to obtain stable profitability even in such an environment, we will accelerate the initiatives featured in our strategy in the market. We will also aim to enhance soundness by controlling risk through such means as using derivatives and other instruments to control duration, using AI to upgrade our systems for monitoring indications of market fluctuations, and building hedge positions against a hike in interest rates.
In addition, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our stewardship activities and seek to deepen responsible investment with sophisticated ESG investment that contributes to ensuring profitability and resolving social issues.
Through these initiatives, we will continue to meet the expectations of stakeholders by ensuring stable earnings power and soundness while we contribute to resolving social issues.

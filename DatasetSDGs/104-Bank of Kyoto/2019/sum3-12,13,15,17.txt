Becoming an Environmentally Friendly Bank
Environmental Policy (Basic Philosophy)
With our headquarters in Kyoto, which boasts more than 1,200 years of history, and operating widely in the Kinki region, a place of magnificent natural environment and precious history and culture, the Bank of Kyoto strives to achieve sustainable development together with the community in which we operate.

Passing on the rich natural environment, culture, and history of this region to the next generation is our social mission. We therefore recognize environmental issues as a management priority, and all officers and employees are actively engaging in environmental preservation.

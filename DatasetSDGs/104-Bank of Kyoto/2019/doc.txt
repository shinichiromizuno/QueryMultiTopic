History
The Bank of Kyoto was established in 1941 as Tanwa Bank (Head Office: Fukuchiyama City) through the merger of four banks in northern Kyoto: Ryotan Bank, Miyazu Bank, Tango Commercial Bank, and Tango Industrial Bank. In 1951 the Bank changed its name to the Bank of Kyoto, moving its Head Office to Kyoto City in 1953. Since its foundation, the Bank has stayed close to its regional customers, following the management principle of “Serving the Prosperity of the Community.”

Against this background, the Bank provided financial support for small and medium-sized companies throughout Kyoto Prefecture, including inside Kyoto City, and consolidated its position as a locally headquartered bank.
Around this time, a number of venture companies appeared in Kyoto that would later grow into major companies. The Bank willingly provided them with financial support through loans and investments. This multitude of companies became the Bank’s important customer base while their shares that the Bank invested in and held became excellent assets forming a financial base that supported its wide area strategy later on.

  02 Growth as a Wide-Area Regional Bank
After the collapse of Japan’s bubble economy, the banking industry underwent a major reorganization which also affected regional financial institutions throughout Japan. The Bank of Kyoto moved quickly to isolate non-performing loans, backed by a robust financial position, and proceeded to expand into Shiga Prefecture with the opening of Kusatsu Branch in 2000, followed by expansion into Nara and Hyogo
Prefectures in addition to an existing expansion in Osaka Prefecture. In this way, the Bank proceeded with its expansion strategy of reinforcing the branch network over a wide area. To enhance its human capital in support of this strategy, the Bank focused on developing human resources. This included establishing Kyoto Banking College as in-house school, and a new training facility with advanced functions, called the “Kyoto Banking College Katsuragawa Campus.” As a result of these growth strategies, the Bank steadily continued its quantitative expansion, and succeeded in increasing its earnings and strengthening its management base.

 Message from the President
 Challenging the Status Quo of Regional Banks—Lessons from the Heisei Era
Looking back on Japan’s Heisei era from the perspective of finance, two major financial events can be seen to have affected the entire economy and led to a subsequent economic downturn. The first is the problem of nonperforming loans, which sparked the collapse of Japan’s bubble economy and the major reorganization of city banks and so forth. The second is the global financial crisis of 2008 that started in the United States. In both cases, financial collapses had a huge impact that extended to regional industries and economies. However, these two events served as a lesson of the Heisei era that made us reconfirm the role that finance should play in “staying close to industry and the community, and contributing to their development.”
Over this time, new services spread throughout the world, enabled by technological innovation such as the rise of the internet. As we benefitted from these services, they made our lives much more convenient and changed our consumption behavior. On the other hand, in Japan a raft of different issues have emerged against a backdrop of structural change with the population simultaneously declining and growing older. These include revitalizing industries that will drive regional economies, measures for aging social infrastructure built during Japan’s high-growth period, and building regional healthcare systems to support the lives of residents. Taking the necessary measures from various angles to revitalize regional economies and build sustainable cities has become an urgent task.
These dramatic changes in people’s lifestyles and the environment for regional economies alone will make the Reiwa era a time for further challenging the status quo of regional banks. We need to use the
diverse issues facing each of our individual and corporate customers as starting points, taking steps to provide financial services that help to solve them. We also need to focus on issues at the region-wide level and work in partnership with governments and others towards solutions. I believe it is by facing these changes in the times, continuing to meet the expectations of the region, and putting the lessons of the Heisei era into action that we will be able to continue serving our customers as their preferred bank in the new era as well.
Looking Back on the History of the Bank
In the Bank’s history, we see that during the post-war recovery period, small and medium-sized companies in Kyoto City suffered from chronic financial stress, and the financial environment inevitably imposed constraints on growth. Concerned about this state of affairs, various sectors of Kyoto City requested the Bank to relocate its headquarters from Fukuchiyama City in the northern part of Kyoto Prefecture to inside Kyoto City. After relocating in response to this request, the Bank strove to facilitate financing for all manner of small and medium-sized companies located in every part of Kyoto Prefecture, including Kyoto City. In doing so, it has developed a strong presence as a locally headquartered bank.
Right about this time, a host of venture companies appeared in Kyoto, producing high-quality products with advanced technology development capabilities and unique management styles. The Bank provided willing, continuous financial support for these companies through loans and investments, and many of them went on to represent Japan as global companies. As Kyoto developed a reputation as a city of venture companies, the Bank built relationships with these ventures from their founding days, and grew together with
4 The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. Annual Report 2019
 
  them along their journeys. This history is an immense source of pride for the Bank whose management principle is “Serving the Prosperity of the Community.”
Furthermore, the numerous shares that the Bank has invested in in the past and continued to hold have become exceptionally good assets over the years, even for a regional bank, and now provide dividend income that supports earnings and are a source of strong financial base. Through this history, the Bank has been able to accumulate the strength to continue stable management even if risk events such as economic downturns occur. Our intention is to continue to maintain and increase our financial soundness so that customers can continue to use our services with confidence over the long term.
Finance in Step with Local Industry All the Way
Initiatives to realize a sustainable society are becoming more important as a common theme for the nation. Producing firms that will drive the regional economy in the future has become the expectation of every region, with public and private entities teaming up to address the issue.
The Bank provides a range of support for ambitious entrepreneurs with great ideas, forming a pathway through a series of processes from preparing for the foundation of a company to commercializing an idea. We also offer support through various kinds of consulting for CEOs who are aiming for further business growth, such as business matching to expand sales channels, M&A and so forth, to expand the business. In particular, we are passionate in our efforts to support company foundation among venture firms, given that this field is deeply related to the Bank’s historical growth journey. We have also invested in several funds, and set up our own original fund. We aim to actively continue investing, targeting a total investment of around ¥5 billion over 10 years.
Furthermore, the closure of businesses as business owners age has become a social issue facing regional economies, and is drawing more attention. The Bank has been training specialist staff in divisions concerned with business succession and is focusing on financial services aligned to business owners that involve working together to find solutions to their concerns.
This industrial promotion will not produce overnight results. However, the Bank will follow the management principle it has adhered to since its foundation and concentrate its efforts towards achieving sustainable development of the region.
Taking Steps to Provide Financial Services to Meet the Needs of Today
Outside of industry promotion, there are various initiatives that regional banks are required to approach. These include consulting services in fields of great interest to individual customers, such as savings, asset formation, and asset succession. In an age where people are expected to live to 100 and leave many cases of inheritance, this kind of consulting service is becoming more important.
The Bank started operations of Kyogin Securities Co., Ltd. in 2017 and entered the trust services business itself last year. With this structure, we can provide customers with banking, securities, and trust services all at their local branch. It represents a major step forward for us as a comprehensive financial service provider. For our customers, we hope to be able to provide detailed consultations of various kinds according to their life stages at their usual banking branch.
Meanwhile, as digital technology continues to advance with surprising speed, a growing number of customers want to do bank transactions using smartphones and so forth. To meet their needs, we have launched the “Kyogin App,” which enables customers to open accounts without visiting a branch and check their balances and transaction records at any time of day. We are now working to expand the functionality of the app. Moreover, with regard to the drive towards a cashless society being promoted by the government, we are actively taking measures with a view to providing value to customers who prefer to avoid cash payments due to hassle and so forth. We are working to introduce new services, including the start of a partnership with bank-affiliated digital currency platform, “J-Coin Pay.”
Through these activities, the Bank of Kyoto Group will continue striving to provide new financial services to meet the needs of today.
As the times change, so do customers’ needs for financial services, and their expectations of regional banks.
The Bank of Kyoto Group will always pay attention to feedback from customers and strives to transform itself so that it can provide services in line with customers’ demands.
In an era that is challenging the status quo for regional banks, we aim to steadfastly carry out our mission and role, meeting the expectations of a wide range of stakeholders while working to sustainably increase our corporate value.
I would like to thank you for your continued support and kind consideration.

 Financial Review (Consolidated)
Financial and Economic Environment
During the fiscal year under review, the Japanese economy followed a moderate expansion trend overall, despite lacking strength due in part to a temporary impact from natural disasters. In this period, the corporate sector saw a marked weakness in export and production activity from around the end of the calendar year, partly due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy, although capital investment remained firm. On the other hand, consumer spending remained firm, supported by improvement in employment and income conditions, while spending by overseas tourists also trended strongly with growth in the number of visitors to Japan. Toward the end of the fiscal year, while concern grew over the slowdown in the global economy caused by trade friction between the U.S. and China, the year ended amid a growing sense of expectation for the new era.

Consolidated ordinary income amounted to ¥133,539 million, an increase of ¥23,307 million year on year.

As a result, the total of deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit increased by ¥231.3 billion to ¥8,030.4 billion at year- end, breaking through the ¥8 trillion level.

  Building Strong Financial Structures
Capital Ratio
The Bank’s capital ratio (based on domestic standards) came to 11.18% on a non-consolidated basis and 11.58% on a consolidated basis.
In both cases, the Bank’s capital ratio exceeds the 4% level of soundness stipulated in laws and regulations.
We will continue to increase the soundness of our operations by working to raise our capital ratio.
Disclosed Assets Based on
the Financial Reconstruction Law
Disclosure of Asset Assessment Based on the Financial Reconstruction Law
The Financial Reconstruction Law requires disclosure of self- assessed loan assets and similar assets to be classified into four categories: unrecoverable or valueless, risk, special attention, and normal.
At the end of fiscal 2018, the Bank’s total disclosed assets, excluding normal assets, amounted to ¥75.0 billion (US$675 million) as we achieved further progress toward enhancing the soundness of our loan portfolio. The average reserve ratio for these assets, excluding the portion covered by collateral and guarantees, was 47.8%. When adding the portion secured by collateral and guarantees to the reserves, the coverage ratio was 84.5%, which we consider to be a sufficient level.

Borrower Classifications
The Bank recognizes that maintaining a sound asset portfolio is its most crucial management objective. Accordingly, we carry out a semiannual self-assessment of assets to accurately monitor the state of our asset quality, and take an active stance toward the disposal of non-performing loans.
To facilitate these efforts, we have finished compiling a set of regulations covering self-assessment of assets, write-offs, and allowances, and we are disposing of all currently anticipated non- performing loans.
Specifically, we classify borrowers using the following six categories based on a judgment of their ability to repay their loans derived from their financial circumstances, financing, profitability, and other factors: borrowers in good standing, borrowers requiring vigilance, borrowers requiring management, borrowers in danger of bankruptcy, borrowers in de facto bankruptcy, and borrowers in legal bankruptcy. These categories are known as borrower categories.

Risk Management Loans under the Banking Law
 Financial Reconstruction Law Standard (Non-Consolidated)
The Banking Law in Japan mandates that banks disclose their risk management loans both on a consolidated and non-consolidated basis. These loans are classified into four categories: loans in legal bankruptcy, nonaccrual loans, accruing loans contractually past due three months or more, and restructured loans. It should be noted, however, that not all of the disclosed loans will incur losses, since these figures include loans that are recoverable by disposing of collateral or redeeming guarantees.

  Corporate Governance
The Bank of Kyoto is working to ensure that its corporate governance structure is founded on sound, transparent management practices by monitoring directors’ execution of business through surveillance by the Board of Directors and auditors and through the use of an auditing system.
The Bank has built a structure for quick management decision making, under which decision-making authority is delegated appropriately, with the Board of Directors acting as the highest ranking decision-making body. Moreover, the Bank is strengthening its auditing functions through internal audits based on risk analysis and through external auditing of its financial statements and internal management system.
To ensure the soundness and propriety of operations, based on sound business management (governance), we have established a set of Business Management (Governance) Regulations, to better position us to offer financial intermediary services, comply with laws and regulations, rigorously protect customer privacy, and duly manage all kinds of risk. The Business Management (Governance) Regulations have the role of bringing together our stances on the finance facilitation management system, legal compliance system, customer protection management system and internal management system.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors comprises nine directors (among whom two are outside directors) and has decision-making responsibility for basic policies and important matters related to the execution of the Bank’s business. Members of the Board of Directors also engage in reciprocal surveillance and monitoring.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is a structure designed to facilitate streamlined decision-making by representative directors and executive directors, who have been delegated decision-making authority by the Board of Directors, on important matters related to daily bank operations.
Audit & Supervisory Board
The Audit & Supervisory Board consists of four auditors, including two external auditors. Appropriate auditing is implemented in accordance with auditing policies and plans approved by the Audit & Supervisory Board.
Election of Corporate Officers and Terms of Office
Directors and auditors are elected at the General Meeting of Shareholders after deliberations by the Nomination and Compensation Committee, which is an advisory organization used at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and after being approved as candidates by resolution of the Board of Directors or approved by the Audit & Supervisory Board, respectively.
To further invigorate the Board of Directors and to flexibly build an optimal management structure capable of responding effectively to changes in the business environment, the term of office for directors is one year.
The Bank has adopted an audit & supervisory board member system in which at least half of the audit & supervisory board members are external audit & supervisory board members who have no potential conflicts of interests with general shareholders. Audit & supervisory board members attend meetings of the Board of Directors; standing audit & supervisory board members also attend meetings of the Executive Committee. Audit & supervisory board members attend these meetings to monitor decision-making processes and the execution of bank business. Internal bank rules have clearly provided that the audit & supervisory board members/Audit & Supervisory Board establish and maintain an audit environment that ensures objectivity and independence in management audits. Accordingly the current structure supports a strict audit control function.
Adoption of Employee Stock Options (ESO) System
The Bank has introduced an ESO (employee stock options) system for directors to reward themselves more concretely for their contribution to improving business performance and raising the enterprise value of the Bank. We believe this system will make the Bank’s management more strongly focused on shareholder value.
      Stance on Internal Control Systems
 1. Structures to ensure that the execution of business by the directors and employees of the Bank and its subsidiaries, conforms to laws and the articles of incorporation of the Bank of Kyoto
2. Structures related to the storage and management of information about the execution of business by the Bank’s directors
3. Guidelines and other structures related to managing the risk of losses of the Bank and its subsidiaries
4. Structures to ensure that the directors of the Bank and its subsidiaries execute business efficiently
5. Structures to ensure the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Bank and its subsidiaries
6. Structures to ensure the appropriateness of operations in the corporate group comprised of the Bank and its subsidiaries, and structures for reporting to the Bank on the business execution of the directors of the Bank’s subsidiaries
7. Structures related to employees who are appointed by request from the Bank’s auditors to assist them with their business
8. Matters related to the independence from the directors of employees assisting the business of the Bank’s auditors and to the effectiveness of auditors’ instructions to said employees
9. Structures for reporting to the Bank’s auditors by directors and employees of the Bank, directors or employees of the Bank’s subsidiaries, or those who receive the reports from these people, as well as other structures related to reporting to auditors, and structures to ensure that those making reports are not subject to adverse treatment by reason of what they reported
10. Matters related to policies on processing prepayments or refunds of expenses incurred concerning the business execution of the Bank’s auditors, or policies on processing expenses or debt incurred for the execution of other businesses
11. Other structures to ensure effective auditing by the Bank’s auditors

   Compliance Structures
Given the public nature of banks, compliance will always be the cornerstone of management.
The Bank considers compliance to be one of its most important management issues and has been working to rigorously enhance its compliance structures to ensure that the actions of management and non-management employees alike will earn the trust and support of observers. This will enable us to build solid bonds of trust with the local community, and to maintain our reputation as a reliable bank that provides excellent customer satisfaction over the long term. For these purposes, we have worked hard to strengthen our compliance systems. For example, the Compliance Committee (chaired by an executive director responsible for oversight of banking operations and who
acts as an assistant to the president) centrally manages and responds to compliance-related problems.
In order to ensure compliance, the Board of Directors establishes compliance programs every fiscal year, and enforces a variety of policies in accordance with these programs.
In light of international requests for Anti-Money Laundering/ Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) in recent years, the Bank believes responding to these requests is a critical management issue, and has taken steps to enhance related measures by setting up the Anti-Money Laundering Office within the Risk Management Division. The Bank also makes every effort to block relationships with anti-social forces through a framework developed based on its Basic Stance on Anti-Social Forces.

  Risk Management Structures
While the ongoing globalization of Japan’s financial system and economy coupled with advances in financial and information technology and other changes have led to increased business opportunities for financial companies, these developments are also increasing the complexity and diversity of risk.
Responding to this environment, the Bank has designated risk management as a crucial management issue for maintaining the stability and soundness of its operations.
Comprehensive Risk Management
At the Bank of Kyoto, in order to accurately identify the amount of risk involved in the conduct of operations, and to ensure the stability and soundness of its management base, we have established a set of Comprehensive Risk Management Guidelines, and we maintain a self-managed risk management posture that compares aggregate risk to the Bank’s capital. We are working to strengthen and enhance risk management by expanding the integrated management of the Risk Management Division to include the supervisory divisions in our head office that take responsibility for each risk type and provide cross-sectional management.
At the same time, we quantify and allocate capital to principal risks (credit risk, market risk, and operational risk). As regards the amount of risk, the amount of allocated capital is treated as a limit for management purposes in accordance with the semiannual review of risk management policy. The estimated risk amount is reported to the management at the monthly ALM meetings. In addition, we conduct comprehensive stress tests projecting the simultaneous appearance of major risks based on comprehensive risk scenarios.
Capital Management
In order to ensure that the Bank maintains sufficient capital commensurate with all possible risks inherent in its operating activities, the Bank of Kyoto has formulated internal rules relating to the management of capital. At the same time, the Bank employs a variety of measures in its capital management endeavors including steps to verify that calculated risk levels fall within allocated capital ranges, conducting comprehensive stress tests and applying such benchmarks as capital adequacy ratios.
The Bank’s capital allocation policy, which is determined by the Executive Committee after deliberation at the ALM meeting (chaired by an executive director responsible for oversight of banking operations and who acts as an assistant to the president), is subject to semiannual review. Specifically, core capital (before applying transitional measures), a primary component of
regulatory capital used to calculate a bank’s capital ratio, serves as the source of capital for allocation to principal risks. The amount of capital allocated is determined on the basis of forecast risk levels, which take into account past risk levels as well as the overall budget and operational policy.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk refers to risk stemming from an inability to recover principal and interest on loans in the event that borrowers experience a deterioration in business conditions, or to the risk of losses due to reduction in the value of securities. In particular, the risk of loss due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or political and economic conditions in borrowers’ countries is known as country risk.
Having crafted a management posture by compiling a series of Credit Risk Management Guidelines, the Bank is working to strengthen its credit risk management regime by establishing the Credit Risk Management Committee (chaired by the corporate officer responsible for the Risk Management Division) in order to develop and maintain a comprehensive stance toward credit risk.
In addition to planning and managing credit risk through means such as internal ratings, a self-assessment system, write- offs of non-performing loans, and provisions for possible loan losses, the Risk Management Division’s Credit Risk Management Section is responsible for quantitatively analyzing and assessing credit risk. Additionally, because the concentration of credit in particular business partners or industries can lead to significant losses in the event of environmental changes, the section analyzes the condition of the Bank’s portfolio from a variety of perspectives and manages it to avoid any excessive concentration of credit. Credit risk levels and credit concentration conditions are reported to the monthly Credit Risk Management Committee meeting.
To maintain and improve the soundness of its assets, the Bank subjects them to a self-assessment regime that includes consolidated subsidiaries in order to adequately write off non- performing loans and make provisions for possible loan losses. We also established an Asset Audit Office as a specialized section within the Internal Audit Division to audit the validity of write-offs and allowances based on asset self-assessments.
In managing credit for specific borrowers, we have established a Credit Examination Division independent of marketing sections, and we are pursuing more stringent credit screening guidelines. Credit ratings are determined by a credit assessment officer based on information including the applicant’s financial condition, technical capabilities, and future viability. Credit ratings are assessed according to strict standards, after which the loan officer makes a final determination based on the intended usage of the
22 The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. Annual Report 2019
 
 funds, resources available for loan repayment, and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan.
We are also placing a special emphasis on improving the ability of our personnel to assess credit risk, providing lending services training to employees according to their level of experience.
Moreover, we have established a Management Support Office within the Credit Examination Division and are working to keep the Bank’s assets sound by helping customers radically transform slumping businesses via a variety of measures designed to support improvements in management. Other initiatives include strengthening risk management by formulating solution plans based on self-assessment results as policies for dealing with individual borrowers and taking measures in response to changing business conditions through continuous monitoring.
Market Risk Management
Market risk refers to interest risk, where the profit margin between fundraising and fund management shrinks due to fluctuations in market interest rates, and price fluctuation risk, where declines in market prices cause losses. While fluctuations in market prices carry with them the risk of the Bank sustaining losses, they also offer profit opportunities. For this reason, it is important to maintain a management posture that not only minimizes risk but also realizes stable earnings.
The Bank has established Market Risk Guidelines, putting in place a risk management approach and ensuring adequate management of market risk. The Risk Management Division, which oversees these activities, centralizes the understanding and management of market risks arising from assets and liabilities including deposits, loans and securities.
Specifically, it manages and analyzes risks by measuring value-at- risk (VaR) and decrease in economic value against interest-rate shocks (delta EVE) for its assets and liabilities, in addition to conducting stress tests supposing a variety of different stress scenarios and utilizing them in risk checks. The Bank also employs tools such as back-testing to verify the suitability and effectiveness of its metrics and management methods.
To ensure appropriate management of market risk involving securities, derivatives and other market transactions, the Bank works to regularly measure and understand proper, accurate market pricing. At the same time, we manage the risk of positions we hold by first considering a balance with capital, net business income and other factors involving the Bank’s strength and income, then setting risk tolerance levels for position and loss limit amounts, etc. For market risk for stocks and other securities, we use the method of setting and managing acceptable risk amounts based on the Bank’s capital and appraisal gains on stocks and other securities. We also conduct adequate risk management, including calculating the daily
positions, profits and losses, and risk levels and reporting them to management. A semiannual self-assessment provides an accurate understanding of the stocks and similar securities held by the Bank and consolidated subsidiaries, the results of which are audited by the Internal Audit Division.
Moreover the Bank conducts semiannual reviews of risk management policy. We also work to strategically address risk management at monthly ALM meetings by reporting on calculated risk levels, examining the appropriate balance of assets and liabilities, and consider measures such as risk hedges as needed.
Liquidity Risk Management
Liquidity risk refers to the risk of losses caused by a need to resort to fundraising at costs well in excess of normal due to obstructions to financing caused by a mismatch in time between fund management and fundraising or by unexpected fund outflows or other factors, as well as to the risk of losses stemming from an inability to conduct market transactions due to factors such as market confusion or to the need to resort to transactions at prices that are significantly less favorable than usual.
The Bank maintains an appropriate funding position through careful projection and verification of fundraising and fund management balances. Utilizing a system that continuously monitors the amount of funds available in the market, the Bank is always prepared for the occurrence of liquidity risk.
We also regularly conduct liquidity stress tests, and carry out verifications of the impact of unexpected cash outflows on financing.
Operational Risk Management
Operational risk refers to the risk of losses caused by inappropriate processes in financial institution operations, activities on the part of executives or employees, Bank systems, or external factors. The Bank categorizes operational risk into the following five components for management purposes: (1) clerical risk, (2) information security risk, (3) legal risk, (4) human risk, and (5) tangible asset risk.
The Bank’s stance on operational risk management has been set out in the Operational Risk Guidelines, and the divisions with oversight for each component risk take responsibility for managing those risks from a specialist’s perspective. The Risk Management Division is responsible for the overall management of operational risk.

Annual Report 2019 23

  Risk Management Structures
The Bank considers operational risk management to be one of its most important management challenges. The Bank has established an Operational Risk Meeting, which is chaired by an executive of the managing director level or above responsible for oversight of banking operations and who acts as an assistant to the President. The meeting provides a central venue for assessing and analyzing problem areas related to operational risk and discussing policy in an organization-based manner.
Money Laundering / Financing of Terrorism Risk
Described on page 21.
Reputation Risk Management
Reputation risk refers to the risk of losses caused by a deterioration of the Bank’s reputation among customers or the market.
The Bank is working to control and minimize reputation risk by establishing a set of Reputation Risk Management Guidelines specifying measures for reducing reputation risk, preventing its manifestation, and responding to the cases where it is likely to manifest.
Contingency Planning
The Bank has established a series of Emergency Task Force Guidelines for dealing with unforeseeable events including crimes, natural disasters such as fires or earthquakes, system malfunctions, financial crises, information security risks, and market and other risks. In the event of such an emergency, the Bank would set up an Emergency Task Force to provide unified leadership and instruction on a temporary basis. We have developed a Contingency Plan detailing specific procedures, and we are working to strengthen our response capability through regular training and reviews.
We have set out in our Crisis Management Guidelines for Disasters the official procedures regarding rapid disaster recovery and a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for implementing the minimum processes necessary to run our business in the event of a large-scale natural disaster, disease outbreak, etc. Our basic policy on business continuity, which includes the Bank’s intentions to offer support in ensuring the livelihoods of local residents and to help local business enterprises resume business operations, has been set out in the Business Continuity Policy. We have also drafted detailed manuals/guidelines taking into account the possibility of a large-scale earthquake and the outbreak of a new and highly contagious strain of influenza. In this way we are working to strengthen our crisis management system.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2019
1. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. (the “Bank”) and consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulation and the Enforcement Regulation for the Banking Law and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made in the 2018 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2019.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Bank is incorporated and operates. All yen figures for 2019 and 2018 have been rounded down to millions of yen. Also, U.S. dollar amounts have been rounded down to thousands of dollars.
The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts
is included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and
has been made at the rate of ¥110.99 to $1, the approximate rate of exchange at March 31, 2019. Such translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a. Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements as of March 31,
2019 include the accounts of the Bank and its 8 (8 in 2018) significant subsidiaries (together, the “Group”).
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Bank, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.
Investments in 1 (1 in 2018) affiliated company is accounted for by the equity method.
Of the consolidated subsidiaries, 8 in 2019 and 2018, respectively, have fiscal years ending on March 31, which is the same as the fiscal year end date of the Bank.
Investments in the remaining unconsolidated subsidiary and an affiliated company are stated at cost. The effect on the consolidated financial statements of not applying the equity method is immaterial.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Group is also eliminated.
b. Cash Equivalents — For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Group considers deposits with Bank of Japan which are included in “Cash and due from banks” in the consolidated balance sheet, to be cash equivalents.
c. Trading Securities — Trading securities, which are held for the purpose of primarily earning capital gains in the short term, are reported at fair value and the related unrealized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of income.
d. Securities — Securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management’s intent, as follows: (1) held-to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost and
(2) available-for-sale securities, which are not classified as held-to- maturity debt securities, are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity. Securities whose fair value cannot be reliably determined are stated at cost determined by the moving-average method. For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income. Money held
in trust classified as trading is reported at fair value and the related unrealized gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of income.
e. Derivatives and Hedging Activities — Derivatives are classified and accounted for as follows: (a) all derivatives (other than those used for hedging purposes) are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value at the end of the fiscal year and the related gains or losses are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of income and (b) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if such derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the gains or losses on the derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions.
To manage interest rate risk associated with financial assets and liabilities, the Bank applies hedge accounting by matching specific items to be hedged with specific hedging instruments or applying deferral hedge accounting (or cash flow hedge) based on the rules of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (the “JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 24.
The Bank applies deferral hedge accounting based on the rules
of the JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 25, “Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Accounting for Foreign Currency Transactions in the Banking Industry,” to manage its exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
f. Tangible Fixed Assets — Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets of
the Bank is computed using the declining-balance method while the straight-line method is applied to buildings acquired on or after April 1, 1998, and building improvements and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016, at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The range of useful lives is principally from 8 to 50 years for buildings and from 3 to 20 years for other tangible fixed assets. Depreciation
of tangible fixed assets of the Bank’s consolidated subsidiaries is computed substantially by the declining-balance method at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets.
g. Intangible Fixed Assets — Depreciation of intangible fixed assets is computed using the straight-line method. Software costs for internal use are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years.
30 The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. Annual Report 2019
 
 h. Long-Lived Assets — The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition
of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
Accumulated impairment losses are directly deducted from the respective tangible fixed assets.
i. Allowance for Possible Loan Losses — The amount of the allowance for possible loan losses is determined based on management’s judgment and assessment of future losses based on the Bank’s self-assessment system. This system reflects past experience of credit losses, possible future credit losses, business and economic conditions, the character, quality and performance of the portfolio, and other pertinent indicators.
The quality of all loans is assessed by branches and the Credit Examination Division with a subsequent audit by the Asset Review and Inspection Division in accordance with the Bank’s policy and rules for self-assessment of asset quality.
j. Reserve under Special Laws — The Reserve under special laws represents financial instruments transaction liability reserve recorded by a consolidated subsidiary as determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 46-5 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and Article 175 of the Cabinet Office Ordinance on Financial Instruments Business to provide for losses arising from security-related accidents.
k. Liability for Employees’ Retirement Benefits — The Bank has a contributory funded pension plan, an unfunded lump-sum severance payment plan and a defined benefit corporate pension plan. Certain consolidated subsidiaries have unfunded lump-sum severance payment plans and defined contribution pension plans. They apply the simplified method to state the retirement benefit expenses and the liability for retirement benefits for employees.
The bank accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on
a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within equity (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects and are recognized in profit or loss over 10 years no longer than the expected average remaining service period of the employees.
l. Liability for Reimbursement of Deposit Losses — A liability for reimbursement of deposits which was derecognized as a liability is provided for estimated losses on future claims of withdrawal from depositors of inactive accounts.
m. Liability for Contingent Losses — A liability for contingent losses is provided for possible losses from contingent events related to the enforcement of the “responsibility-sharing system” on October 1, 2007. The liability is calculated by estimation of future burden charges and other payments to the Credit Guarantee Corporation.
n. Foreign Currency Transactions — Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of income.
o. Stock Options — Compensation expense for employee stock options which were granted on and after May 1, 2006 are recognized based on the fair value at the date of grant and over the vesting period as consideration for receiving goods or services in accordance with Accounting Standards Board of Japan (the “ASBJ”) Statement No.
8, “Accounting Standard for Stock Options.” In the balance sheet, stock options are presented as stock acquisition rights as a separate component of equity until exercised.
The Bank has established a credit rating system under which its customers are classified into five categories. The credit rating system used in the self-assessment of asset quality.
The five categories for self-assessment purposes are “normal,” “caution,” “possible bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy” and “legal bankruptcy.”
For claims to debtors classified as legal bankruptcy or virtual bankruptcy, a full reserve is provided after deducting amounts collectible through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees.
For claims to debtors classified as possible bankruptcy, which are currently neither legally nor virtually bankrupt but are likely to become bankrupt, and for claims to debtors which had restructured loans, allowances are provided at the amounts deemed necessary based on an overall solvency assessment performed after deducting amounts collectible through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees. The discounted cash flow method (“DCF method”) is applied to claims whose estimated uncollectible amounts exceed a pre-established threshold and future cash flows could reasonably be estimated. Under the DCF method, an allowance is provided for the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contracted interest rates and the carrying value of the claims.
is
For other claims, an allowance is provided based on historical loan loss experience.
Subsidiaries provide an allowance for general claims based on their historical loan loss experience and for specific claims at the amounts individually estimated to be uncollectible.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
p.
Leases — In March 2007, the ASBJ issued ASBJ Statement No. 13, “Accounting Standard for Lease Transactions,” which revised the previous accounting standard for lease transactions. The revised accounting standard for lease transactions was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2008.
Lessee
Under the previous accounting standard, finance leases that were deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee were capitalized. However, other finance leases were permitted
to be accounted for as operating lease transactions if certain “as if capitalized” information was disclosed in the note to the lessee’s financial statements. The revised accounting standard requires that all finance lease transactions be capitalized by recognizing lease assets and lease obligations in the balance sheet. In addition, the revised accounting standard permits leases which existed at the transition date and do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee to be accounted for as operating lease transactions.
The Group applied the revised accounting standard effective April 1, 2008.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Lessor
Under the previous accounting standard, finance leases that were deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee were treated as sales. However, other finance leases were permitted to be accounted for as operating lease transactions if certain “as if sold” information was disclosed in the notes to the lessor’s financial statements. The revised accounting standard requires that all finance leases that are deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee be recognized as lease receivables, and all finance leases that are not deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee be recognized as investments in leases.
With regard to finance lease transactions entered into prior to April 1, 2008, that were not deemed to transfer ownership of the property to the lessee, leased investment assets are recognized at the book values of those leased assets at the transaction date.
The Group applied the revised accounting standard effective April 1, 2008.
Income Taxes — The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences.
r. Per Share Information — Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits.
Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net income per share of common stock assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants.
Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective fiscal years including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.
On October 1, 2017, the Bank effected a one-for-five reverse stock split. The impact of this reverse stock split has been reflected in the presentation of share and per share information for the year ended March 31, 2018, such as weighted-average number of common shares, basic net income per share, diluted net income per share, and cash dividends per share.
3. Cash and Cash Equivalents

   The classification of securities was not changed in the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Individual securities, except for trading securities, are written down when a decline in fair value below the cost of such securities is “deemed to be other than
temporary.” The amount written down is accounted for as losses on devaluation. The devaluation of available-for-sale securities did not occur for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
To determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the Bank applies the following rules by the credit risk category for the security issuer based on the Bank’s self-assessment guidelines.
(a) For securities issued by obligors classified as “legal bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy” and “possible bankruptcy”: the fair value is lower than the amortized/ acquisition cost.
(b) For securities issued by obligors classified as “caution”: the fair value is 30% or more lower than the amortized/acquisition cost.
(c) For securities issued by obligors classified as “normal”: the fair value is 50% or more lower than the amortized/acquisition cost, or fair value is more than 30% but less than 50% lower than amortized/acquisition cost and stayed below a certain level for a specified period of time.
“Legal bankruptcy” refers to issuers who have already gone bankrupt from a legal and/or formal perspective. “Virtual bankruptcy” refers to issuers who have
not yet gone legally or formerly bankrupt but who are substantially bankrupt because they are in serious financial difficulties and the possibility of restructuring is remote. “Possible bankruptcy” refers to issuers who are not yet bankrupt but are in financial difficulties and are very likely to go bankrupt in the future. “Caution” refers to debtors who require close attention because there are problems with their borrowings. “Normal” refers to issuers other than those classified as “legal bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” “possible bankruptcy” and “caution” mentioned above.

Cash collateral paid for financial instruments and surety deposits are included in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet.
    Loans in legal bankruptcy are loans in which the interest accrual is discontinued (excluding the portion recognized as bad debt), based
on management’s judgment as to the collectability of principal or interest resulting from the delay in payments of interest or principal for a considerable period of time and other factors.
Nonaccrual loans are loans in which interest accrual is discontinued, other than loans in legal bankruptcy and loans granting deferral of interest payments to debtors in financial difficulty to assist them in their recovery.
Past due loans (three months or more) are excluded loans that are classified as loans in legal bankruptcy and nonaccrual loans.
Restructured loans are loans on which the Bank grants concessions (e.g., reductions of the stated interest rate, deferrals of interest payments, extensions of maturity dates, waivers of the face amount, or other measures) to the debtors to assist them in recovering from financial difficulties and eventually being able to pay creditors. Loans classified
as loans in legal bankruptcy, nonaccrual loans, and accruing loans contractually past due by three months or more are excluded.

11. Commitment Line
Commitment line contracts on overdrafts and loans are agreements
to lend to customers when they apply for borrowing up to prescribed amounts as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contracts. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, such commitments amounted to ¥1,547,702 million ($13,944,518 thousand) and ¥1,481,447 million, respectively, of which ¥1,460,630 million ($13,160,017 thousand) and ¥1,418,255 million, respectively, were those whose original contract maturity was within one year or unconditionally cancelable at any time. As many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount of unutilized commitments does not necessarily represent actual future cash flow requirements. Many of these commitments have clauses that the Group can reject the application from customers or reduce the contract amounts in case economic conditions change, there is a deterioration in the customer’s creditworthiness, or other events occur. In addition, the Group requests customers to pledge collateral, such as buildings, land, and securities, at the execution of
the contracts, and takes necessary measures, such as understanding customers’ financial positions, revising contracts when the need arises, and securing claims, after the execution of the contracts.
12. Land Revaluation
Under the “Law of Land Revaluation,” promulgated on March 31, 1998 (final revised on May 30, 2003), the Bank elected a one-time revaluation of its own-use land to a value based on real estate appraisal information as of March 31, 2002.
The resulting land revaluation surplus represented unrealized appreciation of land and was stated, net of income taxes, as a component of equity. Continuous readjustment is not permitted unless the land value subsequently declines significantly such that the amount of the decline in value should be removed from the land revaluation surplus account and related deferred tax liabilities.
At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of the land after the above one-time revaluation exceeded its fair value.

13. Deposits
Deposits at March 31, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following:
16. Equity
Japanese banks are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”) and the Banking Law. The significant provisions in the Companies Act and the Banking Law that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:
a. Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders’ meeting. Additionally, for companies that meet certain criteria including (1) having a Board of Directors,
(2) having independent auditors, (3) having an Audit & Supervisory Board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed
as one year rather than the normal two-year term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Bank, however, shall not pay such dividends by resolution of the Board of Directors, since it has not prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. On the other hand, semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act and the Banking Law provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury stock.
b. Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve, and Surplus
The Banking Law requires that an amount equal to 20% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of the legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 100% of capital stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that capital stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus, and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.
c. Treasury Stock and Treasury Stock Acquisition Rights
The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury stock and dispose of such treasury stock by resolution of the Board
of Directors. The amount of treasury stock purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury stock. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights.
On October 1, 2017, the Bank made the one-for-five reverse stock split for each outstanding share.

Among corporate bonds included in securities, guarantee liabilities on privately offered corporate bonds (Article 2-3 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act) amounted to ¥30,574 million ($275,468 thousand) as of March 31, 2019.

2018 Discount rate 0.5%
Expected rate of return on plan assets 2.0 Expected salary increase rate 3.9
The amount to be paid to defined contribution pension plan was ¥359 million ($3,241 thousand) and ¥324 million, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
24. Income Taxes
The Group is subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in a normal effective statutory tax rate of approximately 30.6% and 30.8%, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The tax effects of significant temporary differences which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows:
(2)
The Group’s fundamental mission is to contribute to the greater prosperity of the local community and the development of local industries. The Group maintains and improves the soundness of its management, providing small and medium-sized companies with various financial services such as deposits and loans, etc., and investing securities.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
Financial assets held by the Group are mainly composed of loans to local businesses and individual customers. Loans are subject to credit risk stemming from the inability to recover principal and interest on loans due to events such as the deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower.
Securities held by the Group primarily consist of bonds and stocks, which are subject to various risks, such as the credit risk of the issuer, interest rate fluctuation risk, and market price fluctuation risk.
The Group raises funds by deposits which have relatively shorter maturities than those of investments in loans and securities. Therefore, the Group is exposed to liquidity risks such as the risk of losses caused by the necessity to execute transactions at extremely high funding costs when unexpected outflows of funds occur, and by the inability to execute market transactions or by the necessity to execute transactions at extremely unfavorable prices as result of market turbulence.
The Bank enters into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, currency swaps, currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts. The Bank also enters into interest futures, bond futures, bond options and other derivatives; however, there is no derivative balance at March 31, 2019. Subsidiaries do not enter into any derivative transactions. Derivatives are subject
to market risk, which is the risk that a loss may result from fluctuations in market conditions, and credit risk, which is the risk that a loss may result from a counterparty’s failure to perform according to the terms and conditions of the contract.
Since most of the Bank’s derivative transactions are conducted to hedge underlying business exposures, market gain or loss on the derivative instruments is expected to be offset by opposite movements in the value of the hedged assets or liabilities.
The Bank enters into derivatives principally as a means of managing its interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures on certain assets. The Bank also uses derivatives within established trading limits as part of its short-term trading activities. In addition, the Bank uses derivatives actively to meet its customers’ needs for new financial instruments.
Derivatives are classified and accounted for as follows:
➀ For derivatives used for hedging purposes, if derivatives qualify for
hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions.
➁ The hedge items are the interest rate swaps and currency swaps. The hedged instruments are fixed rate loans and currency- denominated available-for-sale securities.
➂ The Bank assesses the effectiveness of the interest rate swaps and currency swaps.

25. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures
In March, 2008, the ASBJ revised ASBJ Statement No. 10, “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” and issued ASBJ Guidance No. 19, “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures.” This accounting standard and the guidance were applicable to financial instruments and related disclosures at the end of the fiscal years ending on or after March 31, 2010. The Group applied the revised accounting standard and the new guidance effective March 31, 2010.
(1) Basic policy for financial instruments
The main business of the Group is banking, which consists of deposit-taking and lending services, trading of securities, securities investment, domestic exchange services, foreign exchange services, etc. Additionally, the Group provides other financial services, such as credit guarantee services, leasing, and credit card services.
40 The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. Annual Report 2019

 (3) Risk management for financial instruments ➀ Credit risk management
Having established a management posture by compiling a series of Credit Risk Management Guidelines, the Bank is working to strengthen its credit risk management. In addition to planning and managing credit risk through means such as credit ratings,
a self-assessment system, write-offs of nonperforming loans, and provisions for possible loan losses, the Risk Management Division’s Credit Planning Office (the “Office”) is responsible for quantitatively analyzing and assessing credit risk. Because the concentration
of credit in particular business partners or industries can lead to significant losses in the event of environmental changes, the Office analyzes the Bank’s portfolio from a variety of perspectives to avoid any excessive concentration of credit. Quantitative analyses of credit risk and credit concentration conditions are reported at the monthly credit-risk management committee.
To maintain and improve the soundness of its assets, the Group subjects its assets to a self-assessment system in order to adequately write off non-performing loans and make provisions
for possible loan losses. The Bank also established an Asset Audit Office as a specialized section within the Internal Audit Division to examine the validity of write-offs and allowances based on asset self-assessments. In managing credit for specific borrowers, the Bank has established a Credit Examination Division independent from business divisions, and the Bank is implementing strict
credit screening. Obligor’s ratings are determined based on information including the applicant’s financial condition, technical capabilities, and future viability by the Credit Examination Division. Comprehensive judgments of repayment ability are provided considering the purpose of the loan and borrowers’ repayment resources, when customers apply for borrowing. The Bank is also working to strengthen its credit screening capabilities by providing training for staff engaged in loan operations at all levels of the Bank.
Moreover, the Bank has established a Management Support Office within the Credit Examination Division and is working to keep the Bank’s assets sound by helping customers radically transform slumping businesses via a variety of measures designed to support improvements in management. Other initiatives include strengthening risk management by formulating plans based on self-assessment results and taking measures in response to changes in business conditions through continuous monitoring.
➁ Market risk management
The Bank is taking steps to strengthen market risk management, based on the Market Risk Guidelines. The Risk Management Division, which is responsible for conducting market risk management, unifies the management of market risk (including risk for deposits, loans, stocks and other securities), credit risk, and other risks, and adequately controls risks within the scope of the Bank’s capital to secure stable earnings.
To this end, the Risk Management Division manages and assesses risks by utilizing techniques such as the VaR method and analysis of fluctuations in the present value of assets and liabilities (interest risk level based on the outlier standard). The Bank also employs tools such as back testing and stress testing to verify
the suitability and effectiveness of its metrics and management methods.
To effectively control market risk for stocks and other securities of instruments which has market risk, the Bank sets the limits on acceptable risk levels, as well as position ranges and loss limits, taking into account the Bank’s economic capital and net operating profit to achieve a balance between capital and profitability. Regarding the Bank’s investment in securities, the Bank regularly monitors the market value of securities and reports these to management.
For stocks, the Bank sets the limits on acceptable risk quantities based on the economic capital and the profit, and a semiannual self-assessment provides an accurate understanding of the investments in stocks and similar securities, the results of which are subject to audit by the Internal Audit Division.
Moreover, the Bank conducts semiannual reviews of risk management policy in areas such as credit, interest, and liquidity by holding ALM meetings. The Bank also works to strategically address risk management based on risk appetite at monthly ALM meetings by reporting on market risk quantities of each instrument, examining the appropriate balance of assets and liabilities, and considering measures such as risk hedges as needed..
(Quantitative information on market risk)
• Financial instruments other than those for trading purposes
The instruments that are affected by the typical risks, parameter interest rate risk, market price fluctuation risk and foreign currency risk are “Loans and bills discounted,” “Securities,” “Deposits (other than negotiable certificates of deposit),” “Negotiable certificates of deposit,” “Cash and due from banks,” “Call loans,” “Call money” and interest rate swaps and currency swaps of “Derivatives.” The Bank measures VaR and conducts a quantitative analysis of market risk in order to manage market risks for the financial assets and financial liabilities mentioned above.
In the current fiscal year, the Bank adopts the historical simulation method (at 1 month holding period and 99% confidence interval and 5 years observation period) in order to measure VaR for interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and market price fluctuation risk associated with stocks other than securities held for strategic equity. In order to measure VaR for market price fluctuation risk associated with securities held for strategic equity, the historical simulation method (at 6 months holding period, 99% confidence interval and 5 years observation period) is adopted.
The market risk exposure (the estimated amount of loss) of the Bank as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 was ¥48.8 billion ($439 million) and ¥31.4 billion.
VaR by risk type at March 31, 2019 and 2018, was as follows:

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
market risks arising with a certain probability using a statistical methodology based on historical market volatilities. It may not be able to capture the risks arising under drastic market movements beyond normal imagination.
➂ Liquidity risk management
The Bank maintains an appropriate funding position through careful projections and verification of fund-raising and fund management balances. The Bank manages its liquidity risk by utilizing a system that continuously monitors the amount of funds available in the market.
(4) Supplementary explanation on fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments includes market prices, as well as reasonably calculated prices in cases where there are no market prices available. Since the calculations of the latter prices are implemented under certain conditions and assumptions, the result of calculations could differ if calculations are made under different conditions and assumptions.

  42 The Bank of Kyoto, Ltd. Annual Report 2019

 (a) Valuation method of financial instruments
Assets
Cash and due from banks
For deposits without maturity, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value since fair value approximates such carrying amount. For deposits with maturity, the carrying amount is presented as the fair value, as the fair value approximates such carrying amount because of their short maturities (within one year).
Call loans and bills bought
The carrying amount is presented as the fair value since fair value approximates such carrying amount because of their short maturities (within one year).
Securities
The fair value of stocks is determined based on the prices quoted by the exchange and the fair value of bonds is determined based on the prices quoted by the exchange or the financial institutions from which they are purchased. The fair value of investment trusts is determined based on the publicly available price.
The fair value of private placement bonds is calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest at the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar bonds by categories according to internal ratings, and terms of the bonds. Information on securities by classification is included in Note 4.
Loans and bills discounted
For floating rate loans, the carrying amount is presented as a fair value as the fair value approximates such carrying amount, unless the creditworthiness of the borrower has changed significantly since the loan origination.
The fair value of fixed-rate loans is calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest at the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar loans by categories according to the types, internal ratings, and terms of the loans.
As for loans in legal bankruptcy, virtual bankruptcy and possible bankruptcy, credit loss is estimated based on factors such as the present value of expected future cash flows or the expected amount to be collected from collateral and guarantees. Since the fair value of these items approximates the carrying amount, net of the currently expected credit loss amount, such carrying amount is presented as the fair value.
For those without a fixed maturity due to loan characteristics such as limiting loans to within the value of collateral, the carrying amount is deemed to be the fair value since the fair value is expected to approximate the carrying amount based on the estimated loan periods, interest rates, and other conditions.
Liabilities
Deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit
Fair value of deposits on demand is deemed as payment amount if demanded on the consolidated balance sheet date (i.e., carrying amount).
Time deposits are grouped by certain maturity lengths. The fair value of such deposits is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted. The discount rate used is the interest rate that would be applied to newly accepted deposits.
Payables under securities lending transactions
The terms of all liabilities are short (within one year) and their fair values approximate their carrying values. The fair values are therefore deemed equal to the carrying values.
Borrowed money
Floating rate-borrowed money reflect market interest rates in short periods, and the credit standing of the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries has not significantly changed from when the money was borrowed. The fair value of floating rate borrowed money is, therefore consolidated to approximate the carrying value and is deemed equal to the carrying value. The present value of fixed-rate borrowed money which is classified in accordance with its period, is estimated by discounting future cash flows, using rates that would be offered to similar borrowed money whose term is short (within one year) approximates the carrying value and is therefore deemed equal to the carrying value.
Derivatives
Fair value information for derivatives is included in Note 26.

              28. Segment Information
Under ASBJ Statement No. 17, “Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” and ASBJ Guidance No. 20, “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” an entity is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available and such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and
in assessing performance. Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
1.
2.
Description of reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are those for which separate financial information is available and regular evaluation by the Bank’s management is being performed in order to decide how resources are allocated among the Group.
The Group provides financial services, but engages mainly in the banking business. Since the business other than the banking business which the Group engages in is immaterial, banking is the only reportable segment of the Group.
The banking business consists of deposit-taking and lending services, trading of securities, securities investment, domestic exchange services, foreign exchange services, trust services, etc.
Methods of measurement of Operating Income, Profit (Loss), Assets, Liabilities, and Other Items for each reportable segment
The accounting policies of each reportable segment are consistent with those disclosed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
The profit of the reportable segment is based on “net operating income.” “Net operating income” does not include certain other income and expenses, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests.

Aiming for a Society in which Diverse People Can Actively Participate
Promoting Work Style Reform
The Bank of Kyoto is promoting its work style reform program, “7-Up Thoughts and Acts for Improvement.” This aims to improve the work productivity of all employees, thereby effectively using spare time that can be used for skills development and self-training. This will enable them to provide higher-quality financial services, while strengthening their connections with their workplace, family, and the community to lead more fulfilling lives.

In addition, we have implemented the Kirameki Career Support Program. The program seeks to fully establish the conditions that make it possible for female employees to participate and advance at the workplace.

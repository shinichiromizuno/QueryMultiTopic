Becoming the Best Supporter of Communities
Offering Donation-Type Products
The Bank of Kyoto’s donation-type loans donate part of the interest income received from customers to projects involved with regional revitalization in Kyoto, Osaka, and Shiga Prefectures. We also offer “The Bank of Kyoto Private Placement Bonds for Supporting the Future by Donating to the Children of the Next Generation,” which use some of the commissions received from customers for executing private placement bonds to purchase books and supplies that will be donated to a school of the customers’ choice.
Through these products, the Bank and regional customers are teaming up to help revitalize the regional economy.
Announcement of a Regional Revitalization
Guidebook
We have created a Regional Revitalization Guidebook summarizing the support services provided by the Bank for regional revitalization. The guidebook is published on our website.
Supporting Financial and Economic Education
The Bank is supporting efforts to provide financial and economic education aimed at realizing an active regional society in the future by supporting the growth of children and the development of human resources who will uphold the regional economy.
We are participating in the Kyoto City Student-City experiential learning program for all fifth year elementary school students in Kyoto City municipal schools. The
program has had over
120,000 participants to date, all of whom have played the part of either bank staff or bank customer at the Bank of Kyoto Booth (branch simulation) that is permanently attended by the Bank’s staff.

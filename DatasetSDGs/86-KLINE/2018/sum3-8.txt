 Securing and Training the World’s Leading Maritime Technical Personnel, Responsible for Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
The “K” LINE Group regards securing and training exceptional maritime technical personnel as one of its three policy pillars for continuously ensuring safety in navigation and cargo operations. Spearheaded by the “K” Line Maritime Academy (KLMA), a scheme to develop maritime technical personnel, we strive to pass down maritime know-how and foster technicians who can respond to new needs.
  Risks
•Increase in maritime technical personnel leaving due to deteriorating work environment
• Loss of opportunities to attract maritime technical personnel • Decline in knowledge and skills of maritime technical personnel • Impacts on transportation quality
Initiatives
1 Securing Maritime Technical Personnel
Securing maritime technical personnel is important for pro- viding safe and optimal transportation services. Seeking to secure diverse human resources, we dispatch our maritime technical personnel to conduct lectures at various maritime universities and schools. We also accept internships from various schools to encourage a broader interest in the work of maritime technical personnel, and we engage in training individuals from non-maritime universities to foster them as maritime technical personnel at the Company.
3 Obtaining the Latest Knowledge and Skills to Support Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Under the “K” LINE Maritime Academy (KLMA), we con- duct various training to foster maritime technical person- nel (“K” Line Seafarers) with essential knowledge and skills to implement the “K” LINE Group’s basic commitment to “the safety in navigation and the protection of human lives, cargoes, and the natural environment at sea.” As part of our seafarers’ training, we have introduced a state-of-the- art ship maneuvering simulator to help trainees respond to re-enacted accidents and the like. For institutional train- ing, KLMA (Philippines) conducts training using actual main equipment to help trainees obtain knowledge and skills on
new technologies. In these ways, our Group companies are united in their quest to develop excellent maritime technical personnel.
•Improve workplace environments to retain deep talent pool of maritime technical personnel
• Secure exceptional and diverse maritime technical personnel • Use accumulated knowledge and technologies to create new value • Ensure continuation of safety in navigation and cargo oper-
ations and high-quality transportation
2 Enhancing Interviews Conducted by HR Personnel
Maritime technical personnel experience closed living con- ditions when working offshore. As soon as our maritime technical personnel disembark after an offshore stint, they participate in telephone interviews with HR personnel to discuss their lives onboard the ship, as well as human rela- tionships and anything else that comes to mind. Where nec- essary, we also conduct face-to-face interviews. Through these efforts, we endeavor to not only relieve anxiety among our maritime technical personnel but also better understand- ing of conditions on the front lines.
4 Enhance and Expand Training Facilities for Maritime Technical Personnel
In Manila, Philippines, we are currently enhancing and expanding our training facility for maritime technical person- nel so that it can accept a total of 10,000 trainees per year. In March 2018, we opened a new building that combines a seafarer’s clinic equipped with the latest medical equip- ment and a dormitory that can accommodate 225 trainees (282 trainees when combined with existing building). We are confident that this will become a symbolic place for secur- ing and training all maritime technical personnel working on our ships. Going forward, we
will step up efforts to secure exceptional maritime technical personnel and enhance their technological learning. In these ways, we will continue striving to maintain and improve our high-quality transportation ser- vices, based on our commit- ment to safety in navigation and cargo operations.

           2 “Health Management” Initiatives
The “K” LINE Group regards health as a source of happi- ness for individuals and essential for realizing its group prin- ciple. In addition to distributing our “Health Declaration” both inside and outside the Company, we formed the Health Enhancement Committee consisting of the Company, labor unions, occupational health physicians, and health insur- ance associations to promote its realization. The Committee spearheads efforts to help maintain and improve the health of each individual employee. Reflecting these efforts, “K” LINE was selected as a 2018 “White 500” organization under the Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organizations Recognition Program conducted by
the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. We will con- tinue establishing workplace environments where employ- ees can work healthily while stepping up efforts related to “health management.”

Securing Blue Seas for Tomorrow, through 2050 and Further in the Future
In consideration of issues and business characteristics that we will face in the future society and with a view towards contributing to fulfillment of the well-being and prosperous lives of many people, in 2015 we have formulated “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, which clarifies what we aim to become, based on long-term perspectives.
    Risks
• Marine pollution caused by serious accidents and oil spills • Ecosystem destruction by our operating vessels
• Global warming and air pollution caused by exhaust gas from ships • Climate change and exhaustion of resources
Business continuity / cost increase / lowering competitiveness
“K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050 -Securing Blue Seas for Tomorrow-
Four Priority Issues and Four Goals
Opportunities
• Marine safety improvement
• Maintain the beautiful blue and fertile oceans
• Further energy efficient operations
• Introducing new marine fuels and advanced technologies
Engineering innovation / entering new business fields / differentiation
Continue avoiding serious marine accidents and be the industry’s leader in protection of the ecosystem
Zero emissions                  Replacing majority of energy currently consumed with new energy sources
Setting a new CO2 emission reduction target of 25% for 2030 against 2011 level
Reducing CO2 emissions by 10% from 2011 level accomplished in 2015
Reducing CO2 emissions by half
               Continuing to avoid causing serious marine accidents
Introducing 2019
Our goal for 2030 has obtained SBT* certification.
Also, our emission reduction target is equivalent to the target determined by the IMO* (40% reduction compared with 2008 levels) right page.
* SBT (Science Based Target): Scientifically consistent with the level achieving “2°C goal” of the “Paris Agreement”

“DRIVE GREEN NETWORK”(DGN) Launched
“K”LINE and its 14 group companies recently acquired a “Statement of Conformity”for our environmental promotion system,“DRIVE GREEN NETWORK”which is established in June 2017 in order to have a high awareness of environmental preservation and realize world top-class environmental responses, in consequence of a conformity audit by a third-party institution.
From April 2018, overseas group companies will also participate as phase 2. We shall proceed it to the entire group by 2019 when our company celebrates its 100th anniversary. To broaden this initia- tive both inside and outside the group companies, we have set up a logo by public invitation.

“K” LINE REPORT 2018Environment Environmental Preservation
  “K” LINE Group Environmental Awards 2018
In 2015, we founded the “K” LINE Group Environmental Awards to give recognition to exceptional environmental preservation activities and share such activities through- out the Group. This year, we held the awards ceremony on World Environment Day*. We also newly established our Sustainability Awards with a focus on “grassroots activities” that embody the philosophy of DGN.
* World Environment Day was established in commemoration of the “United Nations Conference on the Human Environment” held on June 5, 1972.

Initiatives
In light of rising public concern about climate change and air pollution, the environmental regulations including those cover- ing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur oxide (SOX) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) for international shipping are strengthened with each passing year.
  In the “SOX regulation,” the sulfur concentration of fuel used in marine ships must be reduced to 0.5% or less in principle by January 2020.
HOME > CSR > Environment > Environmental Regulations https://www.kline.co.jp/en/csr/environment/regulation.html
There are three main ways to achieve this: use low-sulfur fuel, install SOX scrubbers (exhaust gas cleaning system), and convert to new fuels, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). We are consulting with customers as we consider the best mea- sures according to vessel type and transport route.
Since LNG fuel contains almost no sulfur and generates minimal CO2 and NOX emissions, we set the goal of introducing LNG-fueled carriers as part of “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050. To establish a fuel supply system, which will be chal- lenge when broadening this initiative, in May 2018 we established two joint venture corporations to run the LNG bunkering business together with another partners. In July 2018 we concluded a shipbuilding contract for LNG bunkering vessel, which will be completed in 2020 to become the first LNG bunkering vessel in Japan.
The targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping were decided at the International Maritime Organization’s*1 72nd Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting*2 in April 2018.
We “K” LINE will continue striving to maximize transportation efficiency. With the aims of exploring and embodying yet-unknown technologies that realize zero emissions from marine ships, we will continue our efforts to support a sustain- able society and help enrich the lives of people as an envi-
ronmentally advanced company.
*1. International Maritime Organization (IMO). Measures to reduce green- house gas emissions in international shipping are not congruent with the frameworks for reduction by country addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and consequently the role has been entrusted to the IMO instead.
*2. 72nd Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting (MEPC 72). This meeting adopted reduction targets and the goal of “reducing green- house gas emissions to zero during this century” on a global basis, with no distinction between advanced and developing nations.

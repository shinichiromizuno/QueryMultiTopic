 Interview with the President
The “K” LINE Group is united in its pursuit of innovations aimed at sustainable growth.
The Company will celebrate its 100th year of operation in 2019. Following large-scale struc- tural reforms undertaken in fiscal 2015 and fis- cal 2016, Ocean Network Express (ONE) started its operations in April 2018 through the integra- tion of three containership businesses. Fiscal 2018 is earmarked as a year of innovation. The brand-new “K” LINE Group will pursue various initiatives with its next 100 years in mind, in its quest to further improve corporate value and thus meet the expectations of all stakeholders.
Please explain the business environment Q1 andtheGroup’sperformanceinfiscal2017.
We returned to profitability for the first time A1 in three years as market conditions for our main businesses firmed, while structural reforms and profit enhancement measures
produced good results.
The containership business benefited from healthy cargo movements in east-west trade routes, while the freight rate market remained on an overall recovery trend. The market for dry bulk carriers was buoyed by growth in the cargo movement of iron ore and coking coal to China, which helped cape-size bulkers recover from historically low levels. Small and medium-sized bulkers also contin- ued recovering moderately against a backdrop of solid movements of grain, coal and other cargo. For both con- tainerships and dry bulk carriers, we have not yet achieved full-scale improvement of the supply-demand balance, but we believe that market conditions have bottomed out.
Under these circumstances, our performance improved significantly thanks to rigorous structural reforms taken as an approach toward thorough competitiveness over a two- year period until the previous fiscal year, as well as ongo- ing cost-cutting efforts and enhancing fleet utilization to improve earnings, which had a ¥44.9 billion positive effect. Despite the negative impact of rising fuel prices and the yen’s progressive appreciation, consolidated operating rev- enues increased ¥131.8 billion year-on-year, to ¥1,162.0 billion. We also reported operating income of ¥7.2 billion,
 
 ordinary income of ¥2.0 billion and profit attributable to own- ers of the parent of ¥10.4 billion—marking the first time in three years of positive figures for all three income categories. We also steadily proceeded with preparations for the inte- gration of the containership businesses of three Japanese companies, with the aim of stabilizing our containership

business, which had been an issue. Despite an increase in shareholders’ equity in the year under review, the shareholders’ equity ratio remained mostly unchanged, at 20.8%, due to the appreciation of the yen. We will continue to strengthen earning capacity and heighten the equity ratio in the future.

medium-sized vessels, while at the same time working to increase the number of medium- and long-term contracts to enhance profit stability.
In the Energy Resource Transport segment, we will con- tinue our focus on expanding stable profits in the LNG car- rier and thermal coal carrier categories through medium- and long-term contracts. Although oil tankers are affected by cer- tain market conditions, we plan to increase the number of medium to long-term contracts by replacing existing ships with new ones and entering new agreements. In the lique- fied gas new business, we will foster the LNG bunkering business and other businesses as new sources of income. In May 2018, we established a new company jointly with three partners—Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., Toyota Tsusho Corporation, and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha—to develop an LNG bunkering business for LNG - fueled carriers.
In the Product Logistics segment, we expect profitability of the car carrier business to decline due to stagnant cargo movements to resource-rich countries and increased com- plexity of cargo movement. Nevertheless, we will utilize our fleet of 15 new-generation large-sized vessels, each with a 7,500-vehicle capacity, to improve operational efficiency and reduce vessel costs and operational expenses. We will make maximum use of these vessels, which have high abil- ity to accommodate construction machinery, railway cars and the like, to expand our business in high and heavy car- goes. Meanwhile, in the logistics business, we will rebuild our global network and expand our customer base and busi- ness scale with “K” Line Logistics, Ltd. as the core.
 During the year, we integrated our containership business, one of our core businesses, to Ocean Network Express (ONE) through the business integration of three Japanese shipping companies, with ONE becoming an affiliated com- pany accounted for by the equity-method. As a result, we forecast that consolidated operating revenues will decline to ¥754.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Thanks to progress of structural reforms and the recovery trend in the shipping market, we forecast operating income of ¥5.0 billion, ordinary income of ¥5.0 billion, and profit attributable to owners of the parent of ¥7.0 billion. These figures take into account an ¥8.5 billion one-time cost stemming from the containership business integration, which occurred in the first quarter.
With the integration of containership business, we adopted a key management approach aimed at making our business results easier to understand for outside parties. To this end, we reorganized our businesses for disclosure purposes into four segments: Dry Bulk, Energy Resource Transport, Product Logistics and Others.
In the Dry Bulk segment, we will target sustained growth by reducing the number of high-cost ships, mainly small- and

 Introduction of proposal system, “Suggestions for Greater Strides —Challenge 99”
As I mentioned earlier, the integration of the containership business gives us a great opportunity for innovation. We decided it was good time to encourage each and every offi- cer and employee to think about the future of the Company, and introduced a new proposal system to help build the next-generation “K” LINE Group based on approaches that are not obsessed with the past. The name of the new sys- tem, “Suggestions for Greater Strides—Challenge 99,”
Please tell us your thoughts and expecta- Q3 tions for ONE.
I firmly believe that ONE, which harnesses A3 the strengths of three Japanese shipping companies, will earn widespread trust as
the nation’s largest containership entity.
ONE, which integrates the containership businesses of three Japanese shipping companies, started services in April 2018 as originally planned. This bold business inte- gration gives the new company the business scale and cost competitiveness necessary to survive against inter- national competition. When vessels ordered are in place, ONE will have a total of 224 ships and a capacity of 1.55 million TEU—ranking them just behind the big three European containership companies. In addition, we can sta- bilize our business operations by using integration to reduce
Please describe the progress status of the Q4 Group’s medium-term management plan, “Revival for Greater Strides” (fiscal 2017–
2019).
In order to build stable profits, we have sought A4 to rebuild our business portfolio, while also introducing business risk–return manage- ment method through advanced business
management.
We have set three priority initiatives under the plan: (1) Rebuilding portfolio strategy, (2) Emphasizing advanced business management and function-specific strategies and (3) Pursuing ESG initiatives. Through these measures, we will target positive profits for three consecutive years from fiscal 2017, stable businesses with ROA of 6%, stable rev- enue boosted to ¥30.0 billion or higher and an equity ratio of around 25%.
With respect to the first initiative, “rebuilding portfolio
reflects the “Revival for Greater Strides” part of our medi- um-term management plan and the fact that 2018 is the 99th year since our foundation. We ask officers and employees to send proposals via e-mail about any aspect of the Company’s business. Each proposal is given to the relevant department for examination and consideration of response measures and direction, then passed internally and to the individual proposer as feedback. I, personally, also look through all the proposals in the hope that some of them will lead us to the next generation.
costs. We expect the synergistic effect of the integration to produce US$1.05 billion annually—more than our origi- nal forecast—of which 60% will be derived in fiscal 2018, 80% in fiscal 2019 and 100% in fiscal 2020.
Each of the Japanese shipping companies involved has distinctive strengths in the containership business, and we are all committed to providing transportation and services from the customer’s perspective with a strong emphasis on quality. Now we are involved in this business as a shareholder. I firmly believe that ONE—which fuses the DNA of three Japanese companies, each with differ- ent strengths but a common commitment to quality—will earn the trust of everybody. The three shipping companies involved will provide support with a strong determination to make ONE inevitably successful as the nation’s largest containership entity.
For details about ONE, see Business Overview (TOPICS) on page 35
strategy,” we completed the integration of the container- ship business, sold our heavy lifter business, and reduced the number of market-linked high-cost vessels. In these ways, we are working to strengthen our stable businesses. In fiscal 2017, our stable businesses generated revenue of around ¥27.0 billion, up ¥2.0 billion year-on-year, indicating steady progress toward our target of ¥30.0 billion or higher.
As for emphasizing “advanced business manage- ment,” we started operation of a business risk–return management method with greater attention to capital costs. By introducing this management method, we feel we can identify issues and implement solutions from dif- ferent angles and thus strengthen the correlation with “rebuilding portfolio strategy.” By further entrenching this method into our operations, we also will deepen our advanced business management.
With respect to “emphasizing function-specific strate- gies,” this requires a combination of customer relationship management (CRM) enhancement, technological innovation, business model reform and securement, development, and

diversification of human resources. With an understanding of social changes and the strategies of our customers, we are collaborating with them to create a new business model.
Finally, we are “pursuing ESG initiatives” in various ways, including a reinforcing unit supervisory system and risk management. In addition, we are pursuing mea- sures based on “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, as the long-term environmental management vision with a view to 2050. As a result, our environmentally-friendly
next generation flagship DRIVE GREEN HIGHWAY was awarded with Ship of the Year 2016, reflecting the high external praise we have received as an advanced environ- mental protection company. We also launched an environ- mental management promotion system called “DRIVE GREEN NETWORK” for the entire Group, and acquired a “Statement of conformity”from a third-party institution.

Finally, do you have any message to Q6 stakeholders?
The brand-new “K” LINE Group will strive A6 to implement further innovations.
In fiscal 2017, which marked the beginning of our medi- um-term management plan, we successfully guided initia- tives aimed at “Revival for Greater Strides” along the right track. Because of the urgent need to enhance our financial position in order to increase equity capital, however, we have decided, with regret, to forgo dividends payments for the year.
In fiscal 2018, we will restore our equity capital, which was affected by structural reforms to date, and build up our strength. We have positioned fiscal 2018 as a year for full-scale implementation of measures in preparation for our next “great strides.” At the same time, it will also be a year of innovation, during which we will boldly embrace challenges free from constraints as the brand-new “K” LINE Group. By harnessing Group-wide strengths to forge ahead toward change, we look forward to 2019, the 100th Anniversary of our founding, and to our next cente- nary of operations.
During the three-year period of our medium-term man- agement plan, we will strive to maintain positive profits and swiftly restore our robust business foundation aiming for the resumption of dividends at an early stage, in our quest to be a company that earns the renewed trust of all stakeholders, including customers and shareholders and other investors. We look forward to your ongoing support for these endeavors.

Please describe the status of the Group’s Q5 compliance with environmental regu- lations including those related to sulfur
oxides (SOX).
We will use low-sulfur fuel, install SOX- A5 removal equipment, convert fuel to LNG and otherwise proceed with optimal mea-
sures on a ship-by-ship basis.
Transporting goods by ship has a relatively low environ- mental impact, but as impacts on the environment become more serious on a global scale, reducing the environmen- tal effect of marine transportation is an urgent issue. Rules governing sulfur concentration in marine fuel are attract- ing particular attention. Currently, the maximum concen- tration is 3.5% or less when operating in general waters, but the upper limit will be reduced to 0.5% from January 2020. There are various ways to achieve this, including use of low-sulfur fuel oil, installation of scrubbers (exhaust gas cleaning system) and conversion to LNG and other alterna- tive fuels. We will proceed on a ship-by-ship basis, aware that we cannot limit ourselves to one particular measure. In April 2018, the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions including CO2 emissions from international ship- ping were decided, then the concrete measures to achieve will be discussed.
Implementing environmental measures will entail large costs, but it is important to take action without delay by sharing the burden fairly among beneficiaries.

 Further Enhancing Services and
1
As part of efforts to further reinforce function-specific strategies after the containership business in- tegration, the “K” LINE Group is working to strengthen its customer base by promoting customer re- lationship management (CRM) throughout the Group. In Special Feature 1, we explain about how we deploy our service menu as an integrated logistics company to advance multi-layered, proposal-type sales and thus strengthen our customer base. In the process, we introduce specific initiatives on tech- nological innovation and business model transformation that reflect customer needs.

Creating a New Business Model
   Priority Measure 1: Strengthen Customer Base
   Priority Measure 2: Create New Business Model
 As an integrated logistics company that evolved from the shipping business, we utilize our extensive service menu in a Group-wide effort to actively advance multi-layered, proposal-type sales.
Customers are constantly confronted with multiple challenges related to shipping and logistics. In addition to improving service quality with respect to safety and secu- rity, as well as addressing environmental regulations and other social issues, our customers have wide-ranging needs in other areas. When setting up a factory, for example, they require not only marine transportation of raw materials and products, but also transportation of factory materials, river and land transportation, factory logistics and the like. In the automobile industry, where technological innovation is pro- gressing rapidly, demand for logistics is changing drastically with the spread of electric vehicles (EV) and IoT, as well as advances in automation driven by AI and other technolo- gies, thus raising the potential for major changes in desired cargo shipping and transportation services. In emerging economies, meanwhile, there is a need to build new logis- tics infrastructure at the local level to handle complete built-up car logistics.
Accordingly, customers’ challenges and needs are chang- ing in many ways, giving rise to numerous business oppor- tunities that transcend existing trading frame-works. In addition to its engineering and excellent shipping services, the Group has a comprehensive menu of marine transporta- tion and logistics services and unique associated know-how. In addition, we have established a system to build new logistics infrastructure in cooperation with local partners around the world. For customers in all industries, therefore, we will fully demonstrate our Group strengths as we focus on delivering optimal solutions. Here, we will drill down vertically into logistics transportation in general to provide
In addition to strengthening these coordinating functions, we are swiftly setting up project teams and have estab- lished a system to facilitate systematic solution-based proposals. In addition, we are strengthening our customer base and advancing solution-based proposals with the aim of building a new business model. We have already started using CRM to transform our business model. Here, we are providing solutions and otherwise advancing our businesses
services ranging from marine transportation to land trans- portation in multiple regions. To this end, we have estab- lished a function for coordinating multiple businesses and projects within our headquarters. Here, we utilize cus- tomer information—collected and shared throughout the Group—in sales activities across our business units, and we are promoting efforts to ensure effective inter-action between various function of overseas bases, Group com- panies and the like.

in response to demand for logistics infrastructure—including project transportation and complete built-up car logistics— among customers mainly in emerging economies. We are also making advanced responses to environmental prob- lems. For example, we are working with Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. to set up Japan’s first LNG-fueled ferry service, and we have decided to establish an LNG bunker- ing business for ships in Japan.

    Case Study 1
Deploying Advanced Technologies—Introduction of K-IMS*
We installed “K-IMS,” a next-generation integrated ves- sel operation and performance management system developed jointly with the Kawasaki Heavy Industries Group, into around 90 of our operated and managed ves- sels. Responding to the spread of broadband communica- tions on the seas, we created “K-IMS” by integrating and updating our “Ship Performance Analysis System” and “Data Collecting & Monitoring System,” then combin- ing this with our “Optimum Navigation System” and “Real Time Monitoring” into a single unit. It collects and
monitors all kinds of operational big data in real time using the cloud to display routes offering minimum fuel con- sumption with increased accuracy, thus contributing to improved economic efficiency, safety and environ- mental performance of vessels fitted with the system.
In the future, we will pursue further automation in stages by incorporating AI, big data, and IoT, and other technological innovations. Our aim is to realize auto- mated vessel navigation that completely eliminates human error, with top priority on safety.

Pursuing Environmental Advances—LNG Bunkering Business
In May 2018, the Group established a joint venture with Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, reflect- ing a decision to enter the liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering business for ships in Japan (Chubu District). LNG is regarded as a powerful fuel candidate to replace heavy oil because it allows reductions in air

The “K” LINE Group aims to create and improve corporate value based on a greater awareness of cap- ital costs than ever before. To this end, we introduced and started using two indicators for identify- ing risks in each business unit and ensuring returns that correspond to those risks. The new indicators are: “K” VaCS, a “K” LINE version of Economic Value Added (EVA), and “K” RIC, a “K” LINE version of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

● Details of Business Evaluation Indicators
“K” VaCS — “K” LINE Value after Cost of Shareholders’ Equity —
• A profit indicator that represents Economic Value Added (EVA) corresponding to the cost of shareholders’ equity • Aims to optimize the Group’s business portfolio by using the measured business risk
“K” RIC — “K” LINE Return on Invested Capital —
• An efficiency indicator promoting corporate value enhancement that factors in the cost of capital • Accelerate Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) by establishing a profitability baseline
• Sets hurdle rates for each business and the Group overall by using the measured business risk
Advanced Business Management
 The “K” LINE Group takes objective information about market fluctuations (including freight rates, foreign exchange and interest rates), then determines busi- ness risk as the maximum potential loss based on sta- tistical measurements. By controlling these maximum amounts, we are able to increase the stability of our businesses. When making decisions about new invest- ment projects, moreover, we measure business risk by
project and examine whether or not the profitability of the project matches the business risk. This enables us to make appropriate investment choices. In addition, we are making business-specific assessments using two new indicators based on the measured business risk —“K” VaCS and “K” RIC—in an effort to realize an opti- mal business portfolio.

In fiscal 2017, in order to strengthen our financial foundation, we very regrettably had to decide on no dividend payment for the year, in light of the urgent need to improve our financial condition, following the previous year.
In fiscal 2017, due to the loss before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and the acquisition of ships, free cash flows were negative ¥21.6 billion.

      In fiscal 2017, while shareholder capital increased, the effects of the yen’s appreciation resulted in equity capital and equity ratio remaining at similar lev- els as in the previous year at ¥217 billion and 20.8%, respectively. We aim to increase the equity ratio to somewhere around 25% by the end of fiscal 2019.
In fiscal 2017, due to increases in long-term loans, obligations under finance leases and other items, interest-bearing liabilities increased by ¥20.1 billion year-on-year to ¥570.6 billion. DER climbed by 0.12 points.

 Business Overview
Dry Bulk Business
  Woodchip Carrier
  Senior Managing Executive Officer Atsuo Asano
Responsible for Dry Bulk Carriers Unit, In charge of Bulk Carrier Business
  We Stabilize and Strengthen the Earning Base by Securing Medium- and Long-term Contracts and Enhancing Market Resilience.
Basic Strategies
• Expand the ratio of medium- and long-term contracts through cape-size and woodchip sectors
• Enhanceresiliencetomarketvolatilityofsmall-andmedium-sized vessel sectors
• Enhance allocation efficiency and ensure economically- optimal operation of vessels
• Address needs to reduce environmental impacts
• Expand customer base and create new business model
 Overview of Fiscal 2017
Dry bulk carrier market showed clear improvement with fast growth in seaborne dry bulk trade driven mainly by strong Chinese demand, while fleet growth remained mod- erate with limited supply of newbuildings to the market. As a result, earnings improved significantly year-on-year for all dry bulk carrier size sectors. In cape-size sector, in addi- tion to the medium- and long-term contracts, which is the source of our stable earnings, we actively engaged in new trades and achieved record-breaking volume of cargo trans- ported annually, which greatly contributed to expansion of the dry bulk business. For small- and medium-sized vessels, we sought to optimize the fleet composition to match the portfolio of cargo contracts to enhance resilience to market volatility, while maintaining operational scale. The woodchip fleet was 100% covered by contracts throughout the year and contributed to the stable earnings of the dry bulk busi- ness. The “K” LINE Group strived to improve revenues and reduce expenditures by taking measures such as continual implementation of cost reduction plans and enhancement of ship allocation efficiency, combined with the structural reforms implemented to strengthen competitiveness in the market for the past two years. While there were negative impacts, including rising fuel oil prices and further appreci- ation of the yen, business performance improved year-on- year and higher income and profit were achieved.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
While seaborne dry bulk trade volume is expected to be fairly flat compared with the previous year, the limited order book suggests that fleet growth will be subdued, with delivery of newbuildings projected to slow further, implying moderate improvement in supply-demand bal- ance of the dry bulk market in the coming year. However, given uncertainty factors such as the impact of fur- ther strengthening of China’s environmental regulations on steel production and concerns over trade disputes between the United States and China, market volatility may increase at times.
The Coal & Iron Ore Carrier Group will work to increase competitiveness by providing high-quality transportation services, amid the rise in awareness for navigational safety and conservation of global environment. Furthermore, we will strive to secure and increase medium- and long-term cargo transportation contracts, with the aim of enhancing our stable earnings base.
The Bulk Carrier Group will be committed to enhance market resilience by optimizing the fleet composition of its small- and medium-sized vessels, while stepping up efforts in areas requiring advanced transportation know-how.
As for woodchip and pulp carriers, we will aim to operate a stable business amidst the anticipated strong demand for transportation.

      TOPICS The Dry Bulk Carriers Unit is Muscling Up Now!
*Owned vessels and a part of chartered vessels
 The Coal & Iron Ore Carrier Group has world-class cape-size fleet in scale and continues to actively seek growth in the market with its fleet that is highly resis- tant to market fluctuations. From fiscal 2018, long- term contracts for the transportation of Guinean bauxite by cape-size carriers will gradually begin to take effect, which is expected to contribute considerably to ship allocation efficiency of the entire cape-size fleet as well as to stable earnings. For small- and medium-sized vessel fleet, several series of long-term contracts for dedicated nickel carriers commenced in fiscal 2017. The Bulk Carrier Group leverages its transportation quality to actively handle not only main bulk cargo (iron ore, coal and grains) but also a diverse range of other cargo and is steadily increasing its annual cargo vol- ume while maintaining its existing scale of business. The Dry Bulk Carriers Unit that became independent as a segment from this fiscal year will continue in that business with greater strength and flexibility to meet the needs of our customers.

In charge of LNG, Thermal Coal, Liquefied Gas New Business
LNG Carrier
      We Expand Our Various Fleets and the Energy Value Chain Business in Anticipation of Strong Growth in Energy Demand in the Medium- and Long-term.
Basic Strategies
• Expand medium- and long-term contracts in Tanker business by replacing existing vessels and obtaining new business
• Expand fleet which will bring stable earnings to “K” LINE for medium- and long-term, responding to LNG develop- ment projects, and address diversified customer needs, including medium- and shorter-term contracts
• Engage in and expand the energy value chain business, which will create LNG / LPG demand
 Overview of Fiscal 2017
Tanker Services VLCCs (Very Large Crude Carriers) and large LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) tankers contributed to the earnings under medium- and long-term charter contracts. Vessels with expired contracts were sold ahead of schedule to reduce market exposure.
The market condition for tankers, especially medi- um-size crude oil tankers and petroleum product tankers, stagnated more than our initial forecasts, and revenues and expenditures fell.
LNG Carrier Services During the year, existing fleets operated smoothly and three newly-built vessels were launched, contributing to revenue as a stable earnings busi- ness under medium- and long-term charter contracts. On the other hand, the overall market conditions were sluggish with postponement of new development projects and in- creasing pressure from supply of new vessels due to the delivery of ships ordered for the purpose of speculation.
Thermal Coal Carrier Services In January 2018, we launched CORONA WISDOM, an 88,000-ton coal carrier. For the year, vessels including existing operating ships performed smoothly, mainly under medium- and long-term transportation contracts. While some parts of the business were impacted by contracts that were concluded when market conditions for dry bulk carriers were sluggish, we strove to achieve efficient fleet allocation but earnings re- mained flat from the previous year.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
Tanker Services We expect steady growth in demand for crude oil and LPG, especially from emerging economies.
Improving the supply-demand gap is expected to take some time due to a large number of new vessel deliveries to the market for both VLCC and LPG tankers; however, progress has been made in scrapping VLCCs, and we expect market conditions to recover over the second half of the year.
Under these circumstances, we will build up our stable earnings by expanding our fleets of VLCCs and large LPG tankers based on medium- and long-term contracts in an- ticipation of medium- and long-term growth in demand. On the other hand, we will down-size our market-sensitive busi- nesses and rearrange our portfolio without changing total fleet numbers.
LNG Carrier Services We expect demand for LNG, a clean energy source, to grow in the long-term. Under these circumstances, three LNG carriers tied to long-term charter contracts are scheduled to be steadily completed, which will contribute to expanding our stable earnings businesses. In addition, we anticipate a number of development projects to commence with the rise in LNG prices. We will respond flexibly to the demand of medium-term charter vessels while carefully assessing risks, with a plan to expand our fleet to around 60 vessels over the medium-term.
Thermal Coal Carrier Services As set forth in the medium- term management plan, we will increase our competitive and high-quality fleet to about 30 vessels by around 2020 to en- sure stable transport to coal-fired power plants, which remain a critical power source in Japan. We aim to contribute to sta- ble earnings by expanding medium- and long-term transport contracts with domestic electric power companies.

 Overview of Fiscal 2017
Drillship Services We are currently engaged in drilling operations for ultra-deep-water fields 200 kilometers off the coast of Brazil under a long-term charter contract (up to 20 years / until 2032) with Petrobras. In the year under review, we maintained a high utilization rate, which con- tributed to stable long-term earnings.
Offshore Support Vessel Services Under operation in the North Sea, we reported a loss due to flagging spot rates owing to weakness in offshore E&P development.
FPSO Services “K” LINE, along with Sumitomo Corpo- ration, JGC Corporation, and Development Bank of Japan Inc., entered into the owning and chartering business for oil and gas floating production, storage and off-loading (FPSO) run by Yinson Holdings Berhad in an oil and gas field in offshore Ghana.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
Drillship and FPSO Services We continue to expect the achievement of stable earnings by maintaining a high uptime of drillship and FPSO under long-term charter contracts.
Offshore Support Vessel Services We expect that offshore E&P development will be revitalized, i.e., the offshore support vessel (OSV) demand will increase, by
improving oil companies’ cash flow as rebalancing oil market and impressive cost-cutting efforts. However, the absorption of the over-supply will take time and we ex- pect the market to recover from fiscal 2019 afterwards. Under these circumstances, we will review our asset portfolio and take all options into consideration to mini- mize market fluctuation risks and achieve stable profits.
In line with our effort to cultivate and foster the energy value chain business, we aim to work with reliable partners to expand our activities in busi- nesses that are expected to generate stable earn- ings for the long-term. As a part of this, as stated in the Overview of Fiscal 2017, we participated in an FPSO owning and chartering business in an oil and gas field in offshore Ghana.

•Global network of the “K” LINE Group
Overview of Fiscal 2017
Demand for liquefied gas increased, primarily in emerg- ing economies, with the start of exports of liquefied gas derived from U.S. shale gas. This led to rising consequen- tial demand for FSRU, Floating Gas Power Plant (FGPP) and Small-Scale LNG Transportation at low prices and short delivery times. We therefore strove to capture this new demand by proposing our own unique businesses model.
Given the expected growing demand for vessels that utilize liquefied gas as fuel, in anticipation of the strength- ening of environmental regulations on ship fuel in 2020, we worked to realize a bunkering business for such vessels

Although Middle East, Africa and other resource-rich economies continue to have uncertain futures and cargo movements were stagnant, cargo movements to Europe and North America remained firm. In addition, cargo movements showed signs of recovery in Russia and Brazil.
Under these business conditions, the total volume of complete built-up cars shipped by the “K” LINE Group increased by about 14.6%, from 3,110,000 units in the previous fiscal year to 3,560,000 units by successfully capturing cargo bound for Europe and cargo in the Atlantic region. During the year, while striving to increase the num- ber of shipped cars, we continued to engage in optimiz- ing fleet allocation, including improving the efficiency of fleet operation and reorganizing some route services, and sought to improve revenues and expenditures.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
In fiscal 2018, we expect to carry a total volume of 4,040,000 complete built-up cars, increased by just under 500,000 year-on-year, thanks to the opening of new services in Latin
America and new contracts for cargo from Europe to Japan. While cargo movements from Far East Asia to Europe and North America remain firm, we foresee that the recov- ery in cargo movements to the Middle East, Africa and other resource-rich regions will be limited in fiscal 2018. However, sales in the United States and major European countries are solid, and production in Mexico is expanding, so cargo move- ments in the Atlantic region are expected to remain firm. There is no supply-demand gap in our fleet capacity as we
are flexibly adjusting to market conditions.
Automakers’ production bases are changing daily with a
shift of trends from “local production, local consumption” to “mass production in the right place” and “appropriate pro- duction volume in the right place,” and cargo movement is becoming increasingly diverse amid an expanding elec- tric vehicle (EV) movement. In order to make a flexible and timely response to changes in and the increasing complex- ity of the trade structure, we are strengthening our business foundation by expanding the service network while maintain- ing our fleets properly. Currently ten car carriers each with a 7,500-vehicle capacity are in service, and three new car carri- ers will join our fleet in fiscal 2018. We will strive to enhance our earnings base by making maximum use of large next-gen- eration vessels equipped with significant capacity for loading construction machinery and rail cars and excellent fuel-effi- cient performance.

 We are very interested in the progress with the tran- sition to EVs and in the growth outlook for self-driving cars and mobility services.
Shifting to EVs could bring about large market fluc- tuations, including more local production and con- sumption in Europe, as well as development of China as an export hub. We will closely examine the poten- tial impacts on demand for passenger vehicle sales and marine transportation arising in the future from a society of sharing internet-connected self-driving cars. We believe making appropriate forecasts of the demand growth in emerging economies is also critical.
While working hard to mitigate environmental impacts, we will pursue high- quality services that are sustainable into the future. In accordance with “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, we aim to suppress greenhouse gas emissions and reduce air pollutants as close to zero as possible in step with the environ- mental measures taken by automakers. Furthermore, along with promoting energy-saving ship operation, we are making considerations for and researching next- generation car carriers that use environmentally-friendly alternative fuels, such as LNG and LPG.

   We Expand Our Coastal Business and Upgrade Our Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) Business while Working to Improve the Profitability of the Short Sea Business.
Basic Strategies Strengths
  • Expand our coastal business by introducing large state-of- the-art vessels and opening new routes
• Improve the income and expenditure of the short sea busi- ness by capturing profitable cargo and enhancing our fleet
• Further increase efficiency and strengthen the sales ability
of our OSV business
• Appropriately address customer demand associated with changing conditions in short sea and domestic logistics
• Multi-faceted businesses such as international, coastal and OSV businesses
• OSV business in line with government policies
• Modal shift in response to shortage of truck drivers
Overview of Fiscal 2017
In the short sea business, despite decreases in cargo volume, income and expenditure improved supported by a recov- ery in market conditions year-on-year. In the coastal busi- ness, against the backdrop of solid cargo movements, liner shipping reported increases in cargo volume due to various factors, such as the Shimizu-Oita route that opened in the middle of fiscal 2016 and has become a year-round opera- tion, increases in tonnage on the Hitachinaka-Tomakomai route, and the operation of ferries with low cancellation rates. In the OSV business, we supported the offshore methane hydrate product test, among other activities. As a result, the short sea and coastal business overall reported increases in operating revenues and operating income year-on-year.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
In the short sea business, we will actively engage in sales activities and optimize fleet scale with the aim of further improving income and expenditure. In the coastal business, in the face of the growing social problem of truck driver shortage, we will promote a modal shift by using express RORO vessels and ferries to provide highly-punctual ser- vices. In the ferry business, we aim to capture cargo that can be shipped on our new larger vessels and acquire cargoes shipped regularly on the Miyako-Muroran route
which is to be newly opened. In the OSV business, we will further increase our business efficiency and sales power.
In the coastal business, we commenced daily routes between Shimizu and Oita and started a new ship- ping route that connects Hokkaido and Kyushu, linking Hitachinaka-Tomakomai route. On our ferry routes, we have deployed the new large-sized Silver Tiara on the Hachinohe-Tomakomai route that has increased our load capacity, while its cabins are designed to offer comfort and privacy. On the new Miyako-Muroran ferry route, we will engage in cargo collection looking ahead to the opening of all seg- ments of the Sanriku Reconstruction Road.

Basic Strategies
• Position “K” LINE LOGISTICS, LTD. as the core of logistics business
• Reorganize and expand global network
• Strengthen locally-oriented logistics services
• Enhance buyers consolidation*1 services
• Develop project cargo freight services
 Overview of Fiscal 2017
Domestic demand for logistics services was firm, mainly with respect to land transportation, warehousing and cus- toms clearance, and increases in operating revenues and income were reported. In the international logistics sec- tor, earnings rose year-on-year due to increases in handling volume related to air cargoes departing from and arriv- ing in Japan, mainly for aircraft parts and semi-conduc- tors, commencement of operation of new businesses, as well as expansion of area-rooted services and buyers consolidation. As a result, operating revenues and income increased significantly year-on-year for the logistics busi- ness as a whole.
Fiscal 2018 Business Policies
Domestic demand for logistics services is expected to remain firm, mainly with respect to land transportation and warehousing. In the international logistics sector, handling volume related to air cargo, mainly for semicon- ductors, is expected to be stable, recording earnings at previous year levels.
In fiscal 2018, we will expand the customer base of the NVOCC business*2 with “K” LINE LOGISTICS, LTD. playing a central role. We will work together with Group companies on various aspects, such as introduction of new systems and human resources support, in order to
increase the overall handling volume and shift the devel- opment and strengthening of the logistics business into full gear.
In addition, we will step up efforts to share regional information and know-how while investing in and support- ing priority growth fields in order to enhance and function- ally connect our various regional businesses. Through our ability to make logistics proposals based on our high-qual- ity transportation and information technologies fostered over many years, we will harness our comprehensive group-wide power to deliver one-stop logistics services to meet the demand of customers that has not been fulfilled with existing services.
In the meantime, we will closely monitor latest trends in the industry and identify potential demand, with a focus on tapping demand for buyers consolidation services to address small-lot, multiple-commodity shipments, project cargo transportation, and other fields. We will also target diversification of services and business expansion with the aim of becoming a strategic business partner in logis- tics that customers can trust.
*1 Buyers consolidation: Consolidation-distribution system in which sin- gle buyer uses an agent to collect products from multiple local man- ufacturers, load them into containers for transportation to destination, providing greater shipping efficiency and reduction in cost, lead time, inventory and warehouse work.
*2 NVOCC business: Freight transportation business that includes inci- dental services, such as cargo handling as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, during the cargo transportation process.

PT. “K” Line Mobaru Diamond Indonesia (KMDI) was founded in Indonesia in 2003 and has evolved mainly as a carrier in the car business. Having a variety of units, including standard trailer types as well as single towing and double decks, KMDI with a leading share in Indonesian carrier car market for the export and import of complete built-up cars and domestic deliveries now enjoys an excellent reputation among customers.
In terms of unit development and improvement, at the request of customers, KMDI developed last year a truck carrier that can carry four small trucks, which has significantly improved transportation efficiency and quality compared to conventional self-propelled trailers and has earned high praise from customers. In the two-wheeler transportation business, the two-wheeler triple-decker truck we developed independently based on customers’ feedback has improved load- ing efficiency by 30% compared to conventional double-decker trucks, and is used primarily for medium- and long-distance domestic transportation.
Furthermore, KMDI operates two container depots in Jakarta’s harbor district. With container tractors also in its line-up, it carries out wide-ranging businesses and also works with “K” LINE Group-affiliated compa- nies in Indonesia, such as PT. “K” Line Total Logistics Indonesia. KMDI will continue to draw on its built-up know-how in transportation to constantly improve transportation quality, as well as develop businesses and make new investments in line with customer requests to further expand its business.

The Containership Business was Integrated to Form Ocean Network Express (ONE) by Three Japanese Shipping Companies.
Containership
  Overview of Fiscal 2017
The cargo volume of “K” LINE’s containership business in fiscal 2017 for east-west trunk routes decreased by 2% year-on-year on outward freight bound for North America and increased by 10% year-on-year on outward freight bound for Europe.
The cargo volume increased by 3% year-on-year on Intra-Asia routes, while it decreased by 8% on North-South routes. Total cargo volume for the year including return routes remained mostly unchanged from the previous year.
While the supply-demand balance did not see full- fledged improvement, freight rate conditions in fiscal 2017 recovered due to solid cargo movements. Operating rev- enues and operating income increased as a result of “K” LINE’s freight rate level exceeding the previous year’s.
In the port business, where we aim to operate high-stan- dard, high-quality terminals, we continued to upgrade our cargo handling equipment, extend and strengthen quay walls and improve other facilities so that we can accom- modate larger containerships.

   Steady cargo movement is expected against a background of relatively favorable global economic conditions, so the demand / supply will be stabilized on a medium-term basis. Regrouping of the consortia has settled down and it is expected to contribute to providing stable services.
In the business plan, the freight rate is set at a similar level to fiscal 2017, and cargo volume at organic growth rate (yearly around 3-4%) is incorporated. On top, steady bottom-line improvement will be sought by executing cost-savings by the synergy effect.

  In the “SOX regulation,” the sulfur concentration of fuel used in marine ships must be reduced to 0.5% or less in principle by January 2020.
HOME > CSR > Environment > Environmental Regulations https://www.kline.co.jp/en/csr/environment/regulation.html
There are three main ways to achieve this: use low-sulfur fuel, install SOX scrubbers (exhaust gas cleaning system), and convert to new fuels, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). We are consulting with customers as we consider the best mea- sures according to vessel type and transport route.
Since LNG fuel contains almost no sulfur and generates minimal CO2 and NOX emissions, we set the goal of introducing LNG-fueled carriers as part of “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050. To establish a fuel supply system, which will be chal- lenge when broadening this initiative, in May 2018 we established two joint venture corporations to run the LNG bunkering business together with another partners. In July 2018 we concluded a shipbuilding contract for LNG bunkering vessel, which will be completed in 2020 to become the first LNG bunkering vessel in Japan.
The targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping were decided at the International Maritime Organization’s*1 72nd Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting*2 in April 2018.
We “K” LINE will continue striving to maximize transportation efficiency. With the aims of exploring and embodying yet-unknown technologies that realize zero emissions from marine ships, we will continue our efforts to support a sustain- able society and help enrich the lives of people as an envi-
ronmentally advanced company.
*1. International Maritime Organization (IMO). Measures to reduce green- house gas emissions in international shipping are not congruent with the frameworks for reduction by country addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and consequently the role has been entrusted to the IMO instead.
*2. 72nd Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting (MEPC 72). This meeting adopted reduction targets and the goal of “reducing green- house gas emissions to zero during this century” on a global basis, with no distinction between advanced and developing nations.

 Maintaining World-leading Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Establishing and maintaining safety in navigation and cargo operations represent an immutable mission in running a shipping business. “Providing reliable and excellent services” is one of the most import- ant parts of the “K” LINE Group’s corporate principle and vision and reflects its commitment to bene- fiting society. To this end, we have three policy pillars: (1) Enhancing Safety Management System; (2) Strengthening Ship Management System; and (3) Securing and Training Maritime Technical Personnel.
   Risks
• Casualties, destruction, contamination, and losses caused by accidents, resulting in loss of social trust
•Unsafe condition stemming from deterioration of ship quality, violation of laws, and increasing in accident rates caused by decline in safety culture
• Decline of technological capabilities and loss of maritime expertise caused by shortage of human resources
Initiatives
1 Enhancing Safety Management System
Opportunities
• Provide ongoing safe navigation and high-quality services to improve social trust and seize business opportunities
•Deploy advanced vessel management capabilities to maintain / improve vessel quality and enhance respons- es to handling hazardous / special cargo
• Attract excellent human resources and accumulate/update maritime expertise to maintain / improve technical capabilities
  The Ship Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the President & CEO, is the top decision-making body covering safety. It determines accident prevention and safety measures for all ships operated by the Company—including owned, chartered, and entrusted vessels—and handles everything from basic policy formulation to implementation of measures under the sys- tem shown below.

Reflection and feedback

   1. Pre-embarkation Briefing
In addition to our basic policies regard- ing safety in navigation and cargo oper- ations, we provide the latest specific information and instruction through safety management manuals and related written procedures adopted by each management company.
2. “KL-QUALITY”
Using the Company’s proprietary “KL-QUALITY” guidelines, our ship supervi- sors regularly visit all of our operating ves- sels to conduct inspections. Should any defects be identified, we ask crew mem- bers, vessel owners and ship manage- ment companies to rectify them in order to maintain and improve the quality.
4. Accident Information Management System (AIMS)
Reflecting our zero accident commitment, we continue to explore the hidden causes of accidents deeply by analyzing their details and trends using our propri- etary system.
5. “K” Line-Drive to No Accident (K-DNA): Safety Equipment Installation Guidelines
Based on lessons learned from past accidents, we are working to enhance the safety of all operating vessels from the hardware perspective by accumulating know-how cultivated in the field, while drawing on our own guidelines, which exceed rules and requirements.

6. Safety Campaign
Under the theme of “Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations and Environmental Preservation,” shore staffs and crew members on board work together in the field to improve group-wide safety consciousness by exchanging opin- ions and checking onsite situations.
7. Trouble News
Under the belief that “we will never allow the same accident to happen again, nor will we forget about it,” we thoroughly investigate the causes of past accidents and establish measures to prevent their recurrence. These measures are notified and shared across all of our operating vessels.

Reports on near-miss incidents on ships stemming from unsafe behavior are carefully analyzed by experienced shore- based maritime technical personnel and fed back to the similar-type vessels. By entrenching a non-blaming culture, where the responsibility of near-miss parties are not called into question, we receive thousands of reports annually, which helps safety awareness to take root on the front lines.

To enable swift and accurate responses to accidents, we envisage “worst- case scenarios,” and conduct periodic Emergency Response Drill, includ- ing communication with overseas entities and confirmation of media correspondences.
  2 Strengthening Ship Management System
Through our three in-house ship management companies, which share our principle, we make full use of our expertise to provide higher-quality, safer, and more reliable services.
3 Securing and Training Maritime Technical Personnel
The responsibility for the “K” LINE Group’s safety in navi- gation and cargo operations lies with its team of maritime technical personnel. It includes vessel crews, supervisors at in-house ship management companies, and maritime technical staffs stationed at head office. Through the “K” Line Maritime Academy (KLMA), that is our central body for attracting and fostering marine personnel, we help estab- lish career paths within the Group for our employees, irre- spective of nationality, with the aim of fostering world’s best maritime technical personnel.

 Securing and Training the World’s Leading Maritime Technical Personnel, Responsible for Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
The “K” LINE Group regards securing and training exceptional maritime technical personnel as one of its three policy pillars for continuously ensuring safety in navigation and cargo operations. Spearheaded by the “K” Line Maritime Academy (KLMA), a scheme to develop maritime technical personnel, we strive to pass down maritime know-how and foster technicians who can respond to new needs.
  Risks
•Increase in maritime technical personnel leaving due to deteriorating work environment
• Loss of opportunities to attract maritime technical personnel • Decline in knowledge and skills of maritime technical personnel • Impacts on transportation quality
Initiatives
1 Securing Maritime Technical Personnel
Securing maritime technical personnel is important for pro- viding safe and optimal transportation services. Seeking to secure diverse human resources, we dispatch our maritime technical personnel to conduct lectures at various maritime universities and schools. We also accept internships from various schools to encourage a broader interest in the work of maritime technical personnel, and we engage in training individuals from non-maritime universities to foster them as maritime technical personnel at the Company.
3 Obtaining the Latest Knowledge and Skills to Support Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Under the “K” LINE Maritime Academy (KLMA), we con- duct various training to foster maritime technical person- nel (“K” Line Seafarers) with essential knowledge and skills to implement the “K” LINE Group’s basic commitment to “the safety in navigation and the protection of human lives, cargoes, and the natural environment at sea.” As part of our seafarers’ training, we have introduced a state-of-the- art ship maneuvering simulator to help trainees respond to re-enacted accidents and the like. For institutional train- ing, KLMA (Philippines) conducts training using actual main equipment to help trainees obtain knowledge and skills on
new technologies. In these ways, our Group companies are united in their quest to develop excellent maritime technical personnel.
•Improve workplace environments to retain deep talent pool of maritime technical personnel
• Secure exceptional and diverse maritime technical personnel • Use accumulated knowledge and technologies to create new value • Ensure continuation of safety in navigation and cargo oper-
ations and high-quality transportation
2 Enhancing Interviews Conducted by HR Personnel
Maritime technical personnel experience closed living con- ditions when working offshore. As soon as our maritime technical personnel disembark after an offshore stint, they participate in telephone interviews with HR personnel to discuss their lives onboard the ship, as well as human rela- tionships and anything else that comes to mind. Where nec- essary, we also conduct face-to-face interviews. Through these efforts, we endeavor to not only relieve anxiety among our maritime technical personnel but also better understand- ing of conditions on the front lines.
4 Enhance and Expand Training Facilities for Maritime Technical Personnel
In Manila, Philippines, we are currently enhancing and expanding our training facility for maritime technical person- nel so that it can accept a total of 10,000 trainees per year. In March 2018, we opened a new building that combines a seafarer’s clinic equipped with the latest medical equip- ment and a dormitory that can accommodate 225 trainees (282 trainees when combined with existing building). We are confident that this will become a symbolic place for secur- ing and training all maritime technical personnel working on our ships. Going forward, we
will step up efforts to secure exceptional maritime technical personnel and enhance their technological learning. In these ways, we will continue striving to maintain and improve our high-quality transportation ser- vices, based on our commit- ment to safety in navigation and cargo operations.

 Training for Officers
The Company offers opportunities for newly appointed Officers (including Executive Officers) to attend seminars on legal responsibilities pertaining to the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act within three months after taking office. Each year, all of our Officers undertake training related to compliance in such areas as competition law, insider trading regulation, and anti-bribery
regulations. At the time of their appointments, moreover, Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members receive explanations about the Group’s business, financial, and organizational status, as well as the manage- ment status, operating environment and business issues, from heads of relevant divisions or Executive Officers in charge, to enhance their understanding.
  Taking Advantage of External Perspectives to Enhance Corporate Value
 “K” LINE is actively seeking to appoint Outside Officers, taking advantage of an external perspective in order to enhance corporate value over the medium- to long-term.
“K” LINE has established a set of criteria to determine the level of independence of Outside Directors and only Directors who do not fall under any of the set conditions are considered to be independent.
In order to support the smooth execution of duties of Outside Directors, they are provided with the necessary brief- ings and information prior to meetings of the Board of Directors
and receive reports on important business operations. Further, “K” LINE has appointed personnel to assist our Audit & Supervisory Board Members and has estab- lished regulations concerning these appointments in order to maintain the framework required to assist Audit & Supervisory Board Members in their role within the Company. These assistant personnel do not hold any other concurrent duties and are examined by the Audit & Supervisory Board Members in order to maintain a level of
independence from Directors.

 Governance Risk Management System
We need to recognize diverse management crises and risks, prepare for them, and fulfill our corporate social responsibility when the risks become reality. To this end, we have established our own system for managing crises and risks. Specifically, we divide crises and risks into four types and have established four Committees for responding to each of these types. We have also set up a Crisis Management Committee as an organiza- tion to unify the four Committees to control and facilitate overall crisis and risk management activities.
Major Risks Which Affect Our Business
The Group’s main business field, marine transport, is influ- enced by numerous international factors such as economic trends in various countries, product market conditions, sup- ply and demand balance for ships, as well as intra-industry competition. Changes in any of these factors may give a neg- ative impact on the “K” LINE Group’s marketing activities and business results. In particular, a change in tax systems or eco- nomic policies, or an invocation of protective trade policies in Japan or major trading regions and / or countries such as North America, Europe, China, etc., may result in a decrease
in overall volume of international cargo transport or worsen conditions for freight markets. This may give a serious impact on the Group’s financial situation and operating results.
Other major factors that may have a negative impact on our business include, but are not limited to, fluctuation of exchange rates, interest rates and fuel oil prices, public reg- ulations of environmental issues, and occurrence of seri- ous marine incidents, conflicts or natural disasters. For more information, please access “K” LINE’s website.
  Risk Management Promotion System
We have divided various crises and risks into four types: risks in ship operations, risks from disasters, risks con- cerning compliance and other risks related to management and have also established four Committees to respond to each of these types. Furthermore, the Crisis Management
Committee unifies the four Committees in order to control and facilitate overall risk management. Our President & CEO chairs all the Committees with the Committee meetings being regularly held in order to strengthen risk management.

 Governance Compliance
 Strengthening Our Group Compliance System
 Stricter legislation is being enacted to promote fair compe- tition in the international markets where “K” LINE Group conducts business. To respond to the tightening of regu- lations and increasingly severe penalties in various coun- tries, and in light of given the need to strengthen our Group compliance system on a global level, in January 2017 we
established the “K” LINE Group Global Compliance Policy (hereinafter, the Global Policy). The Global Policy consists of the main policy and individual policies. The main policy sets forth common items applicable to general compliance, and the individual policies set forth items applicable to spe- cific fields, such as competition laws and anti-bribery laws.
Our Efforts to Ensure Compliance with Anti-Monopoly Act
 Regarding compliance with domestic and foreign competi- tion laws, we ensure that executives and employees com- ply with the Regulation for Compliance with Anti-Monopoly Act. Furthermore, we are making efforts to ensure com- pliance awareness concerning competition laws through conducting a continuous training program and promo- tion of educational activities by the Corporate Legal Risk & Compliance Group. In addition, we conduct audits and monitor the state of implementation of compliance mea- sures. With respect to contacts with competing compa- nies, we strictly enforce regulations on prior reporting and
approval depending on the nature of the contact, as well as recording and storing details of each contact.

Towards Sustained Value Creation of the “K” LINE Group
Looking Back at Fiscal 2017
Asakura Mr. Hosomizo, you were appointed as Out- side Director of the Company in June 2017. In the pre-
ceding year, freight rate conditions for dry bulk carriers and containerships plummeted to levels never before experienced—a situation that lasted almost one year. It was one of the most challenging years ever for the shipping industry, and in fiscal 2017 we did our utmost to recover from those depths. As a result, we managed to achieve profitability across all indicators—operating income, ordinary income, and net income—for the first time in three years. Nonetheless, we are still recovering from the bruises we experienced in the historical market downturn. How did you feel about the Company’s man- agement during such a turbulent era?
Jiro Asakura Director, Chairman
Hosomizo I have been involved in government ad- ministration for around 37 years, and this is my first en-
gagement in the shipping industry. However, I recognize that the foundation of Japan’s existence as a nation lies heavily on trade, and that the shipping industry is an es- sential sector in that context. With these factors in mind, I assumed the role of Outside Director. Since my actual appointment, however, I have witnessed severe market fluctuations and the profound effect they have on earn- ings. This has deepened my recognition of the challeng- es faced by the shipping industry and the importance of managing profit risk.
Role of Outside Directors
     Asakura
Mr. Hosomizo, your appointment to the Company
  52
“K” LINE REPORT 2018
 Governance Dialog between Chairman and Outside Director

  Foundation of Value Creation
was your first experience as Outside Director. How do you view your own role as Outside Director? Also, how do you plan to use your personal insights and experience to help increase the Company’s corporate value?
Hosomizo Since Outside Directors are appointed based on resolution at the Ordinary General Meeting of Share-
holders, I think that considering the interests of all share- holders and supervising corporate management from an external perspective adopting the standpoint of other stakeholders—including business partners and employees— as well as a broader segment of society are missions bestowed on me. In other words, rather than finding the best way of “making money,” my important role is to check whether or not we are “making money fairly” in a manner that leads to sustained growth and improved corporate value over the medium and long terms. What is regarded as common sense inside the Company may not necessarily be acceptable on the outside. Sometimes outside people can make more impartial decisions than insiders. This is called the “bystander’s vantage point.” As followers of Adam Smith would attest, I believe that
an economist must behave according to the fair and neutral voice of the observer inside his/her head, in order for the “invisible hand of God” to function properly in the context of free economic activity. I think my role is to point this out. Once one becomes affiliated with a compa- ny, it is sometimes difficult to act as an impartial observer with personal feelings put aside. For this reason, Outside Directors like myself become the “eyes” of society.
Energizing the Board of Directors
Asakura I hope that you make your observations from strict external perspectives. Now let’s talk about corpo-
rate governance. Over the past few years, the Company has sought to revitalize the Board of Directors as a se- rious priority. In addition to deliberating and approving proposed items, the Board of Directors serves as a fo- rum for discussions aimed at enhancing corporate value through medium-to-long-term company growth. As for the latter, I feel that issue resolution begins when is- sues are gleaned, identified and shared, but there is still room for deeper discussion here. Now, I would like to

 Governance
 As Chairman of the Board of Directors, I will encourage rigorous discussions from a wide range of stakeholder perspectives.
to listen to the opinions of people with broad insights and knowledge and use that feedback to drive the Company forward. The Board of Directors must perform these functions. And because these decisions are so important and difficult, I believe this is the part where the compe- tencies of directors with varying backgrounds are tested.
Hosomizo Certainly the most difficult part about cor- porate management is making decisions on business
investments and divestments. Ultimately, some people rely on “animal instinct,” but whatever the case we must have some criteria of judgment to ensure fairness and transparency above all else. To this end, we recent- ly introduced an advanced operational management mechanism that can be highly evaluated as a “Merkmal” (German for “distinguishing feature”). Rather than using this to decide everything, however, it should be regard- ed as one indicator for making objective calculations. In the business world, there are many cases where one must ultimately rely on “live management judgments” based on many years of experience. Needless to say, we must also consider our responsibilities to customers and the balance of our business portfolio and, where necessary, mobilize our animal instincts when things become uncertain.
Asakura It is neither good, nor realistic, to depend ex- cessively on mechanical judgments. Even when animal instinct-based decisions are necessary, perhaps we must hold a reasonable criterion of judgment as a prerequisite.
Fund-raising and Capital Cost
Asakura By the way, 10 years have passed since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, and Europe and the Unit-
ed States are already looking for ways to end the ensuing period of large-scale monetary relaxation. However, Ja- pan continues on a path of slow inflation, illustrating its support of a reflationary policy aimed at achieving stable economic growth. As a financial expert, please point out what we should be aware of in this financial environment.
Hosomizo Of course, we cannot expect the current unusual situation, with negative interest rates on govern-
ment bonds, to last long. In the case of Japan, however, I think it is not yet time for the Bank of Japan to switch to tapering, which would spark a contraction of its quantita- tive easing measures. Under these circumstances, share- holders and other investors are seeking to generate prof- its that exceed the cost of capital, so it is important for the shipping businesses, with major assets in the form of long-lasting ships, to raise funds, especially through low-interest debt. Therefore, it is more crucial than ever
 hear your frank opinion about how to further enhance the Board of Directors.
Hosomizo There are vertically aligned sales divisions and horizontally aligned corporate divisions, and here at
our Company, the managers of each have a strong ten- dency to fulfill the responsibilities of his/her respective position. Accordingly, there doesn’t seem to be much discussion from overall perspectives. I understand Direc- tors’ primary role is to make transparent, fair and swift decisions with the Company’s shareholders and various other stakeholders firmly in mind. In our Company’s case, however, my impression is that we tend to con- centrate on specialized discussions from the standpoint of each division.
Asakura Thank you for your frank opinion. As Chair- man of the Board of Directors, it is important for me to
remove the barriers between divisions and change Board of Directors meetings to facilitate vibrant discussions from a perspective of shareholders or stakeholders that is broad in scope, and from a company-wide perspective, on the topics such as how we should operate the Com- pany going forward. There was a business owner who expressed the essence of corporate management by us- ing the words “earn,” “reduce” and “prevent.” Although it is relatively easy to improve profitability and reduce costs, it is very difficult to prevent the associated risks. We cannot hope for growth without investment, but we are forced to make important and extremely difficult de- cisions related to its risk management. This requires us
      54
“K” LINE REPORT 2018

  Foundation of Value Creation
to establish strong relationships of trust with sharehold- ers and other investors, as well as with financial institu- tions that provide long-term funds. Management should steer the Company based on clearly-stated long-term goals, rather than short-term performances.
Focusing on 5–10 Years Ahead
Asakura When discussing management reforms at a recent Board meeting, you made the following state-
ment: “It is important to clearly imagine what kind of company we want to be 5 or 10 years from now, then calculate backwards and make incremental changes starting from now.” I totally agree. I think this approach should be encouraged across the Company, regardless of job title. When considering our desired company image 10 years from now, what points should we emphasize?
Hosomizo In corporate management, we should con- sider the idea of “continuity and change.” Some things
should change and some should not. In order to main- tain the current living standard of Japanese citizens, we must import considerable amounts of food and energy, now and in the future. On the other hand, we must also increase exports. In light of this unchanging situation, when considering our vessel fleets, which we keep for 15–25 years, we need to focus on three areas that I be- lieve will change.
The first is addressing energy-related issues closely tied to the global environment, such as measures to curb global warming. This is not simply about the energy need- ed to move ships. There have been vibrant discussions about energy policies for the entire nation, specifically, things that can be developed in Japan, things that must be imported, and things that can be substituted. Custom- er needs will change greatly according to energy policies that are adopted, so it is important to think about also changing our business portfolio to reflect this as well.
Secondly, it is necessary to keep a close watch on the “sharing economy” trend, especially given our strength as a car carrier. Currently, it is estimated that only one in 20 automobiles owned by individuals is actually running. In other words, automobile sales volumes may fall dra- matically if the sharing economy fully materializes around the world. It is difficult to predict how this structural change will play out, but we should add that perspective when investing in car carriers.
The third point is “local production for local consump- tion.” If more and more companies end up making in- dustrial products close to where they are consumed, the need for logistics will decline, but economic growth of emerging economies will go in the opposite direction. We must keep a close watch on economic growth in
emerging economies, as well as how the trend of “local production for local consumption” evolves.
Keeping these long-term perspectives in mind, we need to think about things we can address right now, such as what types of vessels we should be ordering, and where we should build bases when we identify economic growth in emerging economies and the rising need for external services.
Advice for Our Young Employees
Asakura Thank you for your valuable suggestions. In conclusion, can you please give some advice to employ-
ees who toil day-to-day in their workplaces, especially the young employees who will be responsible for the Company’s future?
Hosomizo “K” LINE was the first company in Japan to complete construction of a pure car carrier and an LNG
carrier. By all means, I want our employees to contin- ue cherishing this “enterprising spirit” and “free and open-minded” corporate culture. Without these, we can- not achieve sustainable growth in turbulent times. In my position as Outside Director, I hope to lift everyone up so they can demonstrate the “K” LINE SPIRIT and pursue innovative initiatives without reacting nervously to short- term market fluctuations.

Financial Analysis
Results of Operations
Operating revenues
In fiscal 2017, the year that ended March 31, 2018, the “K” LINE Group reported consolidated operating revenues of ¥1,162,025 million, up 12.8% from fiscal 2016. By business segment, operat- ing revenues from the containership business segment increased 15.3% year-on-year to ¥598,474 million, thanks to recovery in the freight market.
In the bulk shipping business segment, operating revenues rose 14.2%, to ¥521,157 million as a result of shifts that showed signs of improvement in the cape-size market for the dry bulk busi- ness, in addition to an increase in the total volume of complete built-up cars shipped by the car carrier business. The LNG car- rier business and tanker business also operated smoothly under medium- and long-term charter contracts, but market-linked con- tracts were partly affected by softening market conditions.
In the offshore energy E&P support and heavy lifter business segment, operating revenues declined 61.5% to ¥7,472 million. Despite having healthy conditions in the drillship business, the offshore support vessel business was affected by stagnant off- shore development. In the heavy lifter business, all shares of SAL Heavy Lift GmbH, which is in charge of the business, was trans- ferred to SALTO Holding GmbH & Co. KG.
Operating revenues from the other segment declined 1.0% year-on-year to ¥34,922 million.
Cost of sales and selling,
general and administrative expenses
Cost of sales rose ¥82,555 million, or 8.2%, from ¥1,000,744 mil- lion in the previous fiscal year to ¥1,083,299 million, due mainly to an increase in operating costs as a result of steady cargo move- ments. The cost of sales ratio fell 3.9 points, to 93.2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined ¥3,978 million, or 5.3%, to ¥71,506 million.
Operating income
Due to an increase in gross profit, the Company reported a con- solidated operating income of ¥7,220 million, compared with operating loss of ¥46,037 million in the previous year.
Other (non-operating) income (expenses)
The net balance of interest and dividend income and interest expense was negative ¥3,168 million versus negative ¥3,822 mil- lion in the previous year. This resulted from an increase in divi- dend income. The Company recorded an exchange loss of ¥1,541
million versus ¥4,006 million in the previous fiscal year, and an equity in loss of subsidiaries and affiliates of ¥4,601 million com- pared with ¥3,155 million of equity in earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates in fiscal 2016. As a result of these and other factors, other (non-operating) loss amounted to ¥5,257 million compared with a loss of ¥6,351 million in the previous fiscal year.
Profit before income taxes
Total extraordinary gains amounted to ¥35,332 million, due mainly to gain on sales of vessels, property and equipment. Total extraor- dinary losses amounted to ¥20,106 million, due mainly to impair- ment loss and loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act. As a result of these gains and losses, profit before income taxes was ¥17,188 million compared with ¥131,227 million in loss before income taxes in fiscal 2016.
Income taxes
Income taxes decreased ¥1,929 million from ¥6,142 million in the previ- ous fiscal year to ¥4,213 million in the year under review. This was due mainly to revisions in the tax rate for federal corporations in the United States for consolidated subsidiaries located in the Unites States.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests totaled ¥2,591 mil- lion versus ¥2,110 million in fiscal 2016. The increase is partly attributable to an increase in non-controlling interests in the income of ‘K’ LINE (India) Shipping Private Limited.
Profit attributable to owners of the parent
The profit attributable to owners of the parent was ¥10,384 mil- lion compared to the ¥139,479 million loss attributed to the own- ers of the parent in fiscal 2016. The profit attributable to owners of the parent per share was ¥111.13 versus a loss attributable to owners of the parent per share of ¥1,488.23 in fiscal 2016.
Analysis of Sources of Capital and Liquidity
Cash flows
As of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents stood at ¥158,073 million, up ¥1,281 million from a year earlier. The details of cash flows are as follows.
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥1,167 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of ¥43,919 million in the previous year. Main factors were the profit before income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥22,813 million

 versus ¥24,882 million in the previous fiscal year. This mainly reflected purchases of vessels.
Net cash provided by financing activities was ¥22,240 mil- lion compared with net cash provided by financing activities of ¥26,436 million in the previous fiscal year. This change mainly reflected proceeds from long-term loans.
Funding requirements
The “K” LINE Group’s major working capital requirement comes from shipping business expenses in connection with contain- ership services and bulk shipping services. These expenses include operating costs such as port charges, cargo handling costs and fuel costs; vessel expenses such as crew expenses and expenses for overhaul of vessels; and chartering expenses. Other expenses are the costs of service operations such as labor costs in connection with the operation of our logistics / harbor transportation businesses and general administrative expenses for the Group’s business operations such as personnel expenses, information processing costs and other non-personnel expenses. Capital requirements include investments in vessels, logistics facilities and terminal facilities. In fiscal 2017, the “K” LINE Group made capital investments of ¥101,105 million.
Financial policy
The “K” LINE Group places importance on securing low-cost, stable funds to support its business continuity and expansion. The Company meets long-term funding requirements mainly by means of long-term debt from financial institutions, supplemented by the issuance of bonds and new shares. The Company procures short-term operating funds by means of bank loans and the issu- ance of commercial paper, and invests temporary surplus funds in highly- stable and liquid financial assets. The Company employs a cash management system to effectively utilize surplus funds of Group companies in Japan and overseas.
The Company secures liquidity by preparing for any urgent capital requirements by means of a commercial paper issuance program of up to ¥60.0 billion, a ¥43.0 billion line of credit estab- lished under overdraft agreements with financial institutions, and the establishment of an ¥80.0 billion multi-year commitment line with financial institutions in Japan.
The Company has been rated by two Japanese rating firms. As of June 21, 2018, the Company maintained a rating of BBB from Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR), and BBB- from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I). The Company also has short-term credit ratings (commercial paper ratings) of J-2 from JCR and a-2 from R&I.
Financial Position
As of March 31, 2018, total assets amounted to ¥1,041,766 million, down ¥3,444 million from a year earlier. Current assets increased ¥15,302 million year-on-year to ¥396,426 million, mainly due to an increase in accounts and notes receivable.
Fixed assets decreased ¥18,747 million to ¥645,339 million. Within this amount, vessels, property and equipment declined ¥43,434 million to ¥482,954 million, mainly due to a reduced number of vessels. Investments and other assets increased ¥24,947 million to ¥158,640 million, mainly due to a rise in investment in securities.
Total liabilities on March 31, 2018 amounted to ¥798,672 mil- lion, down ¥1,055 million from a year earlier. Current liabilities amounted to ¥283,143 million and fixed liabilities amounted to ¥515,529 million, mainly as a result of a decline in allowance for loss related to business restructuring, although long-term loans and obligations under finance leases increased.
Net assets on March 31, 2018 totaled ¥243,094 million, down ¥2,388 million from a year earlier. Within this amount, shareholders’ equity rose to ¥200,689 million, due mainly to an ¥11,353 million increase in retained earnings. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased ¥12,701 million to ¥16,322 million, mainly attrib- utable to a ¥10,094 million decrease in translation adjustments.
Dividend Policy
The Company regards maximization of returns to shareholders as an important priority. To this end, we endeavor to pay stable div- idends while retaining necessary internal reserves to fund invest- ments in plant and equipment and strengthen our financial position in order to achieve sustainable growth, which is a main priority of our management plan.
The Company’s year-end dividend (record date: March 31 of each year) is subject to resolution at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. As prescribed in the Articles of Incorporation, “by resolution of the Board of Directors, an interim dividend may be distributed by the Company as of the record date of September 30 of each year.”
However, in the medium-term management plan announced in April 2017, the Company has positioned the enhancement of finan- cial strength and stability of business infrastructure as the highest priority. For this reason, the Company will regrettably be unable to distribute year-end dividends.
Dividends for the next term are also currently still undecided because the Company’s highest priority remains the enhancement of financial strength and stability of business infrastructure for the time being.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31, 2018
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 (a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiar- ies have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles gen- erally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to present them in a form which is familiar to readers outside Japan. However, no adjustments have been made which would change the financial position or the results of operations presented in the original consolidated financial statements.
Certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 to the 2018 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on consolidated profit, net assets or cash flows.
The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience and has been made, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at ¥106.24=U.S.$1.00, the approximate rate of exchange prevailing on March 31, 2018. Furthermore, the translation should not be construed as a rep- resentation that Japanese yen have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
(b) Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 294 and 313 subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The prin- ciples of consolidation are to include significant subsidiaries, whose voting interests are owned 40 per cent. or more by the consolidated group and whose decision-making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group through financial or technical support, personnel, transac- tions, and so forth. In addition, significant affiliates whose deci- sion-making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group in various ways are accounted for by the equity method.
For the purposes of consolidation, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized profit among the consolidated group companies have been eliminated.
Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of five years.
(c) Accounting period
The Company and 283 consolidated subsidiaries have a March 31 year end, and the remaining 11 consolidated subsidiaries have a December 31 year end. For five of these consolidated subsidiar- ies with a December year end, adjustments have been made for any significant transactions which took place during the period between their year end and the year end of the Company, and for the other six, a provisional closing of their accounts as of the year end of the Company has been used.
(d) Translation of foreign currencies
Revenues earned and expenses incurred in currencies other than Japanese yen of the Company and its subsidiaries that maintain their books in Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen either at an average monthly exchange rate or at the rate pre- vailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and lia- bilities denominated in currencies other than Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Subsidiaries that maintain their books in a currency other than Japanese yen translate revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign cur- rencies into the currency used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries of domicile.
(e) Translation of accounts of overseas consolidated subsidiaries
The accounts of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling inter- ests of consolidated subsidiaries, are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The components of net assets excluding accumulated other compre- hensive income (loss) and non-controlling interests are translated at their historical exchange rates. Differences arising from transla- tion are presented as translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand, and short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased which can easily be converted to cash and are subject to little risk of change in value.
(g) Allowance for doubtful receivables
An allowance for doubtful receivables is provided at an amount calculated based on the historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receivables plus an additional estimate of probable spe- cific bad debts from customers experiencing financial difficulties.
(h) Inventories
Inventories are mainly stated at cost based on the moving-av- erage method (The method includes write-downs based on decreased profitability).
(i) Securities
Securities are classified into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading secu- rities, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fair value. Gain or loss, both realized and unrealized, are credited or charged to income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at their amortized cost. Marketable securities classi- fied as other securities are carried at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, reported as a separate component of net assets. Non- marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost determined principally by the moving- average method.

Past service cost is amortized by the straight-line method “K” LINE REPORT 2018
Under the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”), net unrealized holding gain on investments in securities of the related taxes, is not available for distribution as dividends.
(j) Vessels, property and equipment and depreciation (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Depreciation of vessels is computed by the straight-line or the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of the respective vessels.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed princi- pally by the declining-balance method over the estimated use- ful lives of the respective assets. However, the depreciation of buildings (excluding accompanying facilities) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 are computed by the straight- line method.
Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to income as incurred. Major improvements are capitalized.
(k) Capitalization of interest expense
Interest expense is generally charged to income as incurred. However, interest expense incurred in the construction of certain vessels is capitalized and included in the costs of the assets if the construction period is substantially long.
(l) Leases
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated by the same methods used for owned fixed assets.
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated to a residual value of zero by straight-line method over the lease term.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee, starting on or before March 31, 2008 are accounted for as operating lease transactions.
(m) Research and development costs and computer software (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred.
Expenditures relating to the development of computer soft- ware intended for internal use are charged to income when incurred, unless these are deemed to contribute to the generation of future income or cost savings. Such expenditures are capitalized as assets and amortized by the straight-line method over their esti- mated useful life of five years.
(n) Retirement benefits
The liability for retirement benefits has been provided principally at an amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obliga- tion after the fair value of the pension plan assets are deducted. The retirement benefit obligations are attributed to each period by the benefit formula method.
Actuarial differences are amortized in the years following the year in which the differences are recognized by the straight-line method principally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees.
principally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is deter- mined as a result of consideration of both the portfolio allocation at present and in the future, and the long-term expected rate of return from multiple plan assets at present and in the future.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries also provide for retirement benefits to directors and audit and supervisory board mem- bers based on their internal rules at the amount which would be required to be paid if all directors and audit and supervisory board members retired at the balance sheet date.
(o) Accrued expenses for overhaul of vessels
Vessels of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) are subject to periodic overhaul. An accrual is provided on the basis of the estimated amount of total expenses expected to be incurred for overhauling the vessels.
(p) Allowance for loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act
In order to prepare for fines and penalties required by overseas authorities relating to the Anti-Monopoly Act, an amount reason- ably estimated to the extent possible is recorded.
(q) Allowance for loss related to business restructuring
In order to prepare for future losses resulting from business restructuring, the estimated amounts are recorded.
(r) Allowance for loss on liquidation of subsidiaries and affiliates
In order to prepare for loss accompanied by liquidation of sub- sidiaries and affiliates, the estimated amount of loss is recorded.
(s) Allowance for directors’ stock benefits
In order to prepare for stock benefits etc., to the directors and the executive officers in accordance with the Regulations for Delivery of Shares to Officers, the allowance for stock benefits is accounted for at the estimated amount of the Company’s stock corresponding to points to be provided to the eligible individuals as of the end of the current fiscal year.
(t) Derivatives and hedging activities
The Group utilizes derivatives of forward foreign exchange con- tracts, interest rate swaps, currency option, currency swap, bun- ker fuel swaps and forward freight agreements to hedge the risk arising from fluctuations in forward foreign currency exchange rates, mainly on forecast transactions denominated in foreign cur- rencies, interest rates, mainly on loan and lease transactions and market prices, mainly on bunker fuel.
If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed under “Special treatment.”
Forward foreign exchange contracts which meet certain crite- ria are accounted for by the allocation method which requires that recognized foreign currency receivables or payables be translated at the corresponding contract rates.
The hedge effectiveness is assessed based on a compar- ison of the cumulative changes in cash flows or fair value of

  the hedged items with those of the hedging instruments in the period from the start of the hedging relationship to the assess- ment date. However, an evaluation of effectiveness is omitted for interest-rate swaps which meet certain conditions for apply- ing the Special treatment.
The Group executes and manages transactions for the pur- pose of risk control of financial market and others in accordance with internal rules. These rules have been established not only to prevent derivative or other transactions from being used for any objective other than their original purpose or from being executed without limitation, but also to ensure the management body exer- cises its oversight functions.
(u) Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized with respect to the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and lia- bilities are measured at the rates which are expected to apply to the period when each asset or liability is realized, based on the tax rates which have been enacted as of the balance sheet date or are subsequently enacted.
(v) Deferred assets
Bond issuance costs are charged to income as incurred.
(w) Distribution of retained earnings
Under the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given fiscal year end is made by resolution of the sharehold- ers at a general meeting held subsequent to the close of the financial year. The distribution of retained earnings with respect to the interim financial period is made by resolution of the Board of Directors.
(x) Revenues and related costs
Revenues of the Group from cargo freight and the related costs and expenses, except for those from container vessels, are rec- ognized in full as of the dates on which the vessels complete their respective voyages (the voyage completion method). Revenues from container vessels are recognized based on the passage of the transportation period (the complex transportation progress method). The related costs and expenses are charged to income as incurred. Revenues and costs with respect to charter services are accounted for on an accrual basis.
(y) Consolidated taxation system
The Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries adopt the consolidated taxation system.
(z) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective (Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting and Imple-
mentation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets)
(1) Overview
On February 16, 2018, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (hereinafter referred to as the “ASBJ”) issued “Revised Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Guidance No.28) and “Revised Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets” (ASBJ Guidance No.26). The ASBJ made the following necessary revisions while adhering
fundamentally to the framework outlined in “Practical Guidelines on Accounting Standards for Tax Effect Accounting.”
The authority for providing related accounting guidance has been transferred from the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants to the ASBJ.
(Major revised accounting treatments)
• Accounting treatment of taxable temporary differences
related to investments in subsidiaries, etc. when an entity
prepares separate financial statements.
• Accounting treatment related to the recoverability of
deferred tax assets in entities that qualify as Category 1, the company has recorded sufficient taxable income to exceed the amount of the deductible temporary differences in the current and prior three years.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the revised implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
(3) Effect of the adoption of implementation guidance
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of the revised implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
(Accounting Standard and Implementation Guidance for Revenue Recognition)
(1) Overview
On March 30, 2018, the ASBJ issued “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29) and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30). The International Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter referred to as the “IASB”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (hereinafter referred to as the “FASB”) in the United States co-developed comprehensive accounting standards for revenue recognition and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (issued as IFRS 15 by the IASB and Topic 606 by the FASB) in May 2014. The ASBJ developed com- prehensive accounting standards on revenue recognition and issued them in conjunction with the implementation guid- ance based on the fact that IFRS 15 will be applied from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be applied from fiscal years starting after December 15, 2017.
As the basic policy in developing accounting standards for revenue recognition, the ASBJ defined the accounting stan- dard starting with incorporating the basic principle of IFRS 15 from a standpoint of comparability between financial state- ments, which is one benefit of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15. Furthermore, the ASBJ added alternative account- ing treatment without impairing comparability when there are matters to be considered related to accounting practices, etc. common in Japan.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.

 (3) Effect of the adoption of accounting standard and implemen- tation guidance
The Company is currently evaluation the effect of the adoption of the accounting standard and the implementation guidance on its consolidation financial statements.
2. Changes in Accounting Estimates
(Allowance for Loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act)
As of March 31, 2017, the Company had recorded the allowance for loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act taking into account a partial settlement of a civil class action in the United States that was subject to the approval by the United States federal court. However, because the case was dismissed by the court during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company reasonably re-calculated the allowance based on this judgment. As a result of this change in accounting estimate, profit before income taxes increased by ¥3,551 million ($33,424 thousand) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
(Allowance for Loss related to Business Restructuring)
In order to prepare for anticipated expenditures resulting from business restructuring in the course of integrating its container shipping businesses and for losses related to chartered ves- sels, the Group had previously estimated such amounts to be incurred and recorded an allowance for loss related to business restructuring.
However, after obtaining additional information as the busi- ness restructuring plan progresses, whereby it is possible to measure the amounts more accurately, the Group has changed its accounting estimate. As a result, the difference between the previous estimate and the current one has been deducted from marine transportation and other operating costs and expenses in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
As a result, gross profit, operating income, profit before income taxes each increased by ¥1,456 million ($13,705 thou- sand) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
3. Additional Information
(Establishment of Holding Company and Operating Company for New Integrated Container Shipping Business) For the integration of the container shipping businesses, includ-
ing worldwide terminal operation businesses outside Japan, the Company, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha have concluded a business integration contract and a shareholders agreement on October 31, 2016.

(New Performance-Based Share Remuneration Plan “Board Benefit Trust (BBT)”)
In accordance with the resolution at the 148th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on June 24, 2016, the Company intro- duced a new performance-based share remuneration plan “Board Benefit Trust (BBT)” for the directors (executive directors only) and executive officers of the Company. This plan purports to fur- ther enhance the connection between the remuneration of the directors (executive directors only) and executive officers, and share value, and thereby raise the directors’ motivation to make contributions to increase the Company group’s long-term perfor- mance and corporate value.
(1) Overview of the transaction
In accordance with the “Regulations for Delivery of Shares to Officers” which was established by Board of Directors’ meeting, the Company awards points to the directors, etc. At the time of their retirement, the directors, etc. who sat- isfy requirements for beneficiaries will be provided shares in proportions to the points which the Company has granted to them. With regard to the shares which will be provided to offi- cers in the future, a trust bank acquires the Company’s trea- sury shares through third-party allotment by using the money entrusted by the Company. Such shares are managed as trust assets separately.
(2) Method of accounting for these transactions
The Company applies the same method as stipulated in the “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employee etc. through Trusts” (ASBJ PITF No. 30 issued on March 26, 2015).
(3) Shares in the Company held by the trust bank
The book value (excluding incidental costs) of the Company, shares now held by the trust bank is accounted for as treasury stock in the net assets section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2018, the book value and total number of treasury stock held by the trust bank are, respec- tively, ¥1,299 million ($12,227 thousand) and 448,100 shares.
With an effective date of October 1, 2017, the Company

“K” LINE REPORT 2018
The Group groups vessels, property and equipment for business use based on the smallest identifiable groups of assets generat- ing cash flows whose income and expenditure are monitored per- petually; however, it groups idle assets individually.
Assets for sale have been grouped as business assets. However, the carrying values of these assets were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts as they are planned for sale. The recoverable amount was measured at net selling value based on the planned sales of amount.
As profitability decreased significantly, the carrying values of assets were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recorded for the year ended March 31, 2018. The recoverable amounts were measured at net selling value, which is reasonably measured by certain third parties for the assets of the tanker business. As to the assets of the bulk carrier business and the container services business, the recov- erable amounts are measured by the value-in-use method based on estimated future cash flows discounted at rate of 3.7 per cent. and 5.8 per cent., respectively.
As profitability decreased significantly, the carrying values of
assets were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recorded for the year ended March 31, 2017. The recoverable amounts are measured by the value-in-use method based on estimated future cash flows discounted at rate of 5.0 per cent. for the assets of the heavy lifter services busi- ness and 6.5 per cent. for the assets of the bulk carrier business and iron ore carrier business. As to the assets of the offshore energy E&P support business and container services business, the recoverable amounts were measured at net selling value, which is reasonably measured by certain third parties, or by the value-in-use method based on estimated future cash flows dis- counted at rate of 6.2 per cent. and 4.3 per cent., respectively.
Since the idle assets’ carrying values were deemed to be irre- trievably lower than the respective recoverable amounts mainly due to decreasing land prices, the carrying values were reduced to their respective recoverable amounts and a loss on impairment was recognized for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The recoverable amounts were measured at net selling value, which was reasonably measured mainly by real estate appraisers.

  7. Short-Term Loans and Long-Term Debt

 8. Income Taxes
The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are subject to a number of taxes based on income, which, in the aggregate, resulted in a statutory tax rate of approximately 28.7 per cent. for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.
The effective tax rate reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2018 differed from the statutory tax rate for the following reasons:
Statutory tax rate
Difference in statutory tax rates of consolidated subsidiaries
Equity in earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, net
Surcharge payment
Tonnage tax
Decrease of deferred tax assets (liabilities), resulting from change in the statutory tax rate Changes in the valuation allowance
Other
Effective tax rate
The details of the differences between statutory tax rate and effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 were omitted because the Group recorded a loss before income taxes for the year.
The tax effects of temporary differences which gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2018 and 2017 are analyzed as follows:

“K” LINE REPORT 2018
(Change in balance of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in line with changes in corporate tax rates)
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which mainly focuses on reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, etc., in the U.S. from January 1, 2018, was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017.
In line with this, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of consolidated subsidiaries in the U.S. as of March 31, 2018 were calculated in accordance with the revised statutory tax rate.
As a result of the change in tax rate, deferred tax assets (after offsetting deferred tax liabilities), deferred tax liabilities (after offsetting deferred tax assets), retirement benefits liability adjustments and total income taxes decreased by ¥35 million ($329 thousand), ¥1,659 million ($15,616 thousand), ¥14 million ($132 thousand) and ¥1,638 million ($15,418 thousand), respectively, and net unrealized holding gain on investments in securities increased by ¥0 million ($0 thousand) as of March 31, 2018 and for the year then ended.

The Group has funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit corporate pension plans (all of them are funded plans) provide for a lump-sum payment or annuity pay- ment determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service.
The retirement lump-sum plans provide for a lump-sum pay- ment, as employee retirement benefits, determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries calculate asset for retire- ment benefits, liability for retirement benefits and retirement benefit expenses, for the defined benefit corporate pension plans and the retirement lump-sum plans based on the amount which would be payable at the year-end if all eligible employees termi- nated their services voluntarily (a “simplified method”).
Certain consolidated subsidiaries participate in a small-and- medium-sized enterprise mutual aid plan as a defined contribu- tion plans.

The Companies Act provides that an amount equal to 10 per cent. of the amount to be disbursed as distributions of capital surplus (other than the capital reserve) and retained earnings (other than the legal reserve) be transferred to the capital reserve and the legal reserve, respectively, until the sum of the capital reserve and the legal reserve equals 25 per cent. of the capital stock account. Such distributions can be made at any time by resolu- tion of the shareholders, or by the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met.
The Company’s legal reserve included in retained earnings at March 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to ¥2,540 million ($23,908 thousand).

12. Land Revaluation
The Company and a certain domestic consolidated subsidiary revalued the land used in their business in accordance with the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998) and the Act to Partially Revise the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 19, March 31, 2001). The effect of this revaluation has been recorded as revaluation reserve for land in net assets, excluding the related deferred income taxes on land revaluation.
The timing of the revaluation was effective March 31, 2002.
A certain domestic affiliate accounted for by the equity method also revalued the land used in their business in accor- dance with the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998) and the Act to Partially Revise the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 19, March 31, 2001). The effect of this revaluation has been recorded as revaluation reserve for land in net assets.
The revaluation of land for business use was calculated by making rational adjustments to the prices posted in accordance with the provision of Article 6 of the Public Notice of Land Prices Act for standard sites set forth in Article 6 of the same act in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pur- suant to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of

one share for 10 shares as of October 1, 2017.
(*2) The increase in the number of shares in treasury stock of 4,484 thou-
sand shares for the year ended March 31, 2018 is due to purchases of 3 thousand shares of less than one voting unit before the implementa- tion of share consolidation, purchase of 4,481 thousand shares related to the“Board Benefit Trust (BBT)” and purchase of 0 thousand shares of less than one voting unit after the implementation of share consol- idation. The increase in the number of shares in treasury stock of 26 thousand shares for the year ended March 31, 2017 is due to purchase of shares of less than one voting unit.
(*3) The decrease in the number of shares in treasury stock of 6,006 thou- sand shares is mainly due to the decrease of 5,995 thousand shares resulting from implementation of share consolidation and sales of 0 thousand shares at request of shareholders owning less than one vot- ing unit after share consolidation.

 the Act on Revaluation of Land (Cabinet Order No. 119 of 1998). However, for some land, the revaluation was calculated by mak- ing rational adjustments to standard prices assessed in accor- dance with the provision of Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of the National Land Use Planning Act for stan- dard sites set forth in Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 1 (a) of the same order in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, by making ratio- nal adjustments to land prices registered in the land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 10 of the Local Tax Act or in the supplementary land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 11 of the same act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, or by making rational adjustments to the value calculated by the method established and issued by the Director-General of the National Tax Agency for computing land value that serves as a basis for the calculation of the tax- able amount for land value tax set forth in Article 16 of the Land- Holding Tax Act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Item 4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land.
At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of land was lower than its carrying value after revaluation by ¥2,628 million ($24,736 thousand) and ¥2,656 million, respectively.
13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
At March 31, 2018, commitments made by the Group for the construction of vessels amounted to ¥28,469 million ($267,969 thousand).
Contingent liabilities for guarantees of loans to affiliates and third- party companies and obligations for additional investment, etc. as of March 31, 2018 are as follows:
14. Provision of Allowance for Loss Related to Business Restructuring
Related to the integration of the container shipping business, a one-time restructuring expense in the amount of ¥11,448 million and loss relating to chartered vessels in the amount of ¥36,441 million were recorded in provision of allowance for loss related to business restructuring at year ended March 31, 2017.
15. Financial Instruments
Status of financial instruments
The Group obtains necessary funding, mainly through bank loans and the issuance of bonds, in accordance with their capital expen- diture plans. Temporary excess funds are invested in highly liquid financial assets, and short-term operating funds are financed by bank loans. The Group utilizes derivatives only for avoiding risks, but does not utilize them for speculation.
Trade accounts and notes receivable are exposed to credit risk in the event of the nonperformance by counterparties. As revenues from marine transportation are mainly denominated in foreign currencies, trade receivables are exposed to foreign cur- rency exchange risk and a portion of them, net of trade payables denominated in the same foreign currencies, are hedged by for- ward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade receivables such as for freight and chartered vessels are exposed to market risks, and some of them are hedged by forward freight agreements. The Group holds marketable securities and investments in securi- ties, which are mainly issued by companies who have a business relationship or capital alliance with the Group, and these securi- ties are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in market prices. The Group also has long-term loans receivable mainly from other sub- sidiaries and affiliates.
The Group has trade accounts and notes payable, which have payment due dates within one year. Funds for certain cap- ital expenditures, such as construction of vessels denominated in foreign currencies, are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, which are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade payables such as payments for bunker fuel are exposed to the risk of fluctuation of market prices, and some of them are hedged by bunker fuel swap contracts. Loans pay- able, bonds, bonds with stock acquisition rights and lease obliga- tions for finance lease contracts are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments. The repayment dates of long-term debt extend up to 57 years subsequent to the balance sheet date. Certain elements of these transactions are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. The Group hedges this risk by entering into interest rate swap transactions. The Group has entered into currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk against trade payables.

(Other Important Matters Related to Current Conditions of the Corporate Group)
The Group has been investigated by the competition authorities in Europe and certain other countries in relation to alleged anti-com- petitive behavior (alleged formation of a cartel) relating to the transportation of automobiles, automotive construction machiner- ies, and other automotive vehicles. In February 2018, the Group received the notice from the competition authorities in Europe that the Group shall pay a fine of €39.1 million. In addition, mul- tiple service providers including the Group are currently subject to class actions in North America in relation to the same matter.

  Regarding derivatives, the Group has entered into: 1) for- ward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk arising from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and funds for capital investment to acquire operating assets such as vessels and others; 2) bunker fuel swap contracts to hedge the risk of bunker fuel price fluctuation; 3) forward freight agreements to hedge the risk of fluctuation of market prices; and 4) interest-rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuation aris- ing from interest payables for long-term payables and bonds.
For information on hedge accounting policies of the Group, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (t) Derivatives and hedging activities.
The Company monitors regularly the condition of major busi- ness counterparties by each related business division with whom the Company has accounts receivable for business or loans receivable, and manages the outstanding balances and due dates by counterparties, to minimize the risk of default arising from any decline in the financial condition of counterparties. Its consoli- dated subsidiaries also monitor the condition of accounts receiv- able and loans receivable under a similar management policy.
The Group believes that the credit risk of derivatives is insig- nificant as the Group enters into derivatives transactions only with financial institutions which have a sound credit profile.
For receivables and payables denominated in foreign cur- rencies and future loans related to investment in vessels, the Company has entered into currency swap and forward foreign
Estimated fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and the estimated fair value and the difference between them are shown in the following table. The table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value.
exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluc- tuation risk, and interest-rate swap contracts to minimize interest rate fluctuation risk of loans and bonds. For marketable securi- ties and investments in securities, the Company continuously reviews the condition of holding securities considering the stock market and the relationship with issuing companies, taking into account market value of securities and financial condition of issu- ing companies in accordance with internal regulations.
The Company enters into derivative transactions with the approval from authorized officers in accordance with internal regulations, which set forth transaction authority and maximum upper limit on positions. Results of derivative transactions are regularly reported at the executive officers meeting. Its consol- idated subsidiaries also manage derivative transactions under similar regulations.
The Company manages liquidity risk by preparing and updat- ing cash management plan on timely basis and maintaining liquid instruments on hand based on reports from each business group.
The fair value of financial instruments is based on market price, if available. When there is no market price, fair value is reasonably estimated. Fair value can fluctuate because differ- ent assumptions may be adopted for calculations of fair value considering various factors. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 16. Derivatives and Hedging Activities are not necessarily indicative of the actual market exposure involved in the derivative transactions.

(*) The value of assets and liabilities arising from derivative transactions is shown at net value, and the amounts in parentheses represent net liability position.
 Fair value of cash and deposits and accounts and notes receiv- able – trade is based on carrying value as most of them are settled within a short term and their fair value approximates carrying value.
Fair value of equity securities and investments in securi- ties is based on market prices prevailing in the applicable stock exchange. Fair value of debt securities is based on market prices provided by financial institutions. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to Note 4. Marketable Securities and Investments in Securities.
Fair value of accounts and notes payable – trade and short- term loans is based on carrying value as most of them are set- tled within a short term and their fair value approximates carrying value, except for the current portion of long-term loans whose fair value is based on the same method as long-term loans.
Fair value of bonds is mainly based on market prices.
Fair value of long-term loans is mainly based on the pres- ent value of the total amount including principal and interest,
discounted by the expected interest rate assuming a new bor- rowing of a similar loan.

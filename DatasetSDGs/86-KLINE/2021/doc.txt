Message from the CEO
“K” LINE will continue to fulfill its social mission as a shipping company while providing
new value to achieve
ongoing improvements in corporate value.
Yukikazu Myochin
President & CEO

   Commitment Represented by
the Fiscal 2021 Management Plan Theme
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a temporary period of stagnancy in economic activity, while drawing attention to a number of issues that had not previously been apparent. Concurrently, the pandemic stimulated changes in peo- ple’s behavioral patterns, such as teleworking, while sparking an increase in concern about reducing our envi- ronmental impact. These trends have created a drive for industries to transform themselves in order to achieve decarbonized operations.
“K” LINE’s mission is to fulfill its role as a shipping company—that is, ensuring that logistics channels remain fluid—and to continue providing an indispensable piece of social infrastructure that supports people’s lives. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed the importance of safe and economically sound operation of vessels and of the need to achieve our targets for reductions in our envi- ronmental impact. At the same time, the pandemic pre- sented a need to further build upon our expertise in providing safe, high-quality, and eco-friendly services and the engineering and digital technologies that underpin this insight. “K” LINE must also continue to achieve sus- tainable growth with stable earnings by supplying reliable services while utilizing its expertise and experience to grow together with society and the global environment. This is the commitment represented in the fiscal 2021 management plan’s theme of “Connecting the World via Oceans and Technology.”
The “K” LINE Spirit Shows True Potential in the Face of Adversity
“K” LINE boasts a long history spanning more than 100 years. Our ability to survive for this long period is a result of our continuous efforts to adapt to the volatile market envi- ronment by capitalizing on our strength in sales, acting with a sincere attitude, and offering sales proposals that meet customers’ needs. The “K” LINE spirit has been our guid- ing principle throughout this process. To further reinforce our strength in sales, it will be important for all employees to remain receptive to changes in customer trends in order to respond flexibly on an organizational level.
If we turn to the automotive industry, for example, we will see the acceleration of initiatives for adopting alterna- tive energy sources and contributing to the realization of a decarbonized society. These initiatives take forms such as the transition to electric vehicles and other so-called connected, autonomous, shared, and electric (CASE) technologies.*1 In addition, customers are increasingly expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ways that extend to the direct and indirect emissions from busi- ness activities while pursuing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across supply chains and the lifecycles of their products. For this reason, it is vitally important for “K” LINE to provide safe and reliable transportation, which is at the core of our services, as well as to offer solu- tions to address customers’ decarbonization needs. If we do not, customers might not recognize us as a reliable business partner.
One step forward in this regard was building CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN, “K” LINE’s first LNG-fueled vessel. Completed in March 2021, this car carrier represents a completely new undertaking for “K” LINE and is an amal- gamation of the latest technological advancements. In addition to contributing to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts, CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN employs the latest digital technologies and onboard internet infrastructure. Moreover, its con- struction was funded using climate transition loans*2 designed for financing initiatives for decarbonizing operations (see pages 24–27).
We are already in the process of pursuing new innova- tions after CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN. Specifically, we are currently planning to build an LNG-fueled Cape-size bulk carrier. Our first LNG-fueled bulk carrier, this will be equipped with the Seawing automated kite system for utilizing wind power, a unique and innovative provision for decarbonization.
These initiatives are all prime examples of the “K” LINE spirit (independence and autonomy, broad-mindedness, and enterprising spirit). In the current highly uncertain business environment, we aim to become a company that transforms adversity into opportunities and perceptively senses changes in order to contribute to the future.
*1 This term refers to technologies expected to transform the automotive industry going forward.
*2 This is a financing program designed to contribute to the transition to a carbon- neutral society by providing efficient funding to the initiatives of companies that are working toward decarbonization.

The “K” LINE Group’s Value Creation

 Message from the CEO
 Management Policies for Achieving Ongoing Improvements in Corporate Value
“K” LINE is pursuing improvements in its ability to flexibly evolve to adapt to future uncertainty, while striving to become more unique by continuously promoting innova- tion in advance of change. With these objectives in mind, we have defined the following five business strategies in our management plan for fiscal 2021. Through these strat- egies, we aim to identify the best-possible course of action based on the outlook for social and business envi- ronment changes and to achieve ongoing improvements in corporate value through this course.
Refining Our Four-Pillar Business
The four pillars of “K” LINE’s operations are its Dry Bulk, Energy Resource Transport, Car Carrier, and Logistics and Coastal and Short Sea businesses. We aim to improve the profitability of these businesses.
One measure for refining these businesses will be to continue and accelerate efforts to optimize our fleet scale, for which we achieved a certain degree of results in fiscal 2020. The optimization of our fleet scale is crucial, as strengthening our resilience to changes in a volatile market will be absolutely essential to improving corporate value in the future. Accordingly, we will move forward with fleet scale optimization ahead of schedule to prepare for unforeseen circumstances and facilitate flexible responses to any future temporary market downturns. Our focus in
optimizing our fleet scale will not be limited to cutting down on high-cost vessels. Rather, we intend to improve overall asset value by assembling a fleet of highly com- petitive, and therefore profitable, vessels with exceptional levels of safety and superior environmental performance.
Another measure for refining our business pillars will be fortifying our ability to provide clients with new ideas. This measure is a reflection of my desire to continue to propose new ideas to customers in the future. Up until fiscal 2019, we were forced to focus on liquidating the unprofitable assets with which we had been saddled as
a result of prior excessive investments. However, we are now nearing the end of this process. By tackling new challenges suited to this new phase, we hope to propose new value to customers. Setting forth the measure of fortifying our ability to provide clients with new ideas is symbolic of our commitment.
If we cannot continue to propose new ideas to customers, we will not be able to become a reliable partner for customers.
Through our history, we have proceeded to produce unique new services based on our identity as exemplified by the “K” LINE spirit. Our development and proposal capabilities have always been the Company’s strength. These capabilities can be seen in the “Corona Series” of dedicated thermal coal carriers that became the standard in the shipping industry for supplying coal for thermal power plants in Japan due to their proprietarily devel- oped wide-beam, shallow-draft structure. However, if we cannot continue to propose new ideas to customers, we will not be able to become a reliable partner for custom- ers. As the leader of “K” LINE, I am committed to building an organization where all employees work diligently to create new value based on unrestrained ideas and
a flexible approach.
Venturing into New Business Areas
“K” LINE will venture into new business areas to create value. In particular, we will focus on fields related to safety and the environment, which we are exploring actively under the leadership of four dedicated groups: the GHG Reduction Strategy Group, the Carbon-Neutral Promotion
   8

 Group, the Fuel Strategy & Procurement Group, and the Advanced Technology Group. Pooling our technologies and expertise through these groups, we will seek to develop growth businesses by concentrating the alloca- tion of management resources on fields in which we can utilize “K” LINE’s accumulated expertise and engage in co-creation with trustworthy partners.
In fields related to the realization of a low-carbon and ultimately carbon-free society, we have already begun developing LNG bunkering businesses at Mikawa Bay in Japan as well as in Singapore. As another example, we established “K” Line Wind Service, Ltd., as a joint venture with Group company Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., in June 2021. “K” Line Wind Service was created to offer support services to offshore wind power generation busi- nesses with the aim of facilitating our entry into this area. This company has started operations, and it is receiving numerous inquiries from potential customers in Japan and overseas.
Furthermore, “K” LINE is taking part in verification tests as part of its efforts to develop technologies related to next-generation fuels, such as ammonia, hydrogen, and biofuels, with an eye to the decarbonization trends antici- pated after the 2030s. To accurately identify the business opportunities brought by technological innovation, mem- bers of “K” LINE, myself included, are learning from a range of experts with regard to next-generation fuels in order to continually update our knowledge regarding the technological hurdles to ensuring safety and commercial- izing these technologies and the challenges in developing supply chains.
Accelerating Business Development Abroad, Particularly in Asia
Asia is a growing market where we expect significant growth in shipping demand. In this region, “K” LINE is currently developing business portfolios for its four-pillar businesses on a country-by-country basis. In addition, we are utilizing the networks with local business partners established through the containership business that was integrated into Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONE) as well as the “K” LINE brand, which is backed by years of experience.
We expect increased transport demand for energy resources. The Asian market is projected to see growth in energy demand, but countries in this region are still rela- tively dependent on other countries for their energy needs. In LNG transportation, for example, we are
offering small-scale transportation services for countries where port infrastructure has not yet been developed for large-scale vessels. “K” LINE will also cater to various types of energy demand, such as that for renewable energy.
In business fields other than energy, we are developing portfolios to grow our businesses by fully utilizing the business resources in each country. Accordingly, we are advancing established businesses in China and India and incorporating demand in the Middle East, South Africa, and other emerging countries through trilateral transpor- tation in the dry bulk vessel business; we will be expanding our service network to meet new demand arising from advancements in electric vehicle and other automotive technologies in the car carrier business; and we will be addressing local needs flexibly through collaboration with partners in the logistics and short sea businesses.
Achieving Further Competitiveness
in Containership Business
The company just mentioned, ONE, is a company created by integrating the containership operations of Mitsui O.S. K. Lines, Ltd., Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, and “K” LINE in 2018. This company is positioned as an equity-method affiliate of “K” LINE. Although ONE faced difficulties in its first year, it succeeded in generating synergies of ¥110.0 billion in fiscal 2019, the initial target set at the time of the integration. This feat was accomplished by incorporating the best practices of the three companies.
ONE has been achieving increases in earnings due to the strong growth in demand that has continued since the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as the favorable trends in freight rates. We expect that supply and demand will gradually return to normal levels as a result of COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and the subsequent easing of activity restrictions. It is when supply and demand return to normal that the true strength of ONE will be tested.
“K” LINE is committed to providing ONE with ongoing support in the form of human and other resources.
Improving Corporate Value
“K” LINE had put forth a target of achieving equity capi- tal of ¥300 billion or more by the mid-2020s. However, we managed to accomplish this target in the first quar- ter of fiscal 2021, substantially earlier than expected. This was a result of an increase in retained earnings stemming from the sale of businesses in conjunction with portfolio restructuring and improvements in the performance of ONE.

The “K” LINE Group’s Value Creation

 Message from the CEO
With this sooner-than-expected improvement in our financial base, we are now poised to move on to the next stage. We are in the process of drafting new management plans that incorporate growth strategies and disciplined investments in preparation for our move to this next stage. Looking ahead, we intend to redefine our core values and develop growth strategies in accordance with these redefined values. At the same time, we will continue to enhance our financial base and secure stable earnings while examining potential growth investments with a focus on balancing risks and returns.
We also recognize that shareholder returns are an important management priority. We are thus assessing
the ideal level of capital and reviewing our capital policies, including shareholder returns, for the next stage.

We are . . . assessing the ideal level of capital and reviewing our capital policies, including shareholder returns . . .
The COVID-19 Pandemic and Onboard Workstyle Reforms
The “K” LINE Group’s corporate principle is to earn “trust from all over the world” and thereby “contribute to soci- ety so that people live well and prosperously.” In addition, our vision is for “K” LINE to be trusted as an “important infrastructure for global society,” indicating our commit- ment to fulfilling our responsibility to society. COVID-19 tested the depth of our resolve toward this commitment.
Our top priority in responding to the COVID-19 pan- demic was ensuring the safety of seafarers. The staff of seafarers who operate “K” LINE Group vessels is com- prised of around 4,000 employees from approximately 20 countries. Of these, more than 3,000 are from the Philippines. As COVID-19 prompted many countries to close their borders, the opportunities for seafarers to embark and disembark were limited. As a result,
in July 2020, the peak of such border closures, 1,100
of our seafarers had been on board for more than 10 months, a period that would have been unthinkable in normal circumstances.
Coordinating with the relevant authorities, the “K” LINE Group sought to encourage the global society to join us in pursuing a swift resolution to the issues regarding the inability to change crew members. We also took our own steps to address these issues. Actions by the Group included, of course, exhaustive measures for preventing the infection of ship crew members by COVID-19. In addition, we expanded the range of onboard recreation options available to seafarers, to help them relieve the additional stress accumulated during their extended stays on board while providing mental and physical care to their families. Furthermore, additional allowances were provided to employees who had been scheduled to board but were forced to remain on standby due to travel restrictions.
The improvement of working environments for maritime employees is important, not just to address the current challenges but also for securing employees over the long term and for transmitting our safety culture and tech- niques. For this reason, we launched the “K-Smart” Project with the aim of installing digital technologies into vessels for the purpose of accelerating workstyle reforms. This project has involved installing onboard communication equipment, upgrading onboard networks through Wi-Fi and other methods, and taking steps to boost signal trans- mission between land and seafaring vessels. Through the project, we intend to increase safety and transportation quality by digitizing and streamlining certain onboard processes to reduce the burden placed on maritime
    10

  employees. As we move forward with these advancements, enhancing cybersecurity will also be an important task for fully capitalizing on the introduction of digital technologies into vessels and ensuring safe navigation.
Forward-Looking Sustainability Management
The “K” LINE Implementation Guideline for the Charter of Conduct states that “‘K’ LINE will eliminate any dis- crimination in employment or compensation based on nationality, gender, religion, social class, or other social status, and ensure equal opportunity in the implementa- tion of the human resources management.” Based on this principle, we are committed to positioning our employees where they can make the greatest possible contributions to our global business model, regardless of their gender or nationality. Most of all, we realize that if we do not offer an environment in which every employee can heighten and exercise their skills, with no division between mari- time and onshore employees, then we will not be able
to continue our business in the future.
We realize that if we do not offer an environment in which every employee can heighten and exercise their skills, with no division between maritime and onshore employees, then we will not be able to continue our business in the future.
Sustainability management, I believe, is something that should not be practiced based on a short-term perspec- tive, but rather should employ a longer-term perspective. Moreover, the perspective of sustainability management is incredibly potent for projecting social changes and the resulting changes in customer needs and thereby ensur- ing that we can provide valuable services in this projected future. I hope to fulfill our mission as a shipping company and achieve ongoing improvements in corporate value. Organization and human resource development to help employees exercise their skills, as well as business activi- ties that contribute to the realization of a low-carbon and ultimately carbon-free society, are undertakings aimed at achieving these goals.
“K” LINE movie “Thank You Seafarers: Unsung Heroes”
In June 2020, employee volunteers released a video tribute to the seafarers who were facing challenging con- ditions due to our inability to undertake crew change- overs. This video deeply moved me. The messages were filled with respect and support for our colleagues, who were working around the clock in the face of this unfore- seen adversity. I feel that these messages embody the concept of respecting humanity that is included among our values, as well as the broad-minded perspective which is part of the “K” LINE spirit. When Group employees recognize our corporate principle and vision as something that relates to themselves and reflect it in their actions,
I believe it is incredibly meaningful when it comes to envisioning the future and providing new value. I will continue to carry out management based on our corporate principle and vision going forward, to further improve corporate value.
I look forward to the continued understanding and support of all of our stakeholders.

 Growth Potential of the Asian Market
 “K” LINE’s business strategies for accelerating
the global development of its business include expanding its overseas network, collaborating with local partners, generating synergies between “K” LINE Group companies, and training management personnel. A particular target of these strategies will be Asia, which is expected to account for nearly 5.0 billion of the projected global population of more than 8.5 billion people in 2030. In this market, we

anticipate increases in logistics demand driven by population growth and rises in purchasing power. We also forecast increases in demand for electricity and other forms of energy as a result of population growth. At the same time, there will be efforts to support the decarbonization policies of national governments, giving rise to demand for transporting energy resources as needed to accommodate government energy and environmental policies.

In fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary dip in transportation demand, which mainly affected the Company’s dry bulk and car carrier businesses. As a result, operating revenues decreased 14.9% year on year. Nonetheless, ordinary income rose steeply to ¥89.5 billion, primarily thanks to a solid performance by our containership business operated by equity-method affiliate ONE. The affiliate performed well due to increased cargo demand and stable short-term freight rates—particularly from the second half of the fiscal year onward—which stemmed from stay-at-home demand, etc.

In fiscal 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was recorded due to profit before income taxes, and net cash provided by investing activities was booked as a result of income from the sale of shares of a subsidiary, which accompanied a change in the scope of consolidation. Consequently, positive free cash flow of ¥50.4 billion was recorded.
In fiscal 2020, we gave first priority to continued efforts to improve and strengthen our financial position, and it was with sincere regret that we decided not to pay a dividend for the fiscal year. Further, TSR increased significantly year on year.

Business Environment and Performance in Fiscal 2020
As a company that supports global logistics infrastructure with its operations centered on shipping, “K” LINE’s busi- ness has a high level of susceptibility to changes in the business environment, particularly with regard to global economic trends. One such change was the global COVID- 19 pandemic, which struck the world in early 2020. The pandemic and the ensuing infection prevention measures implemented in countries around the world had a massive impact on individual lifestyles, economic activities, and political trends across the globe. At “K” LINE, we saw rela- tively favorable performance when it came to energy-related businesses, such as LNG carriers and oil tankers. However, dry bulk carriers, car carriers, and other businesses were negatively affected by emergency production adjustments by cargo owners during the first half of the fiscal year.
Meanwhile, market conditions for containerships underwent a massive change in a manner that differed
from our expectations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, cargo movement suffered a sudden, temporary decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This changed in the third quarter, when lockdowns were implemented by gov- ernments in countries such as the United States and in Europe; demand for consumer goods related to people staying at home increased sharply, causing a rapid recov- ery in cargo demand on Asia–North America trade routes. This strong demand resulted in serious shortages in cargo space and container boxes while measures for preventing COVID-19 infections caused labor shortages at ports, which slowed terminal operations. The slowdown in termi- nal operations, coupled with the congestions in in-land transportation of containers, led to supply chain disrup- tions and consequently a rise in freight rates in the containership market that soared past historic highs.
As a result of these factors, operating revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased ¥109.8 billion year on year, to ¥625.5 billion; ordinary income rose ¥82.1 billion, to ¥89.5 billion; and profit attributable to owners of the parent increased ¥103.4 billion, to ¥108.7 billion.

2025, and in fiscal 2020 we were able to reduce our fleet by 25 vessels, centered on aged and low-margin vessels. In other words, we were able to achieve roughly half of our five-year reduction target in the single year of fiscal 2020. This accomplishment was a result of our quick response to favorable market conditions pertaining to secondhand vessels. By maintaining a flexible stance going forward, we aim to optimize our fleet scale ahead of schedule whenever possible.
Acceleration of Initiatives for Safety, the Environment, and Quality
Ensuring safety in navigation is a top management prior- ity. With this focus, we took steps to protect maritime employees from the threat of COVID-19. Specifically, we prioritized improving employee welfare benefits for mari- time employees with long stays on ships, providing mental and physical care to their families, and subsidizing the income of standby crews. The benefits of these mea- sures manifested in our recording zero major accidents during fiscal 2020, despite the difficulty in switching out crew members.
Meanwhile, reducing environment impacts is also
a top management priority, as is safety in navigation.
In this regard, we completed construction of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN, our first LNG-fueled car carrier, based on the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050 (see pages 24–27). CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN represented the first
In light of the exceptionally unpredictable environment seen in April 2020, the start of fiscal 2020, “K” LINE announced a single-year rolling management plan, as opposed to the three-to-five-year medium-term manage- ment plans it usually presents. The purpose of the single- year plan was to allow the Company to respond more flexibly to changes in the short term amid the uncertain conditions. The main focus of the plan formulated for fiscal 2020 was to facilitate a measured response to the current market changes and to define medium- to long- term directives to be pursued based on an outlook for the post-COVID-19 business environment. Next, we will dis- cuss some of the concrete business policies that were implemented based on this focus.
Strengthening of Business Resilience in the Short Term
All product logistics businesses, including the dry bulk business and the car carrier business, suffered from large decreases in demand in the first half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengthening our resilience toward these conditions is thus a top priority. One specific measure for accomplishing this goal was fleet scale optimization. In this regard, we set a target
of downsizing our fleet by 52 vessels leading up to fiscal

time that climate transition loans in Japan were used to fund shipbuilding. This new undertaking thus expanded the potential for procuring funds for initiatives related to the transition to decarbonized operations.
Medium- and Long-Term Targets
and the Fiscal 2021 Management Plan
Traditionally, our shipping business has been prefaced on the idea that vessels continue producing profit over at least 20 years of operation. However, the recent tighten- ing of environmental regulations and accelerating techno- logical innovation have made it increasingly unclear whether a newly built vessel will be able to maintain its competitiveness over such a long term. At the same time, it is clear that the global society will continue to imple- ment stricter environmental regulations and come to expect greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, in order to address climate change issues through means such as achieving a state of carbon neutrality. In response to these trends, companies have begun assessing all pro- cesses throughout their global supply chains with the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions across the entire lifecycles of their products, whether these products are automobiles or some other offering. Meanwhile, the ship- ping industry is undergoing a massive paradigm shift, the likes of which only come around once in a century. This shift can be seen in trends including the use of new fuel sources such as hydrogen and ammonia as replacements for conventional fossil fuels and companies pursuing the development of next-generation automated ship naviga- tion systems. If we are unable to adapt to these changes, our business will fail to survive.
These changes to the shipping industry present both opportunities and risks. The “K” LINE Group was among the earliest companies in Japan to endorse recommenda- tions of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in 2018. This move was symbolic of our acknowledgment of these opportunities and risks and
of our strong commitment to addressing them through aggressive action.
“K” LINE has set targets for increasing equity capital and return on equity. We had originally intended to work toward these targets over a period of five to 10 years, but we now expect to achieve these targets in fiscal 2021. This outcome will be due to the improvement of performance at Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd., recovery of earnings in “K” LINE’s own businesses, and sales of the stock of our North American logistics subsidiaries.
Given the aforementioned business environment changes, as well as the improvements to our financial base, all of “K” LINE’s business divisions will review their portfolio strategies from a medium- to long-term
perspective. Considering the potential impacts of low- carbon and decarbonization trends on the shipping busi- ness after the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, we seek to reassess the fundamental strengths of “K” LINE while discussing with both internal and external stake- holders our vision as a company that supplies a piece of global logistics infrastructure. Through this process, we look to develop new business portfolios that are more in line with our vision.
In the management plan for fiscal 2021, investment plans have been positioned as an important element of business strategies. There are currently three basic guide- lines for investment plans that have been defined. First of all, we aim to invest a total of ¥250.0 billion, within the amount of operating cash flows, over the five-year period beginning with fiscal 2021. Secondly, we will budget ¥100.0 billion out of this amount for environmental investments. Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth fields while care- fully assessing the inherent risks based on our progress in improving our financial position. “K” LINE has no inten- tion of abandoning its basic stance toward discipline in its finances and investments. However, we recognize that it is important to revise our investment plans in line with busi- ness plans for fiscal 2022 and beyond based on the afore- mentioned efforts to develop new business portfolios and the need to accelerate environmental investments.
Enhancement of Risk-Return Management
When making investment decisions, we will also focus on enhancing risk-return management, which we have been enhancing over the past several years, and of improving the accuracy of said management. We have already installed business division-level frameworks for quantify- ing the risk of the maximum-possible business losses that can be projected based on measured statistics. We use “K” LINE Value after Cost of Shareholders’ equity (“K” VaCS), a unique earnings indicator that shows economic value with an emphasis on the cost of shareholders’ equity and business risks, to guarantee returns matched to risks and to determine the Group’s optimal business portfolio. Another unique indicator is “K” LINE Return on Invested Capital (“K” RIC), an efficiency indicator that factors in the cost of capital. This indicator is used to set Groupwide and business division-specific hurdle rates to ensure that returns match amounts of invested capital.
“K” LINE has also recently introduced a framework in which internal carbon pricing standards are set to evaluate investments. Specifically, we have defined a unique eco- nomic indicator based on the benchmark of ¥4,000 per ton of CO2 emissions. LNG-fueled vessels are more expensive to build than conventional fossil fuel-using vessels. Accordingly, it was impossible for investments
  22

 “K” VaCS
–“K” LINE Value after Cost of Shareholders’ equity–
   “K” RIC
–“K” LINE Return on Invested Capital–
    • A profit indicator that represents economic value corresponding to the cost of shareholders’ equity
• Aims to optimize the Group’s business portfolio based on quantified business department-basis risk values
Formula
“K” VaCS = Net income after tax – (Business risk based on the Group’s business attributes x Cost of shareholders’ equity)
Note: If “K” VaCS is greater than zero, then corporate value is enhanced
in these vessels to clear hurdle rates based on prior investment standards. Setting internal carbon pricing standards, however, allows for decisions to be based
on the trend toward a carbon-free society, making these standards a valuable indicator.
Improvement of Corporate Value and Shareholder Returns
As I have mentioned, we project that the earnings and equity capital improvements targeted by the fiscal 2021 management plan will be accomplished significantly ear- lier than initially forecast. Accordingly, we intend to pursue ongoing increases in total shareholder return by achieving stable improvements in return on equity through growth in ordinary income and equity capital.
Resuming dividends as quickly as possible is a top management priority. The spin-off of our containership business to form an equity-method affiliate means that the earnings of this business will only be recorded on our consolidated financial statements, and will therefore not have a direct impact on non-consolidated earnings. At the same time, it is a rule that dividend payments must be limited to the amount of retained earnings on the balance sheet, which represents non-consolidated earnings as defined by the Companies Act of Japan. In other words, it is difficult to determine the level of dividends it is possible for the Company to pay just by looking at disclosed fig- ures for consolidating earnings. For this reason, we aim to increase non-consolidated dividend income, which is not reflected in consolidated earnings, by growing earnings from business other than the containership business.
We will make the utmost effort in this regard with the objective of resuming dividend payments.
Future Vision for Maritime Businesses

We also must strengthen our countermeasures against new risks, such as the ever more destructive threat of cyberattacks. Specific risk factors we are being mindful of include those with the potential to boost market volatility, such as the move to decouple the U.S. and Chinese econ- omies and the resumption of rises in COVID-19. We also recognize the importance of developing a fleet that allows for flexible adjustments in fleet scale to enable us to respond to sudden changes in the supply and demand balance without increasing the overall scale of our fleet.
The trend toward a carbon-free society brings with it expectations regarding eco-friendliness and other factors. Providing new services that address these expectations will require us to exercise leadership in developing busi- ness models that exceed the boundaries of conventional frameworks. Moreover, it is possible that the prior industry reorganization trend seen as centered on containership businesses will accelerate, causing increased consolida- tion focused on highly creditable shipping companies.
I believe that it is crucial for “K” LINE to maintain a strong corporate constitution if it is to make swift, accu- rate, and bold decisions based on a clear outlook for the rapidly changing business environment. This constitution should allow us to effectively select and integrate informa- tion from a wide range of sources and to stay a step ahead of the times. The strength of this corporate consti- tution should be supported by a robust financial platform and consistent stakeholder returns, which will be impor- tant to earning the unwavering trust of society. The busi- ness environment is currently characterized by a high level of volatility, making it incredibly difficult to predict the developments that will be seen even a year into the future. This rings true for the shipping business as well
as for all other businesses. In this environment, “K” LINE is thoroughly committed to advancing its business
and improving corporate value while capitalizing on opportunities, without fear of risks.

     In March 2021, “K” LINE completed construction of the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN LNG-fueled car carrier.
This vessel is the “K” LINE Group’s first LNG-fueled vessel, making it a next-generation eco-friendly car carrier that also represents an important milestone toward accomplishing the goals of the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050. We asked five employees who were involved in this shipbuilding project, which commenced in 2017, about the type of coordination that was needed to advance the project and the insight gained from the process.
  Q: To begin with, could you please explain the relation between your group and the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project, as well as the role you played in this project?
Yamada: I belong to the North America team of the Car Carrier Business Group. In this team, I am responsible mainly for sales activities and communication with auto- mobile manufacturers that ship automobiles from Asia to North America. My role in the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project involved managing the financial outflows and inflows related to the project. I learned from my pre- decessor that the start of this project can be traced to talks between the Car Carrier Business Group and its customers about the possibilities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from marine transportation.
Miyoshi: I am in the GHG Reduction Strategy Group, a group established in April 2021 that is tasked with guiding our next-generation eco-friendly vessel strategies from a technological standpoint. Previously I was in the Ship Technical Group, where I was responsible for advancing shipbuilding in a way that incorporated the technological elements needed to achieve the goal of an LNG-fueled car carrier at the request of the Car Carrier Business Group. As a result, I believe I was involved in the
CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project longer than anyone else here today.
Kuroi: I joined the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project in 2018. I am currently a member of the Car Carrier Planning & Development Group’s fleet management team, where I am responsible for arranging vessels with the capacity to meet cargo transportation needs, whether through new ship- building or chartering. The Car Carrier Business Group, to which Mr. Yamada belongs, was tasked with estimating the outflows and inflows associated with voyages by CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN. I, meanwhile, played a role in negotiat- ing with shipbuilding sites, managing negotiations with relevant internal divisions, and coordinating with ship management companies.
Ebata: I am a member of the Finance Group, which han- dles the procurement of funds for shipbuilding, and I was involved in the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project for roughly one year prior to completion of the vessel. Negotiations with financial institutions on procuring funds to build new ships usually begin around three months before construction is completed. For CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN, however, we started negotiations earlier than normal, given that this was our first LNG- fueled vessel.

Special Feature: Providing New Value
 
  Yamaguchi: Up until 2018, I was a member of the Ship Technical Group together with Mr. Miyoshi. However, I transferred to the newly established AI/Digitalization Strategy Group in 2019 and was quickly assigned to the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project. I joined “K” LINE right around the completion of DRIVE GREEN HIGHWAY, a vessel that boasted world-leading levels of environmen- tal performance at the time. So I hoped one day to be able to take part in a cutting-edge project like that one. This desire became a reality when I was able to participate in this unexpected project, which entailed the construc- tion of a vessel incorporating the latest digital technologies.
Q: We have here today members from five divisions that were involved in this project. Could you please offer some insight into the coordination between internal and exter- nal parties that took place during the development process?
Miyoshi: In terms of coordination with external parties, close sharing of information on the vessel construction was most important with shipbuilding sites. Normally, we would share information with shipbuilding sites in a face-to-face manner during visits to the sites. In 2020, however, we could not make such visits because of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to change course, to make timely adjust- ments in response to any technical issues that emerge during the construction process. For example, in this par- ticular project, we were forced to make a massive change in our schedule as the delivery of the tank, a core component of the vessel, was delayed due to the pandemic. Since
before the pandemic, we have had a shipbuilding supervi- sor stationed at shipbuilding sites in Kagawa Prefecture. This supervisor played a central role in remote communica- tion between Kagawa and Tokyo, through which we shared information on the technical elements of the project. Overcoming the obstacles that occurred during the process of building the vessel through remote communication was a fresh and challenging experience.
Kuroi: “K” Line RoRo Bulk Ship Management Co., Ltd. (KRBS) was entrusted with management of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN. We also took a remote approach toward sharing information with this company. Ship man- agement companies play a core role in ship operation, because they are the ones responsible for managing the maintenance of vessels and their engines, assigning crews, and undertaking other tasks that are necessary to ensure the smooth operation of vessels. KRBS had no prior experience managing LNG carriers or LNG-fueled vessels, meaning that CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN was the first such vessel in their care. It was therefore abso- lutely essential for us to convey our accumulated technical knowledge and skills related to such vessels to KRBS.
Yamada: Coordination between all involved parties was vital to the progress of the project. For example, as we approached the completion of the vessel, we saw an unexpected increase in costs from the estimates formu- lated when ordering the construction of this ship. To limit this rise in costs, frequent communication was pursued with relevant parties inside and outside of the Company to request negotiations when necessary.

CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN
The “K” LINE Group’s Value Creation

  Ebata: The ability of the Finance Group to secure ship- building funding with competitive rates has a direct impact on the profitability of the projects. For this reason, we also sought to share information internally on a frequent basis.
Q: How did “K” LINE’s corporate culture influence coordination and information sharing?
Kuroi: The CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project was a completely new undertaking, and there was thus no room for mistakes. I felt a lot of pressure, and when the uncer- tainty mounted I naturally felt a desire to talk to someone with experience in this area to whom I could ask ques- tions. In times like this, I sought out people within the organization who had experience in operating LNG carri- ers, and these individuals spared no expense in offering me guidance. Thinking back on the process, “K” LINE’s open corporate culture, which allows us to question and receive information from a range of internal parties with ease, was an incredible benefit.

“K” LINE’s open corporate culture, which allows us to question and receive information from a range of internal parties with ease, was an incredible benefit. (Kuroi)
Yamada: I joined “K” LINE around the same time as Mr. Miyoshi and Ms. Ebata. We therefore had been exchang- ing information on an informal basis fairly often, even before our participation in the project began. As Mr. Kuroi said, a corporate culture that makes it easy to communi- cate with others within the organization, including through informal internal networks, is incredibly important.
Yamaguchi: Another vital factor is the ease of moving forward with one’s endeavors. The idea of installing digital technologies to equip CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN with communications infrastructure as a digital flagship was proposed while the vessel was already in the process of being built. This proposal was based on the thinking that, if we were to equip the ship with the latest maritime industry digital technologies, we could achieve higher levels of safety through both environmental performance and digital technologies. Rather than immediately
shooting down the proposal because of its late timing in the process, the Company took a flexible approach to looking at what we could actually accomplish. I think this approach is a major characteristic of the “K” LINE Group.

Yamada: I understand entirely. Personally, I believe that the “K” LINE spirit, which is characterized by an enterpris- ing spirit, drives progress when the diligent individuals in core positions throughout the Company find solutions to the issues we face through individual efforts. For this reason, it is important for those around these individuals to support them and respect their efforts.
Ebata: Our ability to procure funds through climate tran- sition loans could be said to be due to the indirect ben- efits of “K” LINE’s corporate culture of encouraging employees to move forward. One of the major factors considered when screening “K” LINE for these loans was our putting forth Groupwide targets to achieve improve- ments in CO2 efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to an extent that exceeded international indus- try targets in the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050. In other words, our Groupwide environmental initiatives, and the positioning of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN as an important milestone to accomplish our ambitious targets, won a high evaluation.

    Q: What insight has the “K” LINE Group gained through the process of constructing CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN?
Yamada: Amid the rapid push to achieve a decarbonized society that we have been seeing in 2021, we were able to demonstrate the “K” LINE Group’s commitment to our customers and other stakeholders of reducing CO2 emis- sions. This fact reaffirms the importance of making proposals that look to future market trends, even during a challeng- ing operating environment. In 2017, when the CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN project began, infrastructure for supplying LNG fuel was lacking and the shipping market was in decline, which made it difficult to engage in new undertakings. Nevertheless, the Group was quick to see the future potential of LNG-fueled vehicles, and this swift action led to our completion of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN in 2021.

Yamaguchi: The installation of digital technologies on CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN was announced in conjunc- tion with the completion of the vessel’s construction. This announcement spurred an influx of requests for meetings from numerous IT companies with which we had no prior dealings, a development that made it clear how highly society evaluated this undertaking and the amount of attention it was garnering.
Ebata: We also saw a rise in inquiries from ESG financing institutions. In response to such inquiries, the Finance
Group is working to communicate to financial institutions and investors that we are not merely focused on boosting numbers and project totals, but instead engaged in a Groupwide effort to accomplish the goals of the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050.
Miyoshi: The operation of our LNG-fueled vessels and our ship-to-ship LNG bunkering business commenced at essentially the same time, a fact that was incredibly mean- ingful in terms of gaining technical insight into the inter- face between the ships that receive LNG fuel and the ships that supply this fuel. Normalizing marine transport using alternative fuel sources requires the development
of a supply chain for these alternative fuels. The “K” LINE Group is playing a leadership role in establishing this supply chain. However, I also recognize that the true value of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN and its alternative fuel approach with regard to safe navigation and the acquisi- tion of related insight will be demonstrated when the vessel is actually at sea.

Kuroi: The construction of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN was an undertaking that required us to navigate uncharted seas involving new technologies and frameworks. Our successful completion of this vessel will no doubt be a boon for our next innovative project. I hope to use the experience gained through this project in future ship- building plans while pushing ahead with other projects, based on a strong commitment to take the lead in accomplishing the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050.

to achieve carbon neutrality while cementing our presence in this growth market.
Satoshi Kanamori
Executive Officer
In charge of LNG, Carbon-Neutral Promotion
  Utilization of Energy Transportation Experience and Customer Base
“K” LINE established the Carbon-Neutral Promotion Group in April 2021 to facilitate the swift launch of businesses that contribute to carbon neutrality amid an accelerating global decarbonization movement.
We anticipate that markets which promote carbon neutrality will see continuous growth. Factors behind this growth will include increased demand for offshore support vessels for offshore wind energy generation; the establishment of supply chains for alternative fuel sources, such as LNG, hydrogen, and ammonia; the emergence of zero-emission ships
that utilize fuel cells and electric systems; and the commercialization of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) methodologies. With its accu- mulated experience and insight related to energy transportation business of oil, coal, and LNG and offshore support vessels, “K” LINE has been able to earn trust from energy industry customers around the world. We will support customers in their effort to achieve carbon neutrality with this business experience while increasing our presence in this growing market.
New Trends in Carbon Neutrality-Related Business
 In June 2021, operations commenced at “K” Line Wind Service, Ltd. (KWS), a company that provides offshore support vessels and transportation service related to the development, construction, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind power generation projects. KWS is a joint venture with Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen Kaisha Ltd. that combines both parties’ offshore support business expertise as well as the insight of the “K” LINE Group companies pertaining to tug vessel operations and logistics solutions. We plan
to develop the operations of KWS to support the development of offshore wind power generation projects in Japan with a focus on recruiting and training Japanese seafarers, contributing to offshore business communities, and invigorating local communities.
Furthermore, in August 2021, Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., and “K” LINE entered into a joint development agreement with DP Energy, a renewable energy developer headquartered in Ireland, for a tidal energy project in Canada. This project will be the first overseas tidal energy project participated
in by Japanese companies and will entail the installation of three underwater turbine generators.
At the same time, “K” LINE is advancing
R&D activities with an eye to future technological progress, including participation in verification tests for the social implementation of liquefied CO2 maritime transportation (see page 65).

    Overview of Maritime Industry and Carbon Neutrality Trends
 Regulatory Environment
The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized United Nations agency that plays a leadership role in international cooperative actions relating to maritime issues, is responsible for developing environmental policies and other rules for international shipping activities. The initial IMO greenhouse gas strategy launched in April 2018 puts forth the following greenhouse gas reduction targets for international shipping activities: reduce CO2 emissions per transport work by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 2008, reduce total annual greenhouse emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, and phase out greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible in this century.
The IMO’s initial greenhouse gas strategy was originally planned to be revised in 2023, and the revision process is slated to begin in fall 2021.
The European Union, which is taking the lead in environmental discussions, has introduced the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and has proposed instituting stricter international regulations by expanding the application of EU ETS to the entire world. The Japanese government encourages the acceleration of effective policy develop- ment by the IMO instead of simply expanding the application of the EU ETS.
Meanwhile, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was instituted in the aviation industry in 2021, allowing for the utilization of voluntary credits.
Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ship Operations
It is imperative for shipping companies to replace heavy fuel oil with low-emissions fuel to achieve carbon neutrality. In order to transition to low-emissions fuel while maintaining ongoing shipping operations, there is a need to establish supply infrastructure for providing alternative fuels with reliable quality in a timely manner across the globe.
Energy Supply Chain Development
Shipping companies support energy resource supply chains through maritime transportation. The role played by these companies is particularly important in Japan, which depends on imports for a large amount of its energy resources. In the future, it is expected that shipping companies will be able to make continuous contributions to the safe transportation of and development of supply chains for new energy resources, such as hydrogen, ammonia, and CO2, while also transporting traditional energy resources such as oil, coal, and LNG.
The transition to alternative fuel sources is advancing rapidly in power, chemical, and other industries, and it will therefore be important to secure sufficient volumes of fuel over the long term. In order to facilitate this transition to alternative fuel sources, the shipping industry will need to contribute to the establishment of a sustainable and strategic energy supply chain together with the relevant industries.
The transition to renewable energy will facilitate the local generation and local consumption of energy in Japan, and such localization will increase demand for short sea and coastal vessels. These increases in demand will create a greater need for Japanese seafarers to ensure the sustainability of operations, meaning that strategic educational programs are a must.

  Improvement of Safety, Environmental Performance, and Quality with Digital Technologies
As we pursue safety in navigation, the reduction of environmental impacts, and improvements in service quality, we will use data and cutting-edge technologies to create new value.
Hiroshi Uchida
General Manager of AI/Digitalization Strategy Group
   Data Platform Development to Support Digital Transformation
 Guided by its management plan’s theme of “Connecting the World via Oceans and Technology,” “K” LINE is pursuing safety in navigation, the reduction of environ- mental impacts, and improvements in service quality. Our accumulated technological know-how is being utilized along with digital technologies to accelerate our prog- ress toward these goals. At the same time, constituents of the Ship Technical Group, including the Safety and Quality Management Group and the Advanced Technology Group, are teaming up with the Information System Group, business groups, and all other onshore
divisions to create new value.
Responding swiftly to digital transformation trends in
the shipping industry and achieving higher levels of safety, environmental performance, and quality will require the development of data platforms for both onshore and offshore operations. “K” LINE is installing digital infra- structure for communications between onshore facili- ties and vessels at sea while linking data from the Kawasaki Integrated Maritime Solutions integrated vessel operation and performance management system, vessel management data, and data from various internal systems.
Safer Operation and More Sophisticated Operation Management Using AI Technologies
 We started to use the Kawasaki Integrated Maritime Solutions system in 2016, and we have recently been augmenting this system with the latest artificial intel- ligence (AI) analysis technologies. Infusing the system with these technologies enables highly accurate analysis of the impacts of external factors such wind, waves, and currents on the operating performance of vessels at sea. When combined with the navigation optimization sup- port system that is a component of the overall Kawasaki Integrated Maritime Solutions system, these analytical capabilities contribute to more sophisticated operation management along with increased safety and reduced environmental impacts.
“K” LINE is also using AI-powered technologies to
develop autonomous ship technologies. For example,
AI can be used to analyze data collected by the Kawasaki Integrated Maritime Solutions system as well as opera- tion data pertaining to past incidents and maintenance records, which make it possible to optimize the perfor- mance of engine plants and to predict engine trouble
in advance. We are also developing ship maneuvering support systems that use image recognition technologies employing high-spec cameras and AI to avoid collisions with other vessels and prevent vessels from grounding accidents, along with the latest collision risk calculation engines. By introducing such advanced technologies, we aim to reduce the burden placed on crew members while improving safety and transportation quality.
Reforms to Onboard Workstyles and Improvement of Service Quality through Digitalization
   Digital technologies are contributing to reforms to onboard workstyles. We are bolstering the network infrastructure of ships by installing onboard communica- tions equipment and Wi-Fi networks to heighten the efficiency of onboard work. For example, we are utilizing mathematical optimization technologies to automate cargo loading plan preparation in order to allow the planning simulations traditionally conducted onboard to be performed onshore. By sharing information between vessels and onshore facilities in these ways, we aim to expand safety in ship management and develop new frameworks to respond swiftly to customer needs.

Development of next-generation autonomous ship technologies using advanced digital technologies
    Digital Technology Utilization in the Shipping Industry
 Installation of Offshore Broadband Networks
The installation of high-speed communications equipment on ships is significantly behind the installation of onshore infrastructure. However, the spread of satellite communication services and the growth of this market sparked an increase in the speed of communications on ships together with a reduction in costs in the mid-2010s, contributing to the digitalization of onboard work. In the near future, increases in low-orbit satellites are expected to further accelerate the speed of communications on ships.
The spread of broadband networks on ships and the installation of onboard Wi-Fi networks is contributing to improved operational efficiency as well as to increased benefits for crew members. These networks have been espe- cially important since 2020, as they are an invaluable method of communicating with family members and maintaining good mental health for crew members faced with extended stays on vessels due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Maritime Business and Vessel Innovation
The digitalization of vessel navigation systems and terminal operations is becoming more common in the shipping industry, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the overall optimization of operation management. In addition, cutting-edge blockchain technology is being used to streamline processes across the shipping value chain, ranging from fuel procurement and cargo tracking to ship recycling and waste management.
It can be expected that we will see increased use of open platforms for sharing navigation and ship data in conjunc- tion with the acceleration of land and sea communications, the installation of high-speed communication systems and the spread of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. In Japan, the Internet of Ships Open Platform (IoS-SP) ship data sharing platform was implemented in 2018 for the purpose of sharing shipping industry data. In this manner, data sharing and distribution are on the rise in Japan’s shipping industry.
R&D on autonomous ship technologies is moving forward with the goals of improving safety in navigation, onboard work environments, and industry competitiveness and productivity. In Japan, safety engineering guidelines have been established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to facilitate the practical application of autonomous ship technologies, and verification tests related to these guidelines are underway.
Cybersecurity Enhancement
Recent years have seen serious system failures resulting from large-scale cyberattacks, and there have been cases in which weeks have been required to fully recover from attacks or when the alteration of Global Positioning System (GPS) data necessary for navigation has impacted ship courses. For these reasons, enhancing cybersecurity for information systems is a matter of utmost importance for shipping companies.
In response to such issues, the IMO released guidelines on maritime cyber risk management in 2017, and the management of cyber risks through safety management systems based on the International Safety Management (ISM) Code has been strongly encouraged since January 2021.
“K” LINE has been taking steps to enhance cybersecurity by developing a safe and robust global network to effectively manage cyber risks. For example, we received Cyber Security Management System accreditation from ClassNK, and we are working to improve system defense measures and surveillance using the latest technologies to build a safe and strong global network (see pages 54 and 55).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, online meeting systems were used to facilitate two-way communication and brisk exchanges of opinion between onshore and maritime employees.
    “K” ARE Program
 The “K” ARE Program is an initiative focused on the non-technical skills required to ensure safety in navigation and cargo operation. Through this program, we aim to foster a corporate culture in which failures can be used positively by removing the barriers between employees of different ranks under normal circumstances and cultivating workplace environments that facilitate the open reporting and sharing of failures. Moreover, we are encouraging unity among all employees, ranging from frontline staff to management both onshore and at sea, in our efforts to foster a culture of safety, reduce accidents attributable to human error, and eliminate serious accidents.
Safety Report System
KL-QUALITY
“K” Line-Drive to No Accident (K-DNA)
  Reports of near-misses resulting from unsafe behavior on vessels are carefully analyzed by seasoned maritime technical personnel stationed on shore, and the results are communicated back to vessels.
By entrenching a non-blaming culture, where the responsibility of near- miss parties is not called into question, we receive thousands of reports annually, which helps safety awareness to take root on the front lines.
  KL-QUALITY, “K” LINE’s unique quality guidelines, is used by ship supervisors to perform regular onboard inspection of all vessels in operation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these inspections have been conducted remotely using IT and digital equipment.
In addition, we hold an annual Safety Measures Conference for Shipowners to share a variety of information and exchange opinions with the operation managers of the owners of ships used through long-term chartering agreements. Superior shipowners are presented with awards to recognize their accomplishments at this conference.
  “K” Line-Drive to No Accident (K-DNA) is a set of unique safety equipment installation guidelines built on the know-how accumulated on the front lines that also reflects the lessons learned from past accidents. These guidelines epitomize the Company’s DNA with respect to safe vessel operation and include installation standards related to navigation equipment, engine equipment, safety, and piracy countermeasures. By compiling our insight from a range of perspectives, we will continue to enhance the K-DNA guide- lines to improve the safety of the equipment of all vessels in operation.

We have accomplished a number of the interim milestones for 2019 set out in the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, which was announced in 2015. At the same time, we recognize that business conditions and customer expectations are constantly changing since the time of the vision’s announcement, and that there is now a need to address the impacts of climate change and the rising demand for decarbonization. To reconfirm the path the Group should take in this new environment, we have performed climate change scenario analyses based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
Through the scenario analyses, we identified the risks and opportunities facing the Company. This information was used to chart a new course for “K” LINE by categorizing the issues to be addressed as well as our new targets for 2050, based on the two perspectives of decarbonization and the pursuit of zero environmental impacts.

Basic Human Resource Management Policies for Onshore Workers
 Exercising “K” LINE’s corporate principle and vision requires the development of human resources who can practice teamwork in their daily activities to give form to the “K” LINE spirit (the independence and autonomy, broad-mindedness, and enterprising spirit), which has supported our ambitions and value creation for a century, and the four values the “K” LINE Group prizes (providing reliable and excellent services, a fair way of business, relentless efforts to achieve innovation, and respecting humanity). In the
current era, which is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, “K” LINE will continue to foster maritime professionals who can compete on the global stage. We hope to endow these professionals with a propensity for self- growth—with a continual awareness of how circum- stances affect them no matter how the operating environment may change—and make them profi- cient at coordinating their work with others.
 Enhancement of Human Resource and Organizational Capabilities:
Human Resource Strategies for Drawing Out Individual Potential
The “K” LINE Group is developing human resources and shaping workplace environments with the aim of allowing all employees to heighten their own skills and achieve greater results. Our approach toward career planning positions the first 10 years after joining the Company as one leg of an employee’s career, during which he or she should be provided with various experiences and opportunities to learn in order to equip them to develop their careers through on-the-job experi- ence. After the first 10 years, employees move onto a stage at which they are expected to build on their specialties with an emphasis on autonomy and to gain management skills and pursue career development. We have also prepared a number of training programs to help employees acquire the skills needed for their specific career plans.
Improvement of Work-Life Balance:
Creation of a Workplace Environment That Keeps Employees Happy at Work
Ensuring that employees can maintain a good work-life balance is integral to encouraging employee skill development and to spurring the sustainable growth of the “K” LINE Group. We are actively adopting flexible workstyles as a measure to allow employees to continue working even amid the changes that accompany different life stages. For example, the Company had a teleworking system in place even before the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we offer robust systems for supporting employees, including maternity, childcare, and long-term care systems that surpass the legal requirements.
Promotion of Diversity: Utilization of Diversity as a Wellspring of Competitiveness
With subsidiaries and affiliates in more than 20 countries around the world, the “K” LINE Group is composed of diverse employees. Even at the Japan head office, we conduct group and mid-career hiring of employees of diverse nationalities, educational backgrounds, genders, and work areas (administrative, technical). We have also established an Action Plan for Promoting the Advancement of Women, to achieve a more ideal workplace gender balance, and we are promoting other diversity initiatives.
Onshore Workers
      Onshore workers are tasked primarily with sales activities, onshore management of ship operation, and the corporate functions that support these activities. Through sales activities and vessel operation, these workers build trust with cus- tomers and support seafarers in achieving safe navigation. Onshore workers also play an indispensable administrative role by setting management policies and managing human resources, funds, and information in administrative divisions.
      
  We seek to increase work engagement onboard and to develop human resources capable of shaping the future of the shipping industry.
Akihiro Fujimaru
Executive Officer
In charge of Marine Sector
 Basic Human Resource Management Policies for Maritime Technical Personnel
  “K” LINE employs seafarers of various nationalities and encourages mutual respect for the individuality and differences of employees with regard to age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and interests. These sea- farers go about their daily work as a team in the restrictive space available to them onboard ships. No matter how the times may change, there will be no change to our mission of safely transporting cargo and commodities to people around the world. However, from the beginning of 2020 the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic transformed all areas of ship operation together with the environ- ment in which seafarers must live.
At the same time, we recognize that a number of factors contribute to work engagement, which repre- sents the feelings of satisfactions and fulfillment that employees have toward their work. For seafarers, work engagement is heavily influenced by environments onboard ships, which function both as their workplace and their living space. The work engagement of sea- farers also has an influence on important management priorities for the “K” LINE Group, such as the safe operation of ships, improvements in transportation service quality, and environmental preservation. Accordingly, we understand that there is a strong need to advance onboard workstyle reforms to facili- tate the fulfillment of our social responsibilities and the exercise of our corporate principle and vision.
Today, we are seeing an increasingly strong drive to preserve the global environment through means such as contributing to the realization of a
low-carbon and ultimately carbon-free society. This movement is changing the role expected of ship- ping companies in supporting global logistics infra- structure. We are thus expected to go further than simply identifying business risk factors related to enhancing environmental preservation initiatives; we must stand at the forefront of the quest to achieve a sustainable society and advance R&D and other new initiatives to accomplish this objective.
We are committed to fulfilling our mission as a shipping company on into the future. Fostering human resources will be indispensable to this pur- suit. In our human resource efforts, we will broaden our perspective beyond ship crews to develop human resources who can fully exercise their talents as specialists with experience and insight gained at sea even when they are on land and thereby contrib- ute to safe operation, improved service quality, and environmental preservation. We also look to culti- vate human resources who can drive the develop- ment of major next-generation technologies.
   Maritime Technical Personnel
 Maritime technical personnel are hired to fulfill roles that differ from those of onshore workers. In the past, “maritime technical personnel” has referred to the ship crew members who worked primarily onboard ships. In recent years, however, career plans involving work both at sea and onshore are becoming more commonplace. At sea, they act as captains, officers, and chief and other engineers. Onshore, they function as maritime advisors to business divisions, offering input in relation to ship management and safe and economically sound vessel operation.

Latest Training Programs (Fiscal 2021)
The “K” LINE Group has prepared training programs that allow onshore workers to learn in an efficient manner in accordance with their years of service and qualifications. These programs are arranged into four categories based on the skills necessary for onshore workers: core skills, general skills, practical maritime skills, and management skills.
Core skills refer to the absolutely essential skills required by “K” LINE employees, such as professional- ism, communication skills, and logistical thinking. General skills are business skills that can be used in any business division, including accounting, financing, and language skills. Practical maritime skills involve the specialized insight and expertise expected of maritime
professionals, such as an understanding of “K” LINE’s general maritime businesses and safety and environ- mental initiatives. Lastly, management skills are the skills needed for operating organizations and are based on the talents of individuals who have gained skills in the aforementioned three skills categories.
Digital transformation, which has been gaining attention in recent years, is projected to bring about substantial changes in the shipping industry. Responding to these changes will require us to project changes involving both society and customers and to produce innovation based on these changes. “K” LINE has launched training programs aimed at cultivating human resources who can produce this type of innovation.
 Workplace Safety and Diverse Human Resources
 “K” LINE is implementing systems for ensuring safe and comfortable workplaces and facilitating diverse workstyles in order to promote occupational health and safety and support healthy work-life balance. Specific systems include teleworking, shortened workhours, and flextime systems as well as a leave system for providing long-term care to family mem- bers that can be used for up to two years and a leave system for undergoing advanced infertility treatment. We also offer male employees as many as 10 days of childcare leave to encourage the involve- ment of men in childrearing. In fiscal 2020, we
transitioned all employees to teleworking during the period of Japan’s state of emergency declaration in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and pro- tect the safety and health of employees. Even after the state of emergency declaration was canceled, we continued to take preventative measures, includ- ing encouraging staggered shifts, installing acrylic dividers and placing hand sanitizer in offices, and distributing masks to employees. In addition, we instituted a rule allowing employees to acquire spe- cial days of paid leave in the event that they experi- enced an adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

Human Resource-Related Initiatives for Maritime Technical Personnel
 The “K” LINE Group’s basic commitment is to the safety of navigation and the protection of human lives, cargo, and the natural environment at sea. The “K” Line Maritime Academy (KLMA) is the term for our human resource policies aimed at developing “K” LINE seafarers with the knowledge and skills necessary to act as invaluable crew members and maritime technical personnel in onshore divisions.
KLMA facilities for training seafarers have been established in Japan, India, Bangladesh, Bulgaria,
and the Philippines. These facilities conduct training programs tailored to the individual needs of seafarers in each country. An aggregate of more than 20,000 individuals are trained at these facilities each year.
In addition, “K” LINE continues to offer scholar- ships to help pay the tuition of aspiring seafarers attending maritime universities and to recruit these individuals after they graduate. These efforts allow us to offer economic support to students while recruit- ing and developing high-quality human resources.
   Message from the President of KLMA Philippines
KLMA Philippines was established in 2008 with a mandate to ensure that all “K” LINE seafarers are competent and skilled to perform required tasks for safe and efficient operation of ships through comprehensive and effective training using the latest simulation technologies, actual equipment training, and customized courses.
Education and training for seafarers must continuously catch up and even anticipate further modifications to the mariner’s role onboard due to the fast pace of technological advancement and regulatory changes in the shipping industry.
KLMA Philippines will continuously focus on technical skills and soft skills training to ensure that “K” LINE seafarers are properly equipped with abilities and competencies to support ship management’s goals for safe, reliable, and environmen- tally sustainable shipping services.
Among the training priorities of KLMA Philippines to meet the dynamic and rigorous demand of shipping industry are:
Ship Automation and Control Systems
Edgardo T. Baratang
Captain President
KLMA Philippines
 KLMA will train “K” LINE seafarers to be competent and knowledgeable about M.E. engine propulsion systems, electronic navigation systems, electrotechnical systems, cargo handling systems, and new ship technologies such as LNG-fueled vessels, environmental control systems to reduce emissions, etc.
Leadership Safety Behavior and Critical Thinking for Problem Solving
“K” LINE seafarers must also possess an understanding of soft skills such as leadership safety behavior and critical thinking for problem solving, mainly because we cannot rely on technology to do everything for us and, as such, we must work together with safety behavior and critical thinking for practical solutions when technology fails.
We at KLMA Philippines will be relentless in advocating and contributing to the “K” LINE corporate principle and vision, i.e., trust from all over the world, improve the lives of the people and society through safe operation of ships, and fair way of conducting business.
Message from a KLMA Philippines Graduate

      The Board of Directors reviews cross-shareholdings of listed shares from an independent and objective perspective at least once a year to determine whether holdings should be continued based on a concrete assessment of the holding purpose and medium- to long-term economic rationale of individual holdings.
Sales of holdings will be considered when assessments of the economic rationale reveal that returns from said holdings have fallen below the cost of shareholders’ equity in a given fiscal year. The sale of cross- shareholdings that have become applicable under the relevant criteria will be discussed each year at meetings of the Board of Directors to determine which holdings will be sold. As of March 31, 2021, the number of cross- shareholdings of listed shares was three.

Mr. Yamada was appointed as an outside director in June 2019 to utilize his broad experience, personal networks, and insight gained from his years in positions heading public administrative bodies to contribute to the management of the Company. He is appropriately fulfilling his role by proactively offering input at meetings of the Board of Directors and overseeing operational execution as a member of the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Remuneration Advisory Committee. Mr. Yamada is expected to continue to fulfill this role.
Mr. Uchida was appointed as an outside director in June 2019 to utilize his broad experience and insight related to corporate value improvement to contribute to the management of the Company. It has been judged that having Mr. Uchida proactively offer input from the perspective of shareholders at meetings of the Board of Directors and pro- vide oversight of management and operational execution will contribute to shareholder interests and improved corporate governance for the Group. Mr. Uchida is expected to continue to fulfill this role.
Ms. Shiga has professional knowledge and experience as a lawyer, has served as an outside director and outside auditor at several listed companies, and was appointed as an outside Audit & Supervisory Board member of the Company in June 2016 and then as an outside director in June 2020.

Ms. Shiga is expected to continue to fulfill this role.

Ms. Harasawa has extensive professional knowledge and experience as a lawyer and in the transportation sector as a certified first class aircraft maintenance technician at Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. Her presence as an outside officer on the Audit and Supervisory Board enhances Board diversity and the effectiveness of audits through an independent perspective.

  Nomination Advisory Committee, Remuneration Advisory Committee
As a company structured with an Audit & Supervisory Board, “K” LINE voluntarily established a Nomination Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee to enhance the function of the Board of Directors. The committees are composed of independent outside directors, the chairperson of the board, and the president & CEO.

Director remuneration comprises a monthly salary, performance-based compensation, and the Board Benefit Trust (BBT) Performance-based Share Remuneration Plan.

 Corporate Governance
Establishing Sustainable Growth and Raising Corporate Value
Board Evaluation
Article 22 of our Corporate Governance Guidelines states, “Each director shall perform a self-evaluation on the validity of the Board of Directors, his/her performance as a director, etc., on an annual basis, and submit the results to the Board of Directors. Each year the Board of Directors shall, based on the self-evaluation of each director, analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole, and shall disclose a summary of the results in a timely and proper manner.”
Progress in Addressing Issues Raised by the Fiscal 2019 Evaluation
Strengthen Group Governance
It has been confirmed that progress is being made in enhancing “K” LINE’s monitoring and governance of OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS PTE. LTD. (ONE), a company that integrates the containership businesses of three companies and that has a substantial impact on the performance of the Company. These monitoring and governance activities are conducted as a major shareholder, but there is still room for improvement in terms of maintaining a timely understanding of performance trends. On a Groupwide basis, it was confirmed that quantitative management of financial indicators and misconduct response measures are being duly executed. On the other hand, it has been pointed out that there is room for reinforcement in orientation to improve our corporate value as a group and also in function to support group companies while we continue to respect the independence of each company, and we have reaffirmed this point as a theme that we should continue to tackle.
Improve Board Diversity
As one female outside director was elected at the annual general shareholders’ meeting held in June 2020, the absence of female directors was resolved. We will organize aspects such as capabilities, skills, and backgrounds that are necessary for the Board of Directors as a whole and continue to build a structure in which we can realize Board diversity, not only by meeting superficial standards such as gender and career background.
Improved Discussions regarding the Medium- to Long-Term Management Policy and Plan
Since the spread of COVID-19 had a very significant impact on our business, we had no choice but to concentrate our discussions on short- term damage control at the beginning of the fiscal year. As the impact of COVID-19 on the business was dealt with, we moved to discuss our new business plan and capital policy at the Board meetings and strategic meetings, looking ahead to our post–COVID-19 business plans. Recognizing that our important task is to strengthen our financial position and to stabilize our business base, we will continue to enhance our discussions.
Discussions on Risk Management for the Threat of Cyberattacks
Our information system group reported the current situation and issues on this subject to the Board of Directors, and it was reconfirmed that countermeasures against the threat of cyberattacks had been effectively put in place by introducing various kinds of security products and undergoing regular checks by third parties. However, regrettably, we encountered an enterprise system failure in mid-March 2021. Considering this incident very seriously, we, as the Board of Directors, intend to share issues including the emergency response and prevention of recurrence, further enhance measures of protection, detection, countermeasures, and recovery, and thoroughly educate our executive officers and employees.
Fiscal 2020 Evaluation
Method for and Scope of Evaluating Board Effectiveness
For fiscal 2020, the Board conducted a self-evaluation through questionnaires sent to all directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, followed by discussion by the Board of Directors based on the results of the questionnaires. For fiscal 2020, we added a new topic to evaluate how the Board tackled issues related to CSR, ESG, and the SDGs.
Analysis of Board Effectiveness and Overview of Evaluation Results
We were able to confirm that our Board is highly effective overall. We have judged that the following strengths noted in the fiscal 2019 evaluation were continuously maintained and reinforced in fiscal 2020.
Strives to continuously reform and improve governance
A cooperative atmosphere due to the leadership of the chairperson
Quick and appropriate decision-making process when executing duties Appropriate monitoring by diverse outside directors
Proactive discussions about capital efficiency including review of the asset portfolio Constructive dialogue with shareholders
It has been pointed out that there was room for enhancement in discussions and efforts to improve corporate sustainability. In April 2021, we reorganized departments in charge of sustainability and environmental issues to establish a new structure to promote corporate sustainability. We will incorporate the sustainability promotion into our next medium-term management plan.
Going Forward
Our Board of Directors concludes that its effectiveness is properly maintained at this time; however, to realize a more effective Board, we will work on further improvements including the following items.
         50
Promote corporate sustainability Strengthen group governance
Improve discussions regarding the medium- to long-term capital policy
Enhance and reinforce measures against the threat of cyberattacks

Messages from Outside Directors
The Company actively appoints outside directors to take advantage of external perspectives to enhance corporate value over the medium and long term.
The Company’s current outside directors were asked for their honest opinions in response to the following questions.
Q 1 What is the expected role of the shipping industry and of “K” LINE specifically amid the rapid increase in discussion regarding carbon neutrality, decarbonization, and other environmental preservation topics?
Q 2 Based on your experience, what do you believe is necessary to improve the effectiveness of the Company’s Board of Directors?
      Keiji Yamada
Outside Director

1 Society is rapidly transitioning toward virtual spaces cen- tered on IT. However, this will not change the fact that it is compa- nies operating in the physical spaces that support the lifestyles of people. As a company that supports the lifestyles of people both in Japan and around the world, “K” LINE has the potential to change society by contributing to the resolution of environmental issues. I am confident that “K” LINE can transform itself by putting forth a clear policy, such as “becoming the most eco-friendly shipping company.”
A 2 Based on my experience as a prefectural governor, I believe that the issue requiring the most attention and effort is the moti- vation of employees. “K” LINE is a company that has faced a lot of challenges. I therefore hope to facilitate discussions of a brighter future for the Company, one in which its employees can find joy in their work and feel hope for the future, at meetings of the Board of Directors.
Kozue Shiga
Outside Director
A 1 While ships were dependent on the power of people or on the wind for propulsion in the past, today the shipping industry must consume fuel in order to continue transporting cargo around the world. It is, of course, important for “K” LINE to move ahead with research for evolving fuels and ship structures in this regard. At the same time, however, I hope that the Company will broaden its perspective to turn its attention to research that may at first seem unrelated to its operations. I strongly believe that new and valuable ideas can originate in any field.
A 2 Diversity is vital to improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. However, it is sometimes said that accepting diversity requires a certain degree of commitment. For this reason, I con- stantly ask myself whether I am prepared to have an open mind should I encounter someone with a perspective that differs from my own. My job as a lawyer requires that I work amid contradictory claims. I have thus always sought to understand the perspective of the other party, and I hope to use this experience to help improve the effectiveness of “K” LINE’s Board of Directors.
1 There is no going backward when it comes to the global decarbonization trend, and responding to this trend will thus be absolutely essential for companies. This is especially important when it comes to the shipping industry, which has traditionally been highly dependent on fossil fuels. At the same time, this trend represents the emergence of a new and highly viable growth market when viewed from the perspective of customer needs.
By positioning decarbonization as an opportunity to make broader contributions to customers, as opposed to a hurdle to be cleared, I believe that “K” LINE will be able to achieve future growth while boosting its competitiveness.
A 2 Addressing corporate governance issues and improving effectiveness requires the Board of Directors to practice appropriate decision-making and oversight based on both input from sharehold- ers and the policies of management. It is therefore important for “K” LINE to build shared recognition among the Board of Directors through ongoing discussion about how to improve corporate value based on the perspectives of both management and shareholders.

1 Awareness regarding environmental preservation is rising rapidly on a global scale. It is therefore crucial for the “K” LINE Group to more actively help preserve the environment if it hopes
to exercise its corporate principle to contribute to society, so that people live well and prosperously. Accordingly, I feel that the Group needs to combine the insight, techniques, and passion of all of its members to advance innovative initiatives that benefit customers while protecting the environment.
A 2 I have experience as the CEO of a listed company, and this experience has made me aware of the importance of having a diverse team of directors who call upon their individual experience and insight to discuss and build shared recognition about what needs to be done to fuel the ongoing growth of a company. Outside directors, specifically, must monitor and advise the actions of the CEO based on such a shared recognition while sometimes spurring the CEO forward on initiatives aimed at the future.

 Realizing Responsible Corporate Behavior
The United Nations Global Compact
“K” LINE endorses the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary initiative in which companies and organi- zations act as good members of society and participate in the creation of a global framework for sustainable growth by demonstrating responsible and creative leadership. As well as becoming a signatory to the compact in 2020, we have joined the Global Compact Network Japan (GCNJ), a local network in Japan whose member- ship includes Japanese companies. Through the GCNJ’s subcommittees, which are focused on specific themes, member companies and organizations actively conduct discussions and exchange information on approaches to initiatives and methods for proceeding with them. In fiscal 2020, we participated in the Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Subcommittee, the Anti-Corruption Subcommittee, the ESG Subcommittee, and the Reporting Research Subcommittee. At meetings of subcommittees, we collected information on the latest trends and the initiatives of progressive companies in relation to each theme and as far as possible shared information on our own initiatives.

Vessels that have reached the end of their service lives are disman- tled and become useful sources of metals. As vessels differ in size and shape, mechanization and automation of dismantling work is difficult. Therefore, the majority of such work is done using labor- intensive methods. Moreover, this work must be conducted in ways that ensure occupational health and safety and protect the environ- ment. “K” LINE selects dismantling yards by inspecting the site and carrying out evaluations according to our own checklist that assesses factors such as whether work is being carried out safely, whether the substances with an impact on the human body or the environment are collected, and whether a negative impact on the surrounding environment is prevented or mitigated. Additionally, we monitor the work process and constantly check that work is being carried out in consideration of safety and the environment.
Initiatives to Increase Human Rights Awareness
The need to respect human rights is set forth at the beginning of the “K” LINE Group Charter of Conduct. To ensure implementation of this charter, we have established the Implementation Guideline for the Charter of Conduct, which includes 11 specific guidelines for conduct in relation to human rights, covering such areas as respect for personality and diversity, no tolerance for child labor and forced labor, prevention of harassment, and the promotion of work-life balance. Among our employees, we have instilled respect for human rights through e-learning programs and the issuance of newsletters. Given the heightening of society’s expectations with respect to human rights in recent times, in the current fiscal year we have begun establishing a human rights due diligence process based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As part of this process, we will formulate a human rights policy and conduct risk analysis.

 Compliance
The Group’s Compliance System
To provide guidance to the officers and employees of the Company and Group companies in the conduct of their day-to-day duties, in January 2017 we established the “K” LINE Group Global Compliance Policy, with which all officers and employees must comply. Also, the Compliance Committee, which is chaired by the presi- dent, deliberates on policies to ensure the compliance of the Company and Group companies as well as mea- sures in response to compliance violations. Further, under the supervision of the chief compliance officer, the compliance system is being strengthened throughout our organization.
In addition, to prevent compliance issues in the Group’s domestic and overseas operations and detect and correct risks at an early stage, we have established the Hotline Desk and the Global Hotline Desk, which receive whistleblowing reports from officers and employees of the Company and its domestic and overseas Group com- panies. Furthermore, by ensuring the confidentiality of reported information
and protecting whistleblowers, we are developing a system that whistle-
blowers can use with confidence. As part of these efforts, in July 2020 we
registered our in-house whistleblowing system as a Whistleblowing
Compliance Management System, which is a registration system for the
self-declaration of conformity, with the Consumer Affairs Agency of Japan.
1. Our Efforts to Ensure Compliance with the Anti-Monopoly Act
We ensure that executives and employees comply with the Regulation for Compliance with the Anti- Corruption Act. Furthermore, we are making efforts to ensure compliance awareness concerning compe- tition laws by conducting a continuous training program and promotion of educational activities through a dedicated department. In addition, we conduct audits and monitor the state of implementation of compliance measures. With respect to contacts with competing companies, we strictly enforce regula- tions on prior reporting and approval depending on the nature of the contact, as well as recording and storing details of each contact. In June 2021, we distributed an updated version of the Guidebook for Anti-Monopoly Act Compliance to employees.
2. Our Efforts to Prevent Bribery and Corruption
To effectively strengthen the prevention of bribery and corruption, we devote much effort to the prevention of corruption and bribery as a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which is a global business network working toward the vision of a maritime industry free of corruption.
3. Our Efforts to Ensure Compliance with Economic Sanctions
In November 2019, we added individual policies on economic sanctions and anti-money laundering to the “K” LINE Group Global Compliance Policy. All officers and employees of the Company and Group companies are required to comply rigorously with regulations related to economic sanctions, anti-money laundering, and the prevention of terrorism financing that are applicable to the businesses of the “K” LINE Group. Further, in response to the growing trade friction between the United States and China, we are screening business partners even more stringently.
Our Efforts to Raise Compliance Awareness
We set every November as “Compliance Month,” when we distribute a message from the president to executives and employees of “K” LINE and its Group companies to remind them of the importance of compliance. We also hold compliance e-learning training and compliance seminars featuring lecturers invited from outside the Company.

 Risk Management
Risk Management System
We have established a risk and crisis management system so that we can recognize and prepare for various risks in management and fulfill our corporate social responsibility even if risks materialize. We classify risks into four categories: risks associated with vessel operations, compliance risks, disaster risks, and other management- related risks. For each category of risk, we have established a dedicated committee. In addition, the Risk and Crisis Management Committee was established to unify these four committees and to control and promote overall risk management. The president serves as the chairperson of all these committees, and their meetings are held regularly.

 The “K” LINE Group has established a business continuity plan (BCP) in preparation for impediments that could be caused by natural disasters and infectious diseases, including new strains of influenza. With respect for human life as our first priority, we aim to ensure business continuity and thereby meet the responsibility we have to support society’s lifelines. To this end, we are transferring the management of operations to regional offices in Japan and overseas, storing backup data in remote locations, and utilizing teleworking. In prepara- tion for an earthquake occurring directly beneath the Tokyo metropolitan area, we conduct regular evacuation drills and improve the BCP based on simulations of the scale and damage of such an earthquake. In these ways, we are making Companywide efforts to improve our disaster resilience.

Risks Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Measures in Response
“K” LINE has implemented a range of COVID-19 countermeasures. In the management of onshore operations, we expanded and enhanced teleworking and took thorough measures to prevent infection at offices. As for vessels and crew members, we monitored the health of crew members before they boarded vessels, issued an order requiring crew members to spend time in quarantine before boarding vessels, conducted PCR tests, and supplied anti-infection equipment and materials. In fiscal 2021, the Company’s business operations may con- tinue to be affected by unexpected events, such as the emergence of variants or the discovery of new strains. However, by reviewing measures taken in fiscal 2020 and preparing a response manual for future pandemics caused by viruses, including COVID-19, we will establish capabilities for maintaining business continuity even during emergencies. We will then take measures suited to each business.
The Risk of Large-Scale Accidents and Our Measures in Response
As rigorously ensuring the safety of vessel operations is one of our highest priorities, we are maintaining and heightening operational safety levels and crisis management capabilities. However, an unexpected accident, particularly one involving an oil spill or other major accidents leading to environmental pollution, could occur and have a negative impact on the Group’s financial position and operating results. Furthermore, piracy losses, operation in areas affected by political unrest or military conflict, and the increased risk to vessels from terror- ism could cause major damage to the Group’s vessels and jeopardize lives of the crews. This in turn could have a negative impact on the Group’s safe operation of vessels, voyage planning, and management and overall marine transportation business. To counter the aforementioned risks, the Ship Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the president, meets periodically to conduct multifaceted investigations and initiatives for all mat- ters related to the safety of vessel operations. Also, we have prepared an Emergency Response Manual, which sets out the accident response measures to be taken in the event of an emergency, and we continually improve our accident responses by holding regular drills for responses to large-scale accidents (see pages 34–35).
Risks Associated with Information Security and Our Measures in Response
The “K” LINE Group is taking measures to ensure and improve information security in order to provide safe and secure marine transportation and logistics services as a logistics infrastructure supporting global economic activities. Cyberattacks have become extremely diverse in recent years, and local responses and product intro- ductions alone are not sufficient for complete protection. Information leaks due to unauthorized access or system outages due to virus infections could significantly impact the operating activities, financial position, and business results of the “K” LINE Group. Rather than depending on any one measure for information security, we employ a range of measures. As well as helping to prevent cyberattacks, this multilayered approach increases our ability to detect abnormalities rapidly if a security incident occurs and to minimize its impact through countermeasures and restoration. In addition, we have implemented information security measures from the following three perspectives: information management that aims to protect information; cybersecurity that focuses on the defense of system networks against cyberattacks; and physical security that prevents unau- thorized access to facilities such as office terminals. As for our efforts for marine cyber risk management, in particular, we have acquired Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) certification from ClassNK for our ship management companies and vessels, and we are proceeding with the acquisition of certification for other vessels. “Safety” is the core competence of the “K” LINE Group’s maritime transport business. We will provide safer and more optimal transportation services by strengthening our response to cyber risks. We also provide security education to raise awareness of information security among Group officers and employees.

Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
  Demand for marine transportation was sluggish, particu-
larly at the beginning of fiscal 2020, as a result of the eco-
nomic stagnancy triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cargo volume for Cape-size bulker declined substantially
because of deceases in shipments of iron ore due to bad
weather in loading regions. However, demand for trans-
portation to China recovered near the middle of the fiscal
year, and overall demand was strong in the second half of
the fiscal year due to recovery of economic activities in
principal markets. Meanwhile, cargo volumes for
Panamax- and Handy-sized vessels benefited from the
resumption of economic activities in China, increases in
demand for transporting grain from Brazil and the United
States to China, and rising demand for coal imports to
China triggered by cold waves, but these factors were
unable to compensate for the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic felt at the beginning of the fiscal year. Supply of
newly built ships was limited for all vessel types, but the
ship supply and demand balance was weak in comparison
to the previous fiscal year. Against this backdrop, we
sought to reduce operating costs, optimize fleet scale,
and hedge market risks through freight derivatives.
However, ultimately the Dry Bulk Business recorded year- fluctuation. on-year decreases in sales and profit.

Fiscal and economic stimulus measures are boosting eco- nomic activities in countries around the world. This situa- tion has been supporting demand for Cape-size bulker through factors such as the global recovery of steel demand, which led crude steel production in China to reach a historic monthly high in May 2021. Panamax- and Handy-sized bulker cargo volumes have been higher than initially anticipated due to increased demand for transpor- tation of grain to China as well as cargo movement for thermal coal and minor bulk items seen in conjunction with the recovery of industrial activity. Supply of newly built ships is expected to remain limited, resulting in year- on-year increases in ship demand.
Objectives of the Dry Bulk Business will be to expand our foundations for stable earnings through medium- to long-term transportation contracts for high-quality trans- portation services, including the introduction of next- generation fuels. In addition, we will maximize our earnings potential through the strengthening of our marketing
and chartering capabilities by utilizing overseas offices, by improving fleet allocation efficiency, and by optimizing fleet composition to improve our resilience to market

Accommodation of Next-Generation Energy to Contribute to the Realization a Decarbonized Society
“K” LINE continues to support the energy value chain by providing safe and high-quality crude oil and LPG transportation services. At the same time, we are introducing into our fleet vessels fueled by LNG and LPG in order to reduce our environmental impact. Looking ahead, we anticipate the emergence of new demand for transporting ammonia to power plants in Japan, and we therefore intend to enter into the ammonia transportation business.
Meanwhile, we are contributing to the realization of a hydrogen society through participation in pilot hydrogen supply chain demonstrations being conducted jointly by Australia and Japan using the SUISO FRONTIER liquefied hydrogen carrier.
We thereby aim to accumulate expertise related to the safe transportation of next-generation energy sources. “K” LINE is also looking to lower and reduce CO2 emissions for its own vessels, and
 the possibility of adopting ammonia and biofuels, next-generation fuels that are expected to follow the trend set by LNG and LPG, is being investigated.

Overview of Fiscal 2020
Electricity Business
During the first half of fiscal 2020, the state of emergency declaration issued in Japan caused a halt to economic activities in this country, resulting in massive drops in elec- tricity and consequently coal demand. In the second half of the fiscal year, the resumption of economic activities sparked a recovery in power demand. In particular, demand for electricity increased during the cold wave at the begin- ning of 2021 and led coal-fired thermal power plants to continue to be operated at full capacity, as several nuclear power plants were still under a long-term suspension. Against this backdrop, the “K” LINE Group’s fleet continued to operate smoothly, mainly under medium- to long-term contracts, and we were able to generate stable earnings through flexible and efficient fleet deployment
in response to rapid fluctuations in coal demand.
Offshore Business
The FPSO business produced stable earnings through continuously high utilization rates based on a long-term contract in the project off Ghana. Meanwhile, our drillship business recorded a loss, despite earnings from the smooth operation of a project off Brazil conducted under a long- term contract, following the re-examination of market con- ditions after the expiration of contracts. The offshore support vessel business suffered from a deterioration in market conditions due to sluggish trends in development projects as a result of falling crude oil prices in the first half of fiscal 2020. The market remained sluggish despite the recovery in oil prices in the second half of the fiscal year.

Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
Electricity Business
The delays in restarting nuclear power plants in Japan mean that coal-fired thermal power plants will continue to be an important source of power for the country. Electricity demand has proved firm due to the recovery of economic conditions brought about by the accelera- tion of vaccinations. The outlook for electricity demand is currently opaque, but even if a sudden fluctuation in demand occurs, “K” LINE will continue to supply cus- tomers with the flexibility that only it can offer. Inspired by the importance of our mission of supporting a vital lifeline, we will continue to practice high-quality vessel operation to ensure safe operation.
Offshore Business
In our FPSO and drillship businesses, we look to secure stable earnings by maintaining high utilization rates under long-term contracts. As for the offshore support vessel business, we will continue to pursue cost reductions in order to improve earnings, given that market recovery
  will continue to be limited.

     The business environment surrounding the Electricity Business in Japan underwent substantial change during fiscal 2020. Factors behind this change included the issuance of a govern- ment order to look at phasing out inefficient coal-fired thermal power plants in July 2020, the declaration of the country’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in October, and the announcement of a national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from fiscal 2013’s level by fiscal 2030 in April 2021. These government policies are expected to cause decreases in future demand for transportation of coal for thermal power plants in Japan. However, there will be no change to the position of thermal power as an important power source in Japan, given the energy mix as viewed from the circumstances regarding the resumption of nuclear power plant operation and the introduction of renewable energy. Accordingly, it is unlikely that thermal coal transportation demand will drop to zero in the short term. “K” LINE will carefully monitor the progress of Japan’s decarbonization-related energy policies while adjusting its fleet composition to incorporate vessels with eco-friendly equipment, so that it can continue responding to transportation demand.

LNG Carrier Business
Demand for LNG, a relatively clean form of energy, is expected to grow over the long term, centered on emerg- ing countries. Accordingly, we plan to expand our fleet in the LNG Carrier Business in line with the growth of this demand. We will also work to acquire long-term contracts that will be stable sources of future revenue subsequent to the long-term charter contract for two LNG carriers (scheduled to be delivered in 2022) acquired in 2020 from Petronas Group, Malaysia’s national petroleum and gas conglomerate. Furthermore, we will respond flexibly to accommodate the diversifying needs of customers.
Carbon-Neutral Promotion Business
The Carbon-Neutral Promotion Business continues to develop the businesses contributing to the world’s decar- bonization such as offshore wind power projects and com- mercialized CCUS technologies. “K” Line Wind Service, Ltd. (KWS) was started in June 2021 to gather all of the knowledge and ideas within the “K” LINE Group and to contribute to the development of offshore wind projects. At the same time, targeting the practical implementation of liquefied CO2 marine transportation, the Company participates in CO2 marine transportation verification tests.

     Through consignment from the Engineering Advancement Association of Japan, “K” LINE is participating in the R&D project on the social implementation of liquefied CO2 maritime transportation, together with Ochanomizu University and Nippon Gas Line Co., Ltd. These R&D activities are being carried out as a part of “large-scale CCUS verification tests in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido” supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization and aim at the verification of CO2 marine transportation technology.
CCUS refers to the technologies of CO2 capture, utilization, and storage, and these technologies are therefore expected to play an important role in achieving the carbon-neutral society in 2050. Through the aforementioned verification tests, “K” LINE targets the development of liquefied CO2 carrier transportation technologies, to establish the methodology of long-distance, high-volume transportation of CO2 and to reduce the costs associated with CCUS technologies.
By expanding the accumulated technologies and expertise through the safe transportation and cargo handling of liquefied gas, “K” LINE will evaluate
safety loading/discharging operation and transportation of liquefied CO2 transportation with the target of establishing the technical guidelines.

Overview of Fiscal 2020
In fiscal 2020, global automobile sales declined, particularly in April and May 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, a clear recovery trend was later seen in early autumn, most notably in the United States. However, the full-year automobile sale volume was only 7.7 million units in fiscal 2020, a decrease of approximately 14% from fiscal 2019.
Meanwhile, global marine transportation demand for completed automobiles was only around 13.7 million units in fiscal 2020, a decrease of approximately 18% from fiscal 2019.
At the same time, the number of automobiles trans- ported by the “K” LINE Group in fiscal 2020 also declined in the first quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a recovery trend seen centered on the United States beginning in September 2020. However, our transportation volume was only 2.6 million units in fiscal 2020, a decrease of approximately 23% from 3.3 million in fiscal 2019. We took steps to reduce costs through temporary revisions and reorganizations of services and rationalization of surplus vessels, but fiscal 2020 saw a decline in revenue compared to 2019, which resulted in us posting a loss.

Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to persist throughout fiscal 2021. However, we also anticipate substantial recovery in automobile sales markets around the world as well as recovery in marine transportation demand.
In conjunction with this recovery, we will work to secure a proper fleet size and provide transportation services matched to customer demand. Specific measures will include improving conventional high and heavy cargo operations and reorganizing and strengthening our routes to accommodate changes in transportation demand, such as the trend toward electric vehicles. We will thereby seek to strengthen operating foundations.
“K” LINE also plans to accelerate global carbon neu- trality initiatives in the Car Carrier Business. We com- pleted construction of CENTURY HIGHWAY GREEN, our first LNG-fueled car carrier, in March 2021. This vessel is equipped with the latest digital technologies in addition to various eco-friendly technologies. In the future, we will accelerate initiatives for achieving carbon neutrality, such as seeking out alternative fuel sources.

Keiji Kubo
Managing Executive Officer
In charge of Logistics, Port and Affiliated Business
Overview of Fiscal 2020
In the domestic logistics and port business, containership transportation volume declined during the first half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it recovered in the second half of the fiscal year, and annual cargo handling volume at container terminals increased compared to 2019. Similarly, the tugboat business also saw improved performance due to second-half demand recovery. Meanwhile, the warehousing business continued to post strong performance. In domestic terminal opera- tions, we proceeded to make effective use of assets through KLKG HOLDINGS, Co., Ltd., a joint venture with Kamigumi Co., Ltd., that commenced operations in fiscal 2019. The synergies generated with Kamigumi through this company are contributing to strong trends in cargo processed via domestic terminal subsidiaries.
In the international logistics business, our forwarding operations recorded an increase in air cargo volumes as customers turned to air transportation in response to sea container unit shortages and a lack of space on sea vessels.
Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
The domestic logistics and port business will seek to secure a stable profit centered on tugboat, land and sea intermodal transportation, and warehousing operations. Similarly, we will build upon our cooperation with Kamigumi and seek to improve our service efficiency, to enhance our cost-competitiveness, and to raise our asset utilization efficiency. The port business will continue to provide high-standard and high-quality container terminal management in response to the increasing size of container ships.
In international logistics business, we will restructure the global network of “K” Line Logistics, Ltd., expand our customer base in our non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) business,* and provide high-quality logistics services that utilize the comprehensive strength of the Group.
At the same time, we will continue to enhance our comprehensive automobile logistic services, which include logistics for everything from automotive parts to completed automobiles.

   Short Sea and Coastal Business
Keiji Kubo
Managing Executive Officer
In charge of Logistics, Port and Affiliated Business
Overview of Fiscal 2020
The Short Sea Business recorded a loss in fiscal 2020 due to cargo volume declines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, profit decreased in the Coastal Business, despite a reduction in costs from lower bunker prices, as a result of a decreased number of operating vessels and a decrease in cargo volume as well as a decline in ferry passengers throughout the fiscal year. The offshore support vessel business also recorded a loss as reduced earnings from salvage services outweighed the increase in ocean survey service earnings. The results of these activi- ties were year-on-year declines in sales and profits for the Short Sea and Coastal Business.
Medium- to Long-Term Outlook
Steady recovery trend to be seen in the Short Sea Business; transportation demand projected for Russian coal, one of the main cargoes in this business, from steel, cement, and other manufacturers; and transpor- tation demand forecast for biomass fuel in both short sea and more distant locations
Low utilization of ferries expected by passengers and auto- mobiles in the Coastal Business due to COVID-19 pandemic impacts; advancement of the modal shift due to strict envi- ronmental regulations and lack of truck drivers resulting from tightening of regulations on driver workhours
Further promotion of offshore wind power generation backed by Japanese government policies to advance offshore support vessel business
Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
In the Short Sea Business, we will pursue improvements in earnings by increasing fleet allocation efficiency through close monitoring of market trends and customer needs amid the uncertainty regarding the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Coastal Business, we aim to acquire new cargo contracts amid the decline in major cargo items, such as paper products. As for the offshore sup- port vessel business, we will actively take part in offshore wind power generation support projects in addition to existing business.
Major Medium- to Long-Term Strategies
Expansion of trading area in the Short Sea Business by continuing to optimize the fleet in response to changing market trends resulting from environmental regulation tightening in addition to existing business
Appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Coastal Business while continuing to provide punc- tual services to advance the modal shift and stimulate marine transportation demand

Overview of Fiscal 2020
Equity-method affiliate Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONE) achieved improvements in full-year performance, despite a first-half decline in cargo volume, as it flexibly reviewed fleet allocations and sought to improve opera- tional efficiency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, demand for con- sumer goods grew due to the spread of teleworking and people increasingly staying home. At the same time, con- sumer spending increased following measures for respond- ing to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as government benefits in United States.
As a result, ocean freight and container capacity utili- zation showed favorable trends centered on North American trade.
Cargo volume exceeded the capacity of railway trans- portation networks due to an increase in cargo handling volume, causing delays in container delivery. The resulting
Medium- to Long-Term Outlook

shortage of container chassis and a lack of truck drivers disrupted supply chains.
ONE continued working to address the disruption through the allocation of provisional vessels and improvements in operations. Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, a tight supply and demand balance emerged in North American, European, and all other routes. Consequently, short-term freight rates remained high, and ONE’s earnings showed a substantial year-on-year improvement.
Fiscal 2021 Business Strategies
It is still difficult to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, and the Containership Business is expected to continue to face unpredictable conditions accordingly. We expect brisk cargo movement continuing from fiscal 2020, and the supply chain disruption and tight transportation supply and demand balance will persist. ONE will con- tinue to actively allocate provisional vessels and new container equipment to respond to the disruption.

 Financial Analysis
Results of Operations
Operating revenues
In fiscal 2020, ended March 31, 2021, the “K” LINE Group reported consolidated operating revenues of ¥625,486 million, down 14.9% from those of fiscal 2019. By business segment, the Dry Bulk segment’s operating revenues declined 22.2% year on year, to ¥181,983 million, due to sluggish market conditions, particularly in the first half of the consolidated fiscal year. As for the Energy Resource Transport segment, operating revenues decreased 8.3% year on year, to ¥77,641 million. The Product Logistics segment saw an 11.7% year-on-year decline in operating revenues, to ¥339,667 million. The Other segment’s operating revenues fell 19.0% year on year.
Cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses
Cost of sales amounted to ¥590,046 million, a decline of 12.1%, or ¥81,341 million, from ¥671,387 million in the previous fiscal year. The cost of sales ratio increased 3.0 percentage points year on year, to 94.3%. Selling, general and administrative expenses edged down 0.6%, or ¥330 million year on year, to ¥56,726 million.
Operating income (loss)
Reflecting lower gross profit, an operating loss of ¥21,286 million was recorded, compared with the previous fiscal year’s operating income of ¥6,840 million.
Non-operating income
Net non-operating income amounted to ¥110,784 million, which was largely attributable to equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates of ¥118,165 million. In the previous fiscal year, the Company recorded net non-operating income of ¥567 million and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiar- ies and affiliates of ¥8,011 million.
Profit before income taxes
Extraordinary income amounted to ¥32,339 million, which was largely the result of gain on sales of shares of subsidiaries. Extraordinary losses amounted to ¥7,982 million, due mainly to impairment loss. Consequently, profit before income taxes amounted to ¥113,854 million, compared with profit before income taxes of ¥11,315 million in the previous fiscal year.

Income taxes
Income taxes amounted to ¥2,772 million, a decline of ¥339 million from ¥3,111 million in the previous fiscal year, due principally to a decrease in income taxes.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to ¥2,386 million, down ¥548 million from ¥2,934 million in the previ- ous fiscal year. This result was largely attributable to a decrease in profit attributable to non-controlling interests of Kawasaki Kinkai Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., and others.
Profit attributable to owners of the parent
Profit attributable to owners of the parent amounted to ¥108,695 million, compared with ¥5,269 million in the previous fiscal year. Profit attributable to owners of the parent per share was ¥1,165.34, compared with ¥56.50 in the previous fiscal year.
Analysis of Sources of Capital and Liquidity
Cash flows
As of the end of the consolidated fiscal year, cash and cash equiv- alents stood at ¥130,001 million, an increase of ¥18,068 million from the previous fiscal year-end. The details of cash flows are as follows.
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥33,397 million, compared with net cash used in operating activi- ties of ¥21,797 million in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This change was primarily due to an increase in profit before income taxes.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled ¥16,987 million, compared with net cash used in investing activities of ¥20,286 million in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This was mainly due to proceeds from sales of vessels, property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities was ¥34,845 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of ¥16,731 million in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This change primarily stemmed from repayments of long-term loans and obligations under finance leases.
Funding requirements
The “K” LINE Group’s major working capital requirements arise from shipping business expenses in connection with the dry bulk business and the car carrier business. These expenses include operating costs, such as port charges, cargo handling costs, and

fuel costs; vessel expenses, such as crew expenses and expenses for overhaul of vessels; and chartering expenses. Other expenses comprise the costs of service operations, such as labor costs in connection with the operation of the Group’s logistics business, and general administrative expenses for the Group’s business operations, including personnel expenses, information process- ing costs, and other non-personnel expenses. Capital require- ments include investments in vessels, logistics facilities, and terminal facilities. During fiscal 2020, the “K” LINE Group implemented capital investments of ¥45,332 million.
Financial policy
The “K” LINE Group gives priority to securing low-cost, stable funds to support its business continuity and expansion. The Company meets long-term funding requirements mainly by means of long-term debt from financial institutions, supple- mented by the issuance of bonds and new shares. The Company procures short-term operating funds through bank loans, the issuance of commercial paper, and other methods, and invests temporary surplus funds in financial assets with high degrees of stability and liquidity. The Company employs a cash management system to effectively utilize the surplus funds of Group companies in Japan and overseas.
The Company secures liquidity by preparing for any urgent capital requirements through a ¥60.0 billion commercial paper issuance program and an ¥80.0 billion multi-year commitment line with financial institutions in Japan.
As of June 23, 2021, the Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. gave the Company an issuer rating of BBB– and a short-term credit rating (commercial paper rating) of J-2.
Financial Position
At the end of the consolidated fiscal year, total assets amounted to ¥974,608 million, up ¥78,527 million from the previous fiscal year-end. Current assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year were ¥266,210 million, an increase of ¥7,177 million from the previous fiscal year-end, which was largely attributable to a rise
in cash and deposits.
Fixed assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year amounted
to ¥708,398 million, up ¥71,349 million from the previous fiscal year-end. Of this amount, vessels, property and equipment accounted for ¥391,334 million, a decline of ¥39,755 million from the previous fiscal year-end, which was primarily due to a reduction in vessels. Investments and other assets totaled

¥313,512 million, a rise of ¥111,883 million from the previous fiscal year-end, which mainly reflected an increase in investment securities.
Total liabilities at the end of the consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥658,446 million, down ¥37,400 million from the previous fiscal year-end. Current liabilities were ¥261,529 million and fixed liabilities totaled ¥396,916 million at the end of the consolidated fiscal year, mainly as a result of a decline in obliga- tions under finance leases and others, which outweighed an increase in short-term loans.
Net assets at the end of the consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥316,162 million, up ¥115,928 million from the previous fiscal year-end. Of this amount, shareholders’ equity totaled ¥218,103 million, mainly due to an increase of ¥108,672 million in retained earnings. Total accumulated other comprehen- sive income was ¥90 million, compared with a total accumulated other comprehensive loss of ¥7,756 million a year earlier. This change was mainly due to a ¥3,811 million increase in net unrealized holding gain on investment securities.
Dividend Policy
Maximizing return to shareholders is an important priority for us. The Company seeks to provide stable dividends while retaining adequate reserves to conduct necessary capital investment and strengthen the Company’s financial position for enhancement of corporate value, which is a main priority of the management plan. A year-end dividend (record date: March 31 of each year) is sub- ject to a resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, and an interim dividend is distributed as prescribed in the Articles of Incorporation: “by resolution of the Board of Directors, an interim dividend may be distributed by the Company as of the record date of September 30 of each year.”
With respect to the appropriation of profits, the Company’s basic policy is to enhance shareholder returns over the medium to long term in light of comprehensive consideration of future trends in business performance, investment for future growth, and strengthening of the Company’s financial position. Based on this policy and consideration of future trends in business performance, with sincere regret we have decided not to pay
a dividend for fiscal 2020.
Given the need for comprehensive consideration of future trends in business performance, investment for future growth, and strengthening of the Company’s financial position, we have yet to reach a decision regarding an annual dividend for fiscal 2021.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31, 2021
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsid- iaries (the “Group”) have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and are compiled from the consolidated financial state- ments prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accom- panying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifica- tions and rearrangements have been made to present them in a form which is familiar to readers outside Japan. However, no adjustments have been made which would change the financial position or the results of operations presented in the original consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan, amounts of less than one million yen have been rounded off. As a result, the totals in yen in the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts.
Certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020 to the 2021 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on consolidated profit, net assets or cash flows.
(b) Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 279 and 267 subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The principles of consolidation are to include significant subsidiaries, whose voting interests are owned 40 per cent or more by the consoli- dated group and whose decision-making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group through financial or technical support, personnel, transactions, and so forth. In addition, significant affiliates whose decision- making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group in various ways are accounted for by the equity method.
For the purposes of consolidation, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized profit among the consolidated group companies have been eliminated.
Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of five years.
(c) Accounting period
The Company and 257 consolidated subsidiaries have a March 31 year end, and the remaining 10 consolidated subsidiaries have a December 31 year end. For four of these consolidated subsid- iaries with a December year end, adjustments have been made for any significant transactions which took place during the period between their year end and the year end of the Company, and for the other six, a provisional closing of their accounts as of the year end of the Company has been used.
(d) Translation of foreign currencies
Revenues earned and expenses incurred in currencies other than Japanese yen of the Company and its subsidiaries that maintain their books in Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen either at an average monthly exchange rate or at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Subsidiaries that maintain their books in a currency other than Japanese yen translate revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into the currency used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries of domicile.
(e) Translation of accounts of overseas consolidated subsidiaries
The accounts of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling inter- ests of consolidated subsidiaries, are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The components of net assets excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and non-controlling interests are trans- lated at their historical exchange rates. Differences arising from translation are presented as translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand, and short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased which can easily be converted to cash and are subject to little risk of change in value.
(g) Raw material and supplies
Raw material and supplies are mainly stated at cost based on the moving-average method (The method includes write-downs based on decreased profitability).
(h) Securities
Securities are classified into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading securities, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fair value. Gain or loss, both realized and unrealized, are credited or charged to income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at their amortized costs. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, reported as a separate component of net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost deter- mined principally by the moving- average method.
Under the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”), net unrealized holding gain on investment securities of the related taxes, is not available for distribution as dividends.
(i) Vessels, property and equipment and depreciation (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Depreciation of vessels is computed by the straight-line or the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of the respective vessels.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed princi- pally by the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. However, the depreciation of build- ings (excluding accompanying facilities) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 are computed by the straight- line method.
Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to income as incurred. Major improvements are capitalized.
 84

(j) Capitalization of interest expense
Interest expense is generally charged to income as incurred. However, interest expense incurred in the construction of certain vessels is capitalized and included in the costs of the assets if the construction period is substantially long.
(k) Leases
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated by the same methods used for owned fixed assets.
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated to a residual value of zero by straight-line method over the lease term.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee, starting on or before March 31, 2008 are accounted for as operating lease transactions.
(l) Research and development costs and computer software (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred.
Expenditures relating to the development of computer software intended for internal use are charged to income when incurred, unless these are deemed to contribute to the genera- tion of future income or cost savings. Such expenditures are capitalized as assets and amortized by the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years.
(m) Allowance for doubtful receivables
An allowance for doubtful receivables is provided at an amount calculated based on the historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receivables plus an additional estimate of probable specific bad debts from customers experiencing financial difficulties.
(n) Allowance for bonuses
In order to prepare for bonuses to be paid to employees, the allowance for bonuses is recognized at the estimated amount of the bonuses to be paid as allocated to the current fiscal year.
(o) Allowance for directors’ bonuses
In order to prepare for bonuses to be paid to directors, the allow- ance for directors’ bonuses is recognized at the estimated amount of the bonuses to be paid as allocated to the current fiscal year at certain consolidated subsidiaries.
(p) Allowance for directors’ and audit and supervisory board members’ retirement benefits
In order to prepare for retirement benefit payments to directors and audit and supervisory board members, the amount required at the end of the fiscal year by the internal rules is recognized at certain consolidated subsidiaries.
(q) Accrued expenses for overhaul of vessels
Vessels and other assets of the Group are subject to periodic overhaul. An accrual is provided on the basis of the estimated amount of total expenses expected to be incurred for overhauling the vessels in the following year which has been allocated to the current fiscal year.
(r) Allowance for loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act
In order to prepare for fines and penalties required by overseas authorities relating to the Anti-Monopoly Act, an amount reason- ably estimated to the extent possible is recognized.
(s) Allowance for loss on liquidation of a subsidiary
In order to prepare for loss accompanied by liquidation of a subsidiary, the estimated amount of loss is recognized.
(t) Allowance for directors’ stock benefits
In order to prepare for stock benefits, etc. to the directors and the executive officers in accordance with the Regulations for Delivery of Shares to Officers, the allowance for stock benefits is recognized at the estimated amount of the Company’s stock corresponding to points to be provided to the eligible individuals as of the end of the current fiscal year.
(u) Allowance for loss on chartering contracts
In order to prepare for potential future loss under certain contracts where charter rates fall below hire rates, the probable and reasonably estimated amount of loss is recognized based on available information as of the end of the current fiscal year.
(v) Retirement benefits
The liability for retirement benefits has been provided principally at an amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obliga- tion after the fair value of the pension plan assets are deducted within same plan. The retirement benefit obligations are attrib- uted to each period by the benefit formula method.
Actuarial differences are amortized in the years following the year in which the differences are recognized by the straight-line method principally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees.
Past service cost is amortized by the straight-line method principally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is deter- mined as a result of consideration of both the portfolio allocation at present and in the future, and the long-term expected rate of return from multiple plan assets at present and in the future.
(w) Derivatives and hedging activities
The Group utilizes derivatives, including forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, currency options, currency swaps, bunker fuel swaps and forward freight agree- ments to hedge the risks arising from fluctuations in forward foreign currency exchange rates, mainly on investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc. and forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies; interest rates, mainly on loan and lease transactions; and market prices, mainly on bunker fuel.
The Group applies deferral hedge accounting method. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed under “Special treatment.”
Forward foreign exchange contracts which meet certain criteria are accounted for by the allocation method which requires that recognized foreign currency receivables or payables be translated at the corresponding contract rates.
The hedge effectiveness is assessed based on a comparison of the cumulative changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged items with those of the hedging instruments in the period from the start of the hedging relationship to the assess- ment date. However, an evaluation of effectiveness is omitted for interest-rate swaps which meet certain conditions for applying the Special treatment.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(w) Derivatives and hedging activities (continued)
The Group executes and manages transactions for the purpose of risk control with regard to financial markets and others in accordance with internal rules. These rules have been established not only to prevent derivative or other transactions from being used for any objective other than their original purpose or from being executed without limitation, but also to ensure the management body exercises its oversight functions.
The Company has adopted “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Hedge Accounting for Financial Instruments that Reference LIBOR” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Practical Issues Task Force (“PITF”) No.40, issued on September 29, 2020) from the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
Summary of adoption of ASBJ PITF No,40
(1) Hedge accounting method: Deferral hedge accounting
method
(2) Types of financial instruments used as hedging instruments:
Interest rate swaps
(3) Types of financial instruments to be hedged: Long-term loans
(4) Type of hedging transactions: Cash flow hedge
(x) Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized with respect to the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabili- ties are measured at the rates which are expected to apply to the period when each asset or liability is realized, based on the tax rates which have been enacted as of the balance sheet date or are subsequently enacted.
(y) Deferred assets
Bond issuance costs are charged to income as incurred.
(z) Distribution of retained earnings
Under the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given fiscal year end is made by resolution of the share- holders at a general meeting held subsequent to the close of the financial year. The distribution of retained earnings with respect to the interim financial period is made by resolution of the Board of Directors.
(aa) Revenues and related costs
Revenues of the Group from cargo freight and the related costs and expenses, except for those from container vessels, are recog- nized in full as of the dates on which the vessels complete their respective voyages (the voyage completion method). Revenues from container vessels are recognized based on the passage of the transportation period (the complex transportation progress method). The related costs and expenses are charged to income as incurred. Revenues and costs with respect to charter services are accounted for on an accrual basis.
(ab) Consolidated taxation system
The Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries adopt the consolidated taxation system.
On March 31, 2020, the ASBJ issued “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System” (ASBJ PITF No.39), based on provisions in the Act for Partial Amendments to Income Tax Act (Act No.8).
The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries applied tax laws in effect prior to the amendments to calculate deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for certain items remeasured from the single tax return system in accordance with section 3 of ASBJ PITF
No.39 as an alternative to the application of section 44 of “Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Guidance No.28).
(ac) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
(Accounting Standard and Implementation Guidance for Revenue Recognition)
(1) Overview
On March 31, 2020, the ASBJ issued “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29), and “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No.19). On March 26, 2021, the ASBJ issued “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30). The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the United States co-developed comprehensive accounting standards for revenue recognition and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (issued as IFRS 15 by the IASB and Topic 606 by the FASB) in May 2014. The ASBJ developed comprehensive accounting standards on revenue recognition and issued them in conjunction with the implementation guidance based on the fact that IFRS 15 will be applied from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be applied from fiscal years starting after December 15, 2017.
As the basic policy in developing accounting standards for revenue recognition, the ASBJ defined the accounting standard starting with incorporating the basic principle of IFRS 15 from a standpoint of comparability between financial state- ments, which is one benefit of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15. Furthermore, the ASBJ added alternative accounting treatment without impairing comparability when there are matters to be considered related to accounting practices, etc. common in Japan.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
(3) Effect of the adoption of accounting standard and implemen- tation guidance
The major impact of the adoption of the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” on the consolidated financial statements is a change in the accounting treatment of shipping revenues and corresponding shipping expenses. In the past, the Group has adopted the voyage completion method whereby revenues and expenses were recorded at the time of completion of the voyage (revenues from container vessels were accounted for by the complex transportation progress method). However, from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, revenues and expenses will be recorded on a pro rata basis over the estimated voyage duration according to the number of passage days. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of the accounting standard and the implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

(Accounting Standard and Implementation Guidance for Fair Value Measurement)
(1) Overview
On July 4, 2019, the ASBJ issued “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Statement No.30), “Accounting Standards for Measurement of Inventories” (ASBJ Statement No.9), “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Statement No.10), “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Guidance No.31), and “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No.19). The ASBJ tried ensuring consistency between Japanese standards and international standards mainly for guidance and disclosures on estimated fair value of financial instruments and issued “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement”, etc. based on the fact that the IASB and the FASB in the United States had already issued detailed guidance on fair value measurement (issued as IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” by the IASB and Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” in the Accounting Standards Codification by the FASB), which are almost identical to each other.
As the basic policy in developing accounting standards for fair value measurement, the ASBJ incorporated basically all of the matters defined in IFRS 13 from a standpoint of increasing comparability of financial statements among domestic and foreign companies by using a unified measurement method. Furthermore, the ASBJ defined alternative accounting treat- ment to the individual matters without impairing comparability considering related to accounting practices, etc. common
in Japan.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standards and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
(3) Effect of the adoption of accounting standard and implemen- tation guidance
The Company has not determined the effect of the adoption of the accounting standards and the implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
2. Significant Accounting Estimates
Effective from the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company adopted “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates” (ASBJ Statement No.31) and discloses information in the notes related to significant accounting estimates. However, comparative information for the prior year was omitted in accor- dance with provisional treatment in paragraph 11 in the standard.
(1) Impairment loss of vessels
(a) Amount recognized in consolidated financial statements
for the current fiscal year
Consolidated Statement of Operations
Loss on impairment of fixed assets: ¥6,307 million (of which ¥5,587 million is related to vessels)
Consolidated Balance Sheet
Vessels (net book value): ¥352,981 million
(b) Information related to significant accounting estimates for the identified item
(i) Calculation method of the amount recognized in the
consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year. When an impairment loss on an asset or asset group is recognized, the amount of the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the difference is recog- nized as impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of net selling value and value in use of the asset or asset group. Net selling value is an objective fair value evaluation obtained from a third-party vessel valuation specialist. Value in use of the asset or asset group is calculated based on future cash flows expected to result from continuous usage and disposal after usage.
(ii) Significant assumptions used to calculate the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year.
Significant assumptions used to calculate the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year include the future cash flow period, freight and transportation volume forecasts, which serve as the basis of the business plan, a growth rate of the business (inflation rate or stress rate) during the period after the business plan, and the discount rate used to calculate the discounted present value.
The future cash flow estimated in determining whether to recognize impairment loss and calculating the value in use is based on freight, charter market conditions, bunker fuel market conditions, transporta- tion volume, which are basis of the medium- to long- term plan and budget approved by the Board of Directors, modifying as necessary to be consistent with information from external sources such as the business environment and internal information and estimated taking into consideration of the usage status of an asset or asset group or rational future utilization plan of an asset or asset group.
In addition, future cash flows for a period that exceeds the period of the medium- to long-term plan and budget are calculated using the figures from the medium- to long-term plan and budget approved by the Board of Directors, and estimated by assuming certain level of an inflation rate and stress rate based on the trends from the past medium- to long-term plan and budget.
The basis of determining the future cash flows period in determining whether to recognize impairment loss for an asset or asset group is the lesser of the remaining economic useful lives of the asset or the major asset in the asset group and 20 years.
The discount rate used to calculate the value in use is the weighted average cost of capital at the time of measurement of impairment loss.
(iii) Accounting estimates related to COVID-19
Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the spread of COVID-19 and when it will end, it is difficult to forecast a future outlook.
With regards to the estimation of future cash flows in calculating of value in use, it is based on the assump- tion that the effects of the infectious disease will remain at a certain level during the next fiscal year, but the global economy and the accompanying demand for freight transportation will continue to improve and it is assumed that it will recover subsequent to the next fiscal year.

(iv) Impact on consolidated financial statements for the following year
There is high uncertainty in the estimation of the signifi- cant assumptions such as the future cash flow period, freight and transportation volume forecasts, which serve as the basis of the business plan, a growth rate of the business (inflation rate or stress rate) during the period after the business plan, and the discount rate used to calculate the discounted present value, there- fore it may affect the calculation of future cash flows, which are the basis of value in use.
In addition, due to the high degree of uncertainty in the above assumption including the spread of COVID-19 and when it will end, it may affect the calculation of future cash flows, which are the basis of value in use, depending on future circumstances.
(2) Estimate of allowance for loss on chartering contracts
(a) Amount recognized in consolidated financial statements
for the current fiscal year.
Consolidated Statement of Operations
Charter hire in Marine transportation and other operating revenues: ¥15,278 million
Consolidated Balance Sheet
Allowance for loss on chartering contracts: ¥15,556 million
(b) Information related to significant accounting estimates for the identified item
(i) Calculation method of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the current
fiscal year.
After the establishment of OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS PTE. LTD. (A joint venture for the purpose of integrating the regular container shipping business, hereinafter referred to as “ONE”), the containership business started a time charter business from the Company to ONE, and the business model has changed from the conventional business model of operating ships to provide services to the business model of chartering ships.
The allowance for loss on chartering contracts mentioned above is recognized in order to prepare for potential future loss under certain contracts where charter rates fall below hire rates with the probable and reasonably estimated amount of such loss based on available information as of the current fiscal year end.
(ii) Significant assumptions used to calculate the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year.
Significant assumptions used to calculate the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year are the range of vessels for which future charter contract losses are expected, the charter rate and hire rate of applicable vessels, and the expected duration of loss making from the contracts.
The range of vessels for which future charter contract losses are expected is based on the operation plan, which is based on the budget approved by the Board of Directors. The charter rate and hire rate of applicable vessels is based on the charter contract between the Company and the shipowner, and the charter contract between the Company and ONE.
The expected duration of loss making from the contracts is based on the term of the charter contract concluded with the lender, ONE, and the situation where the unfavorable results between the charter rate and hire rate is reasonably expected to continue from the current fiscal year end, even after the consideration of the market trends to which the vessel belongs to and the Group’s policy with regard to the charter contract.
(iii) Accounting estimates related to COVID-19
The future spread and end of the outbreak of COVID-19 may affect the calculation of the estimated losses arising from charter contracts, but the impact will be limited.
(iv) Impact on consolidated financial statements for the following year
Due to the high degree of uncertainty in the estimation of the significant assumptions such as the range of vessels for which future charter contract losses are expected, the charter rate and hire rate of applicable vessels, and the expected duration of loss making from the contracts, depending on the Group’s policy for chartering contracts and trends in charter market, an additional allowance may be needed to be recognized, which would affect the calculation of the amount of estimated loss resulting from chartering contracts.
In addition, due to the high degree of uncertainty in the above assumption including the spread of COVID-19 and when it will end, it may affect the calculation of the amount of estimated loss resulting from chartering contracts, depending on future circumstances.

    In principle, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries group business assets by units whose income and expenditure are monitored perpetually and those cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets are identifiable. However, the grouping for assets for sales and idle assets are conducted by individual asset.
As profitability decreased significantly, the carrying values of business assets and assets group were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recognized for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021.
In addition, since the planned sales amounts of assets for sale were lower than the carrying values and the respective recoverable
amounts of the idle assets were deemed to be irretrievably lower than the carrying values mainly due to decreasing land prices, the carrying values were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recognized for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021.
The recoverable amounts are the higher of net selling value and the value-in-use. Net selling value is measured by third-party valuations and others. The value-in-use is based on estimated future cash flows discounted at rate of 7.5 per cent and 2.5 to
6.5 per cent for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

7. Leases
The following pro forma amounts represent the acquisition costs, accumulated depreciation and net book value of assets, mainly vessels, leased to the Group at March 31, 2020 and 2021, which would have been reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets if finance leases, other than those which transfer the ownership of the leased assets to the Group, that started on or before March 31, 2008 (which are currently accounted for as operating leases) had been capitalized:
8. Retirement Benefits
The Group has adopted funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The defined benefit corpo- rate pension plans (all of them are funded plans) provide for a lump-sum payment or annuity payment determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service. The retire- ment lump-sum plans provide for a lump-sum payment, as employee retirement benefits, determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service. Certain consoli- dated subsidiaries calculate asset for retirement benefits, liability for retirement benefits and retirement benefit expenses, for the defined benefit corporate pension plans and the retirement lump-sum plans based on the amount which would be payable at the year-end if all eligible employees terminated their services voluntarily (a “simplified method”). The Company and its certain consolidated subsidiaries have a selective defined contribution pension plans as a defined contribution plan.

A certain domestic affiliate accounted for by the equity method also revalued the land used in their business in accor- dance with the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998) and the Act to Partially Revise the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 19, March 31, 2001). The effect of this revaluation has been recorded as revaluation reserve for land in net assets.
The revaluation of land for business use was calculated by making rational adjustments to the prices posted in accordance with the provision of Article 6 of the Public Notice of Land Prices Act for standard sites set forth in Article 6 of the same act in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land (Cabinet Order No. 119 of 1998). However, for some land, the revaluation was calculated by making rational adjustments to standard prices assessed in accor- dance with the provision of Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of the National Land Use Planning Act for standard sites set forth in Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 1 (a) of the same order in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, by making rational adjust- ments to land prices registered in the land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 10 of the Local Tax Act or in the supplementary land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 11 of the same act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, or by making rational adjustments to the value calculated by the method established and issued by the Director-General of the National Tax Agency for computing land value that serves as a basis for the calculation of the taxable amount for land value tax set forth in Article 16 of the Land-Holding Tax Act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Item 4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land.
At March 31, 2020 and 2021, the fair value of land was lower than its carrying value after revaluation by ¥2,977 million and ¥2,862 million, respectively.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Other Important Matters Related to Current Conditions
of the Group)
The Group has been investigated by the overseas competition authorities in relation to alleged anti-competitive behavior (alleged formation of a cartel) relating to the transportation of automobiles, automotive construction machineries and other automotive vehicles. In addition, multiple service providers including the Group are currently subject to class actions in some countries in relation to the same matter.
14. Financial Instruments
Status of financial instruments
The Group obtains necessary funding, mainly through bank loans and the issuance of bonds, in accordance with their capital expenditure plans. Temporary excess funds are invested in highly liquid financial assets, and short-term operating funds are financed by bank loans. The Group utilizes derivatives only for avoiding risks, but does not utilize them for speculation.
Trade accounts and notes receivable are exposed to credit risk in the event of the nonperformance by counterparties. As revenues from marine transportation are mainly denominated in foreign currencies, trade receivables are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and a portion of them, net of trade payables denominated in the same foreign currencies, are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade receivables such as for freight and chartered vessels are exposed to market risks, and some of them are hedged by forward freight agreements. The Group holds marketable securities and invest- ment securities, which are mainly issued by companies who have a business relationship or capital alliance with the Group, and these securities are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in market prices. The Group also has long-term loans receivable mainly from other subsidiaries and affiliates.
The Group has trade accounts and notes payable, which have payment due dates within one year. Funds for certain capital expenditures, such as construction of vessels denominated in foreign currencies, are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, which are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade payables such as payments for bunker fuel are exposed to the risk of fluctuation of market prices, and some of them are hedged by bunker fuel swap contracts. Loans payable, bonds, bonds with stock acquisition rights and lease obligations for finance lease contracts are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments. The repayment dates of long-term debt extend up to 36 years subsequent to the balance sheet date. Certain elements of these transactions are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. The Group hedges this risk by entering into interest rate swap transactions. The Group has entered into currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk against trade payables.
Regarding derivatives, the Group has entered into: 1) forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk arising from investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc., receivables and payables denomi- nated in foreign currencies and funds for capital investment to acquire operating assets such as vessels and others; 2) bunker fuel swap contracts to hedge the risk of bunker fuel price fluctua- tion; 3) forward freight agreements to hedge the risk of fluctua- tion of market prices; and 4) interest-rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuation arising from interest payables for long-term payables and bonds.
For information on hedge accounting policies of the Group, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (w) Derivatives and hedging activities.
The Company monitors regularly the condition of major business counterparties by each related business division with whom the Company has accounts receivable for business or loans receivable, and manages the outstanding balances and due dates by counterparties, to minimize the risk of default arising from any decline in the financial condition of counterparties. Its consoli- dated subsidiaries also monitor the condition of accounts receivable and loans receivable under a similar management policy.
The Group believes that the credit risk of derivatives is insig- nificant as the Group enters into derivatives transactions only with financial institutions which have a sound credit profile.
For investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc., receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and future loans related to investment in vessels, the Company has entered into currency swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk, and interest-rate swap contracts to minimize interest rate fluctuation risk of loans and bonds.
For marketable securities and investments in securities, the Company continuously reviews the condition of holding securities considering the stock market and the relationship with issuing companies, taking into account market value of securities and financial condition of issuing companies in accordance with internal regulations.
The Company enters into derivative transactions with the approval from authorized officers in accordance with internal regulations, which set forth transaction authority and maximum upper limit on positions. Results of derivative transactions are regularly reported at the executive officers meeting. Its consoli- dated subsidiaries also manage derivative transactions under similar regulations.
The Company manages liquidity risk by preparing and updating cash management plan on timely basis and maintaining liquid instruments on hand based on reports from each business group.
The fair value of financial instruments is based on market price, if available. When there is no market price, fair value is reasonably estimated. Fair value can fluctuate because different assumptions may be adopted for calculations of fair value consid- ering various factors. In addition, the notional amounts of deriva- tives in Note 15. Derivatives and Hedging Activities are not necessarily indicative of the actual market exposure involved in the derivative transactions.

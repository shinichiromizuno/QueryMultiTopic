Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Maintaining World-leading Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Establishing and maintaining safety in navigation and cargo operations represent an immutable mission in running a shipping business. “Providing reliable and excellent services” is one of the most import- ant parts of the “K” LINE Group’s corporate principle and vision and reflects its commitment to bene- fiting society. To this end, we have three policy pillars: (1) Enhancing Safety Management System; (2) Strengthening Ship Management System; and (3) Securing and Training Maritime Technical Personnel.
The Ship Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the President & CEO, is the top decision-making body covering safety. It determines accident prevention and safety measures for all ships operated by the Company—including owned, chartered, and entrusted vessels—and handles everything from basic policy formulation to implementation of measures under the sys- tem shown below.

Safety Report System
Our Safety Report System encourages boarding crew members to report on near-miss incidents, such as unsafe behavior and unsafe conditions on a vessel. Such reports are received and carefully analyzed by experienced techni- cal personnel on shore duty, and the results are fed back to similar-type vessels with easy-to-understand illustrations. By entrenching a non-blaming culture, where the respon- sibility of near-miss parties is not called into question, we receive thousands of reports annually, which helps safety awareness to take root on the front lines.
“K” Line-Drive to No Accident (K-DNA): Safety Equipment Installation Guidelines
K-DNA is our unique safety equipment installation guidelines that reflect know-how accumulated in the field and lessons learned from past accidents. K-DNA consists of installation standards, such as for navigation equipment, institutional equipment, safety protection, and anti-piracy measures. The K-DNA Working Group continuously improves the guidelines by pooling insight from various angles and works to enhance the safety of all operating vessels from the hardware per- spective. K-DNA is essentially the DNA that succeeds the Company’s history of safe navigation.

 Once a year, we regularly conduct an Emergency Response Drill based on a scenario of a major accident occurred on our ships. Following the “Emergency Response Manual,” we work on practical exercises such as mock press conferences in order for all the staff to perform “swift” and “accurate” responses to accidents not only on the sea but also on shore in an emergency. After the drills, we also receive multiple evaluations from ship management companies, the MLIT, lawyers, consultants and insurance companies to identify problems and improve the procedures in the manual.

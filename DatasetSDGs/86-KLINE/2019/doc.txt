 Special Feature 1: 100 Years of Exploration
Since its establishment in 1919, the “K” LINE Group has overcome fiercely changing business conditions on many occasions while working tirelessly to ensure safe and reliable operations, evolving into “an integrated logistics company grown from shipping business.” Now in 2019, we celebrate our 100th Anniversary. We have always sought advances with a boldness of spirit. Throughout our history, “K” LINE has explored and created new marine transportation business. Our history is proof that we have remained sensitive to current trends, blazing a path to the future through vigorous, flexible business activities.
1919
Establishment of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd.
When the demand for ships outstripped the supply due to World War I, Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. (the predecessor of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.) promoted the construction of stock boats.* When the war ended, there was a surplus of ships. Kojiro Matsukata, who was then the president of Kawasaki Dockyard, saw the surplus as a new opportunity, and established Kawasaki Kisen in April 1919 under the belief that “Selling newly-built ships overseas would only give profits to foreign shipping companies. He believed that, in the interest of Japan’s national development, the company had to retain newly-built vessels for use by Japan and set up a
1921
Birth of “K” LINE
In 1921, Kojiro Matsukata, who simultaneously served as the president of three companies—Kawasaki Kisen, Kawasaki Dockyard and Kokusai Kisen—gathered key people in London to discuss his vision of jointly operating the three companies’ fleets under one flag, and gained their endorsements. Given the initials of the three companies, they decided to name the new organization “K” LINE and designed the immediately recognizable funnel mark* with a white letter “K” on a red background. Thus, “K” LINE was born in London, far away from Japan.

Postwar Revival
“K” LINE’s business expanded after its establishment, but the Pacific War dealt a devastating blow to the company. More than 1,400 crew mem- bers and 56 ships were lost, leaving only 12 ships afloat at the end of the war. Amidst these circumstances, “K” LINE proceeded with reconstruc- tion, including salvaging and restoring the highly-acclaimed KIYOKAWA MARU which was partially sunk during the war. As Japan entered its period of rapid economic growth, “K” LINE expanded its scale of opera- tions, starting by launching a shipping route to Bangkok, and establishing locations throughout Asia—in Thailand in 1964, in Hong Kong in 1968 and in Singapore in 1974. “K” LINE also expanded beyond Asia and reorga- nized shipping routes to North America and Europe from Asia, and so on, and became the first Japanese shipping company to independently pro- vide service between Asia and North America.

and Creation
1960
Development of Dry Bulk Business and Oil Tanker Business
As industrialization moved forward and improvement in living stan- dards proceeded in the 1960s, Japan began to import vast amounts of iron ore, coal, oil, wood, wood chips and other resources. Dry bulk carriers and oil tankers handled the marine transportation of those resources. Starting with the FUKUKAWA MARU as an iron ore carrier, “K” LINE rapidly proceeded to dedicate carriers to the transportation of resources and raw materials for industry. In the oil tanker business as well, the SHINANOGAWA MARU headlined a succession of new tankers that delivered high quality transportation, that garnered praise from Japanese customers as well as the Oil Majors.
1968
Start of Containership Service
The biggest technological innovation in the history of liner services was containerization of the mid-1960s. Although “K” LINE was ini- tially founded on joint management services, we gradually demon- strated our uniqueness and proceeded to containerize nearly all our main routes in 1969, and in 1971, we independently opened a route between the Far East and the Pacific Coast of North America to function as a container route that did not involve calls at Japan. Progressing from the start of containerization to the independent establishment of such a shipping route in just three years was a rev- olutionary accomplishment at the time.

The GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, our first containership
  As a company that recognized the potential of the automobile industry early on, “K” LINE investigated the idea of dedicating carriers to automobile transportation, and in 1968 completed building the TOYOTA MARU No. 1, a car bulker for trans- porting cars to North America and grain to Japan on
the return voyages. In 1970, we built the TOYOTA MARU No. 10, Japan’s first Pure Car Carrier. Its nick- name at the time, “Pure Car Carrier,” and its abbre- viation, PCC, became synonymous with car carriers. Later, in 1973, we built the largest PCC in the world at the time, which inspired the world to pursue increasingly larger PCCs. As a pioneer in automobile transportation, and with proactive efforts for routes from Japan as well as non-Japan-related routes, “K” LINE cemented its position as a top-class car car- rier company.

1983
The BISHU MARU, Japan’s First LNG Carrier
Surging demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) presented increasing opportunities to realize LNG transportation on Japanese carriers, and a project was launched to use seven Japanese LNG carriers to transport LNG produced in the Arun and Badak gas fields of Indonesia to Japan. “K” LINE collabo- rated with other Japanese shipping companies to win the orders for three LNG carriers for the Badak portion of the project, and in 1983 completed building first of those three, the BISHU MARU, Japan’s first LNG carrier. As a form of clean energy, demand

Reform for Prevailing in Global Competition
The environment of international marine transportation changed substantially at the end of the 1980s. Sluggish cargo movement due to soaring energy costs and a slowdown in global economic growth, a surplus of vessels, the emergence of marine transpor- tation from developing countries, and other factors created strong headwinds. Additionally, the Plaza Accord of 1985 resulted in the rapid strengthening of the Japanese yen, which reduced the yen-converted incomes of Japanese international shipping companies, which derive majority of their income in US dollars. Amidst this turbulence in the business environment, “K” LINE thoroughly revised its businesses, reorganized shipping routes, transitioned overseas

Creation of Business Outside Japan
The creation of demand in China, which experienced remarkable economic develop- ment, and other factors invigorated the global logistics industry. In order to respond to this growth in global logistics demand, “K” LINE decided to expand overseas offices in an effort to acquire new business. In 2001, we established “K” LINE Pte Ltd in Singapore to develop tanker and dry bulk business. In 2003, we established “K” LINE European Sea Highway Services GmbH in Germany to provide intra-European automobile shipping ser- vices independently. That same year, primarily to develop dry bulk transportation busi- ness, we established “K” LINE Bulk Shipping (UK) Limited in London, and in 2008 we established “K” LINE (India) Private Limited in India which had also experienced remark- able economic development. We have also expanded logistics business successively in Thailand, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and other countries in a proactive effort toward devel- oping complete built-up car logistics business.

Investment for the Future
Since 2015, we have introduced 13 next-generation pure car car- riers with a capacity of 7,500 cars. DRIVE GREEN HIGHWAY, the PCC that typifies the new fleet, is our environmental flagship com- plete with an array of innovative environmental technologies. We have also introduced 10 containerships with highly competitive capacity of 14,000 TEU. The importance of energy resource trans- port continues to increase as worldwide energy demand expands. In addition to transporting crude oil, LNG, LPG and other energy resources by sea, “K” LINE is engaging in business development upstream and downstream in the energy value chain through par- ticipating in projects such as a drillship business off the coast of Brazil in 2009 and an FPSO* project in offshore Ghana in 2017.

 During the year, we integrated our containership business, one of our core businesses, into Ocean Network Express (ONE) through the business integration of three Japanese shipping companies, with ONE becoming an affiliated company accounted for by the equity-method, which was the main cause of a consolidated operating revenue decline of 28% compared to the previous fiscal year. In addition, ONE’s loss due to decreasing cargo volumes, our reserve against losses from chartering vessels to ONE and other factors resulted in an ordinary loss of ¥48.9 billion.

 Message from the President
ONE struggled but implemented structural reforms which bring sustained earnings improvement
Fiscal 2018 consolidated operating revenue decreased ¥325.2 billion year-on-year to ¥836.7 billion owing to trans- fer of containership business. We booked an operating loss of ¥24.7 billion (vs ¥7.2 billion operating income in fiscal 2017), ordinary loss of ¥48.9 billion (vs ¥2.0 billion ordinary income) and net loss attributable to owners of the parent of ¥111.2 billion (vs ¥10.4 billion net profit).
By segment, performance in the Dry Bulk and Energy Resource Transport segments were solid but results in the Product Logistics segment fell well short of our initial forecast. Market conditions in the Dry Bulk segment took a sharp turn for the worse in the second half of the year owing to the dam break in Brazil, but we achieved a return to profitability in this segment thanks to efforts to reduce operational costs and effective vessel allocation. Buoyed by medium- and long-term contracts, the Energy Resource Transport segment held steady overall with both revenue and profit increase chiefly due to initiatives to down-size market-exposed businesses. In the Product Logistics seg- ment, however, Ocean Network Express (ONE)—estab- lished through integration of the containership businesses of three Japanese shipping companies—recorded a loss of nearly $600 million after bearing the brunt of a sharp drop in cargo volume stemming from disorganized services imme- diately after it commenced operations in April 2018. As a
result, we booked an equity-method loss of ¥20.1 billion. In addition, containership business overall booked a loss of ¥48.8 billion, reflecting a one-off loss in the Company’s own containership business and provisioning of charter contract losses for chartered vessels for fiscal 2019.

Learning from our past,
flexible mindsets unshackled from conventional thinking, an enterprising spirit and teamwork—
these are the attributes
we must draw on to realize Revival for Greater Strides.
In April 2019 I was appointed president of “K” LINE. Since starting out as a shipping company with a fleet of 11 ships 100 years ago, we have weathered the storms of numerous challenges, thanks to the support of our customers and many other stakeholders and grown as a company by turning adver- sity into opportunity. In this last fiscal year of our medium-term management plan Revival for Greater Strides, all officers and employees are pulling together to tackle the key challenges that await us as we take the first steps towards another 100 years.
Meanwhile, having spent ¥51.9 billion on structural reforms, reducing the number of high-cost ships, net loss for the period came to ¥111.2 billion. Following careful preparation and consideration, we carried out these struc- tural reforms because we believe they will bring long-last- ing benefits and deliver the Company profitability from fiscal 2019 onwards. We have continued to work on regain- ing cost competitiveness in our fleets by promptly termi- nating charter contracts and reducing number of high-cost ships that we ordered prior to the global financial crisis.
As a result, our equity ratio temporarily dropped to 11%
Performance Forecast for Fiscal 2019
Targeting Profitability in all Segments
from 21% at end of the previous fiscal year but has already nominally recovered to 16% following our business portfolio review conducted over fiscal 2018-19 and arrangement for subordinated loans implemented at the start of fiscal 2019. We expect structural reforms carried out in fiscal 2018 will boost earnings by ¥11.0 billion in fiscal 2019, by ¥9.5 billion in 2020 and by ¥10.5 billion in 2021. Moreover, we aim to realize recovery and growth in our impaired equity capital as soon as possible by ensuring that we return to profitability from fiscal 2019.
 Our fiscal 2019 consolidated earnings forecasts are operat- ing revenue of ¥760 billion, operating income of ¥6 billion, ordinary income of ¥5 billion and net income attributable to owners of the parent of ¥11 billion. We are targeting prof- itability in all segments by restoring cost competitiveness in our fleets on the back of structural reforms carried out last year, implementing measures to improve income and expenditures for car carriers and profit improvement in the containership business.
In the Dry Bulk segment, structural reforms are bringing profit improvement in small- and medium-sized vessels. We are also working to enhance medium- and long-term con- tracts by cape-size carriers including transportation of bauxite to the Middle East. We forecast a year-on-year profit decline

Message from the President
for the segment in first half of the fiscal year due to the lin- gering impact of the market downturn at the end of fiscal 2018 and in the second half of the fiscal year due to dock- ing of some vessels to install SOx (sulfur oxide) scrubbers.
For the Energy Resource Transport segment, we antic- ipate a strong year-on-year earnings improvement. Three newly-built LNG carriers for UK-based BP and Australia’s Ichthys LNG Project, which commenced operations last year, should deliver full-year earnings contributions in the LNG carrier business, and we aim to chalk up stable earn- ings in the thermal coal carrier business by way of medium- and long-term contracts with the addition of eight new ships, including replacements, built over the last two years. Meanwhile, in the oil tanker business, we withdrew from the petroleum product tanker business in the first quarter. By thoroughly managing risk and selecting and concentrat- ing our assets, we continue to shift to an earnings structure that is less susceptible to the impact of market volatility.
In the Product Logistics segment, even though we fore- cast profit of ¥2.8 billion (under equity method) at ONE driven by improved earnings, we anticipate an overall ¥11.0 billion loss in containership business after factoring in fis- cal 2020 provisions for charter contract losses. We expect the streamlining of unprofitable shipping routes, business reorganization and a recovery in freight rates to boost earn- ings by ¥5.5 billion in car carrier business, which booked a loss last fiscal year. We will return to our roots and con- duct business in line with our capabilities with an emphasis on profitability rather than scale. We expect to pull in sta- ble earnings in both logistics business and short sea and coastal business.
Progress on Medium-Term Management Plan
Focus Still on Key Issues
Fiscal 2019 is the final year of our medium-term manage- ment plan Revival for Greater Strides. In order to boost our earnings capabilities and lay the foundations for strong management, the plan focuses on three priority initiatives: (1) rebuilding portfolio strategy; (2) advanced business man- agement and enhancement of function-specific strategies; and (3) ESG initiatives. On top of this, the plan called for the following financial targets: (1) three consecutive years of sustained profit; (2) ROA of 6% in businesses with sta- ble earnings; (3) ordinary income from stable business of ¥30 billion; (4) an increase in shareholders’ equity ratio to mid-20% level and (5) early resumption of dividend pay- ments. At the end of second year of the plan, our progress was more or less on target for ROA (5.7%) and stable earn- ings (¥27 billion), but due to the structural reforms imple- mented with the aim of an earnings recovery from fiscal 2019, we failed to achieve the key initiatives of sustained profit, equity ratio increase and dividend resumption.
We still see shareholder returns as a key issue, but for the time being we will give top priority to improving our finan- cial condition and stabilizing our business platform, which is why at this juncture we have yet to announce any dividend plans. We deeply apologize to all of our shareholders and investors and kindly ask for their understanding at this time.

“K” LINE REPORT 2019
Re-building Portfolio Strategy
For the first key initiative, rebuilding portfolio strategy, based on our clear vision we have continued to push ahead with a process of selection and concentration in order to fully maximize the strengths of the Group.
Specifically, the integration of our containership business was a major decision to make. This business is strikingly different to other businesses in that it has a high external procurement cost ratio, requires a broad-ranging network and can easily leverage economies of scale. Given that mar- ket share of three Japanese lines is limited, we determined that a business integration between the three would be the best solution.
In fiscal 2018, operations kicked off at ONE and we dis- posed of high-cost ships by terminating charter contracts for several container vessels and dry bulk carriers. At the same time, we took steps to sell off non-core assets, includ- ing real estate and cross-shareholdings. Moreover, we are

 collaborating with harbor logistics company Kamigumi in the harbor transportation business in an effort to bring in exter- nal sources of capital and leverage their expert knowledge.
Following spin-off of the containership business, we have been working to strengthen our stable earnings base at the Company through a process of concentrating and redistrib- uting managerial resources across our four earnings pillars: dry bulk, energy resource transport, car carriers and logistics business. In order to properly hold stable earnings of ¥27 bil- lion we generated in fiscal 2018, we will continue to scale down market-sensitive businesses through the process of selection and concentration and steadily accumulate stable earnings through medium- and long-term contracts.
Business Portfolio Rebuilding
As for the enhancement of function-specific strategies, we established an AI/Digitalization Promotion Division and a Corporate Marketing Strategy Division in order to anticipate in advance the needs of our customers and provide them with new value (see Special Feature 2 on page 15 for details). For example, we continue to equip our ships with K-IMS, a big data-driven vessel operation management system. This system provides optimal navigational support by monitoring the ship’s status in real time and relaying up to 2,000 items of big data, including information related to operations and engine plants, between ship and shore at 30-minute inter- vals. By combining new technologies with conventional maritime knowledge, we hope to deliver safe and reliable shipping services, improve fuel consumption through opti- mum operations, enhance service quality, including mea- sures for preventing accidents and engine trouble, and provide new added value to customers. The vast amount of knowledge and data related to vessel operations is a valuable asset of the “K” LINE Group and we believe we can create new value by combining it with the latest ICT technology.
Pursuing ESG Initiatives
The significance of our Company’s existence is defined in our corporate principle of helping to enrich people’s lives instead of simply seeking profit, we aim to contribute to the sustainable development of society through our business activities. The focus of pursuing ESG initiatives, the third key component in our medium-term management plan, is on the implementation of our corporate principle from the per- spectives of environment (E), social (S) and governance (G).
As a shipping company, the roots of our business are inter- twined with the environment, which means we must pro- tect the bounties of the sea, our field of business. We take an active approach to environmental preservation based on our own targets in line with “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, our long-term environmental policy formulated in 2015. As a result, our efforts have been recognized externally, high- lighted by our selection in the CDP A List for action on climate change for the third year running. We also stress the use of cutting-edge technology as a useful tool for implementing

     Advanced Business Management and Enhancement of Function-Specific Strategies
For the second key initiative, advanced business manage- ment and enhancement of function-specific strategies, we are working on establishing a new risk management system based on a review of our excessive investments in the past. We aim to periodically manage aggregate risk amounts on a group-wide and individual unit level in an effort to maximize returns on investment comparable to risk. This will enable us to pursue an optimal business portfolio in which we can expand business fields that deliver greater earnings com- mensurate to risk, but when we are unable to do so, we can allocate our resources to other fields.

Message from the President
environmental measures—the K-IMS is one example of this. In terms of the social element, the Group considers safety in navigation and cargo operations and the development of human resources to be key components. Safe operation of our ships forms the basis of our business. To this end, our business continuity depends on the securing of human resources, particularly maritime technical personnel, includ- ing foreign seafarers, as well as the enhancement of train-
ing courses and facilities.
And lastly, governance is indispensable to fulfilling our cor-
porate social responsibility and operating our businesses in an

appropriate manner, including how we address environmen- tal and social initiatives. In addition to establishing a corpo- rate governance structure, we have continued to strengthen our risk management system by drawing up guidelines based on Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, creating a Nominating Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee, increasing the number of outside directors to reinforce oversight, and adopting a unit supervi- sory system to enhance business execution. This fiscal year we will further beef up our governance framework by raising the number of auditors and outside directors.
 Concerted Group-Wide Efforts to Enhance Corporate Value
The Company celebrated its 100th anniversary in April 2019. We are extremely grateful to the ongoing support we have hitherto received from all our stakeholders, includ- ing customers, shareholders, investors, business partners, regional communities and employees.
The founding organization of the Company, Kawasaki Dockyard (now Kawasaki Heavy Industries), was established through the investment in kind of surplus stock boats (ships built in anticipation of demand) following the end of World War I. The story of how the unfavorable situation of having excess stock boats was turned into an opportunity in antic- ipation of future growth in global trade is considered the source of our enterprising spirit, broad-mindedness and inde- pendence and autonomy-collectively, the “K” LINE spirit.
Driven by the “K” LINE spirit inherited since the time of the Company’s founding, the Group has overcome numer- ous challenges to continually provide new value.
In 1970 we built Japan’s first pure car carrier, the Toyota
Maru No. 10, which enabled us to stabilize then-problem- atic scheduling and dramatically improve loading efficiency and safety. Accordingly, we were able to provide an unprec- edented level of value to our customers. Even after that we delivered a number of industry firsts, such as the Bishu Maru—Japan’s first LNG carrier—to meet growing demand for oil alternatives, our Corona series of wide-beam, shal- low-draft ships that became the industry standard for thermal coal transportation, and the first double-stack rail transport service by a Japanese shipping company in North America.
All these initiatives were achieved by listening to cus- tomer feedback, harnessing our enterprising “K” LINE spirit and leveraging teamwork, one of the Company’s strengths. As a Company that strives to be first in the industry, we have embraced new challenges as “WARESAKI KISEN” by learning from our past and adopting flexible mindsets unshackled from conventional thinking. Without losing sight of this indomitable spirit, we must remain a profes- sional organization that our customers can depend upon the most and that can earnestly respond to their needs.
Fiscal 2019 will be a key milestone year in which we wrap up our Revival for Greater Strides medium-term manage- ment plan and move into the next stage of medium-term planning. All officers and employees will be making con- certed efforts to expand our financial foundation, build a structure that can generate steady earnings growth and enhance corporate value. I look forward to the continued support and understanding of all our stakeholders.

This division is the engine for promoting the intro- duction of solutions and advanced technology,
starting with AI and IoT, which are evolving daily. We work to further improve the quality of existing service based on safety in navigation and cargo operations, and to provide high value-added total logistics services that can be converted into value for our customers and broadly in society.
We are working to organically integrate and further develop the various technologies and services cultivated across all divisions to date, to move forward not only internally, but also through proactive cooperation with universities and other external research institutes, to enable us to produce results more effectively and with a greater sense of speed. Specifically, we are pressing forward toward the actualiza- tion of various ideas that surpass conventional frameworks, including analyzing the data gathered from vessels in opera- tion in order to streamline ship operations and strengthen the functions of systems that strive to predict accidents before they occur, and conducting proving tests for hull inspections using drone technology. In addition, we believe that these ini- tiatives will lead to the creation of a new business model. We also have our sights set on reforming our internal operat- ing style and are promoting business process reengineering (BPR) geared toward improving productivity in an effort to be an organization that supports the Group’s AI and digitalization.

has worked on individually to date, and we will actu- alize a system that enables the provision of optimal solutions to our customers as we strive to strengthen customer response capacity across the “K” LINE Group toward the creation of a new, comprehensive business model pivoting on customer relationship management.
As it becomes increasingly difficult to use services to dif- ferentiate ourselves in the marine transportation and logis- tics sectors, we will continue our efforts to strengthen relationships with existing customers starting with initia- tives for project transportation, fully understand our cus- tomers’ needs, and use our safe transportation system to provide more convenient, higher-quality services as solu- tions to the logistics infrastructure demand of our custom- ers with a focus on emerging economies. In addition, we are coordinating multiple businesses and projects, and promoting the building of a new, comprehensive business model that creates value-added in cooperation with cus- tomers, external organizations and others, while working together with our Advanced Technology Group and the AI/ Digitalization Promotion Division to incorporate new tech- nologies and mechanisms.

Amid rapid advancements in digitalization and AI technologies, the world of marine transportation has started embracing new technologies. Our dry bulk busi- ness actively deploys digital innovation, such as using technology to automate routine work and improve work efficiency. We are also developing a database contain- ing large volumes of information about our ships and car- goes. We will use this database to develop systems to
enhance our sales and business activities. In addition, we are introducing an external AI market forecasting ser- vice on a trial basis while conducting research to apply this to our sales strategy. We will unite in our quest to address changing business conditions and create new value, and will continue working incessantly to meet the needs of customers.

    Overview of Fiscal 2018
During the year, we launched three newly-built vessels and operated existing fleets smoothly under medium- and long-term transportation contracts. Although demand for coal is strongly affected by seasonal factors, we sought to efficiently deploy vessels throughout the year, and we also benefited from improvements in the dry bulk carrier market. Accordingly, both revenue and profit increased year on year.

Thermal Coal Carrier Business
 We will contribute to stable transportation to meet strong demand for thermal coal by our high-quality dedicated thermal coal carriers.
Basic Strategies
• Expand fleet of dedicated thermal coal carriers (Corona Series)
• Provide flexible vessel deployment adapting to fluctua- tions in coal demand
• Increase the number of medium- and long-term trans- portation contracts, which contribute to earnings stability
• Ensure efficient vessel allocation and economical operation
• Meet customer needs related to environmental respon- sibilities and transportation quality control
Strengths
• Long-term relationships of trust with electric power companies
• High-quality transportation service built on dedicated thermal coal carrier fleet and good ship management
• Diverse knowledge of thermal coal transportation accu- mulated over many years
   Maintain dedicated fleets for coal-fired power plants that are
essential for the safety of Japan’s energy requirements
TOPICS
Coal-fired power generation is a stable and eco- nomical means of power supply and a highly important fuel source in light of Japan’s geograph- ical limitations. Although coal-fired power generation emits more CO2 than LNG-based power, Japan’s coal- fired power stations deliver high combustion efficiency and world-class environmental performance. Based on the long-term energy supply and demand outlook of Japan’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, coal-fired power generation is expected to account for 26% of domestic electricity needs in 2030. To effec- tively meet demand for thermal coal transportation, we will proceed with maintenance of our dedicated ther-
mal coal fleets while reducing environmental impacts.

One new LNG carrier for JERA Co., Inc. named ENSHUMARU was delivered last year. The vessel will be engaged in LNG transportation for the Freeport LNG project in Texas, United States, and will contribute to energy transporta- tion stability in Japan.
In Ise Bay, we established a joint venture following our decision to enter the LNG bunkering business targeting ships in Japan. We also concluded a shipbuilding contract
with Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. for one bunkering vessel to supply LNG to ships. Scheduled for completion in September–December 2020, it will become the first LNG bunkering vessel in Japan.
The Company will continue working with our partners in various LNG-related businesses to address the growing needs of the energy value chain business.

Targeting profitability improvement, we will thoroughly reassess our services bound for Europe and vice versa, and services other than to/from Japan to enhance the efficiency in vessel deployment. Accordingly, we forecast a 5.3% year-on-year decrease in complete built-up cars shipped by the “K” LINE Group, to 3.47 million units in fiscal 2019.
While shipments from Far East Asia to Europe and North America will remain firm, we expect recovery in cargo vol- umes to resource-rich countries in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere to be limited. In addition, there is a risk of down- turn in cargo volumes due to U.S. customs’ issues, Brexit and the like, so we need to monitor the situation closely. We are

 We Promote Comprehensive Logistics Services by Combining the Strengths of various Group companies.
Basic Strategies
• Expand logistics business spearheaded by “K” LINE LOGISTICS, LTD.
• Create and strengthen business models across Group companies
• Reorganize and expand global network
• Strengthen locally-oriented logistics services
• Develop project cargo freight service
• Enhance buyers consolidation*1 services
Strengths
• Use of the Company’s group-wide assets and global network
• Intra-group sharing and development of customer-first business model
• Ability to make proposals backed by accumulated know- how and technological expertise
*1. Buyers consolidation: Consolidation-distribution system in which a single buyer uses an agent to collect products from multiple local manufacturers and load them into containers for transportation to destination, providing greater shipping efficiency and reduction in cost, lead time, inventory and warehouse work.
  Overview of Fiscal 2018
In our domestic logistics business, we posted a temporary decline in capacity utilization due to natural disasters in the second quarter of the fiscal year. However, steady demand for logistics—centered on integrated transportation by sea and land, warehousing and towing—led to increases in net sales and profit. In the international logistics busi- ness, healthy semiconductor-related cargo movements via air freight transportation, as well as increased demand for e-commerce-related freight, contributed to earnings.
However, we posted an increase in costs associated with strengthening our logistics business after the container- ship business integration. For the overall logistics business, therefore, sales increased year on year, but profit declined.
Fiscal 2019 Business Policies
In fiscal 2019, we expect domestic logistics demand to remain steady, especially for integrated transportation by sea and land, warehousing and towing, allowing us to gen- erate stable earnings. In international logistics, we forecast continued strength in semiconductor and e-commerce-re- lated shipments, which will contribute to earnings.
We will strive to further expand the customer base of our NVOCC business,*2 spearheaded by “K” LINE
LOGISTICS, LTD. Here, we will work together with other Group companies on various aspects, such as introduction of new systems and human resource support, in order to foster and strengthen our logistics business.
In addition, we will step up efforts to share regional information and know-how while adopting a selection and concentration approach to priority growth fields in order to enhance and functionally connect our various regional busi- nesses. We will also harness our comprehensive Group-wide strengths to deliver one-stop logistics services to custom- ers whose needs have not been met by existing services.
In the meantime, we will closely monitor the latest industry trends and identify potential demand, with a focus on tapping demand for buyers consolidation services to address small-lot, multiple-commodity shipments, project cargo transportation and other fields.
In April 2019, we launched a harbor transportation busi- ness in collaboration with Kamigumi Co., Ltd. We will work together with Kamigumi and utilize our respective strengths, including knowledge, technology and manage- ment resources, to maximize synergies in the joint business.
Going forward, we will target diversification of services and business expansion with the aim of becoming a strate- gic business partner in logistics that customers can trust.
*2. NVOCC business: Freight transportation business that includes inciden- tal services, such as cargo handling, as an intermediary between ship- pers and carriers, during the cargo transportation process.

 Value Creation Initiatives
TOPICS
In 1989, we entered the cold storage business with the establishment of Bangkok Cold Storage Service, Ltd. in Bangkok, Thailand. In the 30 years since then, we have built a track record by providing a wide range of services, includ- ing delivery, customs clearance and distribution processing.
Using knowledge cultivated in Thailand, in 2015 we established CLK COLD STORAGE COMPANY LIMITED in Vietnam as a joint venture between three compa- nies: “K” LINE, Cool Japan Fund Inc. and Japan Logistic Systems Corp. The joint venture operates Vietnam’s first
four-temperature-zone warehouse (for frozen, refriger- ated, chilled and constant-temperature goods) with vari- ous cargo damage prevention and energy saving features.
Leveraging our maritime and air transportation net- works, we will build a high-quality, high-value-added cold chain that contributes to economic development in Vietnam and Thailand and helps improve the quality of their citizens’ lives. We will also promote the spread of Japanese food products and cooking ingredients in those countries where demand is expected to increase.

 We will promote modal shift in our Coastal Business, improve the profitability of our Short Sea Business, and enhance our OSV* Business.
Basic Strategies
• Improve profitability of Coastal Business by promoting modal shift
• Stabilize long-term profitability of Short Sea Business by capturing market conditions and customer needs
• Increase profitability of OSV Business by improving business efficiency and strengthening sales capability
Strengths
• Appropriately address customer demand associated with changing conditions in Short Sea and domestic logistics
• Multi-faceted businesses such as international, coastal and OSV businesses
• OSV business in line with government policies
• Modal shift in response to shortage of truck drivers * OSV: Offshore support vessel
  Overview of Fiscal 2018
Our Short Sea business benefited from recovery in freight rates and an increase in shipments of mainstay Russian coal and biomass fuel cargo, resulting in improved profitability. In Coastal Business, we reported an increase in cargo volume thanks to the regular Shimizu–Oita RORO route, which is now a daily service, as well as the opening of the Miyako– Muroran ferry route. In OSV Business, meanwhile, we provided support for seafloor seismic surveys of Nankai Trough and participated in VLCC rescue work. These activi- ties led to an increase in net sales of Short Sea and Coastal Business. However, profit declined due to increased expenses stemming from expansion of ferry services.
Fiscal 2019 Business Policies
In Short Sea business, we will continue upgrading our fleet, including new vessels, to further improve earnings, maintain and expand our commercial rights, and stabi- lize balance. In Coastal Business, which faces shortage of truck drivers as a social issue, we will provide reliable RORO and Ferry services aimed at tapping new demand for maritime transport. In OSV Business, we will engage in businesses related to the national government’s Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, which includes installation of off- shore wind power generation equipment, while working to attract new customers.

  Opening of Miyako–Muroran Ferry route connecting Hokkaido and Tohoku regions
 TOPICS
In June 2018, we opened a new passenger ferry route connecting Miyako Port in Iwate Prefecture and Muroran Port in Hokkaido—a 10-hour, one-way trip. The service leaves and returns once each day. Within fis- cal 2020, most segments of the 359km Reconstruction Road linking Sendai City in Miyagi Prefecture with Hachinohe City in Aomori Prefecture along the Sanriku Coast will be open, making the daily Miyako–Muroran
round-trip ferry service more accessible.

   Overview of Fiscal 2018
In April 2018, our Containership business was integrated into Ocean Network Express (ONE), a new company formed by three Japanese companies.
Containerships operated by “K” LINE prior to the busi- ness integration have since been chartered by ONE and allocated to ONE services. Initially, ONE’s cargo volume did not reach its target due to service disruptions, but that issue has since been resolved and the volume has recovered.
Moreover, we are starting to see the anticipated syn- ergistic benefits of the integration, including cost reduc- tions for inland rail costs and terminal costs, rationalization of routes and saving fuel costs. ONE is also improving services for profitability improvement by clarifying issues and steadily implementing its action plan. For entire fiscal 2019, we forecast increased year-on-year sales and profit from this business.
In Port Business, where we aim to operate high-stan- dard, high-quality terminals, we continue to upgrade our cargo handling equipment and terminal facilities to accom- modate larger containerships.

Environmental Preservation
Securing Blue Seas for Tomorrow, through 2050 and Further in the Future
The “K” LINE Group is aware and recognizes that addressing environmental concerns is an issue shared by all mankind. Therefore, the “K” LINE Group is taking proactive measures as an essential condition for its existence and for conducting a business enterprise, striving to reduce the environmental impact of its business activities, and seeking to contribute to the development of a sustainable society.
  Environmental Measures and History of the Shipping Industry
In the shipping industry, initiatives for safety and the environ- ment began to be addressed internationally around 100 years ago, the same time as “K” LINE’s founding. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) was enacted in response to safety concerns following the Titanic acci- dent which occurred in 1912. However, environmental con- cerns were dealt with mainly at the regional level until around 1950, and it was not until after the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was established in 1958 that the initia- tives for global environment began to be addressed. Larger ships were then being developed with the rising volume of marine transportation, and various types carriers were intro- duced as well. The 1970’s oil crises became driving forces for the energy saving movement. Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) under IMO was launched in 1973, after which the shipping sectors started to tackle
In 2015, amid increasing interest in the preservation of the global environment, we reviewed the importance of the environmental impact of “K” LINE’s businesses from both the perspectives of our stakeholders and the Company. We identified four issues, namely, “marine pollution and the ecosystem,” “energy resources,” “global warming,”
’s Goals
international environment in earnest. Subsequently, large- scale oil spill accidents by large tankers occurred in suc- cession, and IMO took measures, such as double hull. In the 1990s, United Nations treaties were enacted on issues concerning the lives of all the world’s people, including the Basel Convention that restricts the transboundary move- ment of hazardous waste and the Framework Convention on Climate Change for countering global warming. At IMO, discussions on environmental concerns have increased rapidly, and issues and measures have been raised, such as the impact of ballast water on the ecosystem that is still being dealt with, and reduction of SOx, NOx, and other contents from the emission gases of ships. In response to the establishment of the Paris Agreement in 2015, it was decided that international shipping would aim for zero GHG emissions by the second half of the 21st century.
and “air pollution.” With a view toward sustainable growth together with society, and toward passing on a blue and beautiful ocean to the next generation, we formulated the “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, which sets forth our long-term goals for 2050. The year 2019 marks an interim milestones of this Vision.
  “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050: Securing Blue Seas for Tomorrow
Navigating for Sustainability Leading to a Brighter Future
  We will continue our voyage with a view towards achieving our goals for 2050 set in consideration of the future circumstances surrounding our business and various issues in the area of the global environment. To further confirm our navigation track toward these goals for 2050, we have also set a milestone to be reached by 2019, the year marking the 100th anniversary of our foundation.

An Outlook on Future Society (According to an Outsider’s Analysis) and Issues in the Environmental Sector
 When we formulated our Environmental Vision 2050, we conducted scenario analyses to forecast the environmen- tal outlook, including future climate change issues 90% of all CO2 emissions arising from our business activities are directly emitted from vessels under our operation. Therefore, we carried out the analyses based on CO2 emis- sion projections for international shipping by 2050 per an IMO GHG Study published by IMO. This study expects that the population will increase due to economic growth
Future Circumstances Surrounding Our Business
Growing global population
7.2 billion → 9.0 billion mainly in emerging economies
Economic growth and demand hikes chiefly
in emerging economies
The global economy will grow to nearly four times
its current size*2
As a result, demand will also increase for energy and many other resources.
Increase in marine transportation volume
More than double the current level*3
*1. SBT (Science Based Target): Target scientifically consistent with the level achieving “2°C goal” of the Paris Agreement
*2 OECD (2012): OECD Environmental Outlook to 2050 published in 2012 *3 Estimation of Global Insight Corporation with “K” LINE’s forecast
in emerging economies and increasing demand in marine transportation volume and that CO2 emissions from inter- national shipping will increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 from 2012 levels. With regard to physical risks from cli- mate change, we referenced IPCC scenarios and also took into account Japan’s 2030 energy policy, and hull life. As a result, we reaffirmed that demand for environmentally- friendly marine transportation services will increase and that reducing the environmental impact is a challenge.
Issues in the Environmental Sector
Mounting needs for environmental actions
New conditions for competition, including tougher regula- tions, will be introduced to suppress the impact, resulting from the growth in marine transportation volume and the massive con- sumption of energy resources, on the atmosphere and the ocean.
Energy diversification
Global warming, shortage of resources and other issues will swiftly lead to diversified energy sources.
Actualizing global warming
Without a considerable reduction of worldwide CO2 emissions, global warming will have a more serious adverse impact on the foundations of people’s lives.There is also concern about its impact on port and harbor facilities, as
it may damage them, and on the safety of operations.

 Long-Term Goals for 2050
  Marine pollution and the ecosystem
 •Oil pollution accidents have serious impacts on the ecosystem.
•Loss of confidence in safety means a loss of confidence in us as a business operator.
•Continuing to avoid causing serious acci- dents will help increase customers’ confi- dence in us.
•By fulfilling our duty as a marine business operator, we can hand down the ocean to the next generation by keeping it clean.
  Continue avoiding serious marine ac- cidents and be the industry’s leader in protection of the ecosystem
  Energy resources
  •Exhaustion of resources and a fuel price surge would affect business profitability.
•Delay in action for stable energy procure- ment and for diversification means a loss of competitiveness.
 •Ensures stable business continuity and in- creases our reliability as a business operator.
•Will enable us to take opportunities to en- ter new business fields including resources exploitation.
   Replace majority
of energy currently consumed with new energy sources
  Global warming
   •Frequent disasters caused by unsettled weather conditions undermine safety in ship operations.
•Sea level rise will lead to the destruction of port and harbor facilities and coastal districts.
  •Stabilization of weather conditions leads to safety and efficiency in operation.
•Generate new transportation demand, such as the transportation of hydrogen.
    Reduce CO2 emis- sions by half (from 2011 level)
  Air pollution
  •Regulations on exhaust gas from ships, con- taining SOx, NOx, PM and other pollutants regarded as hampering growth of humans, animals and plants, will be stricter and the cost incurred for compliance will soar.
 •By taking the lead in introducing equipment that complies with tough regulations, we will gain trust as a business operator and ad- vanced competitiveness.
   Aim for zero emissions
   Governance
 Risk Management (See page 49 for Risk Management)
  The Environmental Sub-Committee under the CSR & Environmental Committee (chaired by the President & CEO) is led by an executive officer in charge of ship technical and environmental affairs and is comprised of employees in charge of environmental affairs from internal divisions and Group companies. The Sub-Committee develops an environ- ment management system for identifying the environmen- tal impacts of our businesses and making improvements to minimize them, also implements the PDCA cycle to promote continuous improvements. The content of its discussions is reported at the Officers’ Meeting. (See page 31 for a chart of the CSR Promotion System.)
We have established a system for managing crises and risks in order to recognize diverse management risks, includ- ing responses to climate change, and to prepare for them. Specifically, we have established four committees for respond- ing to four different types of risks: risks in ship operations, risks of disasters, risks concerning compliance, and other risks related to management. (Risks concerning the environment are handled by the Management Risk Committee.) We have also set up the Crisis Management Committee as an organi- zation to unify the four committees and facilitate overall risk management. Furthermore, important business strategies and investment plans related to environmental preservation are discussed at committees concerning our medium-term management plan and investment and reported to the monthly Board of Directors’ meeting. (See page 36 for the system related to Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations.)

   DRIVE GREEN NETWORK (DGN)
Group-Wide Promotion of Environmental Management
  Preserving the environment is one of “K” LINE’s man- agement priorities. In 2017, we launched “DRIVE GREEN NETWORK,” a system for promoting environmental management by the entire “K” LINE Group.
The name, “DRIVE GREEN NETWORK,” embodies our desire of inheriting the spirit put into the construction of DRIVE GREEN HIGHWAY, our next-generation eco- friendly flagship which was completed in 2016 under the concept of “getting one step ahead for the future”.
Through internal audits, we centrally manages our envi- ronmental policies and target settings that Group compa- nies reflected in their respective businesses as well as the efforts toward their achievement (through the PDCA cycle), to promote environmental preservation activities while ensuring environmental compliance throughout the entire Group. In Phase 1, the network started with
applicable companies’ activities are being implemented in accordance with Drive Green Network management standards. The Statement is effective for marine trans- portation services (including onshore administration work such as general affairs, accounting, legal, and PR) and ship management of a fleet of owned ships, as well as for shipping and logistics businesses conducted by “K” LINE Group companies. From 2018, we have scaled up the project to include companies in other countries and aim to establish a network of all Group companies in 2019, which marks the 100th Anniversary of “K” LINE. In 2015, we founded the “K” LINE Group Environmental Awards to recognize and share exceptional environmen- tal preservation and contribution activities of domestic and overseas Group companies. Every year, the recip- ients are selected by taking into account such stand- points as“originality,” “challenge level,” “degree of contribution,” “continuity” and “potential for perva- siveness” and are awarded by our President & CEO. The maritime and onshore units will continue to collectively execute our businesses while always being conscious of environmental preservation.

Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Maintaining World-leading Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
Establishing and maintaining safety in navigation and cargo operations represent an immutable mission in running a shipping business. “Providing reliable and excellent services” is one of the most import- ant parts of the “K” LINE Group’s corporate principle and vision and reflects its commitment to bene- fiting society. To this end, we have three policy pillars: (1) Enhancing Safety Management System; (2) Strengthening Ship Management System; and (3) Securing and Training Maritime Technical Personnel.
The Ship Safety Promotion Committee, chaired by the President & CEO, is the top decision-making body covering safety. It determines accident prevention and safety measures for all ships operated by the Company—including owned, chartered, and entrusted vessels—and handles everything from basic policy formulation to implementation of measures under the sys- tem shown below.

  FOCUS
Safety Report System
Our Safety Report System encourages boarding crew members to report on near-miss incidents, such as unsafe behavior and unsafe conditions on a vessel. Such reports are received and carefully analyzed by experienced techni- cal personnel on shore duty, and the results are fed back to similar-type vessels with easy-to-understand illustrations. By entrenching a non-blaming culture, where the respon- sibility of near-miss parties is not called into question, we receive thousands of reports annually, which helps safety awareness to take root on the front lines.
“K” Line-Drive to No Accident (K-DNA): Safety Equipment Installation Guidelines
K-DNA is our unique safety equipment installation guidelines that reflect know-how accumulated in the field and lessons learned from past accidents. K-DNA consists of installation standards, such as for navigation equipment, institutional equipment, safety protection, and anti-piracy measures. The K-DNA Working Group continuously improves the guidelines by pooling insight from various angles and works to enhance the safety of all operating vessels from the hardware per- spective. K-DNA is essentially the DNA that succeeds the Company’s history of safe navigation.

 Once a year, we regularly conduct an Emergency Response Drill based on a scenario of a major accident occurred on our ships. Following the “Emergency Response Manual,” we work on practical exercises such as mock press conferences in order for all the staff to perform “swift” and “accurate” responses to accidents not only on the sea but also on shore in an emergency. After the drills, we also receive multiple evaluations from ship management companies, the MLIT, lawyers, consultants and insurance companies to identify problems and improve the procedures in the manual.

Human Resource Development [Maritime Technical Personnel]
Securing and Training the World’s Leading Maritime Technical Personnel, Responsible for Safety in Navigation and Cargo Operations
The “K” LINE Group regards securing and training exceptional maritime technical personnel as one of its three policy pillars for continuously ensuring safety in navigation and cargo operations. Spearheaded by the “K” Line Maritime Academy (KLMA), a scheme to develop maritime technical personnel, we strive to pass down maritime know-how and foster technicians who can respond to new needs.
   Securing and Training Maritime Technical Personnel
It is a priority issue in international shipping to secure and train Japanese maritime technical personnel, who are expected to become leaders in charge of foreign seafar- ers both onboard and onshore. In order to train exceptional maritime technical personnel at the Company, in 2013 we established an in-house training course and started recruit- ing students from non-maritime universities, in addition to students from seafarer educational institutions.
In the training perspective, we enhance the careers of each personnel through both onboard and onshore work, including onshore training at the KLMA (Machida) Training Center and programs onboard. We have also introduced training not only to enhance the knowledge and technical skills of individuals but also to raise their teamwork skills, and are training a group of world-class maritime technical personnel.
At “K” LINE, safety supervisors make active ship visits to raise awareness about preventing work-related accidents and illnesses. In addition, they meet with personnel one- on-one to exchange views and provide advices in order to mitigate any concerns and/or dissatisfaction, as part of our mental healthcare efforts. Furthermore, newsletters from safety supervisors are issued every month containing pro- posals for improving human relations and communication in the ship, approaches to work, and accident prevention information. At the seminar for Japanese maritime techni- cal personnel onshore and on leave held twice a year, we hold mental health lectures and safety training not only for new but also for seasoned employees. We also plan to offer such lectures and training to foreign seafarers.
The ships managed by the “K” LINE Group are navigated not only by Japanese sea- farers but also by seafarers of a variety of nationalities, including the Philippines, Bulgaria, China, and India. As a principle, we secure and train the seafarers (see pie chart). Filipino seafarers make up half of this group, and therefore, KLMA (Philippines) forms the core of “securing and training seafarers” for the “K” LINE Group. We have expanded our training facilities by constructing a new building in the Philippines in March 2018, and completing repairs of the existing building in July 2018. At the HQ office, we are also currently providing on-the-job training to Filipino seafarers, which is same as the training provided to Japanese seafarers, to be able to support technical personnel from shore.

Occupational Health and Safety
   Voice Shutaro Uto Marine Safety Team, Marine Safety Administration Group
My wish to pursue a seafaring career dates back to when I was job hunting in university. After joining the Company, I studied for about two years at Marine Technical College in Kobe. When I held my certificate of competency for the first time, I was overcome with a sense of responsibility that I would be supporting global logistics as a “K” LINE Deck officer. I was then onboard for approximately three years, and since 2019 I have been with the Marine Safety Administration Group onshore. Drawing on the knowledge and experience I gained on ships, I intend to take advantage of my position as a junior employee to bring a breath of fresh air into “K” LINE’s culture of safety in navigation and cargo operations.

    Voice Stephen Ian Espinosa Seafarers Policy Team, Marine Human Resource Group
By gaining practical experience at the HQ office as part of my career development, I can get a deeper understanding of the Company’s operations from a wider perspective. In this way, I can acquire not only onboard skills but also fundamental knowledge related to onshore work.

Developing Human Resources to Drive Our Tireless Commitment to Innovation
In order to provide high-quality logistics services based on its customer-first policy, the “K” LINE Group strives to develop human resources, which is the driving force of this goal. Through job rotation and en- hanced training programs, we are fostering professionals who will underpin our core businesses of the next generation. We also seek to improve productivity through workstyle reforms and diversification. To this end, we strive to foster an organizational culture enabling our people to maximize their personal ca- pabilities and individual traits.
   Human Resource Development
“K” LINE offers a training program (figure on the right) comprised of two parts: annual stratified training and practical training.
Introduction of Assistant Manager System
In 2018, “K” LINE established the assistant manager system, with the aim that employees will gain management experi- ence early, not only to enhance their management skills but also to strengthen the organization’s operational capabilities and develop an efficient structure for business execution.
Trainer-Trainee System
“K” LINE has a trainer-trainee system to enable new employees to engage in actual work shortly after joining the Company. Trainers (employees in their seventh year or later) conduct follow-ups of trainees (new employees) with the aim of giving them a secure step up as business professionals.
Health Management
Based on the recognition that the health of employees is the source of their individual happiness and is essen- tial for achieving the principles of the Company, “K” LINE supports employee health by holding seminars on eat- ing habits and projects for improved physical wellbeing, among other activities. Simultaneously, “K” LINE carries out work-style reforms not only to adapt to laws and reg- ulations but also to promote reduction of overtime work and employees’ acquisition of paid leave.

Diverse Work Styles
Introduction of Telecommuting System
“K” LINE introduced the telecommuting system in FY2018. Reduction in commuting time has led to better work-life balance. Furthermore, employees are able to remain con- centrated on their work due to the decreased burden of commuting, which contributes to greater work efficiency.
Leave System for Spouse’s Work Relocation
This system enables employees of “K” LINE to take up to two years of leave if their spouse is assigned to a position overseas or elsewhere in Japan. Nine employees have used this system in the past five years.
*1. The Company has adopted a 7-hour workday system. Comparing the figures shown above against those under the system of 8-hour work- day (statutory working hours), our actual working hours can be further reduced by an average of 20.4 hours per month.
*2. A total number of annual paid leave and our special paid leave of 7 days.
Voice Mayumi Kawase Raw Material Team, Bulk Carrier Group
By taking advantage of the telecommuting system and working at home, I can better focus on my work than at the office and get work done, such as preparing materials and compiling data. It relieves the stress of commuting by train and frees up the time spent commuting to and back from the office. As a result, I have more time and mental energy to spend on my daily housework and with my family. Another great point is that this system can be combined with half-day leave.

  “K” LINE Spirit—born of a progressive approach
Nakatsuka Congratulations on your 100th Anniversary. When reading about the 100-year history of the “K” LINE Group, I was impressed by its many innovative achieve- ments, such as Japan’s first Pure Car Carrier. How did this kind of corporate culture come about?
Myochin We celebrated our 100th Anniversary on April 5, 2019, but the very founding of the Company is owed to the enterprising spirit of turning adversity into opportunity after ending up with too many stock boats. While there were many ups and downs in our history af- ter that, we drew strength from “K” LINE’s enterprising spirit, broad-mindedness, independence and autonomy to overcome every challenge we faced. In particular, our enterprising spirit for finding solutions to customer needs by thinking outside of the box is a strength that differen- tiates us from other carriers, and I think the process of honing this attribute gave rise to our identity of always striving to be first.
Sustainable management now required more than ever
Nakatsuka When you talk about sustainability of “K” LINE Group, I get the feeling that you really want to leave a better global environment for future generations, not just the present, and contribute to a sustainable society and economy.
Myochin We feel proud to have been partially respon- sible for the infrastructure that underpinned economic growth and people’s livelihoods when the movement of goods gained increasing momentum during Japan’s recov- ery after World War II through our environmentally-friendly marine transportation services. Japan, in particular, is a country that achieved economic growth by importing raw materials and energy resources and processing them into end products for export. Even now the shipping industry handles 99.6% of imports and exports, so you could say that shipping is an indispensable “lifeline” to the people of Japan. The world’s population has risen 50% over the last 30 years from 5.1 billion to 7.5 billion, while the volume in ocean cargo movement has increased three-fold from 4.0 billion tons to 12.3 billion tons during the same period.

  In other words, the pace of increase in cargo movement is twice that of population growth. It is said that the pop- ulation of the world will gain another 1.0 billion people by 2030. I think shipping business, with its infrastructure, will continue to play an even greater role as demand further escalates on the back of economic growth in emerging markets, improved standards of living and advancements in horizontal international specialization.
In order to maintain this infrastructure and keep supporting people’s livelihoods, I believe we must be much more con- siderate of the impact our business has on the global and marine environments and engage in sustainable business op- erations that take into account our relationship with society. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted at a United Nations summit in 2015 with 17 goals referred to. In these goals, “affordable and clean energy,” “climate action,” and “life below water” relate directly to conserva- tion of the world’s oceans, namely our field of business, and we should place particular emphasis on these categories.
Named on CDP’s “Climate Change A List” for third year running
Nakatsuka For the third year in a row “K” LINE has made the Climate Change A List, the highest rating awarded by CDP, the most influential environmental man- agement assessment agency. This serves as an example to other firms and also means we are focusing on your company’s leadership.
Myochin As a result of actively disclosing our environ- mental data and promoting Group-wide environmental management, we are now often assessed by external or- ganizations. In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the CDP evaluated the counter-measures of corporations and recognized 126 global companies in its A List at the CDP 2018 Japan Report Launch. There were 20 Japanese companies on the list, but only seven, including us, were awarded an A rating for the third straight year. Furthermore, in 2017 our Group’s CO2 reduction target was recognized as a science-based target (SBT) with the aim of keeping global warming to below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, as ratified in the Paris Agreement. We were the third Japanese company to be accredited by the global SBT initiative.
In October last year we became the first Japanese ship- ping company to support the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is led by global central banks and financial regulators and encourages companies to disclose climate change-related financial information regarding business impact and risk. By showing our support, I think we become more motivated to implement initiatives from the viewpoint of investors in line with a global consensus rather than just environmental measures from the Group’s perspective. And I believe it also provides added momentum to our initiatives.
Society needs to shoulder the environ- mental costs
Nakatsuka In what way are global and marine environ- ments affected by marine transportation?
Myochin It is said that CO2 and other GHGs in exhaust gas emitted from ships cause global warming, rise in sea levels and abnormal weather events such as torrential rain. Sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in ship emis- sions can bring on acid rain that destroys ecosystems and are also a major cause of air pollution. Moreover, fuel oil spills from a ship after an accident not only pollutes the ocean and threatens marine life, it can also lead to the destruction of marine ecosystems and potentially cause long-lasting damage. In addition, the discharge of ballast water induces non-native or invasive organisms to other regions and is the main reason behind the collapse of unique ecosystems.
Nakatsuka Just how much GHG is emitted by the ma- rine transportation sector?
Myochin Compared to other transportation methods, the per-unit environmental impact of shipping is low. As an example, it is estimated that just under three tons of CO2 is generated when transporting one ton of ocean cargo over a distance of one kilometer, which equates to 3.33% of the volume emitted by truck transportation for the same distance, and 0.67% by airplane. That said, the impact of the total amount in the industry is substantial; CO2 emissions from global shipping equate to just over 2% of the entire world, almost the same as what all of Germany generates, so finding a way to reduce this im- pact is a major challenge.

    The entire financial industry is firmly steering corporations toward ESG, and the movement of “sustainable finance for all” is gaining traction.
Nakatsuka From January 2020 new SOx emission reg- ulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will come into force, lowering the limit on sulfur content in fuel from 3.5% to 0.5%. Global warming has reached the point where there’s no time to waste in implement- ing such measures. What are your thoughts on this?
Myochin It is said the 58,000 ships around the world subject to the SOx regulations use 285 million tons of fuel oil. Given that the global shipping industry will be address- ing the regulations en masse, the global impact will surely be significant. There are probably three ways to address the regulations: (1) use low-sulfur fuel oil; (2) install SOx scrubbers; or (3) use an alternative fuel like LNG or LPG. The prevailing view is that more than 90% of ships will comply with the regulations by using a low-sulfur fuel oil when the regulations take effect. Subsequently, fuel costs are expected to rise sharply—IMO estimates global annual cost of fuel will rise from $30 billion (¥3.3trn) to as high as $60 billion (¥6.6trn).
Nakatsuka Considering that you also need to separately address GHG emissions, total costs are likely to skyrocket. I think society at large should bear the burden of this cost.
Myochin In April 2018 IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted a strategy for reducing GHG emissions. The strategy aims to improve fuel efficiency by 40% overall in the shipping industry by 2030, halve GHG emissions by 2050 (both compared to 2008 levels), and also includes the ambitious target of net zero emissions as early as possible in this century. Con- crete measures are to be fleshed out up ahead, but if the attainment of these targets requires slower navigation in addition to the introduction of new technology, transporta- tion will likely take more time and we will have to cut back
on the frequency of vessel allocations. Measures such as purchasing carbon emission credits or adopting new technology will also cost more money. These problems are already too big for us to solve under our own steam. I believe it is our responsibility to gain the understanding of our customers and other stakeholders with respect to the fact that the social cost of addressing environmental issues should be reasonably borne by society as a whole, as well as the likelihood that changes in distribution, such as longer transit time, could eventuate.
Addressing ESG issues with sanpo-yoshi
Nakatsuka ESG investments have grown since 2006 when the United Nations proposed the Principles for Re- sponsible Investment (PRI) to encourage the incorporation of ESG issues into the investment process. In Japan too, ESG investing is spreading rapidly owing to the signing of the Principles by the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF). While the phrase “sustainable finance for all” has been widely adopted recently, ESG is even penetrating the world of indirect finance and the finance industry as a whole is firmly steering companies toward ESG activities.
In this environment, alongside typical financial analysis, investors are focusing on both the positive and negative impacts that a corporation’s environmental (E) and social (S) contributions have on the world. As such, they are increas- ingly incorporating ESG assessments into their investment decision-making as a method for evaluating intrinsic value. It would be reasonable to say that the ESG evaluation fac- tor draws together the perspectives of various stakehold- ers, not just those of investors. Accordingly, this means that companies rated highly for their ESG initiatives gain the overall trust of stakeholders, which is something in- vestors like to quantify and evaluate. As a result, we are beginning to see more capital flow into companies that are making a positive impact on the world in terms of global sustainability, as demonstrated by the SDGs, for example.
Myochin Japan has a set of time-honored business principles called sanpo-yoshi, which in English translates to “three-way satisfaction,” meaning that benefits are en- joyed by the buyer, seller and society. You could probably say that sustainable management is the materialization of benefits for society. It is impossible to expect a business to be sustainable if it causes environmental destruction and is harmful to society because it only seeks to make a profit. At the same time, a company may disappear altogether unless it earns a modest profit, reinvests its earnings and is able to meet the expectations of investors and other stakeholders. I think the keys to successful business are corporate be- havior that strikes the right balance between seeking profit and contributing to society, as well as co-existence and co-prosperity with the global environment and society.

 This is why ESG initiatives are a key issue in the Group’s medium-term management plan. Particularly with regard to environmental issues, we continue to carry out initiatives in line with ”K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050, which is our long-term policy that we formulated in 2015. With respect to social issues, it goes without saying that safety in naviga- tion and cargo operations is at the core of our business, but in addition to this, human resource development is a major topic. And we believe governance instills discipline in our business management and helps to find the right balance between social contributions and company earnings.
Clear roadmap provided by “K” LINE Environmental Vision 2050
Nakatsuka It is quite progressive to formulate a clear environmental vision in 2015 with a view to 2050 and imple- ment it as a management strategy. I would even say that “K” LINE is at the forefront of environmental management.
Myochin Informulatingourenvironmentalvision,wefirst analyzed and extracted what the key issues are for the ship- ping business. There are four issues: (1) marine pollution & ecosystems; (2) energy resources; (3) global warming; and (4) air pollution. The level of materiality to the Group was plotted horizontally, while materiality from a societal standpoint was assigned on the vertical axis. For these issues and in line with the kind of company we aim to become, we set interim targets for 2019 and final targets for 2050. As an example, to address the key issue of global warming, we aim to achieve a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 versus 2011 lev- els and then cut our emissions by 50% by the year 2050.
Nakatsuka From an investor’s standpoint on ESG is- sues, I think it is vital that board members first recognize the risks and opportunities that the key issues present and accordingly incorporate them into business strategies so each department in the organization can take action in ac- cordance with those strategies, instead of letting each de- partment do their own thing. In this sense, I think “K” LINE’s environmental vision is really effective. What kind of results have you achieved in the four years since its formulation?
Myochin To begin with, having a clear roadmap to follow thanks to the formulation of this policy was a major achieve- ment in itself. More specifically, we were able to identify the aforementioned four key issues that need to be ad- dressed. Although we set interim targets for each category to be achieved in 2019, we still aim to maintain our goal of zero accidents at sea. We are also pushing ahead with plans to introduce LNG-powered vessels. As we achieved our most important initial interim target of reducing GHG emis- sions (10% reduction vs 2011 levels) ahead of schedule, we are working towards achieving our new interim reduction
target of 25% by 2030. And by mere coincidence, our 2030 interim target almost matches the 2030 target set out in the IMO’s GHG reduction strategy last year.
One of our interim goals is the building of environmental- ly-friendly flagships and in 2016 we completed construction of the Drive Green Highway, a car carrier fully equipped with environmental technology. Compared to the Group’s existing vessels, it is capable of reducing CO2 emissions by more than 25%, NOx by more than 50% and SOx by more than 90% per vehicle carried. The vessel was also awarded Ship of the Year 2016. Furthermore, in recognition of our environmental initiatives, including this ship, “K” LINE re- ceived the Panama Green Shipping Award in 2019.
We were able to efficiently take action by appropriately identifying and prioritizing environmental issues.
The introduction of advanced environmentally- friendly technology illustrates without doubt the Group’s “always-first” mentality
Nakatsuka Wheredidtheideaforsuchaground-breaking ship come from?
Myochin This ship too was born of the Group’s en- terprising spirit. When planning the construction of our next-generation 7,500-unit car carrier series, some of our young employees saw an opportunity to develop one of the vessels into a new-age, environmentally-friendly flag- ship. Once Japanese shipyard and ship equipment manu- facturers threw their support behind our idea to deck out the ship with state-of-the-art environmentally-friendly tech- nology, we were able to bring the innovative concept to life. Without doubt, this project demonstrated our ambition of always striving to be first.
Nakatsuka Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) is currently proposing the Society 5.0 for SDGs, a concept that envisions economic development and solutions to
           “K” LINE REPORT 2019

 ESG Interview
 social challenges by fully maximizing innovative technolo- gy to achieve the SDGs. In addition to the Ship of the Year 2016, I hear “K” LINE is utilizing other cutting-edge tech- nology for the purpose of attaining the SDGs.
Myochin One example would be the installation of K-IMS, our IoT-powered management system, for 166 ves- sels in operation. This system monitors various information in real time such as the ship’s status and engine plant data by relaying up to 2,000 items of big data between ship and shore at 30-minute intervals. The use of this data enables navigation via optimal shipping routes, supports onboard equipment maintenance, helps reduce fuel consumption and contributes to safe operations. Furthermore, because the use of leading edge technology can enhance customer convenience and improve internal business processes, in January 2019 we established an AI/Digitalization Promotion Division and a Corporate Marketing Strategy Division.
Enhancing training environment for foreign seafarers
Nakatsuka Please also tell me about the Group’s human resource development in which you stress importance from a social angle.
Myochin While on one hand we focus on enhancing our training system for onshore employees, we also put a lot of effort into securing and nurturing maritime technical per- sonnel in order to ensure safety in navigation and cargo op- erations, the bedrock of our Group’s business. The Group operates around 500 ships in total, of which just under 200 are operated by ourselves. We have more than 300 Japa- nese seafarers and approximately 2,400 from other coun- tries. This is why we naturally focus on the cultivation and training of both foreign and Japanese seafarers as a critical measure for business continuity and development.
Nakatsuka Job satisfaction for foreign seafarers and contributing to progress in regional communities eventually materializes in the form of earnings for the company, I think.
Myochin ThelargemajorityoftheGroup’sforeignseafar- ers hail from the Philippines and we have a training facility for maritime technical personnel in Manila. Last year the facility underwent large-scale renovations and expansion. Every year 55 instructors run more than 50 courses, while the training system is capable of accepting up to 10,000 trainees. However, instead of being content focusing only on our own crew, we also need to be watchful of others, including the various people that we indirectly interact with. Accordingly, in 2016 we developed our CSR Guidelines for Supply Chains in both Japanese and English, which sets
forth rules on fair and transparent transactions and basic human rights. It is important to establish policies that we can use to gauge and demonstrate externally whether the Group’s activities are being executed appropriately.
Rigorously implementing the PDCA cycle
Nakatsuka Andlastly,pleasetellmeabouttheinitiatives you have implemented to ensure that your Board of Direc- tors and employees understand the company’s stance on ESG issues.
Myochin By steadily pushing ahead with ESG initiatives under our medium-term management plan, our depart- ments examine strategies and measures on a quarterly basis. On top of this, our CSR Sub-Committee examines issues in light of their relevance to the SDGs. At the same time, we actively keep all our stakeholders informed so they have an understanding of the initiatives that aim to achieve
sustainable growth for the “K” LINE Group.
Nakatsuka From what I have heard so far, it seems that the “K” LINE Group is soundly incorporating ESG into its management strategy. In my opinion, addressing ESG issues is akin to a company’s commitment to the next generation. Investors too want to see companies where top manage- ment is always aware of ESG as management issues and subsequently integrates them into corporate strategies, thus spreading awareness of ESG throughout the company.
Myochin AmovementlikeESGthatanybodycanidentify with will soon take off once it starts to gain traction. Even if we mean to stay ahead of the pack, at times we may lose sight of the essence of ESG when routine work takes over. At the same time, environmental regulations and the like continue to be tightened, so I think it is important that we rigorously implement the PDCA cycle and tackle the issues that demand our attention straight away.
We thoroughly review our actions at each juncture and immediately address the issues that demand our attention.

Issues Going Forward
Improve discussions regarding the medium- to long- term management policy and plan
In order to create more time for discussions at Board meetings, we need to re-examine the standards for creat- ing the agenda and to redefine the roles of the Board and the Management Conference. This will further accelerate and streamline the decision-making process, and promote more in-depth discussions of the medium- to long-term strategy.
Strengthen Group Governance
As a shareholder, we will strengthen the timely and appro- priate monitoring system for the governance of Ocean Network Express (ONE), and ensure that monitoring by the Board, to the extent possible, is not limited to only the causes and consequences of changes to our results.
Risk Management after Project Execution
We need to verify the risks and apply the Advanced Business Management after we begin to execute proj- ects. We will create a list of investment projects and carry out progress reports at the board level and establish a risk management PDCA cycle.
Improve Board Diversity
We believe that the diversity of our board is one of our strengths, however, there is room for further improve- ment in terms of gender diversity, specifically the absence of a female Director, and we will continue to work to improve the diversity of our Board.

  Internal Control System
The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the internal control system, evaluating its effectiveness and ensuring that it functions properly. In addition, through moni- toring and verifying the status of the internal control system, the Internal Audit Group plays a role in supporting the Board of Directors in carrying out its responsibilities for the develop- ment, maintenance and enhancement of the internal control system. The Audit & Supervisory Board Members oversee the processes by which the Directors establish the internal control system and confirm that it is functioning effectively. Further, while respecting the autonomy of each of our Group companies, “K” LINE supports and supervises the establish- ment and effective management of internal control systems
Risk Management
We need to recognize diverse management crises and risks, prepare for them, and fulfill our corporate social responsibility when the risks become reality. To this end, we have established our own system for managing crises and risks. Specifically, we divide crises and risks into four types and have established four Committees for respond- ing to each of these types. We have also set up a Crisis Management Committee as an organization to unify the four Committees to control and facilitate overall crisis and risk management activities.
Crisis Management Control and Facilitate Overall
within each of these companies to ensure that activities con- ducted across all Group companies are appropriate.
Primary Internal Audit Activities for FY2018
The Internal Audit Group is responsible for formulating annual audit plans and implementing the audits. Primary audit activities for FY2018 include the following.
● Work process audits for all divisions of the Company (20 processes) ● GeneralITcontrolauditsofallprimaryITsystemsoftheCompany(24systems)
● Company-wideinternalcontrolauditsofmajorGroupcompanies(28companies) ● Overseas Group companies audits (9 companies)
● JointauditswithinternalauditdivisionsoftheGroupcompanies(1company)
Major Risks Which Affect Our Business
The Group’s main business field, marine transport, is influenced by numerous international factors such as economic trends in vari- ous countries, product market conditions, supply and demand bal- ance for ships, as well as intra-industry competition. Changes in any of these factors may give a negative impact on the “K” LINE Group’s marketing activities and business results. In par- ticular, a change in tax systems or economic policies, or an invo- cation of protective trade policies in Japan or major trading regions and / or countries such as North America, Europe, China, etc., may result in a decrease in overall volume of international cargo trans- port or worsen conditions for freight markets. This may give a seri- ous impact on the Group’s financial situation and operating results.
The risks described above do not include all the risks the “K” LINE Group is exposed to. For more information, please access “K” LINE’s website.

Compliance Promotion System and Our Efforts to Raise Compliance Awareness
We discuss our policy for securing compliance through- out “K” Line and its Group companies, as well as mea- sures for compliance violations, through our Compliance Committee, chaired by the President & CEO. Under the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who has the ultimate responsibility for compliance, we are strengthening com- pliance throughout our organization.
Furthermore, we set every November as “Compliance Month” when we distribute the President & CEO’s mes- sage to executives and employees of “K” Line and its Group companies to remind them of the importance of compliance and when we also hold compliance seminars.

          Strengthening Our Group Compliance System
The “K” Line Group Global Compliance Policy (including Individual Policies of Competition Law and Anti-Corruption Law) (hereinafter, the Global Policy) which was established in January 2017 is to strengthen our Group compliance sys- tem on a global level. We oblige all executives and employ- ees in “K” Line and our group companies to comply with the Global Policy. Through holding seminars by dedicated department, distributing Guidebook and activities of dedi- cated committee, we put much effort into having the Global Policy be the guideline on our daily business for all execu- tives and employees in “K” Line and our group companies.
Furthermore, in order to quickly find information related to our management risks at our overseas companies and to manage them uniformly, we established a Global Hotline System in October 2018.

Financial Analysis
Results of Operations
Operating revenues
In fiscal 2018, the year that ended March 31, 2019, the “K” LINE Group reported consolidated operating revenues of ¥836,731 mil- lion, down 28.0% from fiscal 2017. By business segment, operat- ing revenues from dry bulk segment increased 10.0% year-on-year to ¥273,827 million on the strength of the large vessel market improve- ment in the first half. In the energy resource transport segment, energy resource transport business (LNG carrier, tanker and thermal coal carrier business) operated smoothly under mid- and long-term charter contracts. As for the offshore energy E&P support business (energy-related development business and offshore support ves- sel business), although the market remained weak in offshore sup- port vessel business, energy-related development business operated smoothly. As a result, operating income increased 17.6% year-on-year to ¥88,701 million. In the product logistics segment, car carrier busi- ness experienced a decline in operating efficiency and other issues despite an increase in transportation volume. In the logistics busi- ness, strength of domestic logistics demand improved, and cargo volumes were robust for international logistics as well. In the short sea and coastal business, strength of short sea transportation volume improved, and in the coastal business, introduction of newly-built large vessels resulted in the expansion of loading capacity. However, operating revenue declined 44.8% year-on-year to ¥441,028 mil- lion due to transfer of containership business to OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS PTE. LTD. (ONE). Operating revenues from the other seg- ments declined 15.2%. It is worth noting that, because reporting seg- ments were reclassified for the consolidated fiscal year, figures were rearranged from the same period last year into the reclassified seg- ments for comparison.
Cost of sales and selling,
general and administrative expenses
Cost of sales decreased ¥282,802 million, or 26.1%, from ¥1,083,299 million in the previous fiscal year to ¥800,497 million, as a result of factors such as decrease in ship operation expenses due to trans- fer of containership business to ONE. Cost of sales ratio increased 2.4 points, to 95.7%. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined ¥10,535 million, or 14.7%, to ¥60,971 million.
Operating income
Due to a decrease in gross profit, the Company reported a consol- idated operating loss of ¥24,737 million, compared with operating income of ¥7,220 million in the previous year.
Other (non-operating) income (expenses)
The net balance of interest and dividend income and interest expense was negative ¥4,877 million versus negative ¥3,167 mil- lion in the previous year. This resulted from an increase in interest expense. The Company recorded an exchange gain of ¥950 million versus an exchange loss of ¥1,541 million in the previous fiscal year, and an equity in loss of subsidiaries and affiliates of ¥18,876 million compared with ¥4,601 million in fiscal 2017. As a result of these and other factors, other (non-operating) loss amounted to ¥24,197 mil- lion compared with a loss of ¥5,257 million in the previous fiscal year.
Profit before income taxes
Total extraordinary gains amounted to ¥10,095 million, due mainly to gain on sales of vessels, property and equipment. Extraordinary losses amounted to ¥60,584 million, due mainly to cancellation of chartered vessels and impairment loss. As a result, ¥99,423 million in loss before income taxes was recorded, compared with ¥17,188 million in profit before income taxes in fiscal 2017.
Income taxes
Income taxes increased ¥5,146 million from ¥4,213 million in the pre- vious fiscal year to ¥9,360 million. This was due mainly to increases in the amount of deferred income taxes filed by companies.
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests totaled ¥2,405 mil- lion versus ¥2,591 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease is partly attributable to a decrease in non-controlling interest in the income of International Transportation Service, Inc.
Profit attributable to owners of the parent
The loss attributable to owners of the parent was ¥111,188 mil- lion compared to the ¥10,384 million profit attributed to the own- ers of the parent in fiscal 2017. The loss attributable to owners of the parent per share was ¥1,192.08 versus a profit attributable to owners of the parent per share of ¥111.13 in the fiscal 2017.
Analysis of Sources of Capital and Liquidity

and a decrease in trade accounts and notes payable. Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥35,494 million versus ¥22,813 million in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This mainly reflected purchases of vessels. Net cash provided by financing activities was ¥19,290 mil- lion compared with net cash provided by financing activities of ¥22,240 million in the previous consolidated fiscal year. This change mainly reflected income from payments from non-controlling shareholders.
Funding requirements
The “K” LINE Group’s major working capital requirement comes from shipping business expenses in connection with dry bulk busi- ness and car carrier business. These expenses include operating costs such as port charges, cargo handling costs and fuel costs; ves- sel expenses such as crew expenses and expenses for overhaul of vessels; and chartering expenses. Other expenses are the costs of service operations such as labor costs in connection with the opera- tion of our logistics businesses and general administrative expenses for the Group’s business operations such as personnel expenses, information processing costs and other non-personnel expenses. Capital requirements include investments in vessels, logistics facil- ities and terminal facilities. During the consolidated fiscal year, the “K” LINE Group made capital investments of ¥97,912 million.
Financial policy
The “K” LINE Group places importance on securing low-cost, stable funds to support its business continuity and expansion. The Company meets long-term funding requirements mainly by means of long-term debt from financial institutions, supplemented by the issuance of bonds and new shares. The Company procures short-term operating funds by means of bank loans and the issuance, etc. of commercial paper, and invests temporary surplus funds in highly-stable and liq- uid financial assets. The Company employs a cash management sys- tem to effectively utilize surplus funds of Group companies in Japan and overseas. The Company secures liquidity by preparing for any urgent capital requirements by means of a commercial paper issu- ance program of up to ¥60.0 billion, and the establishment of an ¥80.0 billion multi-year commitment line with financial institutions in Japan. The Company has been rated by one Japanese rating firm. As of June 21, 2019, the Company maintained a rating of BBB- from Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR). The Company also has a short-term credit rating (commercial paper rating) of J-2 from JCR.
Financial Position
As of the end of the consolidated fiscal year, total assets amounted to ¥951,262 million, down ¥85,625 million from a year earlier. Current
assets decreased ¥101,855 million year-on-year to ¥288,871 million, mainly due to reduced cash and deposits. Fixed assets increased ¥16,230 million to ¥662,390 million. Within this amount, vessels, property and equipment declined ¥34,322 million to ¥448,632 million, mainly due to a decrease in construction in progress. Investments and other assets increased ¥49,920 million to ¥209,381 million, mainly due primarily to a rise in investment in securities. Total lia- bilities as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year amounted to ¥770,028 million, down ¥23,765 million from a year earlier. Current lia- bilities amounted to ¥279,353 million and fixed liabilities amounted to ¥490,676 million, mainly as a result of a decline in allowance for trade accounts and notes payable, although other accounts payable, obliga- tions under short-term loans and the like increased. Net assets as of the end of the consolidated fiscal year totaled ¥181,234 million, down ¥61,860 million from a year earlier. Within this amount, shareholders’ equity was ¥91,152 million, mainly due to a ¥59,124 million decrease in capital surpluses, and a ¥50,414 million decrease in retained earn- ings. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased ¥3,898 million to ¥12,424 million, mainly attributable to a ¥4,768 million decrease in deferred gain on hedges. It is worth noting that “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting, etc.” (ASBJ Statement No. 28, issued on February 16, 2018) has been applied from the beginning of the consolidated fiscal year, and that figures from the previous consolidated fiscal year have been retroactively processed for this comparison of financial conditions.
Dividend Policy
The Company regards maximization of returns to shareholders as an important priority. To this end, we endeavor to pay stable dividends, retaining necessary fund investments in plant and equipment and strengthening our financial position in order to achieve sustain- able growth, which is a main priority of our management plan.
The Company’s year-end dividend (record date: March 31 of each year) is subject to resolution at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. As prescribed in the Articles of Incorporation, “by resolution of the Board of Directors, an interim dividend may be distributed by the Company as of the record date of September 30 of each year.”
However, due to the loss attributable to owners of the parent this term, the Company has positioned the enhancement of financial strength and stability of business infrastructure as the highest pri- ority. For this reason, as announced in October 2018, the Company will regrettably be unable to distribute a year-end dividend.
Dividends for the next term are also currently still undecided because the Company’s highest priority remains the enhancement of financial strength and stability of business infrastructure for the time being.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries March 31, 2019
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 (a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiar- ies have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles gen- erally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to present them in a form which is familiar to readers outside Japan. However, no adjustments have been made which would change the financial position or the results of operations presented in the original consolidated financial statements.
Certain reclassifications of previously reported amounts have been made to conform the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 to the 2019 presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on consolidated profit, net assets or cash flows.
The translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience and has been made, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at ¥110.99=U.S.$1.00, the approximate rate of exchange prevailing on March 31, 2019. Furthermore, the translation should not be construed as a rep- resentation that Japanese yen have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
(b) Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 292 and 294 subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The prin- ciples of consolidation are to include significant subsidiaries, whose voting interests are owned 40 per cent. or more by the consolidated group and whose decision-making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group through financial or technical support, personnel, transac- tions, and so forth. In addition, significant affiliates whose deci- sion-making control over their operations is significantly affected by the consolidated group in various ways are accounted for by the equity method.
For the purposes of consolidation, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized profit among the consolidated group companies have been eliminated.
Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of five years.
(c) Accounting period
The Company and 282 consolidated subsidiaries have a March 31 year end, and the remaining 10 consolidated subsidiaries have a December 31 year end. For four of these consolidated subsidiar- ies with a December year end, adjustments have been made for any significant transactions which took place during the period between their year end and the year end of the Company, and for the other six, a provisional closing of their accounts as of the year end of the Company has been used.
(d) Translation of foreign currencies
Revenues earned and expenses incurred in currencies other than Japanese yen of the Company and its subsidiaries that maintain their books in Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen either at an average monthly exchange rate or at the rate pre- vailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and lia- bilities denominated in currencies other than Japanese yen are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Subsidiaries that maintain their books in a currency other than Japanese yen translate revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign cur- rencies into the currency used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries of domicile.
(e) Translation of accounts of overseas consolidated subsidiaries
The accounts of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling inter- ests of consolidated subsidiaries, are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The components of net assets excluding accumulated other compre- hensive income (loss) and non-controlling interests are translated at their historical exchange rates. Differences arising from transla- tion are presented as translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand, and short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased which can easily be converted to cash and are subject to little risk of change in value.
(g) Allowance for doubtful receivables
An allowance for doubtful receivables is provided at an amount calculated based on the historical experience of bad debts on ordinary receivables plus an additional estimate of probable spe- cific bad debts from customers experiencing financial difficulties.
(h) Inventories
Inventories are mainly stated at cost based on the moving-av- erage method (The method includes write-downs based on decreased profitability).
(i) Securities
Securities are classified into three categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities or other securities. Trading securi- ties, consisting of debt and marketable equity securities, are stated at fair value. Gain or loss, both realized and unrealized, are credited or charged to income. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at their amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, reported as a separate component of net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost determined princi- pally by the moving- average method.

  Financial Section / Corporate Data

“K” LINE REPORT 2019
Under the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”), net unrealized holding gain on investments in securities of the related taxes, is not available for distribution as dividends.
(j) Vessels, property and equipment and depreciation (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Depreciation of vessels is computed by the straight-line or the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of the respective vessels.
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed princi- pally by the declining-balance method over the estimated use- ful lives of the respective assets. However, the depreciation of buildings (excluding accompanying facilities) acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 are computed by the straight- line method.
Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are charged to income as incurred. Major improvements are capitalized.
(k) Capitalization of interest expense
Interest expense is generally charged to income as incurred. However, interest expense incurred in the construction of certain vessels is capitalized and included in the costs of the assets if the construction period is substantially long.
(l) Leases
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated by the same methods used for owned fixed assets.
Leased assets under finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee are depreciated to a residual value of zero by straight-line method over the lease term.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership to the lessee, starting on or before March 31, 2008 are accounted for as operating lease transactions.
(m) Research and development costs and computer software (except for leased assets under finance leases)
Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred. Expenditures relating to the development of computer soft- ware intended for internal use are charged to income when incurred, unless these are deemed to contribute to the genera- tion of future income or cost savings. Such expenditures are cap- italized as assets and amortized by the straight-line method over
their estimated useful life of five years.
(n) Retirement benefits
The liability for retirement benefits has been provided principally at an amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obliga- tion after the fair value of the pension plan assets are deducted. The retirement benefit obligations are attributed to each period by the benefit formula method.
Actuarial differences are amortized in the years following the year in which the differences are recognized by the straight-line method principally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated average remaining years of service of the eligible employees.
Past service cost is amortized by the straight-line method prin- cipally over a period of nine years, which falls within the estimated
average remaining years of service of the eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is deter- mined as a result of consideration of both the portfolio allocation at present and in the future, and the long-term expected rate of
return from multiple plan assets at present and in the future. Certain consolidated subsidiaries also provide for retirement benefits to directors and audit and supervisory board mem- bers based on their internal rules at the amount which would be required to be paid if all directors and audit and supervisory board
members retired at the balance sheet date.
(o) Accrued expenses for overhaul of vessels
Vessels and other assets of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) are subject to periodic overhaul. An accrual is provided on the basis of the estimated amount of total expenses expected to be incurred for overhauling the vessels and other assets in the following year which has been allocated to the current fiscal year.
(p) Allowance for loss related to the Anti-Monopoly Act
In order to prepare for fines and penalties required by overseas authorities relating to the Anti-Monopoly Act, an amount reason- ably estimated to the extent possible is recognized.
(q) Allowance for loss related to business restructuring
In order to prepare for future losses resulting from business restructuring, the estimated amounts are recognized.
(r) Allowance for loss on liquidation of subsidiaries and affiliates
In order to prepare for loss accompanied by liquidation of subsid- iaries and affiliates, the estimated amount of loss is recognized.
(s) Allowance for directors’ stock benefits
In order to prepare for stock benefits etc., to the directors and the executive officers in accordance with the Regulations for Delivery of Shares to Officers, the allowance for stock benefits is recog- nized at the estimated amount of the Company’s stock corre- sponding to points to be provided to the eligible individuals as of the end of the current fiscal year.
(t) Allowance for loss on chartering contracts
In order to prepare for potential future loss under certain con- tracts where charter rates fall below hire rates, the probable and reasonably estimated amount of loss is recognized based on available information as of the end of the current fiscal year.
(u) Derivatives and hedging activities
The Group utilizes derivatives of forward foreign exchange con- tracts, interest rate swaps, currency option, currency swap, bun- ker fuel swaps and forward freight agreements to hedge the risk arising from fluctuations in forward foreign currency exchange rates, mainly on investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc. and forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies, interest rates, mainly on loan and lease transactions and market prices, mainly on bunker fuel.
The Group applies deferral hedge accounting method. If inter- est rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the

interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed under “Special treatment.”
Forward foreign exchange contracts which meet certain crite- ria are accounted for by the allocation method which requires that recognized foreign currency receivables or payables be translated at the corresponding contract rates.
The hedge effectiveness is assessed based on a compar- ison of the cumulative changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged items with those of the hedging instruments in the period from the start of the hedging relationship to the assess- ment date. However, an evaluation of effectiveness is omitted for interest-rate swaps which meet certain conditions for apply- ing the Special treatment.
The Group executes and manages transactions for the pur- pose of risk control of financial market and others in accordance with internal rules. These rules have been established not only to prevent derivative or other transactions from being used for any objective other than their original purpose or from being executed without limitation, but also to ensure the management body exer- cises its oversight functions.
(v) Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized with respect to the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and lia- bilities are measured at the rates which are expected to apply to the period when each asset or liability is realized, based on the tax rates which have been enacted as of the balance sheet date or are subsequently enacted.
(w) Deferred assets
Bond issuance costs are charged to income as incurred.
(x) Distribution of retained earnings
Under the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, the distribution of retained earnings with respect to a given fiscal year end is made by resolution of the sharehold- ers at a general meeting held subsequent to the close of the financial year. The distribution of retained earnings with respect to the interim financial period is made by resolution of the Board of Directors.
(y) Revenues and related costs
Revenues of the Group from cargo freight and the related costs and expenses, except for those from container vessels, are rec- ognized in full as of the dates on which the vessels complete their respective voyages (the voyage completion method). Revenues from container vessels are recognized based on the passage of the transportation period (the complex transportation progress method). The related costs and expenses are charged to income as incurred. Revenues and costs with respect to charter services are accounted for on an accrual basis.
(z) Consolidated taxation system
The Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries adopt the consolidated taxation system.
(aa) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective
(IFRS 16 Leases Applicable to Overseas Consolidated Subsidiaries)
(1) Overview
The accounting standard has been revised primarily so that lessees principally account for all leases on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Group expects to adopt the accounting standard from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020.
(3) Effect of the adoption of accounting standard
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adop- tion of the accounting standard on its consolidation financial statements.

On March 30, 2018, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (the “ASBJ”) issued “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29) and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30). The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the United States co-developed comprehensive accounting standards for revenue recogni- tion and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (issued as IFRS 15 by the IASB and Topic 606 by the FASB) in May 2014. The ASBJ developed comprehensive accounting standards on revenue recognition and issued them in conjunc- tion with the implementation guidance based on the fact that IFRS 15 will be applied from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be applied from fiscal years starting after December 15, 2017.
As the basic policy in developing accounting standards for revenue recognition, the ASBJ defined the accounting stan- dard starting with incorporating the basic principle of IFRS 15 from a standpoint of comparability between financial state- ments, which is one benefit of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15. Furthermore, the ASBJ added alternative account- ing treatment without impairing comparability when there are matters to be considered related to accounting practices, etc. common in Japan.
(2) Scheduled date of adoption
The Company expects to adopt the accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
(3) Effect of the adoption of accounting standard and implemen- tation guidance
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of the accounting standard and the implementation guidance on its consolidation financial statements.

 2. Change in Accounting Estimate
(Change in Service Lives)
Taking the opportunity to review fleet planning following the changes in the business environment for car carriers, the Group reviewed its policies concerning vessel use during the current fis- cal year in accordance with the actual service records and the out- look for vessel supply and demand.
As a result of this review, it became clear that a longer ser- vice life can be expected than that of the previous period, and therefore the service life of pure car carriers was changed from 20 years to 25 years.
As a result of this change in accounting estimate, operat- ing loss and loss before income taxes for the current fiscal year decreased by ¥2,465 million ($22,209 thousand), respectively, compared to that under the previous method.
The effect of the change on each reporting segment is dis- closed in Note 19. Segment Information.
3. Change in Presentation
(Applying “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting”)
“Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect
Accounting” (ASBJ Statement No. 28 issued on February 16, 2018), etc. have been applied from the beginning of the cur- rent fiscal year. “Deferred tax assets” are now presented under “Investments and other assets” of the consolidated balance sheet, and “Deferred tax liabilities” are now presented under “Long-term liabilities.”
In applying the revised standard, “Deferred tax assets” under “Current assets” decreased by ¥5,700 million and “Deferred tax assets” under “Investments and other assets” increased by ¥821 million as of the end of the previous fiscal year. “Deferred tax lia- bilities” under “Current liabilities” decreased by ¥2 million and “Deferred tax liabilities” under “Long-term liabilities” decreased by ¥4,878 million as of the end of the previous fiscal year.
In addition, “Deferred tax assets” and “Deferred tax lia- bilities” of the same taxable entity are offset, and total assets decreased by ¥4,879 million compared to previous method as of the end of the previous fiscal year.
Also, Note 8. Income Taxes stated in accordance with No.8 (except for total valuation allowance) and 9 of annotations on Interpretive Notes in Article 3 to 5 of the Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting. However, com- parative information for the previous fiscal year has not been disclosed in Note 8. Income Taxes in accordance with the transi- tional provisions set forth in Article 7 of the Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting.

Since the respective recoverable amounts of the idle assets were deemed to be irretrievably lower than the carrying values mainly due to decreasing land prices, the carrying values were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recognized for the years ended March 31, 2019
and 2018.
The recoverable amounts are the higher of net selling value and
the value-in-use. Net selling value is measured by third-party valu- ations and others. The value-in-use is based on estimated future cash flows discounted at rate of 3.0 to 6.3 per cent, 3.7 to 5.8 per cent for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

  The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, basically group business assets by units whose income and expenditure are monitored perpetually. However, the grouping is conducted by individual business assets for business assets whose cash flow is mostly individual, assets for sale and idle assets.
As profitability decreased significantly, the carrying values of business assets and assets group were reduced to the respec- tive recoverable amounts and loss on impairment was recognized for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
Since the planned sales amounts of assets for sale were lower than the carrying values, the carrying values were reduced to the respective recoverable amounts and loss on impairment

8. Income Taxes
The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are subject to a number of taxes based on income, which, in the aggregate, resulted in a statutory tax rate of approximately 28.7 per cent. for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.
The details of the differences between statutory tax rate and effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2019 were omitted because the Group recorded a loss before income taxes for the year.
The effective tax rate reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2018 differed from the statutory tax rate for the following reasons:
    Statutory tax rate
Difference in statutory tax rates of consolidated subsidiaries
Equity in earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, net

The Group has funded and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit corporate pension plans (all of them are funded plans) provide for a lump-sum payment or annuity pay- ment determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service.
The retirement lump-sum plans provide for a lump-sum pay- ment, as employee retirement benefits, determined by reference to the current rate of pay and the length of service.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries calculate asset for retire- ment benefits, liability for retirement benefits and retirement benefit expenses, for the defined benefit corporate pension plans and the retirement lump-sum plans based on the amount which would be payable at the year-end if all eligible employees termi- nated their services voluntarily (a “simplified method”).
Certain consolidated subsidiaries participate in a small-and- medium-sized enterprise mutual aid plan as a defined contribu- tion plan.

The conversion price after October 1, 2017 has been adjusted from ¥305.6 to ¥3,056.0.
12. Land Revaluation
The Company and a certain domestic consolidated subsidiary revalued the land used in their business in accordance with the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998) and the Act to Partially Revise the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 19, March 31, 2001). The effect of this revaluation has been recorded as revaluation reserve for land in net assets, excluding the related deferred tax liabilities on land revaluation.
The timing of the revaluation was effective March 31, 2002.
A certain domestic affiliate accounted for by the equity method also revalued the land used in their business in accor- dance with the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 34, March 31, 1998) and the Act to Partially Revise the Act on Revaluation of Land (Act No. 19, March 31, 2001). The effect of this revaluation has been recorded as revaluation reserve for land in net assets.
The revaluation of land for business use was calculated by making rational adjustments to the prices posted in accordance with the provision of Article 6 of the Public Notice of Land Prices Act for standard sites set forth in Article 6 of the same act in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pur- suant to Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land (Cabinet Order No. 119 of 1998).

 However, for some land, the revaluation was calculated by mak- ing rational adjustments to standard prices assessed in accor- dance with the provision of Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the Order for Enforcement of the National Land Use Planning Act for stan- dard sites set forth in Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 1 (a) of the same order in the same neighborhood as the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, by making ratio- nal adjustments to land prices registered in the land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 10 of the Local Tax Act or in the supplementary land tax ledger set forth in Article 341, Item 11 of the same act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land, or by making rational adjustments to the value calculated by the method established and issued by the Director-General of the National Tax Agency for computing land value that serves as a basis for the calculation of the tax- able amount for land value tax set forth in Article 16 of the Land- Holding Tax Act for the relevant land for business use pursuant to Article 2, Item 4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Act on Revaluation of Land.
At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of land was lower than its carrying value after revaluation by ¥3,034 million ($27,336 thousand) and ¥2,628 million, respectively.
13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
At March 31, 2019, commitments made by the Group for the construction of vessels amounted to ¥14,882 million ($134,084 thousand).
Contingent liabilities for guarantees of loans to affiliates and third- party companies and obligations for additional investment, etc. as of March 31, 2019 are as follows:
Group to recognize additional provisions for losses, when the loss amount can be rationally estimated, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s financial position and operating results.
14. Financial Instruments
Status of financial instruments
The Group obtains necessary funding, mainly through bank loans and the issuance of bonds, in accordance with their capital expen- diture plans. Temporary excess funds are invested in highly liquid financial assets, and short-term operating funds are financed by bank loans. The Group utilizes derivatives only for avoiding risks, but does not utilize them for speculation.
Trade accounts and notes receivable are exposed to credit risk in the event of the nonperformance by counterparties. As revenues from marine transportation are mainly denominated in foreign currencies, trade receivables are exposed to foreign cur- rency exchange risk and a portion of them, net of trade payables denominated in the same foreign currencies, are hedged by for- ward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade receivables such as for freight and chartered vessels are exposed to market risks, and some of them are hedged by forward freight agreements. The Group holds marketable securities and investments in securi- ties, which are mainly issued by companies who have a business relationship or capital alliance with the Group, and these securi- ties are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in market prices. The Group also has long-term loans receivable mainly from other sub- sidiaries and affiliates.
The Group has trade accounts and notes payable, which have payment due dates within one year. Funds for certain cap- ital expenditures, such as construction of vessels denominated in foreign currencies, are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, which are hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts. Future trade payables such as payments for bunker fuel are exposed to the risk of fluctuation of market prices, and some of them are hedged by bunker fuel swap contracts. Loans pay- able, bonds, bonds with stock acquisition rights and lease obliga- tions for finance lease contracts are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments. The repayment dates of long-term debt extend up to 56 years subsequent to the balance sheet date. Certain elements of these transactions are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. The Group hedges this risk by entering into interest rate swap transactions. The Group has entered into currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk against trade payables.
Regarding derivatives, the Group has entered into: 1) for- ward foreign exchange contracts and currency swap contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange risk arising from investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc., receivables and payables denom- inated in foreign currencies and funds for capital investment to acquire operating assets such as vessels and others; 2) bunker fuel swap contracts to hedge the risk of bunker fuel price fluc- tuation; 3) forward freight agreements to hedge the risk of fluc- tuation of market prices; and 4) interest-rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of interest rate fluctuation arising from interest payables for long-term payables and bonds.

(Other Important Matters Related to Current Conditions of the Corporate Group)
The Group has been investigated by the overseas competition authorities in relation to alleged anti-competitive behavior (alleged formation of a cartel) relating to the transportation of automobiles, automotive construction machineries and other automotive vehi- cles. In addition, multiple service providers including the Group are currently subject to class actions in North America in relation to the same matter.
The Group contracts out containerships which the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries then charter to other charterers. Since charter rates are highly sensitive to fluctuations in charter markets, there is a risk that charter rates may fall below hire rates. Depending on changes in the Group’s planning for chartering con- tracts or trends in charter markets, it may be necessary for the

For information on hedge accounting policies of the Group, see Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (u) Derivatives and hedging activities.
The Company monitors regularly the condition of major busi- ness counterparties by each related business division with whom the Company has accounts receivable for business or loans receivable, and manages the outstanding balances and due dates by counterparties, to minimize the risk of default arising from any decline in the financial condition of counterparties. Its consoli- dated subsidiaries also monitor the condition of accounts receiv- able and loans receivable under a similar management policy.
The Group believes that the credit risk of derivatives is insig- nificant as the Group enters into derivatives transactions only with financial institutions which have a sound credit profile.
For investments in the overseas subsidiaries, etc., receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and future loans related to investment in vessels, the Company has entered into currency swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk, and interest-rate swap contracts to minimize interest rate fluctuation risk of loans and bonds. For marketable securities and investments in securi- ties, the Company continuously reviews the condition of holding
Estimated fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the estimated fair value and the difference between them are shown in the following table. The table does not include financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine the fair value.
securities considering the stock market and the relationship with issuing companies, taking into account market value of securities and financial condition of issuing companies in accordance with internal regulations.
The Company enters into derivative transactions with the approval from authorized officers in accordance with internal regulations, which set forth transaction authority and maximum upper limit on positions. Results of derivative transactions are regularly reported at the executive officers meeting. Its consol- idated subsidiaries also manage derivative transactions under similar regulations.
The Company manages liquidity risk by preparing and updat- ing cash management plan on timely basis and maintaining liquid instruments on hand based on reports from each business group.
The fair value of financial instruments is based on market price, if available. When there is no market price, fair value is reasonably estimated. Fair value can fluctuate because differ- ent assumptions may be adopted for calculations of fair value considering various factors. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 15. Derivatives and Hedging Activities are not necessarily indicative of the actual market exposure involved in the derivative transactions.

(*) The value of assets and liabilities arising from derivative transactions is shown at net value, and the amounts in parentheses represent net liability position.
 Fair value of cash and deposits and accounts and notes receiv- able – trade is based on carrying value as most of them are settled within a short term and their fair value approximates carrying value.
Fair value of debt securities is based on market prices pro- vided by financial institutions. Fair value of equity securities and investments in securities is based on market prices prevailing in the applicable stock exchange. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to Note 4. Marketable Securities and Investments in Securities.
Fair value of accounts and notes payable – trade and short- term loans is based on carrying value as most of them are set- tled within a short term and their fair value approximates carrying value, except for the current portion of long-term loans whose fair value is based on the same method as long-term loans.
Fair value of bonds is mainly based on market prices.
Fair value of long-term loans is mainly based on the pres- ent value of the total amount including principal and interest,
discounted by the expected interest rate assuming a new bor- rowing of a similar loan.

Segment information for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018
1. Overview of reporting segments
The Company’s reporting segments are its structural units, for which separate financial information is available, and which are subject to periodic review by the Board of Directors in order to assist decision-making on the allocation of managerial resources and assessment of business performance.
The Group is a shipping business organization centering on marine transportation service and has three reporting segments, which are the dry bulk segment, the energy resource transport segment and the product logistics segment, considering the eco- nomic characteristics, service contents and method of the provi- sion and categorization of the market and customers.
The dry bulk segment includes dry bulk business. The energy resource transport segment includes energy transportation busi- ness and offshore energy E&P support business. The product logistics segment includes the following business: car carrier business, logistics business, short sea and coastal business, and containership business.
(Change in Service Lives)
As stated in Note 2. Change in Accounting Estimate, the Group changed the service life of pure car carriers from 20 years to 25 years during the current fiscal year, and the same change has been applied for the vessels of the reporting segments.
As a result of this change in accounting estimate, operating loss of the “Product Logistics” segment for the current fiscal year decreased by ¥2,465 million ($22,209 thousand), compared to that under the previous method.
(Change in Reporting Segments)
The Group decided to change its reporting segments to “Dry Bulk,” “Energy Resource Transport” and “Product Logistics,” respectively, effective the current fiscal year, from the previ- ous segments, “Containership,” “Bulk shipping” and “Offshore energy E&P support and heavy lifter.”
Accompanied by the integration of the containership business under OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS PTE. LTD., the Group has reorganized its business portfolio strategy to build a new busi- ness model with a strong customer relationship base.
The dry bulk segment includes the dry bulk business. The energy resource transport segment includes the energy transpor- tation business and the offshore energy E&P support business. The product logistics segment includes the following businesses: car carrier businesses, logistics business, short sea and coastal business, and containership business.
Revenues, segment profit (loss), segment assets and other items for the previous fiscal year have been reclassified in con- formity with the current fiscal year.

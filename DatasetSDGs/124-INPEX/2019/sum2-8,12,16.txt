SustainabilityCOMPLIANCE
Our Policy
INPEX is systematically developing a compliance structure, which is an indispensable requirement for its sustainable development, and is striving to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and adherence to corporate ethics. Specifically, INPEX has established the Compliance Committee, which formulates basic policies and plans pertaining to compliance, deliberates significant matters and supervises the implementation of compliance programs to pro- mote unified compliance initiatives throughout the INPEX Group.
Compliance Initiatives
INPEX has established a system by which the director in charge of compliance and the Compliance Committee can promptly consider and implement countermeasures if a significant compliance breach occurs. The director in charge of compliance and the Compliance Committee cooperate with the Audit & Supervisory Board and its members, the accounting auditors and INPEX’s internal Audit Unit as well as the equivalent bodies or departments of subsidiaries in (1) developing and implementing compliance measures, (2) moni- toring implementation, (3) raising compliance awareness, (4) receiv- ing reports on compliance violations and conducting investigation, (5) issuing warnings and taking other measures against violations and (6) instituting measures to prevent the recurrence of violations, with the Director in Charge of Compliance regularly reporting to the Board of Directors as appropriate. There were no cases of signifi- cant compliance breaches in fiscal 2019.
In addition, to ensure coordination between the Compliance Committee and the frontline, INPEX has appointed compliance managers and personnel in every workplace and takes measures to instill and raise compliance awareness throughout the Company.

Working Indigenous Communities
In Australia, our commitment to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to build sustainable and mutually beneficial relationships is underpinned by our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP)*. In 2019, INPEX Australia launched its second Stretch RAP 2019-2022 following its first Stretch RAP launched in 2016.
In November 2018, the Ichthys Joint Venture agreed with the Larrakia people to a A$24 million benefits trust being delivered over 40 years. The agreement recognizes the important role that the Larrakia people have played in supporting the Ichthys LNG Proj- ect through the construction phase and highlights the continued importance of the relationship with the Larrakia people into the future. The funds are held in trust and distributed to provide the Larrakia people with a range of opportunities through economic, educational and social programs.
We are committed to promoting employment and business opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through our own ”Solid Pathways” program introduced in 2019 and working closely with Ichthys LNG Project contractors.
the local communities in which we operate, we conduct impact assessments in advance and implement a variety of countermea- sures. Through working closely with our stakeholders and support- ing the development of local human resources and businesses, we help communities become vibrant, prosperous and resilient.

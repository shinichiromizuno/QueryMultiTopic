EMPLOYEES
Our Policy
In order to constantly strengthen responsible management, INPEX as a global organization values workforce diversity and the devel- opment of global employees who share common values. To achieve this, the HR division formulated the INPEX HR VISION, which com- prises four key elements. HR activities based on these elements are implemented from a global perspective, linking employee develop- ment and team performance to contribute to a globally competitive organization.

Major Initiatives
Since 2014, INPEX has been carrying out activities to promote its corporate values, known as INPEX Values. Through company-wide surveys, INPEX collects nominations for “Values People” and “Values Teams” made up of executives, employees, contractors and teams who embody the INPEX Values and put the values into practice. The fourth survey, conducted in 2018, identified 749 Values People. In addition to interviews with those who receive the most votes, a selection of case studies compiled from a follow-up survey of Values People candidates on how they are considering and carrying out the INPEX Values in their daily lives, known as “Case studies of INPEX Values,” is also published on the intranet. Particularly outstanding cases will be presented with the “INPEX Values Award” as a way of further spreading the INPEX Values.
Targets and Results of Material Issues
In fiscal 2018, to further enhance diversity, one of the INPEX Val- ues, INPEX communicated its basic policy on diversity and inclusion (D&I)* to all stakeholders. In fiscal 2019, we conducted e-learning sessions on D&I for all executives and employees. Going forward, we plan to push ahead with D&I and improve capabilities across the organization to raise the general appeal of INPEX as a company and receive greater recognition from the global community.

HSE
Our Policy
INPEX’s HSE Policy helps ensure the safety and health of all those involved in our business activities as well as promote the conserva- tion of local ecosystems and the global environment. To firmly implement this policy, the corporate HSE Unit, which consists of
five groups (HSE System Group, Health & Safety Group, Process Safe- ty Group, Security & Crisis Management Group and Environment Group) established at headquarters, will promote HSE management through a robust HSE Management System.
    MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF HSE
To realize sustainable energy development, which is part of our mission, we are required to conform to high moral values as a member of society and to foster a corporate culture in which the utmost priority is placed on ensuring safety and conserving the environment. In order to maintain a stable energy supply, we need to conduct our business internationally in search of natural resources. In this pursuit, while we continue to comply with international norms and standards, we must also continue to nurture a corporate culture that will be received by the international community with open arms.
To help achieve our goals, the group-wide HSE Policy is in place to ensure operations are in line with the HSE Management System (HSEMS) based on international standards. The HSEMS Manual comprehensively identifies the HSE activities we must conduct to fulfill our commitment to the HSE Policy, and supports our efforts to seek continuous improvement and risk management in our operations.
We have been implementing the Corporate HSE Third Phase Mid-term Plan (FY2016–FY2020) since fiscal 2016 with the aim of raising our HSE com-
petency to the same level as that of top-tier independent International Oil Companies (IOCs). In addition to ingraining process safety management to prevent major accidents, we are actively promoting environmental management in several ways including the formulation of the Corporate Environmental Management Plan, the control and management of green- house gas emissions and the compiling of reports on protecting biodiversi- ty. Moreover, we expanded the HSE management scope to cover non-oper- ated projects and domestic subsidiaries, and we remain committed to working to ensure more effective and consistent HSE management.
We believe it is our social responsibility, as a global company, to demon- strate to a wide range of stakeholders our commitment to the HSE Policy by promoting specific HSE activities. With unyielding determination to grow into a company worthy of admiration, we will continue to press forward with our HSE activities.

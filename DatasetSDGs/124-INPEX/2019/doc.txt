 The Structure and Mechanism of
Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Development
The business activities of the oil and gas industry can be envisioned as the flow of a river. The upstream consists of the devel- opment and production of oil and natural gas. The midstream is where products are transported. The downstream refers to refining and sales. Our mainstay business is to handle operations in the upstream including the exploration, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. As shown in the business flow on this page, upstream business activities can be further classified into the acquisition of blocks, exploration, appraisal, development, production and sales.
We collect extensive information on legal system and country risks related to areas in which oil and natural gas are expected to exist. We then apply and bid for mining rights and/or exploration and development rights and enter into a contract for exploration and development.

Acquisition of Blocks
Major oil and natural gas producing regions
  There are many methods for marketing crude oil linked to spot prices (market prices established one time per transaction), the spot prices themselves being mainly decided based on crude oil, which has become the transaction benchmark. Representative crude oil spot prices are those quoted for Middle East Dubai crude, North Sea Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) from the United States, to name but a few.
In contrast, as liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects require large amount of
investments, in
many cases LNG is

       supplied under a long-term contract between producers and buyers.
The extracted oil and natural gas are refined and processed. After separating oil and removing impurities (e.g., acid gas, water), we ship natural gas that can be used as a product.

     Where do crude oil and natural gas come from?
Crude oil and natural gas are thought to originate from organic matter, such as the remains of once-living organisms that accumulated at the bottom of seas and lakes, that was then subjected to extreme heat and pressure underground (organic origin theory). Crude oil and natural gas that have formed deep underground are lighter than the water in the earth, allowing them to gradually rise to the surface over a long period of time. If the crude oil and natural gas encounter highly dense geological formations on the way to the surface, however, deposits form that become oil and gas fields.
   In addition to geological surveys, we utilize geophysical surveys conducted through satellite images and seismic waves to assess the potential subsurface accumulations of oil and
natural gas.
      Exploration
Furthermore, we drill exploratory wells to confirm the presence of oil and gas. The bit, a special drill attached to the tip of the pipe, drills through hard rock while digging into the ground.
   Geophysical surveys
      Appraisal
Once the presence of oil and natural gas has been confirmed, we drill appraisal wells to assess the extent of the oil and gas fields and to evaluate the amount of reserves. In addition, we make comprehensive judgments regarding the commercial viability of the
fields.
Drilling of appraisal wells
After a final investment decision (FID) has been made, steps are taken to construct facilities to produce and ship crude oil and natural gas. This includes facilities that separate resources into their liquid and gaseous states to remove impurities and pipelines to
facilitate transportation.
In addition, the drilling of
production wells is
undertaken to extract
crude oil and natural gas.

   Our goal is to become
a leading energy company serving
an essential role in society by meeting the energy needs of
Japan and countries around the world
In retrospect, the fiscal year ended December 2019 was a nine-month period in which INPEX made steady progress from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. The highlights of this period, which marked the second year of our Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022 formulated in May 2018, include the extremely smooth production ramp-up of the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia and the significant increase in our profit owing to the project’s contri- bution to earnings.
Since the turn of the year, however, the global economy has stagnated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and amid the resulting decline in energy demand, crude oil prices have plummeted due to factors including the failure of OPEC-plus to reach an agreement on production cuts. An agreement to reduce production was reached in early April 2020, but the crude oil price outlook remains uncertain.
It is a challenge to foresee how long these circumstances will last. But even if the current low crude oil price environment were to persist for a certain amount of time, we will seek to minimize its impact by reducing investment and costs, securing enough liquidity and further strengthening our financial base, and build a resilient corporate structure that will enable us to stably sustain our business operations. In fiscal 2020, the Company will reduce investment in development and exploration by over 20% and 40%, respectively, compa- ny-wide compared to its initial forecasts. For our global oil and gas production operations, we maintain steady operations in an effort to ensure a stable supply of energy while redou- bling our measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
It is expected that oil and natural gas will still account for half of the world’s energy demand in 2040, and we will continue to strive to sustainably grow our upstream oil and natural gas businesses. On the other hand, measures on climate change response and carbon reduction are accelerating at an unprecedented pace, and fossil fuels are being increasingly scrutinized by the international community. Positioning these social issues as priority themes, we are pursuing new technological developments in carbon recycling and renewable energy initiatives for which we expect long-term demand to increase, while engaging in efforts to set and meet CO2 emission reduction targets.
In addition to pursuing our core business of oil and natural gas exploration and produc- tion, we will sustainably develop, produce and supply a diverse range of energy sources including renewables to become a leading energy company serving an essential role in global society by meeting the energy needs of Japan and countries around the world.
We would like to take this opportunity to ask for the continued and unwavering support and understanding of all our stakeholders.

  Smooth ramp-up with the Ichthys LNG project in Australia.
Responding appropriately to low oil prices and ongoing business stability will feed through to steady growth
 Rapid changes in the business environment from 2020 and our response
I would first like to express my sincere condolences to all those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. I would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the medical and other professionals who are working on the front lines.
The global economy has been facing a major crisis since the start of 2020 as COVID-19 has spread around the world, restricting the movement of people and goods internationally and disrupting supply chains. The slowdown of the global econ- omy is having a serious impact on energy demand, with some forecasting that global energy demand in 2020 will decrease by about 6% year on year.*

After a period of discord among its members, OPEC-plus agreed in early April to cut production. However, owing to the sharp decline in crude oil demand, we remain in a situation of acute excess supply.
In this supply/demand environment, the per- barrel price of crude oil, which began the year at US$65-70 per barrel, fell sharply from mid-March. Since then the oil price slightly rebounded, howev- er we are still in a low oil price environment. The outlook for oil prices is unpredictable, and crude oil prices could remain depressed for six months to more than a year.
In response to rapid changes in the business environment, we will work to reduce investment and cut costs in order to build a strong corporate structure that can sustain stable business even if oil prices remain at their current low level for a con- siderable period of time. We aim to secure suffi- cient liquidity and further strengthen our financial

  base. Regarding the reduction of investments and cutting of costs, we aim to curtail development investment across the entire company by more than 20% and cut exploration investment by more than 40% compared with our initial plan in fiscal 2020. We will also reduce companywide operating expenses and administrative costs throughout the Company. INPEX has secured liquidity through suf- ficient cash on hand and commitment lines. How- ever, we plan additional borrowings to strengthen our financial base and intend to continue diversify- ing our funding structure to further enhance the quality and soundness of our position.
At the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia, where we are the operator, and at the Minami-Nagaoka Gas Field and Naoetsu LNG Terminal in Japan and other operating sites, we are striving to ensure sta- ble operations and maintain stable supplies of energy while implementing extensive measures to prevent further COVID-19 infection, standing firmly to the principle that the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority.
Although situation at the moment has become increasingly uncertain, we continue to expect sub- stantial growth in energy demand centered on Asia and especially for liquefied natural gas (LNG) over the medium to long term. I view this as a time
to prepare the ground for our future development by working together to reduce costs and build a strong corporate structure.
Looking back on the past fiscal term ended on December 31, 2019
The fiscal term ended December 31, 2019 was an irregular transitional fiscal period of nine months from April to December 2019. This reflects the change in our fiscal year-end from March 31 to December 31.
Looking first at crude oil prices, which have a major impact on INPEX’s earnings, Brent crude, a benchmark index, stood at US$69 per barrel at the beginning of the fiscal term and finished at US$66 after repeated fluctuations amid tensions in the Middle East and persistent US-China trade friction. The average annual Brent crude price over the term was US$65.61 per barrel, down US$5.95 compared with the previous fiscal year.
With foreign currency exchange rates, another key factor, the yen traded at an average rate of ¥108.84 over the period. This represented yen appreciation of ¥1.88 compared with the same period of the previous year.
*Year-on-year comparisons are made on the basis of figures for the fiscal year ended on March 31, 2019 adjusted to nine months, the same period as the fiscal term under review.
Turning to consolidated results for the fiscal term, despite the decline in oil prices, sales volume increased due to the successful ramp-up of the Ich- thys LNG project in Australia and the start of pro- duction at the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project. Consolidated sales expanded 25.0% year on year to ¥1 trillion, operating income rose 20.5% to ¥498.6 billion and recurring profit increased 14.7% to ¥511.0 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent increased a substantial 136.1% year on year to ¥123.5 billion.
Regarding dividends to shareholders, our Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022 sets out a basic shareholder returns policy for the term of the plan from FY2018 to FY2022. This targets a payout ratio of 30% or higher, and enhancing dividends per share in stages in accordance with the growth of the Company’s financial results. Based on this policy, INPEX paid dividends for the fiscal term

increased by around 80 million barrels of oil equiv- alent (BOE) compared with the previous fiscal year-end, to roughly 4.09 billion BOE as of Decem- ber 31, 2019. In terms of both net production and proved reserves, we are approaching the top 10 international oil companies. We remain committed to becoming a leading energy company ranking among the global powers in the sector.
Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022: Initiatives and results
In May 2018, we formulated our “Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022” based on our “Vision 2040: Delivering Tomorrow’s Energy Solutions,” our long-term vision for the Company. This plan sets out three business targets for achievement: 1) sustainable growth of oil and natural gas E&P activ- ities; 2) development of the global gas value chain business; and 3) reinforcement of renewable
energy initiatives.
1. Sustainable growth of oil and natural gas E&P activities
Production at the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia, the first large-scale LNG project operated by a Jap- anese company, has continued to go well since it started in July 2018. The project shipped 84 car- goes of LNG in the nine months ended December 31, 2019. This project has annual production capac- ity of approximately 8.9 million tons of LNG, approximately 1.65 million tons of LPG, along with approximately 100,000 barrels of condensate per day at peak. We are targeting an average of 10 car- goes per month in 2020 assuming sustained pla- teau production. We expect stable operations at this project will form the foundation of our future activities. With this project, we have completed the drilling and completion work on 18 production wells and will continue drilling in 2020.
In December 2019, we achieved financial com-
  Ichthys LNG Project floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility Ichthys Venturer
16 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12
 
 pletion under the financing framework for this project, thereby releasing INPEX and its joint ven- ture partners from completion guarantee obliga- tions to lenders corresponding to their respective participating interests in the project. Financial completion in about 14 months from the start of LNG shipments is shorter than the average with LNG Project of a similar size, demonstrating that a very smooth ramp-up and stable operations have been achieved with this project. Employees of vari- ous nationalities and different genders have been involved in the Ichthys LNG project. Their contribu- tion, strong teamwork nurtured through active communication, and the top priority placed on safety underpinned smooth development and ramp-up work. We intend to continue to promote stable operations based on the mutual trust built thus far.
The Abadi LNG Project in Indonesia, INPEX’s largest LNG Project after the Ichthys LNG Project is targeted to begin production in the second half of the 2020s. Plans call for annual LNG production capacity of approximately 9.5 million tons and 35 thousand barrels of condensate per day. The proj- ect is also expected to supply up to 150 million cubic feet of natural gas via pipeline to meet gas demand in the surrounding area. The revised plan of development (POD) received official approval of Indonesian government authorities in July 2019 after extended negotiations. In addition, the Indo- nesian authorities also approved an extension of the production sharing contract (PSC) until 2055. Having secured three financial incentives in the form of exemptions from indirect tax, investment credit and profit sharing after tax, we are confident this project will be economically viable. We recog- nize that this project is of vital importance to Indo- nesia, and we will continue to work towards its realization.
In the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, development work is currently under way to increase daily production capacity in the on- shore concession to two million barrels per day and to 1.5 million barrels per day in the four offshore oil fields. Among the offshore oil fields, INPEX was nominated as the asset leader of the Lower Zakum Oil Field in recognition of its operational experi- ence in Abu Dhabi thus far. As the asset leader, INPEX is currently playing a leading role in devel-
opment and operations working closely with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its part- ners.
The Australian Prelude FLNG Project has been steadily achieving its project milestones, including starting gas production in December 2018, com- mencing condensate shipments in March 2019, and beginning shipments of LNG in June of the same year.
The Kashagan Oil Field Project in Kazakhstan began shipping crude oil in 2016 and has achieved its initial production target of 370,000 barrels per day. We are currently working to increase daily pro- duction volume to 450,000 barrels. As of December 2019, the ACG Oil Field in Azerbaijan had achieved cumulative production of 500 million tons (approx- imately 3.7 billion barrels).
INPEX positions Australia's northwest continen- tal shelf, the Gulf of Mexico, and Norway as priority exploration areas, and has acquired interests in exploration blocks in each area. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on quality and strategic sig- nificance as well as quantity, and make appropriate investment decisions to take us through to our next stage of growth.
2. Development of the global gas value chain business
In the natural gas business in Japan, the natural gas produced by INPEX's Minami-Nagaoka Gas Field (Niigata Prefecture) and LNG received at the Naoetsu LNG Terminal (Niigata Prefecture) are transported through a trunk pipeline network of approximately 1,500 kilometers stretching across the Kanto, Koshinetsu and Hokuriku regions, and sold to customers including city gas companies and large-scale plants along the aforementioned network. INPEX began receiving LNG from the Ichthys LNG Project at the Naoetsu LNG Terminal in October 2018 and began regular shipments with the Oceanic Breeze LNG carrier, which is jointly owned by INPEX and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha. In these ways, we have been building strong infra- structure connecting Japan and overseas.
The domestic pipeline network is designed to ensure stable energy supplies in the event of a disaster. In October 2019, a portion of INPEX’s pipe- line located in Nagano Prefecture was damaged by Typhoon Hagibis (Typhoon No. 19), which caused

 Message from the President
extensive damage throughout Japan. However, we managed to maintain supplies of natural gas to customers without disruption while proceeding with restoration work. The sales volume of natural gas in the nine months ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 1.51 billion cubic meters. We are continuing to make progress toward quickly lifting our annual domestic gas volume supply to 2.5 billion cubic meters, as set out in our Medi- um-term Business Plan 2018-2022. Natural gas is used not only as a raw material for heating, but can be used in a wide variety of applications, including as a raw material for chemical products, fuel for natural gas-fired power plants, and fuel for home-power generation and cogeneration. As we work to further expand supply volumes, we are focusing on developing new demand in response to diversifying natural gas needs by such means as entering new energy service businesses.
In addition, we are taking measures to develop a global gas value chain by expanding domestic gas yearly volume, maintaining and strengthening transportation capacity, enhancing supply and demand management and trading functions, and maximizing value with our upstream natural gas interests. Through these means, we aim to be a key player in natural gas development and supply in Asia and Oceania.
3. Reinforcement of renewable energy initiatives
As the international community accelerates its transition to a low-carbon society, we will continue to promote a shift in energy consumption to natu- ral gas, which has a lower environmental footprint. We are also focused on raising the proportion renewable energy projects account for in our energy portfolio to 10%.
With regard to the geothermal power genera- tion business, the three units of the Sarulla Geo- thermal Independent Power Producer (IPP) Project in Sumatra, Indonesia, have been generating total power output of about 330 megawatts since May 2018. This is a commercial operation providing power to about 2.1 million local households. In Japan, we are conducting an environmental assess- ment for the construction of a geothermal power plant in the Oyasu region of Akita Prefecture. In addition to the geothermal power generation busi-
ness, we are continuing to strengthen operations in the renewable field, including entering the wind power business.
To achieve a low carbon footprint, we are also exercising appropriate management of green- house gas emissions resulting from of our business activities and proceeding with technological development for the practical application of car- bon capture and storage (CCS) to capture and sequester GHG emissions.
We have also been working with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and Hitachi Zosen Corpora- tion to establish methanation technology, which is a carbon recycling technology. We have com- pleted construction of a test facility for synthesiz- ing methane from CO2 and hydrogen at the Koshiji- hara Plant of our Nagaoka Field Office in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture and have commenced trial operations of the technology. Through evaluation and examination of technical issues, we aim to later expand the scale of our operation.
On page 4 of this Annual Report, we present our business model for INPEX’s value creation through the strategic development of businesses based on the business goals discussed above. This sets out a process for INPEX achieving sustainable growth through a balanced approach to satisfying society’s twin needs for meeting global energy demand and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Please take a look.
ESG: Initiatives to create value over the medium to long term
In order to create value over the medium to long term, we intend to strengthen ESG efforts, respond to growing global energy demand, contribute to raising Japan's oil and natural gas self-develop- ment ratio, and take appropriate measures to tackle climate change. We will also endeavor to contribute to the resolution of social issues, includ- ing promoting low-carbon business activities, and the attainment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Regarding tackling climate change, based on “Vision 2040,” we aim to take proactive steps to strengthen our governance system to help pro-
 18 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12
 
  mote a low-carbon society based on the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, assess business strat- egies, and evaluate climate change risks and opportunities. We are also making efforts in each area that affects gas emission management, and are continuing to enhance information disclosure in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In addition, INPEX has formulated a position paper titled “Corporate Position on Climate Change.” This sets out how we are addressing climate change as a responsible member of the oil and natural gas industry.
As part of our efforts to promote health and productivity management, we formulated the INPEX Group Health Statement in 2018 and have established a health management implementation committee. This committee meets regularly as a forum for INPEX to work with its labor union and health insurance union to maintain and improve the health of its employees and create healthy workplaces. We are working to maintain and improve physical and mental health and promote work-life balance so that all employees feel moti- vated in their work and are encouraged to maxi- mize their potential. In recognition of these efforts, INPEX has been selected in the large enterprise cat- egory (White 500) of the 2020 Certified Health & Productivity Management Outstanding Organiza- tions recognition program operated by the Minis- try of Economy, Trade and Industry and Nippon Kenko Kaigi, an organization promoting public health. Furthermore, to ensure the global penetra- tion of the INPEX Values as values shared by all Group employees, while at the same time recog- nizing the importance of promoting diversity in order to respond to risks and opportunities in a rapidly changing world, we have been focusing on diversity and inclusion in the organization. This includes encouraging the active participation of women and promoting employment of people with disabilities.
Regarding corporate governance, we are con- stantly striving to strengthen our governance sys- tem in order to quickly grasp changes in the exter- nal environment and incorporate them into our strategies. Our Board of Directors includes eight directors appointed from within the company. These members have a deep familiarity of INPEX’s
operations as well as international experience and a firm understanding of the technology and know- how of the business. The Board also includes six outside directors. Since March 2020 we have increased the number of outside directors by one. These outside directors have served as leaders in the resource and energy industry, as well as in the legal, financial and other specialty fields and as seasoned leaders in academia or the corporate world who come to us with a wealth of experience and knowledge. As this demonstrates, we attach great importance to diversity in our Board of Direc- tors. Directors’ compensation now takes into account HSE performance including ESG. We have also introduced a stock-based remuneration sys- tem for directors with remuneration based on the recommendations of the Nomination and Com- pensation Committee.
As production at the Ichthys LNG Project has continued to proceed steadily and has entered a new stage, I feel a greater sense of social responsi- bility than ever before. With all of the employees and executives aware of our responsibilities, we will continue to fulfill our mission through our busi- ness. In doing so, I ask for the continued support and understanding of all our stakeholders.

 Cash Allocation Aimed at Increasing Corporate Value
 Increase corporate value through shareholder returns and investments for growth under Vision 2040
To continuously improve corporate value, it is important to ensure a well-balanced allocation of cash generated from projects to both investments in promising projects and shareholder returns. It is equally important to remain aware of the need for cap- ital efficiency and financial soundness. INPEX is committed to further improving capital efficiency by increasing profitability through efficient project management. At the same time, we will ensure an appropriate equity ratio to maintain sound finances. Every effort will be made to generate new cash through investments for growth while simultaneously increasing shareholder value in a bid to continuously increase corporate value over the long term.

Current assets decreased by ¥37.9 billion to ¥419.8 billion due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, while fixed assets increased by ¥94.3 billion to ¥4,430.1 billion due to increases in development investment and other factors.
Meanwhile, total liabilities combining current and long-term liabilities amounted to ¥1,552.8 billion, while long- and short-term debt decreased by ¥23.4 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥1,117.7 billion. Net assets increased by ¥39.5 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥3,297.1 billion. Total shareholders’ equity increased by ¥84.9 billion to ¥2,722.7 billion, total accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by ¥50.6 billion to ¥317.9 billion, and non-controlling interests in net assets increased by ¥5.2 billion to ¥256.4 billion. Net assets, excluding non-controlling interests, as a percentage of total assets were 62.7%, the same level as at the end of the previous fiscal year. Net assets, excluding non-controlling interests, per share increased by ¥23.48 from the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥2,082.43.
Response to low crude oil prices
Crude oil prices plummeted at the beginning of 2020, creating a harsh business environment. While a decrease in revenue due to the crude oil price downturn is unavoidable, INPEX will work to improve free cash flow through investment and cost reductions and further stabilize its financial base through additional financing in order to be able to sustain stable business operations even in a low oil price environment.

The Abadi LNG Project was designated by the Indonesian government as a National Strategic Project in June 2017 and a Priority Infrastructure Project in September 2017.
 Aiming to be a key player in the development and supply of gas
 INPEX acquired a 100% interest in the Masela Block, located in the Arafura Sea of Indonesia, in 1998. As operator, INPEX discovered the Abadi Gas Field in 2000.
In 2019, Indonesian government authorities approved INPEX’s revised plan of development based on an onshore LNG development scheme as well as an extension of the PSC term until November 15, 2055.
INPEX is currently preparing to commence FEED (Front-end engineering design) work with the aim of launching production in the latter half of the 2020s. LNG production at the Abadi LNG Project is expected to reach 9.5 million tons per year, equal to just over 10% of Japan’s total annual LNG import volume. INPEX aims to become a key player in natural gas development and supply in the growth markets of Asia and Oceania.

    1 Abadi LNG Project The Abadi LNG Project is based on an
onshore LNG development scheme that INPEX as the operator is preparing for de- velopment alongside Shell in the Masela Block offshore Indonesia. The project is expected to produce approximately 9.5 million tons of LNG per year and up to ap- proximately 35,000 barrels of condensate per day. The project will also supply 150 million cubic feet of natural gas per day
via pipeline to address local demand for natural gas.
INPEX acquired a 100% interest in the Masela Block in November 1998 through an open bid conducted by the Indonesian authorities. INPEX subsequently conduct- ed exploration activities as the operator, discovering the Abadi Gas Field through the first exploratory well drilled in 2000. Following exploration, evaluation activi-
ties and development studies, INPEX con- ducted Pre-FEED work from March 2018 based on an onshore LNG development scheme envisaging an annual LNG produc- tion capacity of 9.5 million tons. INPEX submitted a revised plan of development in June 2019 and received approval from the Indonesian authorities in July 2019. Alongside the approval of the revised development plan, the Indonesian author- ities also approved a 20-year extension of the production sharing contract (PSC) and the application for a seven-year additional time allocation, extending the term of the PSC until 2055. INPEX will undertake front-end engineering design (FEED) work and is aiming to reach production startup in the latter half of the 2020s.

 3 Ichthys LNG Project and surrounding blocks
Ichthys LNG Project
In 1998, INPEX acquired an exploration permit in the block where the Ichthys Gas-Condensate Field is now located, and following development studies including exploration, evaluation and FEED work, INPEX announced its FID in January 2012. Following the completion and com- missioning of production facilities, INPEX commenced production in July 2018 and later began shipping condensate, LNG and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
Production ramp up has progressed very smoothly, and in 2019, 104 LNG cargoes were shipped from the project’s onshore gas liquefaction plant in Darwin. In 2020, shipments of approximately 10 LNG cargoes per month are expected given stable (plateau) production condi- tions.
Surrounding exploration blocks
INPEX holds interests in 20 exploration blocks in the vicinity of the Ichthys
Gas-Condensate Field and has engaged in exploration activities that have led to the discovery of gas in at least 11 of these blocks. Evaluation work is now being performed on these discoveries. In the event that substantial amounts of hydro- carbons are confirmed as a result of these exploration and evaluation activities, INPEX expects to expand its business by leveraging the synergies of integration with the Ichthys LNG Project.

 8 Bayu-Undan Project (PSC-TL-SO-T 19-12 (former JPDA03-12))
In April 1993, INPEX acquired an interest in the former JPDA03-12 contract area, located in the Timor Sea joint petroleum development area (JPDA), which was jointly managed by Australia and East Timor. Exploration within this contract area resulted in the discovery of oil and gas fields. Of these, studies revealed that the Undan structure and the Bayu structure, located in the adjacent former
JPDA03-13 contract area, were a single structure. The interest holders unitized both contract areas in 1999, allowing joint development of the Bayu-Undan Gas-Condensate Field to proceed. The commercial production and shipment of condensate and LPG started in 2004 followed by LNG in February 2006.
In August 2019, JPDA was abolished as a result of the ratification of a maritime
boundary treaty between Australia and East Timor, and the area fell under the sole jurisdiction of the East Timor government. In accordance with the treaty, discussions were held between both governments and PSC contractors. The parties agreed to keep the same conditions as the former PSC and consequently a new PSC with the East Timor government (Block title: PSC-TL-SO-T 19-12) was bound.

    1 Offshore North Caspian Sea Contract Area (Kashagan Oil Field and others)
  In September 1998, INPEX acquired an interest in the Offshore North Caspian Sea Contract Area in Kazakhstan’s territorial waters. The Kashagan Oil Field is located within this area in the Caspian Sea where the water reaches depths of 3-4 meters, approximately 75 kilometers southeast of Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Following the drilling of the first exploratory well in September 1999, the Kashagan Oil Field was discovered in 2000 and commercial quantities of oil were confirmed in 2002. After development work, the shipment of crude oil commenced in October 2016. INPEX and its partners have achieved the project’s initial production vol- ume target of 370,000 barrels per day and are currently working to increase the daily production volume to 450,000 barrels.
Meanwhile, the presence of hydrocar-
bons has been confirmed in the Kalamkas, Aktote and Kairan structures, which are located adjacent to the Kashagan Oil Field. Appraisal of these three structures is
being conducted in parallel with the devel- opment of the Kashagan Oil Field, with a view to expanding the total production of the contract area.

In the natural gas business in Japan, the natural gas produced from the INPEX-held Mina- mi-Nagaoka Gas Field (Niigata Prefecture), as well as the LNG and other products received at the Naoetsu LNG Terminal (Niigata Prefecture), which commenced operations in December 2013, is transported through a trunk pipeline network of approximately 1,500 km stretching across the Kanto, Koshinetsu and Hokuriku regions, and sold to customers including city gas companies and large-scale plants along the aforementioned network.
INPEX has experienced steady growth in sales of natural gas volume due to efforts to expand its supply infrastructure, as well as the highly environmentally friendly attributes of natural gas. Natural gas is expected to be used for a wide variety of applications, not only as a fuel for thermal energy but also as a fuel for onsite power generation and co-gener- ation, as well as a fuel for natural gas electric
power plants and a raw material for chemical products. INPEX is targeting annual natural gas sales of 2.5 billion m3 by fiscal 2022 and 3.0 billion m3 or more by 2040 as it uses existing infrastructure in tie-ups with other companies to ensure stable supply. INPEX remains focused on the sustainable improvement in the value of INPEX natural gas business, which plays a key role in the global gas value chains. INPEX began receiving LNG from the Ichthys LNG Project at the Naoetsu LNG Terminal in October 2018.
Alongside the full deregulation of the elec- tric power market since April 2016, INPEX has responded to growing demand from gas-fired electric power plants and is engaged in the electric power wholesale business with partner Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc. Moreover, in light of the full deregulation of the gas retail market from April 2017, INPEX moved to bolster its marketing abilities by way of reorganization

focused on addressing changes in the business environment, including changes in the compet- itive landscape in the domestic gas market. At the Naruto Gas Field in Chiba Prefecture, nat- ural gas is being produced from water-soluble gas fields. In addition, after extracting the natu- ral gas from underground water (brine water), the brine water is used to produce iodine, which is exported to Europe, the United States and elsewhere.

Power generation business in Japan
In March 2013, INPEX began generating electricity at INPEX Mega Solar Joetsu, a photovoltaic power genera- tion facility with a maximum output of 2,000 kilowatts (two megawatts) located on the site of a former oil refin- ery in Joetsu City, Niigata Prefecture. In 2014, construction began on a second 2,000 kilowatts (two megawatts) photovoltaic power generation facility located adjacent to the first, where operations commenced in July 2015 under the management of an INPEX Group company. The two photovoltaic power generation facilities are expected to generate around 5.33 million kilowatt-hours annually, enough electricity to power 1,600 homes on an annual basis in Japan.
In addition, INPEX constructed a high-efficiency gas turbine combined cycle thermal power plant with a maxi- mum output of about 55,000 kilowatts next to its Koshiji- hara natural gas production plant in Niigata Prefecture. The power plant has been supplying electricity on a wholesale basis to electricity retailers since May 2007.
INPEX and Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd., have been jointly conducting geothermal resource surveys in the Amema- sudake region of Hokkaido Prefecture and the Oyasu region of Akita Prefecture since 2011. From 2013 to 2018, surveys were conducted by drilling a total of seven explor- atory wells in the Amemasudake region and seven explor- atory wells, two test production wells and one test reinjec- tion well in the Oyasu region. Steam and hydrothermal production were confirmed through fumarolic testing in both areas and environmental assessments commenced in the Oyasu region in 2018 with full-scale fumarolic testing scheduled for 2020.
CO2 Utilization Technology Development
Also, as a member of a geothermal resource survey group in Fukushima Prefecture, INPEX participated in a joint land survey in the Bandai region from 2012 until its temporary suspension in 2018. INPEX, however, has con- tinued survey preparations in the Azuma-Adatara area.
Power generation business overseas
In June 2015, INPEX joined the Sarulla Geothermal Independent Power Producer (IPP) Project in Indonesia. The project involves operating the world’s largest single-contract geothermal power plant located in the Sarulla area of Indonesia’s North Sumatra province and supplying the generated power to Indonesia’s govern- ment-owned electricity company over a period of 30 years. Construction of the power plant began in 2014. Commercial operations commenced at the power plant’s first, second and third units in March 2017, October 2017 and May 2018, respectively. The three units generate a combined power output of approximately 330,000 kilowatts (330 megawatts).
Indonesia Sarulla Geothermal IPP Project
  The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from thermal power generation is considered key to addressing the issue of climate change, and one solution is the devel- opment of carbon recycling technologies that capture and effectively utilize CO2.
INPEX is involved in pursuing carbon capture and utilization through the development of methanation
CO2 methanation test facility currently under construction
technology, which involves the production of methane using CO2 as a raw material.
To this end, INPEX has been participating in a project sanctioned by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to develop technolo- gies that enable the effective utilization of CO2. As part of the project, INPEX, in cooperation with Hitachi Zosen Corporation, established a testing facility that synthesizes methane from CO2 and hydrogen at the Koshijihara plant located within INPEX’s Nagaoka Field Office in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture.
The commissioning of the methane synthesis testing facility began in October 2019, and the facility operated continuously until February 2020. Using data obtained through testing and continuous operation, INPEX is reviewing and assessing technical issues, including ways to optimize the methanation process with the aim of establishing and further developing methanation technologies.

    In April 2012, we identified five key issues among the seven core social responsibility subjects in ISO 26000 as Material Issues of impor- tance for us and our stakeholders. In May 2015, we reexamined the Material Issues considering factors such as impacts of business activi- ties associated with the progress of our key projects and changes to stakeholder priorities. As a result, we redefined the Material Issues by adding the sixth issue, “Governance.” Furthermore, CSR actions that should be prioritized for each Material Issue have been defined as Key Tasks and have been incorporated into our PDCA1 cycle in order to achieve continuous improvement. In fiscal 2017, we incorporated
the perspectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)2 into the existing Key Tasks, mapped the Key Tasks through a four-step prioritization process (identify the issues and conduct gap analysis, have dialog with stakeholders, prioritize the issues, then conduct management review) and reevaluated the Key Tasks.

 CLIMATE CHANGE
Our Policy
INPEX recognizes that climate change is a critical business issue. To achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, an econo- my-wide transition to a low-carbon society is under way. Global cli- mate change response requires action by all members of the inter- national community including governments, businesses and civil society. Governmental policy, technology development, industry response and other long-term initiatives are particularly pertinent. We are committed to fulfilling our role in addressing climate change as a responsible member of the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, we comply with the national regulations of each country in which we operate, including those introduced to support the Paris Agree- ment. Our businesses will work with governments and other stake- holders to address the two societal demands of meeting increasing energy needs and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve a balance between the two. In our actions towards achiev-
1. Corporate Position on Climate Change https://www.inpex.co.jp/english/csr/climatechange/pdf/20200204.pdf
ing a low-carbon society, we will strengthen initiatives on promot- ing natural gas development and renewable energy to reduce the emissions associated with INPEX’s value chain.
In addition, we will properly manage GHG emissions from our operations and pursue technology development for the practical application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to capture and sequester GHG emissions. We shall also implement measures to disclose information associated with climate change in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In line with these policies, INPEX has developed “Corporate Position on Climate Change,” (issued December 2015 and last revised February 2020) a position paper accessible on our website1.
    MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE
To enhance our response to climate change as a responsible oil and natural gas company, we published a position paper entitled “Corporate Position on Climate Change” in December 2015 and most recently updated it in February 2020. As detailed in INPEX’s “Vision 2040” and “Medium-term Busi- ness Plan 2018- 2022” announced in May 2018, we are also implementing ongoing measures to enhance our initiatives addressing climate change and to disclose information in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These measures are positioned to help us contribute proactively to developing a low-carbon society based on the long-term targets outlined in the Paris Agreement.
Specifically, our Board of Directors seeks to maintain its oversight and expand its involvement in governance. When developing our business strat- egies, we assess our ability to respond to multiple climate-related scenarios, including the IEA2 WEO 2°C scenario3, to evaluate our business portfolio. Regarding risk and opportunity assessment, we have an annual assessment
2. IEA: International Energy Agency
3. Sustainable Development Scenario
4. IPIECA: International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association
and management cycle where risks and opportunities are explored in detail. We then implement measures and work plans developed from that process. As for the management of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we are considering target-setting methods in line with international standards while complying with each country’s national regulations and GHG man- agement frameworks. We are also improving information disclosure regard- ing exposure to climate change risks in line with the recommendations set out by the TCFD.
To apply industry best practices to these activities in a timely manner, we disseminate and gather information as a member of the Executive Com- mittee of IPIECA4, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance. INPEX hosted the first IPIECA extraordinary general meeting and executive committee meeting in Japan in November 2019. We will continue our efforts to proactively promote sustainability.

Climate Change
In response to the TCFD recommendations, we are implementing initiatives for the assessment and management of climate change risks.
We classify policy and legal transitions, technology transitions, market transitions and reputational risks as transition risks, and acute and chronic risks as physical risks. We also apply short-term, medium-term and long-term classifications to each of these risk categories. Climate Change Strategy Group, within the Corporate Strategy & Planning Unit of the Corporate Strategy & Planning Divi- sion acts as the secretariat and conducts risk assessment and man- agement on a yearly cycle.
Given their importance, risk assessment and the formulation of countermeasures incorporate the deliberations, evaluations and proposals of divisions and units across the Company, with the Cli- mate Change Strategy Project Team assuming the title of “Climate Change Strategy Working Group” and serving as an advisory board to the CSR Committee.
We conduct financial assessments of climate change-related
Climate Change Milestones
risks by addressing policy and regulatory risk as well as market risk. For the policy and regulatory risk, we assess how the introduction or enhancement of a carbon pricing policy would financially impact our projects. For the market risk, we assess how crude oil prices and carbon prices in a WEO 2°C scenario published by the IEA, as well as the supply and demand outlook for oil and LNG in the same scenario, would financially impact our projects.
Meanwhile, we conducted physical risk assessments of INPEX-operated facilities in fiscal 2019 and identified risks at leading facilities in Japan and Australia. In terms of chronic risk, there may be impacts to our operational efficiency, though our assessment indicated that there was no immediate need for facility repairs. On the other hand, when looking at acute risks, our attention is focused on natural disasters, which appear to be occurring in Japan with greater frequency and force. As countermeasures move forward on the national level, we focus on the risk management within the con- ventional framework including promotion of pipeline risk assess- ment and the formulation of countermeasures.

            Governance Framework for Climate Change Response
As we recognize that climate change is a critical business issue, the Board of Directors seeks to maintain its oversight and expand INPEX’s involvement in this matter. Specifically, our “Corporate Posi- tion on Climate Change” was resolved by the Board of Directors and published in 2015, with a revision made in February 2020. As a rule, the Board will review this corporate position on a yearly basis. We created a system where assessment of climate change risks and
Governance Framework for Climate Change Response
opportunities and the target settings relating to climate change are approved by the Management Committee and then reported to the Board of Directors. Finally, we have tasked the Climate Change Strat- egy Group, within the Corporate Strategy & Planning Unit of the Corporate Strategy & Planning Division, to address climate change issues across the entire company.

   Plan for Transitioning to a Low-Carbon Society
With the goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our businesses, we use the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) Stated Policies Scenario as a base-case scenario, and are focused on business strategies for the transition period to a low-car- bon society, with reference materials including the IEA’s WEO 2°C scenario (Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS)). In addition to promoting the development of natural gas and strengthening our efforts in renewable energy initiatives, where strong demand is expected under these scenarios, we are managing emissions from our operations appropriately and participating in proof-of-concept trials for CCS, which is a technology to capture and store CO2.
In Vison 2040, we further promote a low-carbon footprint in operations. We aim to be a key player in natural gas development
Renewable Energy Initiatives
With the goal of adequately responding to climate change and meeting growing demand for renewable energy over the long term, we are accelerating the development of our renewable energy busi- ness. In addition to domestic photovoltaic power projects, we are currently engaged in geothermal power generation businesses both in Japan and Indonesia. In the future, INPEX intends to expand its participation in wind power generation and other areas, further expanding its business, while also promoting technology research and development related to greenhouse gas reduction. INPEX aims for renewable energy to account for 10 percent of its project portfo- lio by 2040.

and supply, mainly focusing on Asia and Oceania. Meanwhile, we will seek to expand our domestic gas supply chain on which our development and supply of natural gas has so far been centered, and create a global gas value chain. In the field of renewables, we aim for renewable energy projects to account for 10% of our project portfolio in the long term. As for CCS, we will develop technologies for its practical application.
Accordingly, while reducing our carbon footprint in each of our business activities, we will work to continuously increase corporate value by maintaining a business portfolio with the flexibility to respond to changes in our business environment looking towards 2040.

 COMPLIANCE
Our Policy
INPEX is systematically developing a compliance structure, which is an indispensable requirement for its sustainable development, and is striving to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and adherence to corporate ethics. Specifically, INPEX has established the Compliance Committee, which formulates basic policies and plans pertaining to compliance, deliberates significant matters and supervises the implementation of compliance programs to pro- mote unified compliance initiatives throughout the INPEX Group.
Compliance Initiatives
INPEX has established a system by which the director in charge of compliance and the Compliance Committee can promptly consider and implement countermeasures if a significant compliance breach occurs. The director in charge of compliance and the Compliance Committee cooperate with the Audit & Supervisory Board and its members, the accounting auditors and INPEX’s internal Audit Unit as well as the equivalent bodies or departments of subsidiaries in (1) developing and implementing compliance measures, (2) moni- toring implementation, (3) raising compliance awareness, (4) receiv- ing reports on compliance violations and conducting investigation, (5) issuing warnings and taking other measures against violations and (6) instituting measures to prevent the recurrence of violations, with the Director in Charge of Compliance regularly reporting to the Board of Directors as appropriate. There were no cases of signifi- cant compliance breaches in fiscal 2019.
In addition, to ensure coordination between the Compliance Committee and the frontline, INPEX has appointed compliance managers and personnel in every workplace and takes measures to instill and raise compliance awareness throughout the Company.
Targets and Results of Material Issues
Compliance
The committee’s responsibilities also include the development and revision of compliance-related regulations.
In addition, in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsi- bility Principles, INPEX has instituted the Code of Conduct, which prescribes obligations of personnel to practice compliance, in order to increase compliance awareness among executives and employ- ees and put the Business Principles into practice.

 HSE
Our Policy
INPEX’s HSE Policy helps ensure the safety and health of all those involved in our business activities as well as promote the conserva- tion of local ecosystems and the global environment. To firmly implement this policy, the corporate HSE Unit, which consists of
five groups (HSE System Group, Health & Safety Group, Process Safe- ty Group, Security & Crisis Management Group and Environment Group) established at headquarters, will promote HSE management through a robust HSE Management System.
    MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF HSE
To realize sustainable energy development, which is part of our mission, we are required to conform to high moral values as a member of society and to foster a corporate culture in which the utmost priority is placed on ensuring safety and conserving the environment. In order to maintain a stable energy supply, we need to conduct our business internationally in search of natural resources. In this pursuit, while we continue to comply with international norms and standards, we must also continue to nurture a corporate culture that will be received by the international community with open arms.
To help achieve our goals, the group-wide HSE Policy is in place to ensure operations are in line with the HSE Management System (HSEMS) based on international standards. The HSEMS Manual comprehensively identifies the HSE activities we must conduct to fulfill our commitment to the HSE Policy, and supports our efforts to seek continuous improvement and risk management in our operations.
We have been implementing the Corporate HSE Third Phase Mid-term Plan (FY2016–FY2020) since fiscal 2016 with the aim of raising our HSE com-
petency to the same level as that of top-tier independent International Oil Companies (IOCs). In addition to ingraining process safety management to prevent major accidents, we are actively promoting environmental management in several ways including the formulation of the Corporate Environmental Management Plan, the control and management of green- house gas emissions and the compiling of reports on protecting biodiversi- ty. Moreover, we expanded the HSE management scope to cover non-oper- ated projects and domestic subsidiaries, and we remain committed to working to ensure more effective and consistent HSE management.
We believe it is our social responsibility, as a global company, to demon- strate to a wide range of stakeholders our commitment to the HSE Policy by promoting specific HSE activities. With unyielding determination to grow into a company worthy of admiration, we will continue to press forward with our HSE activities.

Working Indigenous Communities
In Australia, our commitment to working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to build sustainable and mutually beneficial relationships is underpinned by our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP)*. In 2019, INPEX Australia launched its second Stretch RAP 2019-2022 following its first Stretch RAP launched in 2016.
In November 2018, the Ichthys Joint Venture agreed with the Larrakia people to a A$24 million benefits trust being delivered over 40 years. The agreement recognizes the important role that the Larrakia people have played in supporting the Ichthys LNG Proj- ect through the construction phase and highlights the continued importance of the relationship with the Larrakia people into the future. The funds are held in trust and distributed to provide the Larrakia people with a range of opportunities through economic, educational and social programs.
We are committed to promoting employment and business opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through our own ”Solid Pathways” program introduced in 2019 and working closely with Ichthys LNG Project contractors.

 EMPLOYEES
Our Policy
In order to constantly strengthen responsible management, INPEX as a global organization values workforce diversity and the devel- opment of global employees who share common values. To achieve this, the HR division formulated the INPEX HR VISION, which com- prises four key elements. HR activities based on these elements are implemented from a global perspective, linking employee develop- ment and team performance to contribute to a globally competitive organization.
*D&I-related message: https://www.inpex.co.jp/english/csr/employee/
Major Initiatives
Since 2014, INPEX has been carrying out activities to promote its corporate values, known as INPEX Values. Through company-wide surveys, INPEX collects nominations for “Values People” and “Values Teams” made up of executives, employees, contractors and teams who embody the INPEX Values and put the values into practice. The fourth survey, conducted in 2018, identified 749 Values People. In addition to interviews with those who receive the most votes, a selection of case studies compiled from a follow-up survey of Values People candidates on how they are considering and carrying out the INPEX Values in their daily lives, known as “Case studies of INPEX Values,” is also published on the intranet. Particularly outstanding cases will be presented with the “INPEX Values Award” as a way of further spreading the INPEX Values.
Targets and Results of Material Issues
In fiscal 2018, to further enhance diversity, one of the INPEX Val- ues, INPEX communicated its basic policy on diversity and inclusion (D&I)* to all stakeholders. In fiscal 2019, we conducted e-learning sessions on D&I for all executives and employees. Going forward, we plan to push ahead with D&I and improve capabilities across the organization to raise the general appeal of INPEX as a company and receive greater recognition from the global community.

  Interview with Outside Directors
  Jun Yanai Director (Outside)
   Question 1 As an outside director since 2016, what are your thoughts about the INPEX Board of Directors?
All members of the Board of Directors share the commitment to enhancing the corporate value of this company and engage in lively discussions where nothing is off limits. Over the years, new outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members with diverse backgrounds have been appointed to the board. As a result, questioning and counsel based on a broad range of per- spectives have further stimulated our dialogue.
Outside directors are not involved in the execution of the Company’s operations and are therefore not as well-versed in operational matters as the internal directors who take part in dis- cussions at executive committee meetings. Nevertheless, INPEX management personnel demonstrate a sincere willingness to listen to the opinions of outside directors and make every effort to incorporate viewpoints that are of benefit to the management
of the Company, and this encourages free and open discussion. Outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members are briefed regularly on agenda items a week before the Board of Directors meetings. These detailed briefings enable
the board discussions to proceed efficiently.
A survey to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Direc-
tors is conducted each year, and the survey’s results are careful- ly reviewed to further streamline and improve the board’s func- tions. This enables the governance of the Board of Directors to continuously evolve with a high level of transparency.
As we face the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we outside directors are committed to actively participating in the crisis management discussions and providing counsel based on our knowledge.
  Question 2 Vision 2040 and the Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022 were formulated in fiscal 2018. How do you evaluate their content and the progress being made to
implement these?
The Medium-term Business Plan 2018-2022 published in fiscal 2018 was formulated through proactive discussions between board members—including outside directors and audit & super- visory board members—addressing all options to enable INPEX to respond flexibly to any situation while anticipating changes in our business environment such as the advent of a low-carbon society. Today, after two years, the Ichthys LNG Project is making
good progress, but we are facing a new paradigm shift in our business environment, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price collapse. While staying true to the basic policies out- lined in the Medium-term Business Plan, we will work with man- agement personnel to find the best way to implement ambitious makeovers as part of our crisis response.
  Question 3 What future challenges do you see regarding the effectiveness of the INPEX Board of Directors?
Members of the INPEX Board of Directors have a diverse range of attributes. As such, I believe the annual evaluation of the effec- tiveness of the Board of Directors should continue to be centered around self-evaluation as practiced until now.
The most important factor contributing to the effectiveness
of the Board of Directors is an environment that enables outside directors to make open and frank recommendations to manage- ment personnel based on sufficient access to information. In this regard, I believe the INPEX Board of Directors is superior to that of other companies.
50 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12

   Atsuko Nishimura Director (Outside)
   Question 1 What were your impressions of the first Board of Directors meeting held overseas and the site visit in Darwin last year?
While visiting the Ichthys site, I was impressed to see the massive and complex Ichthys LNG Project—the first large-scale LNG project to be operated by INPEX—running smoothly based on a safety-first policy and solid management supported by a gifted workforce representing diverse backgrounds, including women, and advanced technical capabilities.
It was also extremely encouraging to witness the Prime Minister and cabinet ministers of the Australian federal govern- ment as well as the Chief Minister and ministers of the Northern
Territory government and others convey their genuine trust and expectations for INPEX, in addition to the tangible results of CSR activities as evidenced by the solid, long-term relationships INPEX has built with the indigenous Larrakia communities in the Darwin area. I was once again made aware that INPEX’s global development and outreach is supported in large part by the Company’s sincere willingness to build sound relations based on trust with the multitude of local stakeholders in areas where it does business.
 Outside Director Atsuko Nishimura in conversation with local employees in Darwin
Question 2 What future challenges do you see regarding the effectiveness of the INPEX Board of Directors?
  The INPEX Board of Directors has been working to improve its effectiveness in many ways including promoting diversity and ensuring greater access to information. In these challeng- ing times, I believe it is important for the Board of Directors to embrace and respond to the expectations of stakeholders by formulating management strategies reflecting the changes in
the energy business environment and ensuring the timely imple- mentation of these strategies, so that INPEX may appropriate- ly address key business issues including global economic uncer- tainty induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the oil price collapse and climate change.

 Corporate Governance
(As of March 25, 2020)
To achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term, the Company fulfills its social responsibilities in cooperation with its shareholders and other stakeholders and works to enhance its corporate governance for the purpose of conducting transparent, fair, timely and decisive decision making.
Overview of the Corporate Governance Structure
 INPEX has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board Member organization- al structure, under which Audit & Supervisory Board members audit the execution of operations, which are in turn carried out by directors well versed in their field. In addition, the Company has introduced an Execu- tive Officer System to pursue management with agility and efficiency. INPEX frequently engages in negotiations with the governments of oil-producing countries and overseas oil companies. This necessarily requires internal directors and executive officers who have knowledge, expertise and international experience relating to the Company’s busi- ness and both a sound knowledge of the Company and their particular field of expertise. Internal directors, in principle, hold the concurrent po- sition of executive officers. By adopting this concurrent organizational structure, the Company’s Board of Directors is better placed to execute operations in an efficient manner. At the same time, this structure helps to ensure effective operating oversight.
In addition to enhancing the transparency of management and bol- stering the ability of the Board of Directors to carry out its supervisory function, INPEX has appointed six of its 14-member Board of Directors from outside the Company. Through this initiative, steps have been tak- en to ensure that management issues are considered and deliberated with a greater degree of objectivity from an independent standpoint. Moreover, four of the Company's five Audit & Supervisory Board mem- bers are also appointed from external sources. In addition to putting in place an Audit & Supervisory Board, INPEX has set up the Audit &
Corporate Governance Framework
Supervisory Board Members’ Office and deployed dedicated staff and is reinforcing collaboration between Audit & Supervisory Board members and the Audit Unit, as well as independent auditors.

The responsibilities of the Board of Directors shall be to fully exercise its supervisory function, secure fairness and transparency in management, and ensure sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term through implementation of effective corporate governance, with recognition of its fiduciary responsibility to sharehold- ers.
The Company’s Board of Directors comprises 14 members, six of whom are outside directors. In addition to a monthly meeting, the Board of Directors meets as necessary to discuss and determine matters concerning management strategy and important business execution, and to supervise the execution of duties by directors. The term of office for directors is set at one year. In addition to enhancing the ability of directors to respond to changes in the Company’s global operating environment in a timely manner, this initiative helps to further clarify management responsibilities.
2 Executive Committee and Executive Officer System
From the perspective of increasing the speed of decision making relat- ed to the execution of business, we have established an Executive Committee. Meetings are held weekly and as necessary. At the Execu- tive Committee, flexible decision making is conducted for resolutions not affiliated with the Board of Directors, and deliberation is held to contribute to decision making by the Board of Directors.
We implemented an Executive Officer System to respond accurately and quickly to a rapidly changing management environment and the expansion of our business activities. The term of office for executive officers is set to one year, the same as for directors.
3 Formulation of Corporate Governance Guidelines
The mission of the Company is to contribute to the creation of a brighter future for society through our efforts to develop, produce and deliver energy in a sustainable way. Through our business, we aim to become an integrated energy company that contributes to the community and makes it more livable and prosperous. Based on this mission, to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term, the Company fulfills its social responsibilities in cooperation with its shareholders and other stakeholders, and works to enhance its corporate governance for the purpose of conducting transparent, fair, timely and decisive decision making.
In November 2015, the INPEX Group made clear its basic views and policies on corporate governance and, with the aim of ensuring trans- parency and fairness in the Company’s decision making, as well as real- izing effective corporate governance by carrying out the proactive dissemination of information, formulated its Corporate Governance Guidelines. Please refer to our Web site for details.

According to the stipulations of the Articles of Incorporation, INPEX is- sues a Class A Stock to the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. The Class A Stock does not possess voting rights at shareholders’ meetings. However, it is possible for the holder of the Class A Stock to exercise veto rights for certain major corporate decisions. We think the holding of Class A Stock by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will help prevent any incidence of unusual management, allow INPEX to stably supply energy as a core company for Japan’s oil & gas E&P and
ensure that the Company does not incur any negative impact from a speculative acquisition or an attempt at management control through foreign capital. On this basis, INPEX’s role is assured. Furthermore, we expect positive results in terms of external negotiation and credits as a national flagship company efficiently contributing to the stable supply of energy in Japan.

The Board of Directors decide on compensation for directors within the limits and terms approved at the general meeting of shareholders upon report by the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Commit- tee.
The compensation for directors (with the exception of outside directors) consists of three types: basic compensation, bonuses (perfor- mance-based compensation), and stock-based remuneration. In addi- tion, compensation for outside directors is limited to basic compensa- tion only.
Basic compensation is paid based on the duties of each director, and bonuses are paid based on the Company’s performance from the medi- um- to long-term perspective and other factors. As to the Stock-based remuneration, the Company’s shares, etc. will be delivered based on the position, etc. of each director and executive officer, aiming to raise the awareness of directors and executive officers towards increasing corporate value of the Company and further increase their willingness to contribute to maximizing shareholder value, by making clear linkage between the remuneration of directors and executive officers and the Company’s mid- to long-term stock price. In addition, based on a resolution passed on June 26, 2018 at the 12th Ordinary General Meet- ing of Shareholders, a stock-based remuneration system has been intro- duced for directors (excluding outside directors and non-residents of Japan) and executive officers. Compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board members consists solely of a basic compensation, which is deter- mined through consultation between the Audit & Supervisory Board members, within the limits and terms approved at the general meeting of shareholders.
6 Accounting Audit and Auditor Compensation
In accordance with the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, we accept accounting audits from Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC. The amount of auditor compensation is determined in total based on the audit plan and the number of auditing dates, after obtaining approval from the Audit & Supervisory Board.

 Monitoring of Management by Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
  1 Outside Directors
Regarding the appointment of outside directors, we believe that it is important to comprehensively consider a variety of factors. These factors include the validity of business decisions and consideration of their efficacy, professionalism and objectiveness in the oversight function in addition to the perspective of independence.
As corporate managers, academics or other specialists, our compa- ny’s six outside directors possess broad knowledge and many years of experience as managers in such fields as resource/energy industry, finance and legal matters. Also, three of the outside directors are shareholders of the Company and serve as advisors of companies that conduct business in the same field. Therefore, we recognize the impor- tance of paying special attention to the possibility of competition and other conflicts of interest. In response, we collect written pledges from outside directors to ensure conformance with the Companies Act when taking a proper response toward noncompetition, the prevention of in- formation leakage and the implementation of appropriate measures toward transactions with a conflict of interest. These written pledges are the same as those submitted by internal appointees.
2 Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
When appointing outside Audit & Supervisory Board members, we believe that it is important to comprehensively consider factors such as independence, efficacy in the oversight function and professionalism. Four of the Company’s five Audit & Supervisory Board members are appointed from external sources. Audit & Supervisory Board members possess a rich knowledge and experience in the Company’s business as well as in such fields as finance and accounting, which they use when performing auditing activities for the Company.
3 Independence of Outside Directors and
Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Company has reported all outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members as independent directors as defined by Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.
As a part of efforts to comply with the Corporate Governance Code, INPEX has formulated independence standards for outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members taking into consideration the independence standards and qualifications for independent directors issued by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Com- pany determines the independence of outside directors, including major shareholders and business partners that do not fall within the scope of these standards.
4 Audit & Supervisory Board and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Audit & Supervisory Board is composed of five Audit & Supervisory Board members, four of which come from outside.
In addition to attending meetings of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, the Audit & Supervisory Board members review the execution of business duties by directors and executive offi- cers through reports given by and hearings for related departments. Furthermore, the Audit & Supervisory Board members meet on regu- lar and as needed bases with the Independent Auditors, and receive reports from the Independent Auditors regarding audits. They also conduct regular meetings with the internal audit department (Audit Unit) to receive reports regarding internal audits and the evaluation of internal controls.
To strengthen the auditing function and ensure viable corporate governance, steps have been taken to set up the Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ Office and to deploy dedicated staff. In this manner, efforts are being made to promote collaboration along the aforemen- tioned terms between Audit & Supervisory Board members, the Audit Unit and the Independent Auditors. Moreover, we have constructed a system to strengthen the monitoring function through periodic meetings with representative directors and directors.

* Production volumes are calculated in accordance with SEC regu-
lations and include the equity-method affiliates. The production volume of crude oil and natural gas under the production sharing contracts entered into by the Group corresponds to the net eco- nomic take of the Group.
* The amounts in millions of yen and in thousands of U.S. dollars, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 and prior periods are rounded off. On the other hand, such amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 are rounded down and therefore the totals do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual account balances for the corresponding period.

 Background Information
 Oil and Gas Accounting Policies and Treatment
ACCOUNTING METHODS FOR TYPES OF AGREEMENTS
 The oil and gas business generates the bulk of consolidated net sales rev- enues for INPEX CORPORATION and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”). Two types of agreements govern the Group’s oil and gas opera- tions. One is production sharing contracts (the “PSCs”) and the other is concession agreements. The latter category also includes domestic mining rights, as well as overseas permits, licenses and lease agreements.
1. Production sharing contracts
Production sharing contract is an agreement by which one or several oil and gas development companies serve as contractors that undertake at their own expense exploration and development work on behalf of the governments of oil-producing countries or national oil companies and receive production from the projects as cost recovery and compensation.
Cost recovery and production sharing
The PSCs determine the allocation of oil and gas production among the host country’s government (or related entity) and the contractors such as the Group. The allocation formula generally differs according to the terms of the individual PSC. In the case of PSC for major projects currently in production, total production volume is allocated quarterly between two portions.
(1) “Cost recovery portion”: This is the oil and gas equivalent of costs incurred at the quarterly period under the PSCs with the governments of oil-producing countries. The equivalents are determined based on the current unit prices of crude oil and natural gas and allocated between the contractors alone. The quantity of oil and gas in the “cost recovery portion” decreases as unit prices increase, whereas that of the “equity portion” (explained below) rises.
If the actual production for the quarterly period is insufficient to cover the quantity of oil and gas equivalent calculated for the cost recovery portion, the latter is capped at actual production and any sur- plus amount is carried forward to the following quarterly period, as stipulated in the PSC.
(2) “Equity portion”: This is any residual production after the cost recov- ery portion has been allocated. It is allocated between the host coun- try’s government and the contractors based on agreed percentages.
The calculation of items in the income statement based on the above PSC-related considerations is as follows:
• The Group records as net sales its share of total sales relating to the oil
and gas production that is allocated to contractors under the PSCs.
• The Group books as cost of sales the portion of “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” that is recovered through the allocation of its
share of the “cost recovery portion.”
Production sharing contracts
Recoverable costs under the PSCs
Exploration costs
The share of recoverable exploration costs incurred by the Group under the terms of the relevant PSC is capitalized within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing.”
Development costs
The share of all development costs incurred by the Group that is recover- able under the terms of the relevant PSC is recorded within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing.”
Production costs
Any operating costs incurred during the production phase that are recov- erable under the relevant PSC are initially recorded within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing.”
Administrative expenses
Any administrative expenses that are recoverable under the relevant PSC are recorded within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing.”
As noted, in “Cost recovery and production sharing,” these costs are recovered either as capital or operating expenditures.
Non-recoverable costs under the PSCs
Acquisition costs
Costs relating to the acquisition of rights (recorded as intangible assets under “Exploration and development rights”) for any projects governed by the PSCs that are entirely in the exploration phase are expensed as incurred and amortized. Expenditures or costs relating to the acquisition of rights to projects already in the development or production phase are capitalized within “Exploration and development rights” and amortized based on the unit-of-production method. These amortization costs are recorded within “Depreciation and amortization.” Cost recovery provisions in the PSCs do not generally cover these expenditures.
2. Concession agreements
Concession agreement is an agreement or authorization (including mining rights awarded in Japan, as well as overseas permits, licenses and lease agreements) by which a government entity or a national oil company of the country directly awards mining rights to an oil company. The oil com- pany makes its own investment in exploration and development and has the right of disposition of the oil and gas it extracts. Revenues are returned to the host country in the form of royalties, taxes, etc., on sales. Acquisition costs
Costs relating to the acquisition of rights (recorded as intangible assets under “Mining rights”) for projects governed by concession agreements are treated in the same way as projects governed by the PSCs, as described above.
Exploration costs
The Group’s share of exploration costs is expensed as incurred.

 Development costs
The Group’s share of any development costs related to mining facilities is capitalized within tangible fixed assets. The depreciation of tangible fixed assets that are governed by concession agreements is computed primarily using the unit-of-production method for mining assets located outside Japan and the straight-line method for domestic facilities. These deprecia- tion expenses are recorded within the cost of sales.
Production costs
The Group’s share of operating costs that are incurred during the produc- tion phase is recorded within the cost of sales.
Administrative expenses
The Group’s share of administrative expenses is expensed as incurred.
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with Japanese GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the application of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the finan- cial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the previously esti- mated or assumed values.
Accounting estimates pursuant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are deemed critical if the degree of uncertainty asso- ciated with such estimates is high, or if rational changes to such estimates could exert a material impact on the financial condition or operating results. Critical accounting policies and estimates relating to the financial presentation are outlined below.
— Allowance for recoverable accounts under production sharing
Any expenditures made during the exploration, development and produc- tion phases of projects governed by the PSCs are capitalized within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” if they are recoverable under the relevant PSC. An allowance equal to exploration costs is record- ed within “Allowance for recoverable accounts under production sharing” to provide for potential losses from unsuccessful exploration. This allow- ance typically remains unchanged on the balance sheet until it exceeds the residual balance of exploration costs that previously had been capital- ized within “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” during the exploration phase. Reflecting the uncertainty associated with oil and gas projects, an allowance is recorded within “Allowance for recoverable accounts under production sharing” to provide for probable losses on development activities, as individually estimated for each project. Although assessments and accounting estimates are made on a reason- able basis, actual operating results can change depending on the project status.
— Unit-of-production method
Overseas mining facilities, mining rights and exploration and development rights that are acquired during the development and production phase are mainly depreciated or amortized based on the unit-of-production method. This approach requires the estimation of reserves. Although the Group believes that the assessment of reserves is done in an appropriate manner, any changes in these estimates could significantly affect future operating results.
— Asset retirement obligations
Asset retirement obligations are recorded by a reasonable estimate of the present value of retirement costs incurred upon termination of the opera- tion and production with respect to oil and gas production facilities, based on the oil and gas contracts or laws and regulations within the countries in which the Group operates or has working interests. Although the Group believes that such estimates of the present value of retirement costs are reasonable, changes to estimates of the present value of retirement costs which are caused by the factors such as changes to retirement plans, esca- lating prices of drilling equipment and materials and others could signifi- cantly affect future operating results.
— Allowance for investments in exploration companies
An allowance is recorded to provide for probable losses on investments made by the Group in entities engaged in oil and gas activities, as esti- mated based on the net assets of such entities. Although the Group believes that the assessments and estimates relating to such investments are reasonable, changes in actual production volumes, prices or foreign exchange rates could significantly affect future operating results.
— Provision for exploration projects
A provision for exploration projects is provided for future expenditures of consolidated subsidiaries at the exploration stage based on a schedule of investments in exploration. Although the Group believes that assessments relating to the schedule of investments are reasonable, changes to the schedule could significantly affect future operating results.
— Provision for loss on business
A provision for loss on business is provided for future potential loss on crude oil and natural gas development, production and sales business individually estimated for each project. Although assessments and accounting estimates are made on a reasonable basis, actual operating results can change depending on the business status.
— Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets reflect temporary differences (including net operating loss carry-forwards) arising mainly from the write-down of exploration expenditures, foreign taxes payable and excess of tax allowable deprecia- tion. Valuation allowances are provided once it is judged that the non-real- ization of deferred tax assets has become the more probable outcome. The effect of foreign tax credits is taken into account in the calculation of such valuation allowances. The realization of deferred tax assets is princi- pally dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income, based on the available information. Adjustments to deferred tax assets could be required if future taxable income was lower than expected due to market conditions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or poor operating perfor- mance.
— Retirement benefits to employees
Retirement benefit obligation to employees are recognized at the net present value of future obligations as of the end of the accounting period, taking into account any periodic benefit costs that have arisen during the period. The calculation of retirement benefit obligations and retirement benefit expenses is based on various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate, employee turnover and retirement rates, remuneration growth rates, and the long-term expected return on plan assets. Future operating results could be significantly affected by deviation between the base assumptions and actual results or the revision of such assumptions which were to generate actuarial gains or losses.
— Goodwill
The excess cost over underlying net assets excluding non-controlling interests as fair value as of their dates of acquisition is accounted for as goodwill and amortized over 20 years on a straight-line method.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The Company and its subsidiaries unified their fiscal year-ends to December 31, effective from the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries whose for- mer fiscal years ended on March 31 changed their year-ends to December 31. Due to this change, the year ended December 31, 2019 is a nine-month transition period. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the consolidated accounting period of the Company and its subsidiaries with provisional settlements of accounts is a nine- month period (April 1 - December 31, 2019), while the subsidiaries with December 31 fiscal year-ends remain unchanged (January 1 - December 31, 2019). Subsidiaries with December 31 fiscal year-ends which have a relatively large impact on the consolidated financial results formerly implemented provisional settlements of accounts on March 31.
Increases or decreases displayed hereinafter are based on the comparison to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, which is comprised of the nine-month results (April 1 - December 31, 2018) for the Company and subsidiaries with provisional settlements of accounts, and the twelve-month results (January 1 - December 31, 2018) for subsidiaries with December 31 fiscal year-ends.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, there was growing concern of a global economic slowdown due to prolonged U.S.-Chi- na trade disputes and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Although the Japanese economy showed signs of gradual recovery due to growth in consumer spending as well as improved corporate earnings and employment, uncertainty about the future grew as a result of a prolonged slugishness in exports and capital investment.
Of the international crude oil price indices, which significantly influence the financial performance of the INPEX Group, Brent crude (on a near-term closing price basis), considered a benchmark index for crude oil, started at US$69.01 per barrel on April 1, 2019. Although Brent temporarily rose to US$74.57 in late April following tightened US sanctions on Iran and other factors, the oil price dipped again due to concerns of a slowdown in the global economy owing to prolonged U.S.-China trade disputes and an increase in US oil inventories, falling to as low as US$56.23 in early August. The price
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
Net sales
Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by ¥199.8 billion, or 25.0%, to ¥1 trillion from ¥800.1 bil- lion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year due to an increase in sales volume, despite a decrease in crude oil price.
Compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, net sales of crude oil increased by ¥88.8 billion, or 13.2%, to ¥764.0 billion from ¥675.1 billion, and net sales of natural gas increased by ¥110.3 billion, or 97.8%, to ¥223.0 billion from ¥112.7 billion.
The sales volume of crude oil increased by 21,812 thousand bar- rels, or 25.6%, to 106,950 thousand barrels compared with the corre- sponding period of the previous fiscal year. The sales volume of natu- ral gas increased by 187 billion cubic feet (Bcf), or 118.6%, to 345 Bcf compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. Of this, the sales volume of overseas natural gas increased by 188 Bcf, or 186.6%, to 289 Bcf compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The sales volume of domestic natural gas decreased by 23 million m3, or 1.5%, to 1,507 million m3 (equivalent to 56 Bcf) compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The average sales price of overseas crude oil was US$65.61 per barrel, a decrease of US$5.95, or 8.3%, compared with
then surged at about that time on the back of mounting tensions in the Middle East caused by an assault on a Japanese oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz as well as an attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility that led to a temporary halt in production. However, as views spread that production could resume sooner than market expectations, Brent quickly returned to a downward trajectory. By the end of the year, expectations for progress in the U.S.-China trade talks and a decision by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to jointly expand production cuts led to a slight increase in the price, which ended the year at US$66.00 per barrel. In Japan, prices of crude oil and petroleum products correlated with the fluctuations in international crude oil prices. The INPEX Group’s average crude oil sales price for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected this shift and fell to US$65.61 per barrel, down US$5.95 from the corresponding period of the pre- vious fiscal year.
The foreign exchange market, another important factor that affects the business of our Group, began to trade at ¥111 level against the U.S. dollar. On April, Japanese Yen climbed to ¥112 level against the U.S. dollar due to the expectation of progress on US-Chi- na trade deal, followingly strong outcome on Current Employment Statistics (CES) of US and China Trade statistics. However, the yen appreciated to ¥105 level against the U.S. dollar due to increasing uncertainty after additional tariffs from US to China, followingly rate cuts by FOMC on July, September and October. Despite intensifying situation of Hong Kong protests, Japanese Yen rebounded to ¥109 level against the U.S. dollar with decreasing uncertainty of global economic outlook after withdrawal of additional tariffs from US to China on October.
Finally, at the end of this period, TTM closed at ¥109.55 against the U.S. dollar which turned out to be ¥1.46 higher than that on March 31, 2019. Reflecting these situations, the average exchange rate applied for sales transactions for our Group for the year ended December 31, 2019 was ¥108.84 against the U.S. dollar, which is ¥1.88 higher than that for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The average sales price of overseas natural gas was US$4.45 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), an increase of US$1.51, or 51.4%, compared with the cor- responding period of the previous fiscal year. The average sales price of domestic natural gas was ¥53.27 per m3, an increase of ¥1.62 per m3, or 3.1%, compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
The increase of ¥199.8 billion in net sales was mainly derived from the following factors: an increase in sales volume contributing ¥233.5 billion to the increase, a decrease in unit sales price pushing sales down of ¥19.5 billion, the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar pushing sales down of ¥14.8 billion, and an increase in net sales excluding crude oil and natural gas of ¥0.6 billion.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥97.8 billion, or 29.9%, to ¥424.7 billion from ¥326.8 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Exploration expenses
Exploration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥11.9 billion to ¥15.4 billion from ¥3.5 billion for the

Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥4.5 billion, or 10.0%, to ¥49.7 bil- lion from ¥45.2 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥0.5 billion, or 5.1%, to ¥11.4 billion from ¥10.8 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The Group records depreciation expenses for production facilities that are covered by concession agreements as cost of sales. In addition, under its accounting treatment of the PSCs, the Group records capital expenditures as “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” instead of capitalizing these costs within tangible fixed assets and depreciating them. Costs that are recovered in any given year based on the terms of the PSCs are included in the cost of sales.
Operating income
As a result of the above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥84.9 billion, or 20.5%, to ¥498.6 billion from ¥413.6 billion for the corresponding period of the previ- ous fiscal year.
Other income
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by ¥7.5 billion, or 14.4%, to ¥44.7 billion from ¥52.3 billion for the corre- sponding period of the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to the absence of compensation income.
Other expenses
Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by ¥6.9 billion, or 17.3%, to ¥33.1 billion from ¥40.0 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to a decrease in impairment loss.
Income taxes
Total current income taxes and deferred income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥21.9 billion, or 6.0%, to ¥385.7 billion from ¥363.7 billion for the corresponding period of the

  previous fiscal year. The Group pays the majority of its taxes outside Japan. In addition to the high corporate tax rates imposed in a num- ber of regions, the Group is generally unable to deduct expenses incurred in Japan for such taxes. Despite the positive effects attribut- able to the application of the foreign tax credit system, this situation resulted in a high effective income tax rate.

Current assets decreased by ¥37.9 billion, or 8.3%, to ¥419.8 billion from ¥457.7 billion due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and others. Fixed assets increased by ¥94.3 billion, or 2.2%, to ¥4,430.1 billion from ¥4,335.8 billion as of March 31, 2019, due to increases in intangible assets, investments and other assets and oth- ers.
Meanwhile, total liabilities increased by ¥16.8 billion, or 1.1%, to ¥1,552.8 billion from ¥1,535.9 billion as of March 31, 2019. Current liabilities increased by ¥29.4 billion, or 7.9%, to ¥401.4 billion from
INVESTMENT AND FUNDING
— Investments in upstream oil and gas projects
Continuous exploration for new reserves of crude oil and natural gas is essential for stable earnings of the Group. The information in this section on upstream oil and gas investments is based on the data reported by project operators relating to exploration expenditures, development expenditures and operating expenses. The Group’s expenditure categories are defined as follows:
• Exploration expenditures include the costs of exploratory drilling and any geological or geophysical studies. The costs of local per- sonnel and office operations and related administrative expenses are also included in this category if a project (or contract area) is in the exploration phase.
• Development expenditures include the costs of development drill- ing, any production facilities and acquisition of participating inter- ests.
• Operating expenses include the costs of well operations, mainte- nance and the supervision of production activities. This category also includes the administrative expenses for the project (or con- tract area) if it contains a field in active production.
ed December 31, 2019, decreased by ¥8.8 billion, or 89.7%, to ¥1.0 billion from ¥9.8 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Net income attributable to owners of parent
As a result of the above, net income attributable to owners of parent for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by ¥71.2 billion, or 136.1%, to ¥123.5 billion from ¥52.3 billion for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
¥372.0 billion as of March 31, 2019. Long-term liabilities decreased by ¥12.6 billion, or 1.1%, to ¥1,151.3 billion from ¥1,163.9 billion as of March 31, 2019.
Net assets increased by ¥39.5 billion, or 1.2%, to ¥3,297.1 billion from ¥3,257.5 billion as of March 31, 2019. Total shareholders’ equity increased by ¥84.9 billion, or 3.2%, to ¥2,722.7 billion from ¥2,637.8 billion as of March 31, 2019. Total accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by ¥50.6 billion, or 13.7%, to ¥317.9 billion from ¥368.6 billion as of March 31, 2019, and non-controlling interests increased by ¥5.2 billion, or 2.1%, to ¥256.4 billion from ¥251.1 bil- lion as of March 31, 2019.
• Discrepancies exist between the standards stipulated in U.S. FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, “Extractive Indus- tries – Oil and Gas (Topic 932),” and both the Group’s definitions of exploration and development expenditures and the standards used in preparing the following tables. The following is a partial list of the discrepancies between the Group’s accounting policies and Topic 932.
- Group expenditures relating to the PSC-governed joint ventures where the Group is not the operator are disclosed on a cash basis rather than an accrual basis as required by Topic 932.
- The tables below have been prepared based on the cost defini- tions used by operators in their reporting, which may not be con- sistent with Topic 932.
- Topic 932 requires that administrative costs not directly related to exploration and development activities be excluded from explora- tion and development expenditures, whereas such administrative costs are not necessarily excluded from those expenditures under the Group’s accounting policies.

  — Analysis of recoverable accounts under production sharing
For upstream projects governed by the PSCs, the Group’s share of costs arising during the exploration, development and production phases is capitalized under “Recoverable accounts under production sharing.” The following table shows the changes in the balance of “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” during the years ended March 31 and December 31, 2019.

568,059 ¥ (70,017)
        The amount posted as “Cost recovery – operating expenditures” in recoverable accounts under production sharing is greater than that posted as operating expenses. Along with operating expenses, this is because a portion of the exploration and development costs, which are incurred and recoverable within the year, is included in the “Cost recovery – operating expenditures” account.
Exploration costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ¥3.2 billion. This was mainly due to exploration expenditures in the Middle East & Africa region.
Development costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ¥27.0 billion. This was mainly due to development expenditures in the Asia & Oceania region and the Eurasia region.
— Funding sources and liquidity
Oil and gas exploration and development projects, as well as the construction of gas infrastructure, require significant funding. The Group relies on cash flow derived from internal reserves, together with external sources, to procure funds. The Group’s basic policy is to utilize internal cash flow and external equity financing to fund explo- ration projects and to utilize internal cash flow and external loans to fund development projects and the construction of gas infrastructure. The Group currently receives loans from the Japan Bank for Interna- tional Cooperation, Japanese commercial banks and others. The Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) guaran- tee system covers these loans. In addition, the Development Bank of Japan and various Japanese commercial banks provide loans for the construction of domestic gas infrastructure.
The Ichthys downstream entity (Ichthys LNG Pty Ltd, an equi- ty-method affiliate), as the borrower, has utilized external loans from export credit agencies and commercial banks for project financing and others throughout the year ended December 31, 2019.
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ¥13.0 billion. This was mainly due to operating expenses in the Eur- asia region.
Cost recovery for the year ended December 31, 2019, was ¥44.5 billion. This was mainly due to cost recovery in the Eurasia region.
In addition, other deduction was mainly due to the decrease in recoverable accounts under production sharing related to the busi- ness withdrawal from certain exploration blocks.
The allowance for recoverable accounts under production sharing as of December 31, 2019, decreased compared with March 31, 2019. This was mainly due to the business withdrawal from certain explora- tion blocks.
The Group’s basic liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient cash on hand at all times to fund expenditures for existing and new oil and gas projects in a timely manner, while also keeping a cushion of liquidity to provide for steep falls in oil and gas prices. In line with this policy, excess cash reserves are invested in low-risk, highly liquid financial instruments. The Group’s strategy is to improve capital effi- ciency over the long term through business expansion while continu- ing to maintain a sound financial position with sufficient liquidity.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
INPEX CORPORATION and Consolidated Subsidiaries
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
INPEX CORPORATION (the “Company”) is primarily engaged in the research, exploration, development and production of crude oil and natu- ral gas.
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries maintain their accounting records and prepare their financial statements in accordance with account- ing principles generally accepted in Japan.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been pre- pared by using the accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS or the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.
GAAP as adjusted for certain items.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been pre-
pared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which may differ in certain material respects from IFRS or U.S. GAAP, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements pre- pared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.
The Company has made certain reclassifications of the previous years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the presentation used for the year ended December 31, 2019.
  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in affiliates
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. Companies over which the Company exercises significant influ- ence in terms of their operating and financial policies are included in the consolidated financial statements on an equity basis. All significant inter- company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Fur- ther, certain companies that do not have significant impact on the consoli- dated financial statements, are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity-method.
The Company changed its consolidated fiscal year-end from March 31 to December 31 following the approval for the Partial Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 25, 2019. The purposes of this change are to streamline and strengthen financial reporting and management groupwide by unifying the accounting periods of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to December, and further enhance management transparency through the timely and accurate disclosure of financial and business-related informa- tion. As a result of this change, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 under review was a transitional period of nine months from April 1 to December 31, 2019. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the consolidated accounting period of the Company and certain subsidiaries with provisional settlements of accounts is a nine-month period (April 1 to December 31), while the subsidiaries with a December 31 fiscal year-end remain unchanged (January 1 to December 31). Subsidiaries with a December 31 fiscal year-end which have a relatively large impact on the consolidated financial results had previously implemented a provisional settlement of accounts on March 31.
The closing date of consolidated subsidiaries is now the same as the consolidated closing date.
The excess of cost over underlying net assets excluding non-controlling interests at fair value as of the date of acquisition is accounted for as goodwill and amortized over 20 years on a straight-line method.
(b) Cash equivalents
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents, including short-term time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
(c) Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. All revenues and expenses associated with foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing when such transactions were made. The resulting exchange gain or loss is credited or charged to income.
The assets and liability accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The revenue and expense accounts of the overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the average rates of exchange during the period. The compo- nents of net assets excluding non-controlling interests are translated at
their historical exchange rates. The differences arising from the translation are presented as translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
(d) Securities
In general, securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or other securities. Securities held by the Company and its subsidiaries are all classified as other securities. Other securities with a determinable market value are mainly stated at fair value with any changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Other securities without a determinable market value are stated at cost determined by the moving-average meth- od. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving-average method.
(e) Derivatives
Derivatives are stated at fair value.
(f) Inventories
Overseas inventories are carried mainly at cost, determined by the aver- age cost method (balance sheet value is carried at the lower of cost or market). Domestic inventories are carried mainly at cost, determined by the moving-average method (balance sheet value is carried at the lower of cost or market).
(g) Allowance for doubtful accounts
Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided at an amount determined based on the historical experience of bad debt with respect to ordinary receivables, plus an estimate of uncollectible amounts determined by ref- erence to specific doubtful receivables from customers experiencing finan- cial difficulties.
(h) Recoverable accounts under production sharing and related allowance
Cash investments made by the Company during exploration, development and production phases under a production sharing contract are recorded as “Recoverable accounts under production sharing” so long as they are recoverable under the terms of the relevant contract. When the Company receives crude oil and natural gas in accordance with the relevant contract, an amount corresponding to the purchase costs of the products (i.e., a cost recovery portion of the investments) is released from this account.
Because these investments are recoverable only where commercial oil or gas is discovered, an allowance for recoverable accounts under produc- tion sharing is provided for probable losses on investments made during the exploration stage under production sharing contracts arising from the failure to discover commercial oil and gas. In light of this uncertainty, an allowance for recoverable accounts under production sharing is provided for probable losses on development investment individually estimated for each project.
(i) Allowance for investments in exploration
Allowance for investments in exploration is provided for future potential losses on investments in exploration companies at an estimated amount

  based on the net assets of the investees.
(j) Tangible fixed assets (except leased assets)
Depreciation of overseas mining facilities is mainly computed by the unit-of-production method.
For other tangible fixed assets, the straight-line method of deprecia- tion is applied. The useful lives of fixed assets are based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
(k) Intangible assets (except leased assets)
Exploration and development rights at the exploration stage are fully amortized in the year such rights are acquired, and those at the produc- tion stage are amortized by the unit-of-production method.
Mining rights are amortized mainly by the unit-of-production method.
Other intangible assets are amortized mainly by the straight-line meth- od.
Capitalized computer software costs are amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years.
(l) Leased assets
Leased assets are amortized by the straight-line method over the lease period assuming no residual value.
(m) Accrued bonuses
Accrued bonuses to employees are provided at the expected payment amount for the fiscal year.
(n) Accrued bonuses to officers
Accrued bonuses to officers are provided at the expected payment amount for the fiscal year.
(o) Provision for loss on business
Provision for loss on business is provided for future potential losses on crude oil and natural gas development, production and sales business individually estimated for each project.
(p) Provision for exploration projects
Provision for exploration projects is provided for future expenditures of consolidated subsidiaries at the exploration stage based on a schedule of investments in exploration.
(q) Provision for stocks payment
Provision for stocks payment is provided to prepare for payments of stock benefits to directors and other under the share delivery rule. The amount is based on the expected stock benefit payable for the fiscal year.
(r) Accrued special repair and maintenance
Accrued special repair and maintenance are provided for planned major repair and maintenance activities on tanks in certain subsidiaries at amounts accumulated through the next activity.
3. U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS
(s) Accounting for retirement benefits
(Method of attributing expected retirement benefits to proper periods) When calculating retirement benefit obligations, the benefit formula method is used for attributing expected retirement benefits to periods through December 31, 2019. Because certain subsidiaries are classified as small enterprises, a simplified method (the amount which would be required to be paid if all active employees voluntarily terminated their employment as of the balance sheet date) is applied for the calculation of the retirement benefit obligation for those subsidiaries.
(Method of recognizing for actuarial differences)
Actuarial gains and losses are charged or credited to income as incurred.
(t) Asset retirement obligations
Asset retirement obligations are recorded by a reasonable estimate of the present value of retirement costs incurred upon termination of the opera- tion and production with respect to oil and gas production facilities, based on the oil and gas contracts or laws and regulations within the countries in which the Company operates or has working interests.
(u) Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses are charged to income as incurred.
(v) Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
(w) Standards issued but not effective
• “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement No.29, issued on March 30, 2018)
• “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Rec- ognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30, issued on March 30, 2018)
(Overview)
These are comprehensive accounting standard and guidance about reve- nue recognition. Revenue is recognized using the following five steps.
1. Identify the contracts with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract
5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
obligation
(Scheduled effective date)
The accounting standard and guidance are scheduled to take effect from the beginning of the year ending December 31, 2022.
(The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard and guid- ance)
The impact of the adoption of new accounting standard and guidance on consolidated financial statements is now under evaluation.
 The translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts is included solely for convenience, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at ¥109.55=US$1.00, the approximate exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. This translation should not be construed as a representation that yen have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at the above or any other rate.

 4. STATUS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(a) Policy regarding financial instruments
The Company raises funds for oil and gas development and production, construction or expansion of gas infrastructure primarily from cash flow on hand and from bank loans. Oil and gas development projects are primarily funded from long-term loans that the Company has secured from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japanese commercial banks and others. Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation has provided guarantees for the principal on certain outstanding amounts of the Com- pany’s long-term loans. The Development Bank of Japan and Japanese commercial banks and others have provided long-term loans for the con- struction or expansion of domestic gas infrastructure. The Company gen- erally borrows loans with variable interest rates, while some loans are with a fixed interest rate depending on the nature of each project.
Regarding the financing policy, the Company manages funds mainly from deposits and government bonds, which are considered to be of low- risk and high-liquidity. The Company limits the use of derivative transac- tions for managing risks of forecasted transactions and portfolio assets, and does not engage in speculative derivative transactions.
(b) Details of financial instruments, associated risks and risk management
(Credit risk related to trade receivables)
Trade receivables such as accounts receivable-trade and accounts receiv- able-other are comprised mainly from sales of crude oil and natural gas. Main trading partners are national oil companies, major oil companies and others. In line with the criteria for trading and credit exposure manage- ment, the Company properly analyzes the status of trading partners for early detection and reduction of default risks.
(Market price fluctuation risk related to securities)
For marketable securities and investment securities exposed to market price fluctuation risk, analysis of market values is regularly reported to the Executive Committee. For shares of stock, the Company mainly holds shares of trading partners and others to establish close and smooth rela- tionships for the purpose of maintaining a medium- to long-term stable business. A part of these shares are held for the purpose of investment.
5. SECURITIES
(a) Information regarding other securities as of March 31 and December 31, 2019 is as follows:
Securities with acquisition costs exceeding their carrying values
23,691
26,303
22,409
(Interest rate fluctuation risk related to short-term loans and long-term debt)
Loans are mainly used to fund oil and natural gas development projects and construction or expansion of domestic gas infrastructure and others. The borrowing period is determined considering the financial prospects of the project and useful lives of the facilities. Loans with variable interest rates are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk, however, the Company analyzes the impact of interest rate fluctuation at the time of borrowing and on an annual basis, and leverages fixed-rate-loans or interest rate swaps as necessary.
(Exchange rates fluctuation risk related to assets and liabilities in foreign currencies)
As most of the Company’s business is conducted overseas, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation risk due to a large portion of mon- etary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies such as cash and deposits, accounts receivables and loans required in overseas projects. For this reason, the Company endeavors to reduce exchange rate fluctuation risk by maintaining the position between assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. In addition to planned expenditures in foreign currencies, the Company manages exchange rate fluctuation risk through derivative trans- actions such as foreign exchange forwards and others as necessary.
(Management of derivative transactions)
For the above derivative transactions, the Company follows its internal rules. Market values of these derivatives are regularly reported to the Executive Committee, and the Company only transacts with financial insti- tutions with high credit ratings to reduce counterparty risks for the use of derivatives.
(Management of liquidity risk related to financing)
The finance and accounting division controls cash management based on a monthly financing plan prepared by each project division and secures sufficient liquidity on hand to prepare for liquidity risk.

However, requirements stipu- lated in the Articles of Incorporation need to be met in cases involving the exercise of the veto over the appointment or removal of directors, the dis- position of all or a portion of material assets, and business integration;
• Appointment or removal of Directors
• Disposition of all or a portion of material assets
• Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation relating to the Company’s
business objectives and granting voting rights to any shares other than

tion of the meeting of the Board of Directors in case where Class A stock is transferred to a non-public entity.
The Company conducted a stock split at a ratio of 1:400 of common stock with October 1, 2013 as the effective date, but for Class A stock, no stock split was conducted. The Articles of Incorporation specifies that divi- dends of Class A stock are equivalent to dividends of a common stock pri- or to the stock split. The cash dividends of Class A stock for the year end- ed December 31, 2019 amounted to ¥12,000.
Under the Companies Act of Japan, 10% of the amount to be distribut- ed as dividends from capital surplus (other than capital reserve) and retained earnings (other than legal reserve) should be transferred to capi- tal reserve and legal reserve, respectively, up to the point where total amount of capital reserve and legal reserve equals 25% of the common stock account.
Distributions can be made at any time by a resolution of the meeting of shareholders, or the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met, but neither capital reserve nor legal reserve is available for distributions.

  Diluted net income per share is not presented because there are no dilutive potential shares of common stock.
Net assets excluding non-controlling interests per share are computed based on the net assets excluding non-controlling interests and the number of
shares of common stock outstanding at the year end.
Cash dividends per share represent the cash dividends proposed by the Board of Directors together with the interim cash dividends paid.
Net income per share is computed based on the net income available for distribution to shareholders of common stock and the average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
For the purpose of computing net assets excluding non-controlling interests per share, the Company’s shares held by “the Board Incentive Plan Trust”* recorded as treasury stock under shareholders’ equity are included in the treasury stock to be deducted from the total number of shares issued at the end of the period. Additionally, in computing net income per share, above shares of the Company are included in the treasury stock to be deducted from the average number of shares during the period. The numbers of shares of treasury stock deducted from the total number of shares issued at the end of the period in computing net assets excluding non-controlling interests per share were 157,300 shares and 155,416 shares as of March 31 and December 31, 2019 respectively. The numbers of shares of treasury stock deducted from the average number of shares during the period in computing net income per share were 96,800 shares and 156,113 shares for the years ended March 31 and December 31, 2019 respectively.
*“The Board Incentive Plan Trust” is a share-based remuneration system under which a predetermined number of shares of the Company or the amount of money equivalent to the proceeds from the disposal of those shares are delivered or provided to the eligible Directors and Executive Officers of the Company according to their positions and other factors, covering the five calendar years from 2018 to 2023.

(Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt)
 The estimated fair value of current portion of long-term debt is calculated by the same method as long-term debt. For short-term borrowings, the rele- vant carrying value is used since the item is settled in a short periods of time and its fair value is almost the same as the carrying value.
(Long-term debt)
The estimated fair value of long-term debt is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of principal and interest. The discount rate is based on the assumed interest rate if a similar new loan is entered into.

Research and development expenses included in general and administrative expenses and cost of sales amounted to ¥579 million and ¥442 million ($4,034 thousand) for the years ended March 31 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
14. IMPAIRMENT LOSS
For the year ended March 31, 2019

(b) Asset retirement obligations other than those recognized in the consolidated balance sheet
Regarding domestic oil and gas production facilities and gas supply and marketing facilities, the Group has obligations to prevent mine pollution at aban- doned well sites after the completion of the production under Mine Safety Act and restore sites to their original condition at the time of business termina- tion in accordance with lease contracts.
Among these facilities, certain domestic oil and gas production facilities are operated complementarily and holistically in connection with the LNG ter- minal and it is impossible to determine the timing of decommission since it is difficult to formulate reasonable long-term production plan considering the balance between the production and the inflow of LNG at this time. The Group plans to operate domestic gas supply and marketing facilities permanently as highly public infrastructures for energy supply.
The Group also has obligations to decommission mines with respect to certain overseas oil production facilities. However, it is difficult to estimate retirement costs since the information about decommissioning work including the assets subject to the work based on the approval by the government of oil-producing country has not been specified yet.
Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the relevant asset retirement obligations reasonably and the Group does not recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet.

Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for designing and operating such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. The purpose of an audit of the consolidated financial statements is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control, but in making these risk assessments the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of INPEX CORPORATION and its consolidated subsidiaries as at December 31, 2019, and their consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the nine-month period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.

 Business Risks
 its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Group”). From the standpoint of information disclosure to investors and shareholders, we proactively disclose matters that are not necessarily the business risks but that can be considered to have important effects on the investment deci- sions of investors. The following discussion does not completely cover all business risks relating to the Group’s businesses.
Unless stated otherwise, forward-looking statements in the discussion are the judgment of the Group as of March 26, 2020 and are subject to change after such date due to various factors, including changes in social and economic circumstances.
1. CHARACTERISTICS OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS
 (1) Risk of failure in exploration, development or production
Payment of compensation is ordinarily necessary to acquire partici- pating interests. Also, surveying and exploratory drilling expenses (exploration expenses) become necessary at the time of explora- tion activities for the purpose of discovering resources. When resources are discovered, it is necessary to further invest in sub- stantial development expenses according to various conditions, including the size of the recoverable reserves, development costs and details of agreements with oil-producing countries (including gas-producing countries; hereinafter the same shall apply).
There is, however, no guarantee of discovering resources on a scale that makes development and production feasible. The prob- ability of such discoveries is considerably low despite various tech- nological advances in recent years, and even when resources are discovered the scale of the reserves does not necessarily make commercial production feasible. For this reason, the Group conser- vatively recognizes expenses related to exploration investment in our consolidated financial statements. The Group maintains finan- cial soundness by booking 100% as expenses in the case of con- cession agreements (including mining rights awarded in Japan as well as permits, licenses and leases awarded overseas) and by booking 100% of exploration project investment as allowances in the case of production sharing agreements. In addition, if there are impossibilities of recovery of investment in a development project, we also book the corresponding amount of investment in the development project as allowances while considering the recovery possibility of each project.
To increase recoverable reserve and production volumes, the Group plans to always take an interest in promising properties and plans to continue exploration investment. At the same time, we plan to invest in development projects, including the acquisition of interests in discovered undeveloped fields and producing fields, so as to maintain an overall balance between assets at the explora- tion, development, and production stages.
Although exploration and development (including the acquisi- tion of interests) are necessary to secure the reserves essential to the Group’s future sustainable business development, each type of investment involves technological and economic risks, and failed exploration or development could have an adverse effect on the results of the Group’s operations.
(2) Crude oil, condensate, LPG and natural gas reserves
1) Proved reserves
INPEX CORPORATION (the “Company”) commissioned DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an independent petroleum engineering con- sultant in the United States, to assess the main proved reserves of
the Group of which projects with a significant amount of future development investment might materially affect future perfor- mance. An assessment of other projects was undertaken by the Company. The definition of proved reserves is based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a), which is widely known among U.S. investors. Regardless of whether the deterministic approach or probabilistic approach is used in evaluation, proved oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, from the date of evaluation through to the expiration date of the agreement granting operating rights (or in the event of evidence with a rea- sonable certainty of agreement, extension through to the expira- tion of the projected extension period). For definition as “proved reserves,” operators must have a reasonable degree of certainty that the recovery of hydrocarbons has commenced or that the project will commence within an acceptable period of time. This definition is widely regarded as being conservative. Nevertheless, the strictness of the definition does not imply any guarantee of the production of total reserves during a future production period. In this context, when probabilistic methods are employed, there should be at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved reserves.
For further details on proved reserves of crude oil, condensate, LPG and natural gas held by the Group, including equity-method, affiliates accounted please see the section “Oil and Gas Reserves and Production Volume” on P. 100.
2) Possibility of changes in reserves
A reserve evaluation depends on the available geological and engineering data from oil and gas reservoirs, the maturity of devel- opment plans and a considerable number of assumptions, factors and variables including economic conditions as of the date such an estimate is made. Reserves may be revised in the future on the basis of geological and engineering data as well as development plans and information relating to changes in economic and other conditions made newly available through progress in production and operations. As a result, there is a possibility that reserves will be restated upwards or downwards. As to the reserves under a PSC, not only production, but also oil and gas prices, investments, recovery of investments due to contractual conditions and remu- neration fees may affect the economic entitlement. This may cause reserves to increase or decrease. In this way, the assessed value of reserves could fluctuate because of various data, assumptions and changes of definition.

 (3) In the oil and natural gas development business the period from exploration to sales is highly capital intensive and funds cannot be recovered for a long time
Considerable time and expense is required for exploration activi- ties. Even when promising resources are discovered through exploration, substantial expenses including production facility con- struction costs, and an extended period of time, are necessary at the development stage leading up to production. For this reason, a long period of 10 years or more is required from the time of exploration and development investment until the recovery of funds through production and sales. In particular, the large-scale LNG projects require a very large amount of investment, and the financing of these projects could be impacted by changes in the economic and financial environment. Following the discovery of resources, a delay in the development schedule or the loss of the economic viability of the properties during the development pro- cess leading up to production and the commencement of sales could have an adverse effect on the Group’s operational results. Such delays or losses may occur due to changes in the business environment including a delay in the acquisition or modification of government approvals, the occurrence of unanticipated problems related to geological conditions, fluctuations in the price of oil or gas, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or escalating prices of equipment and materials. In the case of LNG projects, such delays or losses may occur due to an inability to complete such procedur- al requirements as FID owing to the lack of any long-term contrac- tual agreement with prospective purchasers with respect to pro- duction.
(4) Operatorship
In the oil and natural gas development business, companies fre- quently form business partnerships for the purpose of the disper- sion of risk and financial burden. In such partnerships, one of the companies becomes the operator, which performs the actual work and bears the responsibility for operations on behalf of the part- ners. The companies other than the operator, as non-operators, participate in the business by providing a predetermined amount of funds and either carefully examining the exploration and devel- opment plan devised and implemented by the operator, or partici- pating in some operations.
The Group intends to actively pursue operator projects, focus- ing on the large-scale Ichthys LNG and other projects taking into consideration the effective application of business resources as well as the balance between operator and non-operator projects, based on the Group’s knowhow and technical capability, which has been acquired through considerable operational experience at each of the exploration, development and production stages. The Company has significant expertise as an operator in the develop- ment and production of crude oil and natural gas both in Japan and overseas as well as a wealth of know-how and knowledge accumulated over many years as a participant in LNG and other projects in such countries as Indonesia and Australia. In addition, we believe that by utilizing the services of specialized subcontrac- tors and highly experienced external consultants, a practice similar to foreign oil companies including the majors, it will be possible to execute business appropriately as an operator including LNG proj- ects.
Engaging in project coordination as an operator will contribute to the expansion of opportunities of block and acreage acquisition
through enhancement of technical capabilities and greater pres- ence in oil-producing countries and the industry. At the same time, there exist risks such as constraints on the recruitment of personnel who have specialized operational skills and an increase in financial burden. Inability to adequately cope with such risks could have an adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations.
(5) Project partners
In the oil and natural gas development business, as previously mentioned, several companies often engage in joint business for the purpose of dispersion of risk and financial burden. In such cas- es, the partners generally enter into a joint operating agreement among themselves to decide on the decision-making procedure for execution of the joint business, or to decide on an operator that conducts business on their behalf. A company that is a partner in one property in which the Group is engaged in joint business may become a competitor in the acquisition of other participating interests, even though the relationship with the partner may be good.
In undertaking the joint business, participants in principle bear a financial burden in proportion to their interest share. Any inability by a joint business partner to fulfill this financial burden may adversely affect the project.
(6) Disaster and accident risks
Oil and natural gas development entails the risk that operational accidents and disasters may occur in the process of exploration, development, production and transportation. Should such an acci- dent, disaster or other such incident occur, there is the risk that costs will be incurred, excluding compensation covered by insur- ance, due to facility damage, as well as the risk of a major accident or disaster involving loss of life. In addition, a cost burden for recovery or opportunity loss from the interruption of operations could occur. For the domestic natural gas business, the Company has continued to procure as source gas natural gas regasified from imported LNG since January 2010. Furthermore, the Company has procured imported LNG as source gas in connection with its Naoetsu LNG Terminal from August 2013. An inability to procure natural gas regasified from imported LNG and other imported gas as source gas due to troubles concerning suppliers or the Compa- ny’s Naoetsu LNG Terminal, or difficulty in pipeline operations due to accidents or trouble along the pipeline network, may interfere with the Company’s ability to supply to its customers. This could in turn have an adverse effect on the Company’s domestic natural gas business.
With regard to environmental problems, there is a possibility of soil contamination, air pollution, and freshwater and seawater pol- lution. The Group has established a “Health, Safety and Environ- ment Policy,” and as a matter of course abides by the environmen- tal laws, regulations, and standards of the countries in which we operate and give due consideration to the environment in the con- duct of business, based on our independent guidelines. In the event of an operating accident or disaster which impacts the envi- ronment, there is the possibility of incurring a response or cost burden for recovery from that incident, of incurring obligation of payment for procedural costs, compensation or other cost related to the start of civil, criminal or government procedures, or of incur- ring loss from the interruption of operations. Furthermore, in the event of changes to or the strengthening of the environmental laws, regulations, and standards (including support measures for
INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12 93
  INPEX Value Creation Management Strategies and Results Project Overview Sustainability and Governance Financial and Corporate Information

  the promotion of new, renewable energies) of the countries in which we operate, it may be necessary for the Group to devise additional measures with an associated cost burden and it could affect on the financial results of the Group.
Although the Group maintains accident insurance in the natural conduct of its operations, should such an accident or disaster be attributable to willful misconduct or negligence on the part of the Group, the occurrence of a cost burden could have an adverse effect on financial results. Also, such accident or trouble would result in receiving administrative punishment or result in damage to the Group’s credibility and reputation as an oil and natural gas development company, and could therefore have an adverse effect on future business activities.
(7) Climate Change Risk
In order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and amid growing interest in addressing global-scale climate change, efforts are being made to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are recognized as the cause of climate change and global warming worldwide. Pursuant to our position paper, Corporate Position on Climate Change, the INPEX Group is undertaking measures in specific areas such as corporate governance, business strategies, risk and opportunity assessments, the management of emissions,
and information disclosure in order to proactively reduce GHG emissions and participate in the transition to low carbon society to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in the event that individual countries strengthen national climate change policies to help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and/or there are changes or additions to environmental laws, regu- lations, and standards, the INPEX Group would be required to implement additional countermeasures and, in turn, incur cost bur- dens that could impact the Group’s performance.
(8) Risk in Relation to Mine Abandonment
The Group books in its accounts, as an asset retirement obligation, the estimated present value of costs related to mine abandonment that will become necessary after finishing operation and produc- tion in oil and gas production facilities and the like in accordance with agreements with the authorities of oil-producing countries, applicable laws and regulations and the like. If it is later found that the estimated present value of those costs falls short due to a change in the procedures used for mine abandonment, a rise in expenses for procuring drilling materials and equipment or any other reason, the Group will be required to increase the amount of that asset retirement obligation, which could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Group.
 2. EFFECTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN CRUDE OIL PRICES, NATURAL GAS PRICES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES ON FINANCIAL RESULTS
(1) Effects of fluctuations in crude oil prices and natural gas prices on financial results
A large percentage of crude oil prices and natural gas prices in overseas businesses are determined by international market condi- tions. In addition, those prices fluctuate significantly in response to the influence of a variety of factors including global or local supply and demand as well as trends and conditions in the global econo- my and financial markets. The vast majority of these factors are beyond the control of the Company. In this regard, INPEX is not in a position to accurately predict movements in future crude oil and natural gas prices. The Group’s sales and profits are subject to the effects of such price fluctuations. Such effects are highly complex and are caused by the following factors.
1) Although a majority of natural gas selling prices in overseas businesses are linked to crude oil prices, they are not in direct proportion to crude oil prices.
2) Because sales and profits are determined on the basis of crude oil prices and natural gas prices at the time sales are booked, actual crude oil transaction prices and the average oil price during the accounting period do not necessarily correspond. Since the natural gas business in Japan uses domestically pro-
duced natural gas and imported LNG as feedstock, changes in the market price for LNG have an effect on feedstock prices and sales prices. There is also the possibility that changes in the competitive environment associated with electric power and gas system reforms will have an effect on natural gas sales prices and sales volumes.
Also, should the recovery of an amount invested in a business asset held by the Group be no longer expected—due to a decrease in profitability associated with changes in the business
environment on the basis of changes in future market conditions— since the Group would reduce that business asset’s book value to reflect the level of recoverability and the amount of that reduction would be deemed impairment loss, there is the possibility that there could be an adverse effect on the Group’s results of opera- tions.
(2) The effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on financial results
As most of the Group’s business consists of E&P conducted over- seas, associated revenues (sales) and expenditures (costs) are denominated in foreign currencies (primarily in U.S. dollars), and profit and loss is subject to the effects of the foreign exchange market. In the event of appreciation in the value of the yen, yen-denominated sales and profits decrease. Conversely, in the event of depreciation in the value of the yen, yen-denominated sales and profits increase.
On the other hand, when borrowing necessary funds, the Com- pany borrows in foreign currencies. In the event of appreciation in the value of the yen, a foreign exchange gain on foreign-currency denominated borrowings is recorded as a result of fiscal year-end conversion; in the event of depreciation in the value of the yen, a foreign exchange loss is incurred. For this reason, the exchange risk associated with the above business is diminished and the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on profit and loss tends to be mitigated. Moreover, although the Company is taking measures to reduce a portion of the risks associated with movements in for- eign currency exchange rates, these measures by no means cover all possible risks. As a result, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates cannot be completely eliminated.
94 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12

 (3) The effect of fluctuations in interest rates on financial results
The Group raises some of the funds necessary for exploration and development operations through borrowing. Much of these bor- rowings are with variable-rates, long term borrowings based on the U.S. dollar six-month LIBOR rate. Accordingly, the Company’s
profits are subject to the influence of fluctuations in U.S. dollar interest rates. Furthermore, although the Group has devised meth- ods to reduce a portion of interest rate risk, these methods do not cover all risks of interest rate fluctuation incurred by our Group and do not entirely remove the effect of fluctuations in interest rates.
 3. OVERSEAS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND COUNTRY RISK
The Group engages in a large number of oil and natural gas devel- opment projects overseas. Because the Group’s business activities, including the acquisition of participating interests, are conducted on the basis of contracts with the governments of oil-producing countries and other entities, steps taken by oil-producing countries to further tighten controls applicable to home country natural resources, suspension of operation due to conflicts and other fac- tors, and other such changes in the political, economic, and social circumstances in such oil-producing countries or neighboring countries (including government involvement, stage of economic development, economic growth rate, capital reinvestment, resource allocation, restriction of economic activities by global community, government control of foreign exchange or foreign remittances, and the balance of international payments), the appli-
cation of OPEC production ceilings in OPEC member countries and changes in the legal system and taxation system of those countries (including the establishment or abolition of laws or regu- lations and changes in their interpretation or enforcement) as well as lawsuits could have a significant impact on the Group’s business or results unless the impact is compensated by insurance.
Additionally, against the background of rising development costs and other changes in the business environment, the progress of oil and gas projects, and the need to address environmental issues, the governments of oil-producing countries may seek to renegotiate the fiscal conditions including conditions of existing oil contracts related to participating interests. In the event that the fis- cal conditions of contracts were to be renegotiated, this could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business performance.
 4. DEPENDENCE ON SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR PROPERTIES
(1) Production volume
The Group engages in stable production of crude oil and natural gas in the Ichthys gas-condensate field (Australia), the on shore and offshore Abu Dhabi oil fields (United Arab Emirates), the Mina- mi Nagaoka Gas Field (Japan) and so on. The areas in which the Group operates are spread broadly throughout the Asia-Oceania regions (particularly Japan, Indonesia, and Australia), the Middle East and Africa, Eurasia including Caspian Sea area and the Ameri- cas. For fiscal 2019, however, the Middle East and Africa regions accounted for about 42% and the Asia and Oceania regions accounted for about 41% of the Group’s production volume, mak- ing up the vast majority of the Group’s operations.
Looking ahead, the Group will endeavor to further enhance the balance of its asset portfolio on a regional basis. However, the Group currently relies heavily on specific geographical areas and properties for its production volume, and the occurrence in these properties of an operational problem or difficulty could have an adverse effect on the Group’s operational results.
(2) Contract expiration dates in principal business areas
Expiration dates are customarily stipulated in the agreements related to participating interests, which are prerequisites for the Group’s overseas business activities. Should an agreement in which an expiration date is stipulated not be extended, re-extended or renewed, or should the terms and conditions be less favorable (including a reduction in the proportion of the Group’s interest) than those existing at the time of extension, re- extension or renewal, there could be an adverse effect on the Group’s results. INPEX Group policy to work with our business partners toward the
extension, re-extension or renewal of these agreements, should an existing agreement not be extended, re-extended or renewed as a result of agreement negotiations with the national petroleum com- pany of an oil-producing country, or in the event of agreement terms and conditions (including a reduction in the Group’s partici- pating interest) that are more disadvantageous than the situation at the time of the extension, re-extension or renewal, this could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business or results. Even should the agreements stipulating expiration dates be extended, re-extended or renewed, we anticipate that the remaining recover- able reserves at that time will have decreased due to production developments. Although the Group is striving to acquire interests that can substitute these properties, failure to acquire participating interests in oil and gas fields to fully substitute for these properties could have an adverse effect on the Group’s results. In addition, the period for exploration in oil and gas fields currently under exploration is fixed by contracts, and in the case of fields where oil and/or gas reserves are found that are deemed to be commercial- ized, and the Company is unable to decide on the transition to the development stage by the expiration of the current contract, efforts will be made through negotiations with the government of the oil- or gas-producing country in question to have the periods extended. However, there remains the possibility that such negoti- ations may not be successfully concluded, in which event the Company would be forced to withdraw from operations in the oil or gas field concerned. Also, as a rule, when there has been a major breach of contract on the part of one party, it is customary for the other party to have the right to cancel the agreement before the expiration date. The agreements for properties in these principal geographical business areas contain similar provisions.
INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12 95
  INPEX Value Creation Management Strategies and Results Project Overview Sustainability and Governance Financial and Corporate Information

  The Group has never experienced early cancellation of an agree- ment due to breach of contract, and we do not anticipate such an occurrence in the future. Nevertheless, a major breach of contract on the part of a party to an agreement could result in cancellation of an agreement before the expiration date.
And in the overseas natural gas development and production activities, in many cases we are selling and supplying gas based on
5. PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS
(1) Details of production sharing contracts
The Group has entered into production sharing contracts with countries including Indonesia and Caspian Sea area, and therefore holds numerous participating interests in those regions.
Production sharing contracts are agreements by which one or several oil companies serve as contractors that undertake at their own expense exploration and development work on behalf of the governments of oil-producing countries or national oil companies and receive production from the projects as cost recovery and compensation. That is to say, when exploration and development work results in the production of oil or natural gas, the contractors recover the exploration and development costs they incurred by means of a share in the production. The remaining production (crude oil and gas) is shared among the oil-producing country or national oil company and the contractors according to fixed alloca- tion ratios. (The contactors’ share of production after cost recovery is called “profit oil and gas.”) On the other hand, in cases when exploration fails and expected production is not realized, the con- tractors are not to recover their invested funds.
(2) Accounting treatment of production sharing contracts
When a company in the Group owns participating interests under
long-term sales and supply contracts in which expiration dates are stipulated. We plan to make efforts with partners to extend or re-extend the expiration date before the deadline stipulated in these contracts. Nevertheless, inability to extend the contracts, or the occurrence of cases in which extension is made but sales and supply volumes are reduced, could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business or results.
production sharing contracts, as mentioned above, in the role of contractor it invests technology and funds in the exploration and development of the property, recovers the invested costs from the production produced, and receives a share of the remaining pro- duction after recovery of invested costs as compensation.
Costs invested on the basis of production sharing contracts are recorded on the balance sheet as assets for which future recovery is anticipated under the item “Recoverable accounts under pro- duction sharing.” After the start of production, recovered costs on the basis of those agreements are deducted from this balance sheet item.
As production received under production sharing contracts is divided into the cost recovery portion and the compensation por- tion, the method of calculating cost of sales is also distinctive. That is to say, the full amount of production received is temporarily charged to cost of sales as the cost of received production, and subsequently the amount of the compensation portion is calculat- ed and this amount is booked as an adjustment item to cost of sales (“Free of charge production allocated”). Consequently, only the cost recovery portion of production after deduction of the compensation portion is booked as cost of sales.
  6. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT
(1) The Company’s relationship with the Japanese government
Although the government of Japan (the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) holds 18.96 of the Company’s common shares issued (excluding treasury shares) and a Class A Stock as of March 26, 2020, the Company autonomously exercises business judg- ment as a private corporation. There is no relationship of control, such as through the dispatch of officers or other means between the Company and the Japanese government. Moreover, we believe that no such relationship will develop in the future. Fur- thermore, there is no concurrent posting or secondment to the Company of officers or employees from the Japanese govern- ment.
(2) Ownership and sale of the Company’s shares by the Japanese government (the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry)
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) holds 18.96% of the Company’s common shares issued (excluding treasury shares). METI succeeded to the shares that had been held by
Japan National Oil Corporation (JNOC) following the dissolution of JNOC on April 1, 2005. With regard to the liquidation and dis- position of the oil and gas upstream assets owned by JNOC, the Policy Regarding the Disposal of Oil and Gas Development-Relat- ed Assets Held by Japan National Oil Corporation (hereinafter, the “Report”) was announced on March 18, 2003 by the Japan Nation- al Oil Corporation Asset Evaluation and Liquidation Deliberation Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, an advisory body of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The Report describes the importance of appropriate tim- ing in selling the shares on the market, taking into consideration enterprise value growth. In addition, METI may, in accordance with the Supplementary Provision Article 13 (1) 2 of the “Special Mea- sures Act for Reconstruction Finance Keeping After the Great East Japan Earthquake” (“the Reconstruction Finance Keeping Act“ (provisional translation, the same shall apply hereinafter)) enacted December 2, 2011, sell off the Company’s shares in Japan or over- seas after examining the possibility of disposal of the said shares based on a review of the holdings from the perspective of energy policy. This could have an impact on the market price of the Com-
96 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12

 pany’s shares.
METI also holds one share of the Company’s Class A Stock. As
the holder of a Class A Stock, METI possesses veto rights over cer-
tain resolutions of the Company’s general shareholders’ meetings and meetings of the Board of Directors. For details on the Class A Stock, please refer to “8. CLASS A STOCK” on P. 98.
 7. TREATMENT OF SHARES OF THE GROUP’S PROJECT COMPANY OWNED BY JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND JOGMEC
(1) Treatment of shares of the Group’s project company previously owned by Japan National Oil Corporation (JNOC)
In the aforementioned Report, INPEX CORPORATION (prior to the integration with Teikoku Oil; reorganized on October 1, 2008) was identified as a company that should comprise part of a core com- pany, and is expected to play a role in efficient realization of a sta- ble supply of energy for Japan through the involvement by a national flagship company. In response to the Report, the Compa- ny (also, the Group since our acquirement of Teikoku Oil on Octo- ber 1, 2008) has sought to promote efficient realization of a stable supply of energy for Japan while taking advantage of synergy with the efforts of active resource diplomacy on the part of the Japa- nese government, and has aimed to maximize shareholder value by engaging in highly transparent and efficient business opera- tions.
As a result, with regard to the integration by means of transfer of shares held by JNOC proposed in the Report, INPEX CORPO- RATION and JNOC concluded the Basic Agreement Concerning the Integration of Assets Held by JNOC into INPEX CORPORA- TION of February 5, 2004 (hereinafter the “Basic Agreement”) and a memorandum of understanding related to Basic Agreement (hereinafter “MOU”). On March 29, 2004, INPEX CORPORATION and JNOC entered into related contracts including the Basic Con- tract Concerning the Integration of Assets Held by JNOC into INPEX CORPORATION (hereinafter the “Basic Contract”), achiev- ing the agreement on the details including the treatment of the project companies subject to the integration and shareholding ratios.
The treatment of Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter “SODECO”), INPEX Masela, Ltd., INPEX North Caspi- an Sea, Ltd., INPEX North Makassar, Ltd. (liquidation proceedings completed on December 19, 2008), and INPEX Offshore North Campos, Ltd. (following the acquisition of all shares in this compa- ny by private-sector shareholders, including INPEX CORPORA- TION, this company was sold to a third-party in October 2019), was agreed between INPEX CORPORATION and JNOC in the MOU of February 5, 2004. Regarding the treatment of shares of SODECO, refer to the section “(2) Treatment of the shares of Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO) owned by the Japa- nese government” on P. 97. With regard to the transfer to INPEX CORPORATION of the shares in the above project companies oth- er than SODECO, it was decided that the shares are to be trans- ferred for cash compensation as soon as prerequisites such as the consent of the oil-producing country and joint venture partners and the possibility of appropriate asset evaluations are in place. However, the transfer of shares held by JNOC in the above com- panies has not been decided and the shares in the above project companies were succeeded to by the Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (hereinafter “JOGMEC”) on the dissolution
of JNOC on April 1, 2005, except shares related to INPEX North Makassar, Ltd., to which the Minister of Economy, Trade and Indus- try succeeded. JOGMEC states in its “medium-term objective” and “medium-term plan” that the shares succeeded to from JNOC will be disposed of at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner. However, the timing and manner of disposal for those shares in the above companies held by JOGMEC that have not been acquired by INPEX CORPORATION have not been decided, and it is possible that the Company will be unable to acquire these shares.
(2) Treatment of the shares of Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO) owned by the Japanese government
The Japanese government (the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) owns 50% of the shares of SODECO. SODECO was established in 1995 to engage in an oil and natural gas exploration and development project located on the northeast continental shelf off Sakhalin Island. SODECO owns a 30.0% interest in the Sakhalin-1 Project, of which ExxonMobil of the United States is the operator. In October 2005, Phase 1 of this project started with the goal of advanced production of oil and natural gas. Furthermore, there is a plan for additional development operations (Phase 2) for the purpose of the full-scale production of natural gas. The Com- pany holds 6.08% of SODECO shares issued and outstanding.
In the previously mentioned Report, SODECO, along with INPEX CORPORATION and JODCO, has been identified as a company that should comprise part of a core company in Japan’s oil and natural gas upstream industry in the future.
In accordance with the Report, it is assumed that private-sector shareholders, including INPEX CORPORATION, will acquire shares of SODECO issued and outstanding to which the Minister of Econ- omy, Trade and Industry succeeded and that were previously held by JNOC (50.0%). The Company plans to hold a maximum of 33% of the SODECO shares to become its largest shareholder. In the event that the consent of SODECO’s joint-venture partners, the relevant Russian government entity, or other parties is necessary for the acquisition of the shares, obtaining the consent is a prereq- uisite for acquisition. In addition, it will be necessary to reach agreement on the shareholder composition for SODECO, the share transfer price, and other matters.
In the event that the additional acquisition of the SODECO shares is realized, the Group will hold a substantial ownership interest in oil and natural gas assets in Russia, as well as in Asia and Oceania, the Middle East, Caspian Sea area, and other regions, and we expect the acquisition to contribute to the achievement of a more balanced overseas asset portfolio for the Group.
However, at this time it is undecided whether agreement con- cerning acquisition of the shares with the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry will be reached as anticipated and will be real-
INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12 97

  ized. Also, even in the event that the acquisition is realized, the conditions and time of acquisition are undecided and, depending on the result of review in accordance with the Reconstruction
8. CLASS A STOCK
(1) Overview of the classified share
1) Reason for the introduction
The Company was established as the holding company through a stock transfer between INPEX CORPORATION and Teikoku Oil Co., Ltd. on April 3, 2006. Along with this, a classified share origi- nally issued by INPEX CORPORATION (prior to the merger) was transferred and at the same time the Company issued a classified share with the same effect (hereinafter the “Class A Stock”) to the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. The classified share origi- nally issued by INPEX CORPORATION was the minimally required and a highly transparent measure to eliminate the possibility of management control by foreign capital while not unreasonably impeding the efficiency and flexibility of management based on the concept in the Report discussed in the above section 7. “TREATMENT OF SHARES OF THE GROUP’S PROJECT COMPA- NY OWNED BY JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND JOGMEC.” INPEX CORPORATION is identified as a company that should comprise part of a core company for Japan’s oil and gas upstream industry and is expected to play a role in efficient realization of a stable supply of energy for Japan as a national flagship company. On the basis of the concept of the Report, following a speculative acquisition or an attempt at management controlled by foreign capital, Class A Stock is designed and issued to be highly transpar- ent while not unreasonably impeding the efficiency and flexibility of management and to keep the effects of any such speculative acquisition to the necessary minimum. At the same time, Class A Stock maintains the Company’s role in the efficient implementation of a stable supply of energy for Japan as a core business, so that management is not conducted in a way contradictory to that role and no negative impact is felt.
2) Shareholders’ meeting resolutions, dividends, distribution of residual assets, and redemption
Unless otherwise provided by laws or ordinances, the Class A Stock does not have any voting rights at the Company’s general shareholders’ meetings. With regard to cash dividends paid and the distribution of residual assets, the Company concluded a stock split at a ratio of 1:400 of common stock with October 1, 2013, as the effective date. For Class A Stock (unlisted) no stock split was conducted. The Articles of Incorporation specify that dividends of Class A Stock are equivalent to dividends of a common stock prior to the stock split. The Class A Stock will be redeemed by resolu- tion of the Board of Directors of the Company if the holder of the Class A Stock requests redemption or if the Class A Stock is trans- ferred to a party other than the government of Japan or an inde- pendent administrative body that is fully funded by the govern- ment of Japan.
3) Veto rights in the Articles of Incorporation
The Articles of Incorporation of the Company provide that an approval resolution of the meeting of the holder of the Class A Stock is necessary in addition to resolutions of the Company’s gen- eral shareholders’ meetings and resolutions of meetings of the Board of Directors for the decisions on certain important matters
Finance Keeping Act, the acquisition by the Company could be unavailable.
such as the appointment or removal of Directors, disposition of material assets, changes to the Articles of Incorporation, business integration, capital reduction or company dissolution in connection with the business of the Company. Accordingly, the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, as the holder of the Class A Stock, has veto rights over these important matters. With regard to the cases in which the Class A Stock veto rights are exercisable, please refer to “4) Criteria for the exercise of veto rights provided in the criteria for the exercise of the Class A Stock holder’s voting rights”, below.
4) Criteria for the exercise of veto rights provided in the criteria for the exercise of the Class A Stock holder’s voting rights
Criteria concerning the exercise of the veto rights have been established in a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Notice (No. 37, 2019) (hereinafter the “Notice”). The criteria stipulate the exercise of veto rights only in the following specific cases.
• When resolutions pertaining to appointment or removal of Directors and integration are not voted down and it is judged that the probability is high that the Company will engage in management inconsistent with the role that a core company should perform for efficient realization of a stable supply of energy to Japan.
• With regard to decisions related to the disposal of all or part of significant assets, when resolutions pertaining to disposition of material assets are not voted down and the objects of disposi- tion are oil and natural gas exploration or production rights or rights similar thereto or shares or ownership interest in the Company’s subsidiary whose principal assets are said rights and it is judged that the probability is high that the Company will engage in management inconsistent with the role that a core company should perform for efficient realization of a stable sup- ply of energy to Japan.
• When resolutions pertaining to amendments to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation relating to changes in the Company’s business objectives, reduction in the amount of capital, or disso- lution are not voted down and it is judged that the probability is high that the Company will engage in management inconsistent with the role that a core company should perform for efficient realization of a stable supply of energy to Japan.
• When resolutions pertaining to amendments to the Articles of Incorporation granting voting rights to any shares other than the common shares of the Company are not voted down and could have an effect on the exercise of the voting rights of the Class A Stock.
It is provided that the above criteria shall not be limited in the event that the Notice is changed in the light of energy policy.
(2) Risk in connection with the Class A Stock
Following a speculative acquisition or an attempt at management controlled by foreign capital, Class A Stock is designed and issued to be highly transparent while not unreasonably impeding the effi-
 98 INPEX CORPORATION Annual Report 2019/12

 ciency and flexibility of management and to keep the effects of any such speculative acquisition to the necessary minimum. At the same time, Class A Stock maintains the Company’s role in the effi- cient implementation of a stable supply of energy for Japan as a core business, so that management is not conducted in a way con- tradictory to that role and no negative impact is felt. Nevertheless, the anticipated risks in connection with the Class A Stock include the following.
1) Possibility of conflict of interest between national policy and the Company and its common shareholders
It is conceivable that the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry could exercise the veto rights in accordance with the above criteria provided in the Notice. As the said criteria have been provided from the standpoint of efficient realization of a stable supply of energy to Japan, it is possible that the exercise of the veto rights by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry could conflict with the interest of other shareholders who hold the Company’s com- mon shares. Also, it is possible that the said criteria could be changed in the light of energy policy.
2) Impact of the exercise of veto rights on the price of
shares of common stock
As mentioned above, as the holder of the Class A Stock has the veto rights over certain important matters in connection with the business of the Company, the actual exercise of the veto rights over a certain matter could have an impact on the price of the Company’s shares of common stock.
3) Impact on the Company’s degree of freedom in business and business judgment
As the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry holds the Class A Stock with the previously mentioned veto rights, the Company needs a resolution of the meeting of the holder of the Class A Stock concerning the above matters. For this reason, the Compa- ny’s degree of freedom in management in those matters could be restricted by the judgment of the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. Also, attendant on the need for a resolution of the meet- ing of the holder of the Class A Stock concerning the above mat- ters, a certain period of time is required for procedures such as the convening and holding of meetings and resolutions and for the processing of formal objections, if necessary.
 9. CONCURRENTLY SERVING OUTSIDE DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors of the Company is currently composed of 14 members, six of whom are outside directors.
Four of the six outside directors have many years’ experience and knowledge of the Company’s business and are able to offer objective, professional advice regarding operations. For this rea- son, they were asked to join the Board of Directors to contribute to the development of the Company’s business. Three of the directors concurrently serve as director or advisors of Japan Petro- leum Exploration Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co., Ltd. and JXTG Holdings, Inc. (hereinafter “share- holder corporations”), respectively.
At the same time, however, the shareholder corporations are involved in businesses that overlap with those of the Company. The Company therefore recognizes that it must pay particular attention to corporate governance to avoid conflicts of interest in connection with competition and other matters.
To this end, all Company directors, including the three outside
directors described above, are required to sign a written undertak- ing to carry out their duties as officers of the Company appropri- ately and with the highest regard for the importance of such mat- ters as their obligations in connection with noncompetitive practices under the Japanese Companies Act, the proper manner for dealing with conflict of interest, and confidentiality.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and their changes relating to proved oil and gas
reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019
Disclosure contents for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and their changes relating to proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019 are determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the FASB, and are presented in accordance with Topic 932.
In calculating the standardized measure of discounted future cash inflows, the arithmetic average of oil and gas prices at the first day of each month during the current fiscal year is applied to the estimated annual future production from proved reserves. Future development and production costs are estimated based upon the assumptions of
constant oil and gas prices and the continuation of existing econom- ic, operating and regulatory conditions. Future income tax expenses are calculated by applying the year-end statutory tax rates to estimat- ed future pretax cash flows less the tax basis of the properties involved based upon laws and regulations already legislated at year- end. The discount is computed by applying a prescribed discount rate of 10% to the estimated future net cash flows.
The translation of U.S. dollar amounts into yen amounts is com- puted by applying the year-end exchange rates (TTM) of ¥111.01 and ¥109.55 to the U.S. dollar as of March 31, 2019 and December 31,

 2019, respectively.
Since these figures are calculated in accordance with the rules set
forth by the FASB, which have the following aspects, they do not rep- resent the fair market value nor the Group’s estimation for the present value of the cash flows of reserves of crude oil, condensate, LPG and
natural gas.
• No economic value is attributed to potential reserves.
• A prescribed discount rate of 10% is applied.
• Oil and gas prices are subject to constant fluctuations despite the
assumptions of constant oil and gas prices of Topic 932.

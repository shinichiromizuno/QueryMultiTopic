Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
We endeavor to eliminate process accidents through initiatives that ensure that our facilities are safe and secure. We also undertake activities to minimize damage in the event of large earth- quakes. In fiscal 2018, we focused on reducing risks to eliminate process accidents, improving safety at certified high-pressure gas sites, and implementing earthquake and tsunami measures.
Efforts to reduce risks to eliminate process accidents focus on comprehensively identifying risks, emphasizing employee education, sharing
internal and external accident cases, providing proposals on close-calls, and harnessing new technical knowledge. We also address identified risks by systematically formulating drastic mea- sures and thereby building business sites that are impervious to accidents.
For certified high-pressure gas sites, we obtain regular assessments from the Japan Safety Com- petency Center, undertaking ongoing efforts to enhance safety at these facilities in light of find- ings from such evaluations.
Earthquake and tsunami measures encom- pass enhancing responsiveness by formulating and executing emergency plans. We also respond to the Industrial Process Safety Action Plan of the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association.

Measures to Prevent Occupational Accidents
Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven cor- porate culture, encompassing eight elements. These are organizational governance, positive involvement, resource management, work man- agement, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual under- standing. We are examining existing activities
in light of these elements, and are stepping up efforts to tackle and overcome weak areas.
Eliminating Major Disasters
We have undertaken a range of activities to pre- vent occupational accidents. In fiscal 2018, we initiated efforts that centered on eliminating major incidents. We conduct risk assessments of work in which people might fall, be caught or entangled in machinery, or come into contact with hazard- ous materials. We implement systematic risk reduction measures and endeavor to make oper- ations inherently safe.
We investigate the causes of all incidents regardless of whether they result in lost time, striving to prevent similar incidents by assessing and rolling out measures.

      Business Strategies for Fiscal 2019
The chemicals industry experienced adversity
as the result of a deteriorating demand–supply balance, owing to new competition from players in China and emerging nations, and massive facilities upgrades. Although markets have recovered
backdrop that we have cut caprolactam costs since the previous medium-term management
plan by positioning caprolactam as a raw material for nylon while upgrading facilities for nylon extru- sion applications—one of our strengths—to expand sales. These efforts have begun to bear fruit. We will continue to stably supply differentiated nylon and synthetic rubber products that leverage our strengths, including joint product development with customers. At the same time, we will expand extensively in specialty chemicals, where we can draw on such proprietary technologies as separa- tors and polyimide, to drive the Group’s growth. As for new business and R&D, we will focus on nurturing future growth drivers based on a clear policy and direction.

SWOT AnalysisStrengths
• Our product range is extensive, encompassing such basic chemicals businesses as our core lactam-nylon chains and synthetic rubber and such specialty chemicals businesses as specialty products, high-performance coatings, and battery materials.
• We integrate diverse materials and technologies to supply differenti- ated products and services worldwide.
• We have the technology and manufacturing capabilities to meet sophisticated customer needs as a trusted joint development partner, and to provide solutions to customers.
 Weaknesses
• Because our business emits a considerable amount of greenhouse gases, we are exposed to regulatory risks, such as environmental taxes. Countermeasures: We will provide products and technologies that help reduce greenhouse gases in the supply chain while reducing the UBE Group’s overall emissions.Opportunities Threats
• We anticipate favorable market expansion for functional products, high-performance coatings, and nylon.
• We forecast strong electric and hybrid vehicle demand and growing markets for coated separators.
• We are expecting business opportunities for environmentally friendly products for new battery materials, EVs, lighter mobility, and fuel economy improvements.
• Intensifying price competition from market entries of players in middle-income countries
Countermeasures: We will extensively cut costs to improve our competitive position and ally with other companies.
• Shorter product lifespans and swifter changes in the external environment Countermeasures: We will anticipate customer needs by providing joint product development and other solutions, and create new applications.
  building closer relationships with customers from global perspectives. In the fine chemicals business, we will step up overseas development of our C1 chemicals business, which is a competitive strength. For the high-performance coatings business, we will progress as a solutions provider while expand- ing in volume zones around Asia and North and Central America.
In the synthetic rubber business, we will pursue joint product development with customers and swiftly supply high-value-added products by cater- ing to customer needs. At the same time, we will reinforce production capacity, particularly in high- value-added offerings, and will push forward in exploring a fifth production site.
In January 2019, we completed the transfer of our separator business, from base to coated films, to UBE Maxell Co., Ltd. We will fully realize benefits from integration and enhance cost competitiveness while stabilizing the supply system for tomorrow’s businesses.
For the polyimide business, we will stably expand revenues and reform the business struc- ture by fully operating existing facilities and expanding capacity. In separation membranes, we will reinforce the competitiveness of mainstay nitro- gen membranes and expand market share in the mobility field.
ESG-Related Initiatives
Platform Businesses
We will cut costs further at production units in Japan, Thailand, and Spain that underpin our caprolactam business, a raw material for nylon.
In industrial chemicals, we will establish a dominant position in the domestic ammonia industry and explore global development opportunities.
In the pharmaceutical business, we will set up a research structure for nucleic acid drugs and will reinforce our development, production, and sales framework for fluorine materials. We will restructure the Ube Factory to establish a multi-product, small-lot production setup.
Developing Fields
For the Tyranno Fiber® business, we will develop ceramic matrix composite fibers for civil aircraft engines and mass production technologies, estab- lishing these offerings as competitively superior next-generation sintered fibers.
R&D
We will swiftly create new businesses in the envi- ronment and energy, mobility, construction and infrastructure, and healthcare domains, and bolster development pipeline themes.
     • We will supply products that lower environmental impact and contribute to society. Such offerings include environmentally friendly high-performance coating materials, synthetic rubber and nylon that improves the fuel economy and lowers the weight of automo- biles, battery materials for electric and hybrid vehicles, separation membranes for fuel cell vehicles, and Tyranno Fiber®, which helps enhance aircraft engine fuel economy.
• We will create new businesses to serve a low-carbon society and engage in R&D and verification tests that help reduce CO2 emis- sions and usage.

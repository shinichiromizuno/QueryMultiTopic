We endeavor to safeguard the environment and comply with levels set through agreements with government bodies or with voluntary stan- dards by constantly stabilizing plant operations and by extensively controlling air and water emissions of pollutants. We also undertake ongoing environmental impact reduction activi- ties. Each plant manages water consumption
and discharges to ensure effective usage of this resource.
We will continue to engage in business activities that contribute to a recycling-based economy as part of environmental management, such as by preventing global warming, reducing and recycling industrial waste, and lowering chemical substance emissions.

*1 Sulfur oxides (SOx) originate in the sulfur (S) component of fuels. Boilers are our main source of these oxides.
*2 Nitrogen oxides (NOx) stem from fuel combustion, primarily from Group boilers and cement kilns.
*3 Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) Law: This legislation requires companies to identify business site chemical substance emissions and transfer volumes and report to
the government. The Ministry of the Environment discloses the submitted information on its website. Such disclosure is designed to encourage voluntary efforts to improve chemical
substance management.
*4 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): This is an indicator of water pollution by organic substances and represents the amount of oxygen consumed in the chemical oxidation of organic

 Addressing Environmental Issues / Biodiversity
Preventing Global Warming
Policy on Addressing Global Warming
The UBE Group contributes to sustainable economic development by cutting greenhouse gas emissions and by creating and expanding technologies and products that help lower environmental impact.
Medium-Term Management Plan: Helping Tackle Resource, Energy, and Environmental Issues We will undertake initiatives based on the following three key policies:
(1) Attain fiscal 2021 goals and formulate new targets toward 2030
The UBE Group’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for fiscal 2021: Domestic and key Group business sites overseas seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% from the fiscal 2005 level by fiscal 2021.
(2) Lower environmental impact across the supply chain
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using less energy and recycling more waste
(3) Create and expand new technologies and products that help reduce environmental impact
We look for such products and technologies to represent at least 30% of net sales by fiscal 2021.

Forest Conservation Initiatives
  In fiscal 2018, 107 employ- ees took part in the 11th Forest Creation Experiential Activity for Water Conserva- tion. The Mine City Office
of Yamaguchi Prefecture’s Agriculture, Forestry & Fish- eries Department sponsors this annual initiative. The employees thinned and logged around two hectares of bamboo.

 Using Resources Effectively
Our cement factories recycle diverse waste and by-products as raw materials (material recycling) and alternative fuels (thermal recycling). Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possible to use ash from incineration as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.
In fiscal 2018, our three cement factories harnessed 3.34 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.96 million metric tons of which we sourced externally, contributing considerably to
a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new businesses to use waste materials in applications other than as mate- rials for cement. In fiscal 2017, for example, we began recycling plasterboard, for which we expect demand to increase. We will continue to boost
our capacity for handling various waste as part
of efforts to expand our recycling business.
Please see Non-Financial Highlights on page 11 for details of our usage of waste substances and by-products.

Reducing Industrial Waste
and Chemical Substance Emissions
Industrial Waste Reductions
The Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) Volun- tary Action Plan on the Environment targets a 70% reduction in the final disposal volume of industrial waste from the fiscal 2000 level by fiscal 2020.
We strive through industry-led initiatives to recycle industrial waste and reduce final disposal waste to contribute to a recycling-based economy.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2018, we lowered such waste by 85% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeavor- ing to cut volumes from fiscal 2019.
Reducing Chemical Substance Emissions
The Japanese government is driving efforts to cut chemical substance emissions through a combina- tion of legislation and voluntary initiatives. Voluntary efforts include industry initiatives to constrain emis- sions of VOCs*1 and a system to disclose sub- stances based on the PRTR Law*2.
In terms of the UBE Group’s activities, 20 sub- stances*3, which it emits in relatively large amounts, were voluntarily selected from substances subject to the PRTR Law as well as VOCs. We will focus on the Group’s emissions of these substances and strive to reduce them.
Minimizing VOC Emissions
The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2018 were 33% lower than those in fiscal 2010.
Reducing PRTR Substances
We handle 68 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2018 were down 28% from fiscal 2010.

Page 7 of the 2019 Integrated Report Supplementary Infor- mation (Environment and Safety) presents emissions and transfer volumes and other data on the top 10 sub- stances in terms of emissions volume.

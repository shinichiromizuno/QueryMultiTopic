Pursuing Further Growth while Solidifying Our Underpinnings
I recently became president and CEO, embarking on a range of changes for the UBE Group since the start of fiscal 2019.
We have updated our business principles and management policies. We have also rolled out a new medium-term management plan, reorganized into a three-company operating structure, and adopted a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee setup.
Our reforms have essentially balanced growth ambitions while solidifying our foundations. Under our plan, we seek to become a growth-centric entity that steadily delivers results to stakehold- ers. Safety first is our shared values, and we will do our best to occupational, environmental, and facilities incidents, establishing our foundations for expansion by strengthening governance and internal controls. I recognize that it is vital for
me to ensure that we can pursue further growth while solidifying our underpinnings.
Updating Our Business Principles and Management Policies
Ensuring that Our Founding Spirit Keeps Meeting Contemporary Challenges
Since our establishment more than 120 years ago, our business principles have focused on coexis- tence and mutual prosperity for all stakeholders, including regional communities, and the notion
of shifting from finite mining to infinite industry because we knew that we could not rely forever on an exhaustible resource like coal.
We have updated our corporate philosophy statement to express our raison d’etre, which is
to pursue technology and embrace innovation to create value for the future and contribute to social progress. We formulated management principles regarding ethics, safety and security, quality, and people (please see page 1 for details) in recognition that best practices are operational essentials. A guiding factor in establishing these management principles was our deep reflection on inappropriate quality inspection practices last year, and it is a major management priority to ensure Groupwide awareness of the need to prevent recurrences.
Reflections on Change & Challenge 2018 Medium-Term Management Plan
Steadily Solidifying Underlying Strengths
to Fully Revitalize
the Chemicals Business Performance
The table on the left presents our progress with respect to our original performance targets over the past three years. In fiscal 2017, conditions in the chemicals business were particularly favorable, enabling us to greatly exceed our target. In fiscal 2018, the final year of Change & Challenge 2018, earnings were less than envisaged owing to a

decrease in earnings due to regular ammonia facili- ties repairs in the Ube area, the absence of such extraordinary factors as a temporary expansion of synthetic rubber spreads in fiscal 2017, and the impact of higher coal prices. Nonetheless, I think we basically achieved our goals for the three years.
Under our previous two medium-term manage- ment plans, our ongoing focus was on driving an earnings turnaround in the chemicals business. In fiscal 2018, that business generated ¥23.7 billion in operating profit, against our original target of ¥20 billion. A favorable operating environment con- tributed partly to that result, so we cannot claim that our performance in that business was solely the outcome of a full resurgence. Nonetheless, we can say that being able to translate good condi- tions into profits demonstrated ample fundamental strengths toward achieving such a resurgence.
Key Results and Issues
In the chemicals business, battery materials opera- tions centered on separators expanded as planned in fiscal 2018. Other major achievements were the stabilization of caprolactam and nylon as a chain and the return of polyimide, once a central func- tional material, as a prime earnings driver. In the machinery business, the integration of our injection molding machine business with that of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., was an important move. Following integration, we sold models under a uniform brand and progressed in establishing an optimal global production system, forming the basis for growth.
In contrast, the construction materials business

Reorganizing into a Three-Company Operating Structure
Bringing Together Compatible Businesses in Making Internal Controls More Effective
To date, we have maintained three internal companies—Chemicals, Construction Materials, and Machinery—and the Pharmaceutical and Energy & Environment businesses. In fiscal 2019, we integrated those two businesses into relevant areas of the Chemicals and Construction Materials companies. We thus now have a three-company operating structure. Because much of its output
is for the chemicals area, we made the Corporate Research & Development unit part of the Chemicals Company.
The purpose was to become more flexible in expansionary and defensive respects. In defensive terms, reorganizing enables us to more effectively allocate operational resources to enhance internal controls. All three companies have already put sys- tems in place to focus on environmental safety and quality assurance. On the expansionary front, hav- ing these companies function more autonomously should help us to accelerate decision making.

 did not benefit as much as originally envisaged from demand growth associated with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and a surge in coal costs drove higher expenses. Although raw materials costs increased, we were unable to raise prices in a cement business requiring reinvest- ments, and this is still a challenge for us.
Our new medium-term management plan incorporates
a three-year action plan for driving growth
toward and well beyond 2025.

Launching Our New Medium-Term Management Plan
Vision UBE 2025 Prime Phase
About Our New Medium-Term
Management Plan
This plan (please see pages 6–7 for details) first describes our vision for continuing to create value for all stakeholders by 2025 and also incorporates a three-year action plan for driving growth toward and well beyond 2025.
Direction for Each Business
The chemicals business is central to the UBE Group’s growth. There, we simultaneously tar- get stability in basic chemicals operations and growth in specialty chemicals. The basic chemi- cals business focuses on caprolactam and syn- thetic rubber, so it is susceptible to large profit swings owing to market conditions. We will therefore strive to stabilize earnings by cutting costs and differentiating our offerings, making basic chemicals a bedrock of our chemicals operations. We will additionally pursue further expansion in such specialty chemicals fields as functional and fine chemicals, thus enhancing the overall profitability of the chemicals busi- ness. Key areas are separators and other bat- tery materials, high-performance coatings, and polyimides. In basic chemicals, we will pursue expansion in nylon and synthetic rubber.
Although markets for the construction materials business are maturing, demand should drop only moderately after the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We will
therefore continue to generate stable cash flows while focusing on areas offering growth poten- tial, such as biomass and resource recycling, with earnings expanding steadily.
Globalization and services are keys to the future of the machinery business. We believe that the previously mentioned integration of our injection molding machine business with that of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and services busi- ness expansion overseas should enhance our profitability (please see pages 32–37 for details).
Please see pages 6–7 for details on Vision UBE 2025—Prime Phase— New Medium-Term Management Plan.
Tackling Environmental Issues
We developed our businesses by drawing on coal as a key energy source. Our operations thus consume considerable energy, and we recognize the importance of tackling environmental issues.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions come from energy and processes. Processes related to cement and ammonia production represent half

of our total CO2 emissions. The truth is that as long as we do business it will be challenging to do much about CO2 emissions from processes. There is room, however, to reduce CO2 emis- sions from energy by conserving energy and enhancing efficiency, and we will do our best to achieve reductions. We will also strive to expand our eco businesses, transforming challenges in that area into new opportunities (please see pages 28–29 for details).
Our Message to Stakeholders
Better Empowering Our People to Help Create Long-Term Value
Our people are vital to helping our businesses keep abreast of dramatic changes. We are noth- ing without our people. In research and develop- ment, for example, the zeal of our professionals and their commitment to creating technologies that are commercially viable have enabled us
to create and develop a range of businesses. While our journey began in the Ube area, we now operate globally. A prime focus of business management is therefore how best to empower our people wherever they are and combine their collective talents.
Given significant labor shortages, it is essen- tial for us to secure individuals who can help us respond to change. I thus wish to cultivate work environments in which diverse people can col- laborate and provide more opportunities and operations that reward employees as we grow (please see pages 18–19 and 50–51 for details).
Continuing to Transform Ourselves and Pursue Further Growth While Leveraging the Talents of Our People
On the governance front, we transitioned in June 2019 from a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee. Such a transformation should enable us to accelerate efforts to strengthen the supervisory role of the Board
of Directors and enhance internal controls and governance, which are the defensive elements of our business. On the expansionary front, this should help us to delegate more authority to executives to accelerate decision making (please see pages 39–49 for details).
We have always harnessed the talents
of our people in ongoing changes so that we can pursue new growth opportunities in response to contemporary needs. We will continue that basic approach in the years ahead, and look forward to the ongoing support and encouragement of all stakeholders for our endeavors.

   We will do our best to reduce CO2 emissions.
We will also strive to expand our eco businesses,
transforming challenges in that area into new opportunities.

Dividends per Share
Reaching Our Three-Year Cumulative Earnings and Cash Flow Targets
In fiscal 2018, earnings were down from a year earlier despite revenues increasing. Although operating profit and ordinary income were lower than aimed for in the final year of our medium-term management plan, profit attributable to owners of parent was a record high that exceeded our initial forecast at the beginning of the year, and three-year cumulative earnings achieved our plan target.
We have progressed well financially. While cumulative operating cash flows exceeded the
Total Return Ratio
80 (%) 75 70

plan target, investment cash flows were less than projected, owing partly to changes in the business climate. As such, free cash
flow exceeded our initial goal. We have also reached the objectives of our medium-term management plan in terms of equity capital and interest-bearing debt at year-end. The equity and debt/equity ratios improved to 44.5% and 0.57 times, respectively. On the capital efficiency front, ROE was again up and exceeded 10%.
Maintaining Financial Discipline While Intensifying Growth Investments
We seek to secure free cash flow of ¥40 billion over the three years of our new medium-term management plan, and aim to intensify growth investments. At the same time, we will continue to improve our financial position in keeping with a firm commitment to a focus on cash flow and keeping our overall funds in positive territory. ROE will remain a key efficiency benchmark. Our target for the final year of the plan is 10%. We will work to further amass capital.
Increasing Cash Dividends per Share by ¥5
In fiscal 2018, we implemented a ¥10 billion share buyback and increased cash dividends per share by ¥5, to ¥80. The cumulative total return ratio was therefore 39%.
Stable and sustainable dividends underpin our shareholder return policy. Under our new medium-term management plan, we rolled out a new key performance indicator (KPI), a divi- dend on equity (DOE) ratio of at least 2.5%. At the same time, we will maintain a consolidated total return ratio of 30.0% or more during the three years of the plan. We aim to further reflect revenue growth in greater shareholder returns in the years ahead while investing for growth and maintaining healthy internal reserves.

   Building Value to Materialize Sustainable Growth
The UBE Group’s Strengths: R&D and Intellectual Capital
 Building Value through Robust R&D Activities
and Intellectual Property Initiatives
Our R&D activities draw on synthetic technologies that we have amassed since starting out in coal mining, and we continue to carry out a variety of R&D activities to date. We also undertake strategic intellectual property initiatives that are vital to corporate growth while endeavoring to avoid intellectual property infringements.

R&D
Harnessing Proprietary Synthetic Technologies to Develop Products and Pursue Licensing
C1 Chemistry*1 Technologies Centered on Dimethyl Carbonate
Over the years, we have synthesized chemicals based on raw materials sourced in-house to pur- sue higher added value. As a result, C1 chemistry has become a world-renowned technology, not
only for the creation of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and dimethyl oxalate (DMO) but also for the syn- thesis of derivatives such as polycarbonate diol (PCD)*2 and polyurethane dispersion (PUD)*3,
and heterocyclic compounds that are part of drug substances. This continues to be a source of profit for the Group.
Our efforts to derive oxamides to be used as fertilizer by using a synthetic gas (a mixture of car- bon monoxide and hydrogen) from coal helped
us to pioneer our organic chemistry. We thereafter continued R&D, with our C1 chemistry technolo- gies blossoming in the 1970s after we used a palladium catalyst to create a proprietary nitrite technology*4 (using a carbon monoxide coupling reaction).
DMC is a key outcome of our efforts. It was used for only limited purposes when marketed as a phosgene substitute*5 for carbonate synthesis

          because of a reputation for poor reactivity. We were about to stop production, however, we dis- covered that incorporating small amounts of an additive resulted in DMC becoming a much better electrolyte than existing counterparts in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Since then, this organic compound has been a core product for us, particularly as an electrolyte.
We have progressed steadily in developing derivatives, and have extended our PCD manufac- turing network* to include sites in Thailand and Spain. We have also developed and commercial- ized such high-value-added offerings as PUD, which are derived from PCD.
In recent years, we have augmented the licens- ing business of our C1 chemistry technologies internationally. A good example is the technology for monoethylene glycol (MEG). This is made from DMO, which shares the same raw materials as those of DMC. We have licensed production of more than 12 million metric tons of DMO and
more than 6 million metric tons of MEG.
MEG is a compound whose market is growing
as a raw material for polyester fibers used in apparel and polyethylene terephthalate resins, commonly for plastic beverage bottles. While hydrogen is needed to make MEG from DMO, the synthetic gas that is a raw material of DMO already incorpo- rates hydrogen. Our production process for MEG is thus highly regarded because it minimizes envi- ronmental impact. China’s national policy of har- nessing coal as a raw material for chemicals rather than as a fuel is contributing to a bright future for our technology.
* Please see pages 26–27.
Intellectual Property (IP)
The UBE Group’s initiatives to reinforce and opti- mally leverage IP aim to enable us to create new businesses and bolster competitiveness, thereby helping to build and expand enterprise value.
We seek to maximize our enterprise and IP value by formulating IP strategies according to our business strategies and by implementing the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle of IP strategy activities. Furthermore, to strengthen IP research and analysis capabilities, we are working to improve operational efficiency, including in R&D departments, by utilizing tools with artificial intelli- gence (AI) functions and to utilize IP portfolios*1 and open/close strategies*2 while promoting IP activities that contribute to business revenue. At the same time, we are promoting global IP man- agement as the UBE Group, and are advancing the sharing of activity policies and IP information with Group companies in Japan and overseas.

   Building Value to Materialize Sustainable Growth
The UBE Group’s Strengths: Cultivating Human Resources
Fostering the Human Resources That Will Drive the UBE Group Forward
Global Business Leader (GBL) Program*
Cultivating human resources is a top priority for management, as people are vital to creating value. In an increasingly interconnected world, the UBE Group offers a wide range of opportunities for its people to study and gain experience, equipping them to drive our business forward no matter where they are.
             Our Stance on Developing Human Resources
Hideo Tamada
Managing Executive Officer
The UBE Group’s 11,000 or so employees work
to fulfill its corporate mission and social responsibil- ities. They also underpin our efforts to manufacture safe and secure products, generate sustainable corporate growth, and build corporate value.
Employee education and training are focused on knowledge acquisition, mainly to improve expertise and foster leadership. Eight years ago, we launched our GBL program to concentrate more on human resources development worldwide.
Going forward, we will cultivate the potential of individuals by transferring them in-house or exter- nally so they can pursue new challenges and become proficient in new roles. I believe that those with diverse experience can be prospective execu- tives and guide subordinates as on-site managers.
I also consider it important to encourage further diversity and create more attractive work environments so that we can shift toward more performance-based evaluations and create a cul- ture that is conducive to colleagues being more supportive of each other in performing their duties.
Benefits of the GBL Program
Tsuyoshi Muratani

   started with each of the 24 participants from UBE Group operations in Thailand, Spain, Germany, and Japan quietly introducing ourselves. Over time, however, we found ourselves discussing late into the evenings UBE’s future and finally singing the praises of our strenuous efforts with high fives. I learned a lot from my new mates about what makes a good global leader, and seven years later the experience still helps me to grow the sense of diverse values at the workplace.

I was thrilled when I found out I had been nomi- nated for the GBL program.
Training required me
to be very motivated, chal- lenge my limits, and inspire myself. These qualities apply to life in general as well as the workplace, and I realized that nothing is impossible. Once I changed,
my whole world did. I learned the importance of listening to others and asking questions without fear of failure. I also recognized the need to embrace failure and get out of my comfort zone and even to sometimes differ with others. The knowledge I acquired has proven useful both professionally and personally.
I was able to share an understanding of the importance of global communication with a team that was essentially my family, and we were able to help each other to complete our final presentation.
Sisurat Prakobchat
Quality Assurance Manager
UBE Chemicals (Asia) Public Company Limited
I have been a member
of the UBE Group for
approximately 20 years,
and recently I was fortunate
enough to participate in the
GBL program. I learned a
great many things from
colleagues from all over the
world that also took part, and now feel that I have a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the value of a diverse workforce. Diversity can help the Group to achieve successes as a global team. We also learned to apply strategic skills and use execution excellence processes.
Through the GBL program, I learned that suc- cess relies largely on the following:
• Trusting relationships within the team
• Clear goals
• Clear communication
• Clear priorities
I am utilizing experience gained from the GBL program to implement projects more effectively and strengthen team performance. I am also improving my communication skills by listening more openly to feedback.

Key Risks and Opportunities
Risk Management Policy and System
The UBE Group implements suitable risk countermeasures after assessing probabilities and impacts that might prevent it from reaching its business objectives in every decision-making process, including in gath- erings of the Board of Directors and the Strategic Management Meeting.
We established a Companywide integrated management system to assess risks and gather informa- tion on probabilities and impacts. We also set up the Risk Management Department to centrally oversee related information, and maintain internal systems to manage the Group’s risks.
We set up the following entities to tackle individual risks.
1. Information Security Committee The committee formulated the Information Security Policies, informing everyone and checking compliance while creating information security terms and rules.
2. Crisis Management Committee The committee ensures swift responses to domestic and overseas emergencies by preparing manuals on gathering information and taking internal and external
action, and is building a unified internal and external emergency structure. Strategic Management Meeting • Identify risks and undertake appropriate countermeasures

Risk Overview
Excluded from investment portfolio due to fossil fuel-dependent business structure
Significantly higher costs from tighter taxation on the use of fossil fuels
Serious compliance violations that detract from stakeholder trust and lead to massive damage liabilities
Massive losses from market slowdowns or tighter spreads if demand plunges or supplies surged owing to production capacity increases at other companies
Business continuity issues from chronic and serious labor shortages from such factors as the difficulty of attracting the right people or significantly higher turn- over ratios against a background of declining birth rates, economic trends, and diverse individual values
Large losses from being slow to respond to the rapid spread of alternative new products from other companies
In the event of a major accident at a plant handling hazardous substances
or high-pressure gas, restoration costs, opportunity losses from production shut- downs, compensation to customers and workers, and erosion of social credibility
Lost opportunities because earthquakes or tsunamis greatly damage production facilities
Measures
While enhancing energy efficiency, make known our contributions to lowering environmental impact to the public
In view of the balance between benefits of using fossil fuels and increasing costs, consider using alternatives
While reinforcing governance through tougher manage- ment supervision, a stronger quality assurance system, and more extensive measures to prevent quality issue recurrences, keep improving attitudes and nurturing a corporate culture that does not tolerate any dishonesty
Continue extensive cost cuts and promote differentiation in targeted markets, to reinforce cost competitiveness and to secure stable demands in markets
Undertake such measures as work style reform, operational reviews, diversity initiatives, and leverage information and communication technology (ICT)
Anticipate market needs in product development
and focus resource allocations based on the business portfolio, thereby steadily expanding active growth businesses and cultivating developing fields
Bolster process safety measures (such as to
maintain facilities, produce better manuals, and
use ICT), undertake disaster prevention measures, educate about safety, pass on skills of veteran workers, and formulate and regularly review business continuity plans (BCPs)

     Building Value to Materialize Sustainable Growth
Materiality: Driving Stable Growth for the Chemical Business
Chemical Business Driving Stable Growth for the UBE Group
The UBE Group has positioned the stable expansion of the chemical business, a Group growth driver, as a materiality issue. We practice the UBE Management Philosophy—Pursue technology and embrace innovation to create value for the future and contribute to social progress—by creating products that societies need. In the process, we take advantage of our technological and human resources strengths and our solid customer base.
         A key strength of our chemical business is synthetic technologies that we have cultivated since our foundation. This business has inno- vated numerous products with global growth potentials, including in nylon, synthetic rubber, battery materials, high-performance coatings, and polyimide. Such offerings will continue to drive the Group’s growth.
We have set up chemical production sites overseas, including in Thailand and Spain. We have also deployed our outstanding proprietary technologies cultivated in Ube at overseas businesses in keeping with strategies that match regional needs. Each business runs its own produc- tion sites and has systems in place to supply customers the world over.
Products created with our technological prowess and global supply structure contribute in various ways to conserving energy, producing lighter and longer-lasting products, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing convenience. They also help to resolve global warming, health- care, food, and other issues and contribute to recycling-oriented societies.

      Business Strategies for Fiscal 2019
The chemicals industry experienced adversity
as the result of a deteriorating demand–supply balance, owing to new competition from players in China and emerging nations, and massive facilities upgrades. Although markets have recovered
backdrop that we have cut caprolactam costs since the previous medium-term management
plan by positioning caprolactam as a raw material for nylon while upgrading facilities for nylon extru- sion applications—one of our strengths—to expand sales. These efforts have begun to bear fruit. We will continue to stably supply differentiated nylon and synthetic rubber products that leverage our strengths, including joint product development with customers. At the same time, we will expand extensively in specialty chemicals, where we can draw on such proprietary technologies as separa- tors and polyimide, to drive the Group’s growth. As for new business and R&D, we will focus on nurturing future growth drivers based on a clear policy and direction.

 Initiatives to Create Value and Drive Sustainable Growth
Business Strategies of Construction Materials Company
New Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Strengthen business foundations. • Enhance growth strategy.
• Pursue Group synergies.
 Principal Products and Businesses
• Cement, ready-mixed concrete
• Biomass, industrial waste recycling
• Building materials (Self-leveling materials, waterproofing
materials, and renovation)
• Magnesia and calcia
• Fine chemicals
• Energy (Coal and electricity)
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2019
Our construction materials are essential for society. We expect to remain profitable in the years ahead by expanding new businesses on top of stable business foundations. While construction related
to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games should create some construction demand in fiscal 2019, persistently high coal and heavy oil costs
is projected to continue to constrain near-term results.
Ready-mixed concrete
It is against this adverse business backdrop that the Company will strive to reach its new medium-term management plan targets while reaping the rewards from actions to date under the new medium-term management plan.
1. Strengthen business foundations
While building a stable shipment framework
and conserving energy and costs in cement, ready-mixed concrete, magnesia and calcia, and energy operations, we will improve profitability through consistent efforts to revise prices and overcome the challenges of a deteriorating busi- ness climate.
• Installing a high-efficiency clinker cooler at the
Kanda Factory to cut energy and costs (con- struction started in fiscal 2019, with operations slated to begin in fiscal 2020). Waste heat power facilities at the Isa Factory should start operating in fiscal 2019.

SWOT Analysis
  Strengths
• We can optimize Group synergies through our diverse Groupwide product businesses.
• We maintain a solid infrastructural setup through our coal and power supply structure and large port facilities.
• We are able to harness a wide range of waste substances and draw on our advanced technical capabilities to conserve resources.
 Weaknesses
• Aging facilities
Countermeasures: We will overcome this issue
by lowering opportunity losses through formulating long-term facilities maintenance plans and using
ICT to consolidate facilities maintenance information.
  Opportunities
• We continue to enjoy solid demand in urban areas in line with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, redevelopment, Osaka Expo, and other projects.
• We must ensure stable supplies of materials that are essential for building social capital and competitive energies.
• We anticipate further synergies through the integration of energy and environmental businesses.
• Deploying Renewal Phase II (covering fiscal 2019–2021) at the Ube Factory of Ube Materials Industries to maintain stable operations and deliver high-added-value for magnesia (fiscal 2019–2021).
• Rolling out environmental measures, aging facilities countermeasures, and efficiency improvements to maintain competitive and stable supplies of energy.
2. Enhance growth strategy
We have positioned fine materials, biomass, and recycling as growth businesses and are pursuing new ideas beyond existing business frameworks to expand by commercializing businesses and generating profits.
• In fine materials, we will lift production capability in MOS-HIGE magnesium oxysulfate whiskers (Thai plant construction started in April 2018, with operations scheduled to begin in fiscal 2020).
• In biomass and recycling, we will expand sales of environmental materials, notably by increasing biomass incinerations at IPP, and are looking to produce polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) over- seas while creating new recycling operations and expanding sales of such environmental materials as neutral stabilizers and heavy metal immobilizers.
ESG-Related Initiatives
Threats
• Sluggish domestic cement demand and increasing thermal energy costs Countermeasures: We will tackle this challenge by constantly revising cement prices while building solid, low-cost operating foundations.
• Tighter environmental regulations
Countermeasures: We will undertake the following energy-saving measures, which aim to (1) deploy high-efficiency facilities,
(2) reuse waste heat, (3) use more biomass fuel in power generation, and (4) streamline kiln operations.
Solar power plant
3. Pursue Group synergies
From the beginning of fiscal 2019, the energy & environment business (coal and electricity) have been integrated into the Construction Materials Company. Although operations collaborated closely with cement factories and Group compa- nies, being in the same company should further generate new synergies. These will include maxi- mizing and optimizing the use of waste and bio- mass and more effectively harnessing and devel- oping human resources.
Finally, this fiscal year is the start of our new medium-term management plan. While responding flexibly to business climate changes in the years ahead, we will accelerate independent operational management as a new company and ensure safety, security, stability, and growth.
Self-leveling materials
             • We are installing waste heat power facilities at the Isa Cement Factory that should start operating in February 2020. We plan to install a high-efficiency clinker cooler at the Kanda Factory to begin operation from summer 2020. Together, these measures should reduce annual emissions of CO2, a greenhouse gas, by roughly 80,000 metric tons - CO2e/y.
• We are endeavoring to greenify former limestone quarries. Since fiscal 2008, we have planted citrus trees, ivy, and other vegetation on the slopes of the Kanda Mine. Since fiscal 2011, we have planted wild cherry trees and round leaf holly on the slopes of the Ube Isa Mine.

In fiscal 2019, we will focus on production pro- cesses and cost management for large domestic electric power plant orders received while develop- ing new products to enter markets for environmen- tally friendly products and resource recycling, taking advantage of our strengths in combustion, crushing, and materials handling technologies.
We will also focus on the licensing business.
Machinery Services Business
This business is a major source of income that generates more stable profits than machinery products businesses, which are more exposed
to various factors. That said, we need to reinforce the business because rivals have also focused in recent years on reinforcing services operations.
In fiscal 2019, we will bolster overseas services sites and support capabilities. In particular, we
will enhance our services structure by integrating and reinforcing sites while training and beefing
up service personnel. We will also become more responsive by stocking more components.
• Intensifying competition from the emergence of manufacturers in Europe, the United States, China, and emerging nations Countermeasures: We will tackle this challenge by developing new products, bolstering overseas sites, and reinforcing service and support capabilities to enhance customer satisfaction.
• Concerns about product competitiveness deteriorating amid rocketing raw materials costs and longer delivery times Countermeasures: We will resolve this issue by cutting costs Com- panywide, cultivating new vendors, and increasing productivity.
    Steel Products Business
The business environment is adverse because of surging costs of raw and indirect materials and electricity.
This situation is expected to per-
sist in fiscal 2019. As such, while
continuing to improve materials pro-
curement and production efficiency we will work to enhance profitability by constructing an optimal production framework that is responsive to changes in the operating climate and to expand our industrial waste recycling business.

Corporate Governance Discussion
   Left
Yuzuru Yamamoto Chairman of the Board
Right
Seiichi Ochiai Outside Director Chairman of the Audit & Supervisory Committee
UBE transitioned from a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure in keeping with an amendment of
the Articles of Incorporation that was adopted at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2019. Yuzuru Yamamoto, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Seiichi Ochiai, an independent outside director and Chairman of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, and who is a commercial law researcher, discussed the purpose of the transition and the resulting changes.
We have shifted to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure. The UBE Group will pursue further growth through all employees being committed to doing things better.
How does a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee differ from a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors or a Company with Nominating Committee?
Ochiai: The board of directors of a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors needs to decide by itself all important business matters. That tends
to centralize management decision-making, and supervision of business implementation is often inadequate as a result.
There are therefore two organizational setups under the Companies Act to rectify such a situation. One is a Company with Nominating Committee. The other is a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee. A Company with Nominating Commit- tee enables the use of a monitoring model, with
executives looking after management and the board of directors overseeing management. A Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee is halfway between a Company with Board of Corpo- rate Auditors and a Company with Nominating Committee. Its board of directors does not have statutory Nomination and Remuneration Commit- tees, and this organizational setup makes it easy to transition from a Company with Board of Corpo- rate Auditors. While a considerable number of listed companies have transitioned, a minority have Company with Nominating Committee setups.
•
Yamamoto: A Company with Nominating Commit- tee structure is basically a European or American approach. By clearly separating executive and supervisory roles, this organizational setup enables
39

40
companies to grow fast and increase corporate value. I understand that while there were moves in Japan to adopt such structures, there were unfor- tunately few outside directors to offer monitoring, so this structure was not widely adopted. It was thereafter considered easier to shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure, a halfway marker under the law, whose purpose
is to improve corporate value.
Committee structure. Another consideration was the identifying of inappropriate quality inspections last year. On reflection, we realized that our corpo- rate governance system needed more than a Com- pany with Board of Corporate Auditors setup. We are also at a turning point this year, notably in terms of having a new President and CEO, reorganizing into a three-company operating structure, and hav- ing embarked on a new medium-term management plan. We therefore decided to adopt a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure.
•
Ochiai: The Board of Directors has delegated important business implementation decisions to management. In this era of fast global changes, important management decisions are up to top executives rather than the Board. The President and CEO can act swiftly and boldly in keeping with the business climate and focus on improving corporate value. With management clearly in charge of implementation, with Board oversight, it is then possible to properly evaluate manage- ment’s overall performance in attaining goals.
What is the scope of important business imple- mentation decisions delegated to the CEO?
Yamamoto: If you adopt a Company with Audit
& Supervisory Committee structure, you can dele- gate authority reasonably soon to executives to handle measures. For particularly important busi- ness implementation decisions, executives tradi- tionally submit interim reports to the board and then explore final decisions in light of the board’s views. By continuing that approach, the board can transfer authority and leave things up to manage- ment to make rapid progress.
•
Ochiai: Even if the board delegates decision-making to management, if management believes that it needs to seek opinions from third parties, including outside directors, it is free to explain that situation to the board. It is also possible for management
to go back to the board to seek a decision on a matter, and there can even be a gradual delegation of authority in line with realities at a company, so delegation should be flexible.
How will the Company change with the focus of the Board of Directors shifting to management oversight?
Yamamoto: In a Company with Audit & Supervi- sory Committee, the board can flexibly determine
 Accelerating decision-making should improve growth rates.
Why did UBE transition to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure?
Yamamoto: We discussed the benefits and issues of the Audit & Supervisory Committee setup and the best deployment approaches since the revision of the Companies Act in 2014. UBE has long had numerous outside directors, and they have always felt free to air their views with others on the Board of Directors, and executives have been very responsive. So, because governance has functioned well, some said there was little need to shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure. But since a board makes all important business imple- mentation decisions in a Company with Board of Corporate Auditors, there are issues of manage- ment agility. So, directors increasingly wanted
to shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory

the extent to which it delegates important business implementation decisions to top management. The board’s role is to use the new organizational setup to provide direction so executives autonomously improve their efforts. Executives can manage more flexibly and make faster decisions if a lot of author- ity is delegated to them. To that end, executives need to explain to the board that they are proceed- ing properly and steadily producing results.
•
Ochiai: It is important for the Board of Directors
to carefully assess the UBE Group’s situation and delegate authority to the proper extent. At the same time, executives need to explain to the Board how much freedom they need to fulfill man- agement responsibilities, and have the Board suffi- ciently deliberate this. In other words, both sides likely need to move forward to complete the new organizational setup.
•
Yamamoto: Accelerating decision-making should improve growth rates. Even if goals remain the same, a nimbler management should deliver results faster. We can therefore anticipate results and take next steps more quickly.
How will auditing change owing to the transi- tion to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure? How will you ensure the effectiveness of the internal control systems you need?
Yamamoto: To date, our auditing section has inspected business sites, while auditors have also assessed sites from their own perspectives, high- lighting any areas needing improvement. Execu- tives now handle such tasks and need to demon- strate to the Audit & Supervisory Committee that there are no issues. At around the same time as the shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee setup, we are changing the organiza- tion, appointing an executive officer to look after the Auditing Department and strengthen internal controls. There will be a framework for executives to improve governance.
•
Ochiai: Creating and running a solid internal control system will become an even more important man- agement responsibility. With an executive officer put in charge of the Auditing Department, we antic- ipate a more robust internal control system. This should enable the management team to match or outperform other companies. I would like execu- tives to step up their efforts in that regard. From
here on, we will rely on this internal control system while the Audit & Supervisory Committee checks whether our internal control system functions prop- erly. It is also important to note that members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee are Board members with voting rights, unlike auditors, so they can be useful to improve the supervisory aspects of the Board. This is a major change in
my view.
 Members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee are Board members with voting rights, so they can be useful to improve the supervisory aspects of the Board.
Finally, what is your current business situation?
Yamamoto: We have updated our business philosophy. As well, we have shifted to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure and changed our management team. By reorganizing into a three-company operating structure, each company can become more agile and strengthen its defensive capabilities. We have also launched
a new medium-term management plan. The
UBE Group will pursue further growth through all employees being committed to doing things better.
•
Ochiai: We are steering our ship in exciting new directions, and I look forward to the voyage. I am convinced that we are well positioned to deliver solid corporate value over the medium and long terms.

Board of Directors
In principle, a director who does not serve concur- rently as an executive officer serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes decisions about important management issues in accordance with laws, regulations, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, and the rules of the Board of Directors, and also supervises directors and executive officers to ensure they are performing their duties appropriately and efficiently. As a Company with Audit & Supervisory Commit- tee, we will accelerate operational execution by delegating decision-making on important opera- tions to the President and CEO while consistently reinforcing supervision.
Audit & Supervisory Committee
The Audit & Supervisory Committee is responsible for auditing the execution of duties by directors and presenting opinions at the General Meetings of Shareholders concerning the nomination and com- pensation of directors other than members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee. The committee’s operations are conducted based on audit policies and plans established each fiscal year. Committee members attend and express their opinions at important meetings, including Board of Directors’ meetings, in order to understand the decision- making process of important decisions and the status of business execution, while examining important decision-making documents and receiv- ing business reports from directors (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee), executive officers, and employees. They also hold periodic meetings with the President and Repre- sentative Director to confirm management policies and exchange opinions on key issues. The com- mittee members are permitted to attend meetings

The Board of Directors receives a report on these deliberations and conducts an evaluation of its effectiveness. As a result, the Board of Directors determined at a meeting held in June 2019 that the Board functioned effectively in fiscal 2018, as

Board were appropriate and that vigorous discus- sion and deliberation were conducted.
With the change to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee in mind, UBE views the following five issues as challenges and will pursue improvements going forward to enhance corporate value by reinforcing the supervisory functions of the Board of Directors: (1) broadening the scope of decision-making authority delegated to the President and Representative Director concerning important business execution; (2) investigating
an ideal reporting method that contributes to
the supervision of management and phased-in implementation; (3) monitoring business execution status relative to medium- and long-term
management plans; (4) monitoring the complete- ness and appropriateness of structured risk management using risk management systems; and (5) reinforcing and monitoring of the effective- ness of internal control systems.
Director and Executive Officer Remuneration
UBE revised its director and executive officer remu- neration system effective April 1, 2019. The amount of remuneration for fiscal 2018 and for fiscal 2019 were determined based on the old system. The new system will be applied to the determination of the amount of remuneration starting in fiscal 2020.
The outline of the new system is stated below. The major differences from the old remuneration system include the simplification of various bench- marks to aid understanding, with the compensation ratio for performance-linked portions increasing.

A. Calculation method for determining director and executive officer remuneration
(a) The remuneration structure for directors (excluding directors who are also members
of the Audit & Supervisory Committee and outside directors who are not members of the committee) and executive officers at UBE con- sists of (1) base compensation (fixed compen- sation), (2) an annual incentive (Companywide performance-linked compensation and annual individual target-based compensation), and (3) long-term incentives (medium-to-long term individual target-based compensation and stock options).
(b) The ratios of base compensation and annual and long-term incentives are set to allocate about 50% for base compensation, 30% for annual incentives, and 20% for long-term incentives. The ratios of annual incentives for the President and the Chairman are higher, and base compensation lower, compared to those for other directors and executive officers.
(c) Directors who are also members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee and outside direc- tors who are not members of the committee receive fixed, base compensation only.
(d) The objective validity of standards for director and executive officer remuneration is con- firmed by constantly referring to remuneration
study data from external research institutes and by making comparisons with levels at major manufacturers of similar sizes and in comparable industries.
B. Outline of procedure to determine director and executive officer remuneration
The amount of compensation for each director (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee) and executive officer will be deliber- ated by the Compensation Committee, which reports to the Board of Directors and is chaired
by an outside director and a majority of which is comprised of outside directors. After reviewing compensation, the committee forwards its recom- mendations and findings to the Board of Directors for a decision. The compensation of directors who are also members of the Audit & Supervisory Com- mittee shall be decided through deliberations of members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee.
C. Status for the year ended March 31, 2019
The following remunerations were for the year ended March 31, 2019 based on the old remuner- ation system. The Company transitioned to a Com- pany with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure as resolved at the General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2019. Accordingly, an auditor had not been appointed as of the issue date of
this Integrated Report.

General Meeting of Shareholders and Exercise of Voting Rights
The Notice of Convocation is sent out three weeks prior to the General Meeting of Share- holders, but its contents are posted on the UBE Group’s website earlier. UBE provides access to mobile phone and internet voting in addition to voting by mail so that shareholders unable
to attend can also exercise their voting rights. UBE also uses an electronic voting platform for institutional investors.
At the General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 28, 2018, a total of 15,340 shareholders exercised their voting rights (including 14,412 shareholders who exercised voting rights in writing and via the internet), representing 77.1% of total voting rights.

Internal Control System
The Board of Directors has resolved the basic policies for the configuration of the UBE Group’s internal control system.
Detailed information on the Basic
Policy for Establishing Internal Control
is available on the UBE Group’s
website:
https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/en/corporate/management/ internalcontrol.html
Compliance
UBE established the UBE Action Guidelines as a code of conduct guiding basic behavior within the UBE Group and among constituent mem- bers. The guidelines outline the standards and criteria for compliance in corporate activities, which directors and employees are expected
to adhere to.
UBE appoints a Compliance Officer for
the UBE Group and maintains the UBE Group Compliance Committee including general coun- sels as an advisory body. Within the committee, it set up the UBE Group Competition Law Com- pliance Committee to prevent acts that impede fair competition and to ensure the soundness
of business operations. It additionally set up
the UBE Group Restricted Cargo and Export Management Committee to increase awareness within the Group of the need to prevent the unauthorized export or provision of goods and technology that are restricted under export control laws and regulations designed to maintain international peace and stability.
UBE is working to upgrade and strengthen structures and frameworks for compliance. Initiatives include the introduction of the “UBE C-Line,” a hotline that allows executive officers and employees to directly report compliance issues without going through normal channels. This encourages the rapid finding and swift correction of compliance issues. By providing compliance-related information, e-learning, team coaching, and other programs, UBE continuously educates and enlightens its employees.
In fiscal 2018, UBE conducted internal training and education on laws and regulations such as the Anti-Monopoly Act, Subcontract Act, and Unfair Competition Prevention Act.
The Company trained instructors for general compliance education at each office and facility to cultivate capabilities based in workplaces. Training extends over cycles of three years. From fiscal 2015 through 2017, approximately 10,800 employees took courses. In the first year of the fiscal 2018 to 2020 cycle, roughly 1,700 employees attended courses.
Thorough Procurement in Line with Basic Purchasing Policies
(Supply Chain Management)
The UBE Group endeavors to build fair and honest business relationships. We purchase in line with the Basic Purchasing Policies—Fair Transactions, Objective Selection of Suppliers, Compliance with Laws and Regulations and Confidentiality, Green Purchasing, and CSR Procurement*, as disclosed in the purchasing information
on the UBE Group’s website. Detailed information on these
policies is available on the UBE
Group’s website: https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/en/koubai/index.html
CSR Procurement
The UBE Group prepared CSR Procurement Policies and CSR Procurement Guidelines that encompass respecting human rights, complying with laws and social norms such as eliminating anti-social forces, and safeguarding the environ- ment to foster CSR procurement that boosts standards across the entire supply chain.
In fiscal 2018, we conducted a third survey of 277 major business partners accounting for 90% of our procurement costs for materials, construction, packaging materials, and fuel oil.
Addressing Quality Issues
We sincerely regret quality check improprieties that came to light last year, and formulated and implemented measures to prevent recurrences. In line with recurrence prevention efforts, we have constantly improved quality systems to make them more appropriate, including by closely matching customer agreements with
our actual operations. As part of these efforts, we are responding appropriately in collabora- tion with customers where we find amendments necessary in keeping with the revised response rules. We are continuously implementing recur- rence prevention measures to improve Group governance and enhancing our quality manage- ment systems to regain stakeholder trust.

    ESG: Underpinning Value Creation and Sustainable Growth
Human Resources
   At the UBE Group, we consider employees our most important resource for cre- ating value and supporting sustainable growth. We therefore devote considerable attention to human resources development and endeavor to enhance our programs to ensure that all employees can lead fulfilling lives.
Personnel System
UBE maintains a personnel system in which it clari- fies what it expects of employees and impartially evaluates individual effort. We seek to ensure that employees therefore fully understand what they need to do and create workplaces that are chal- lenging and motivating for all our employees.
Enhancing Work Style Reform
Work style reform is an important management priority. We are accordingly reviewing Company- wide approaches to ensure high productivity and enhance the skills of all employees. We have implemented programs and develop the working environment that allow employees to work with flexibility as part of our commitment to encouraging a healthy work–life balance for our employees.

Description
Employees whose spouses have given birth can take four days of paid leave.
Leave can be taken until the day before the child’s first birthday (or
the child’s second birthday, in certain circumstances).
The first seven days of leave are fully paid.
Employees can take leave to provide nursing care for family members (up to a total of 365 days).
Employees can take leave to nurse children in the third grade of elemen- tary school or younger. (Five days per child can be taken each year, up to a maximum of 10 days a year.)
The working hours of employees caring for children in the third grade of elementary school or younger, nursing family members, seeing a doctor, and going to school can be shortened by up to two hours per day on request.
We augment on-the-job training, workshops and other off-the-job training, and self-improvement support programs with systems that empower our employees to perform at their best in an array of businesses and in an increasingly global operating climate. A good example is the Career Develop- ment Sheets that employees prepare every year, based on which they can discuss their prospects with supervisors. We rotate employees through posts to broaden their perspectives and expertise. We upgrade off-the-job training, including work- shops, in keeping with specific business needs to keep pace with changes in the operating climate.
Respect for Human Rights
The UBE Group Action Guidelines for Business Conduct state our commitment to respecting indi- viduals while fostering mutual understanding and eliminating discrimination. We established the Human Rights Education Committee, which offers executive training and training opportunities to employees by business site and job classification and draws on e-learning tools in its programs. All members of the Group endeavor to fully respect human rights in every aspect of our operations.

We endeavor to attract and retain diverse talent as part of efforts to overcome the looming challenges of a declining labor force and a changing business climate.
We recruit people from a wide range of backgrounds without regard to such factors as nationality or gender and provide work environ- ments in which they can fulfill their potential.

Addressing the Gender Gap
As of March 31, 2019, 7.5% of parent company employees were women, up from 7.3% a year earlier. Females represented 2.4% of our manage- ment pool, up from 1.5% a year earlier. In fiscal 2019, we launched a three-year action plan based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. The plan encompasses the following three benchmarks
to realize more flexible working styles and provide greater opportunities for female employees.
(1) A paid vacation usage rate of 80% or more
(2) At least 70% of eligible male employees taking
childcare leave
(3) Women representing at least 20% of new
graduate hires for generalist positions
As part of our efforts to be more inclusive for
women, we have increased the number of female employees at our factories and overseas. Women are increasingly vital to our operations.
     Numbers in parentheses are the number of female hires.

Employing Non-Japanese Nationals
Our domestic employees need to engage increasingly with their overseas colleagues amid the increasingly global nature of our business, and we accordingly hire foreign nationals to work in Japan so Japanese can acquaint themselves with different business and cultural practices.
Rehiring Retirees
We are making our workplaces more conducive to rehiring employees as seniors or managers who have reached the standard retirement age so they can continue to share their experience and skills. We rehired 90.7% of new retirees in fiscal 2018.
Recruiting People with Disabilities
We do much to foster the employment of people with disabilities, and maintain the UBE Group Support Network for Employment of People
with Disabilities. Through it, we place individuals within the Group through Libertas Ube, Ltd., a special-purpose subsidiary that we established in 1991.

Coexisting with Communities
  The UBE Group engages in social contribution initiatives that contribute to local progress in keeping with the spirit of coexistence and mutual prosperity that is the basis of its CSR activities and management philosophy and in line with an aware- ness that close ties with communities are essential for corporate activities.
 Responsible Care (RC)* Local Dialogue Meetings
Our chemical factories are members of the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) RC Committee in the western Yamaguchi, Sakai/Senboku, and Chiba regions. JCIA member companies hold bien- nial RC Local Dialogue Meetings in each of the com- mittee’s regions to deepen mutual understanding with local residents about such RC activities as envi- ronmental preservation, process safety and disaster prevention, and occupational safety. The 12th RC Local Dialogue Meeting was held in the Chiba region in fiscal 2018. After reviewing their activities through- out the year, member companies exchanged views with residents on the topic of corporate environmen- tal preservation and process safety and disaster

prevention. There was also a lecture by the Fire Prevention and Management Division of Chiba Prefec- ture’s Disaster Crisis Management Division about the prefecture’s readiness for major disasters.
To create a significant opportunity each year for engagement between industry, government, aca- demia, and local residents, JCIA member companies in the city of Ube, which is home to UBE’s principal production facilities, hold dialogue forums for the Ube district in years in which they are not convening RC Local Dialogue Meetings in the western Yamaguchi region. The 15th RC Dialogue Forum in November 2018 featured explanations of the activities of mem- ber companies in Ube City and exchanges of views with participants regarding chemical substance man- agement and zero waste emissions. The JCIA RC Committee lectured on RC activities and communica- tion initiatives, while the Ube City Environmental Policy Office discussed municipal environmental initiatives.
We will continue to focus on local dialogue and maintain RC activities to foster coexistence and mutual prosperity with communities.
Support for Culture and the Arts in Japan
UBE provides financial and personnel support for the activities of the UBE Foundation and the Watanabe Memorial Culture Association. Since fiscal 2008, we have invited the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra to per- form in the UBE Group Charity Concert in Ube City. We have taken advantage of these visits to hold small performances at hospitals in the city.
All proceeds from the concert are used to pur- chase and donate musical instruments to junior high schools and local music organizations.

UBE Corporation Europe, S.A. Unipersonal (UCE) in Spain
This past year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our caprolactam plant in Castellón and signifi- cantly developed the activities of the Volunteer Promotion Group.
To help commemorate the anniversary, we organized “Conversations with Good Chemistry” in June to discuss the future of our sector with the Rector of Castellón University, the President of the Valencia Region, the UBE Chairman, and the UCE President. In addition, in November we participated in the “Hafu festival,” which was held in the open area of Castellón Port. The festival was open to the general public, and we offered such activities as workshops for children and culinary exhibits. Also, we conducted a bus tour of the plant for 35 external visitors from five civil associations in Castellón. We concluded the celebration with a free concert by the flamenco singer Estrella Morente.
The Volunteer Promotion Group organized
a Tree Planting Campaign and supported the International Trail Course Race, a Toy Collection Campaign, the third Charity Race against Cancer, and a visit to the Red Cross Warehouse.
Corporate Citizenship
UBE Group in Thailand (See note)
CSR activities of the UBE Group in Thailand are guided by a commitment to being a good corpo- rate citizen with continuous emphasis on social responsibility. Its initiatives center on maintaining occupational safety and health, protecting the environment, ensuring compliance, and engaging with communities.
In December 2018, we achieved a record of
40 million hours free of accidents requiring time off from work. This was the fruit of ongoing efforts to maintain occupational safety and health. We com- memorated this milestone by distributing sphygmo- manometers to encourage employees to manage their health. Since 2014, we have pursued ongoing efforts to protect the region’s environment. Our fourth initiative was to build a dam on February 16 and 17, 2019, in Khao Chamao-Khao Wong National Park in Rayong to improve the habitat for wildlife.
We will continue to undertake initiatives in keep- ing with activity guidelines in our drive to become a better corporate citizen.

Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
We endeavor to eliminate process accidents through initiatives that ensure that our facilities are safe and secure. We also undertake activities to minimize damage in the event of large earth- quakes. In fiscal 2018, we focused on reducing risks to eliminate process accidents, improving safety at certified high-pressure gas sites, and implementing earthquake and tsunami measures.
Efforts to reduce risks to eliminate process accidents focus on comprehensively identifying risks, emphasizing employee education, sharing
internal and external accident cases, providing proposals on close-calls, and harnessing new technical knowledge. We also address identified risks by systematically formulating drastic mea- sures and thereby building business sites that are impervious to accidents.
For certified high-pressure gas sites, we obtain regular assessments from the Japan Safety Com- petency Center, undertaking ongoing efforts to enhance safety at these facilities in light of find- ings from such evaluations.
Earthquake and tsunami measures encom- pass enhancing responsiveness by formulating and executing emergency plans. We also respond to the Industrial Process Safety Action Plan of the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association.

Measures to Prevent Occupational Accidents
Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven cor- porate culture, encompassing eight elements. These are organizational governance, positive involvement, resource management, work man- agement, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual under- standing. We are examining existing activities
in light of these elements, and are stepping up efforts to tackle and overcome weak areas.
Eliminating Major Disasters
We have undertaken a range of activities to pre- vent occupational accidents. In fiscal 2018, we initiated efforts that centered on eliminating major incidents. We conduct risk assessments of work in which people might fall, be caught or entangled in machinery, or come into contact with hazard- ous materials. We implement systematic risk reduction measures and endeavor to make oper- ations inherently safe.
We investigate the causes of all incidents regardless of whether they result in lost time, striving to prevent similar incidents by assessing and rolling out measures.

 Using Resources Effectively
Our cement factories recycle diverse waste and by-products as raw materials (material recycling) and alternative fuels (thermal recycling). Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possible to use ash from incineration as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.
In fiscal 2018, our three cement factories harnessed 3.34 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.96 million metric tons of which we sourced externally, contributing considerably to
a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new businesses to use waste materials in applications other than as mate- rials for cement. In fiscal 2017, for example, we began recycling plasterboard, for which we expect demand to increase. We will continue to boost
our capacity for handling various waste as part
of efforts to expand our recycling business.
Please see Non-Financial Highlights on page 11 for details of our usage of waste substances and by-products.

Reducing Industrial Waste
and Chemical Substance Emissions
Industrial Waste Reductions
The Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) Volun- tary Action Plan on the Environment targets a 70% reduction in the final disposal volume of industrial waste from the fiscal 2000 level by fiscal 2020.
We strive through industry-led initiatives to recycle industrial waste and reduce final disposal waste to contribute to a recycling-based economy.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2018, we lowered such waste by 85% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeavor- ing to cut volumes from fiscal 2019.
Reducing Chemical Substance Emissions
The Japanese government is driving efforts to cut chemical substance emissions through a combina- tion of legislation and voluntary initiatives. Voluntary efforts include industry initiatives to constrain emis- sions of VOCs*1 and a system to disclose sub- stances based on the PRTR Law*2.
In terms of the UBE Group’s activities, 20 sub- stances*3, which it emits in relatively large amounts, were voluntarily selected from substances subject to the PRTR Law as well as VOCs. We will focus on the Group’s emissions of these substances and strive to reduce them.
Minimizing VOC Emissions
The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2018 were 33% lower than those in fiscal 2010.
Reducing PRTR Substances
We handle 68 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2018 were down 28% from fiscal 2010.

Product Safety and Quality Assurance
 Product Safety Initiatives
We comply strictly with the chemical laws and regulations of Japan and the other countries in which we operate. Our stewardship of chemical substances encompasses health, safety, and environmental perspectives. We carefully man- age the distribution of chemical substances and extensively disclose safety information about our chemical products.
Complying with Chemical Substances Laws and Regulations
We are digitizing our systems to handle chemical substances laws and regulations. As well, we have constructed a domestic and overseas compliance structure that encompasses an SDS*1 production support system; in-house-developed chemical safety information; and U-CHRIP, a comprehensive database for managing safety and regulatory infor- mation about chemical substances. We accordingly seek to replace manual processes and a reliance on individual skills in handling compliance.
The electrical and electronic device and automotive sectors are leading the way in green procurement*2, and as a supplier of raw and other materials we carefully monitor our offerings for harmful substances.

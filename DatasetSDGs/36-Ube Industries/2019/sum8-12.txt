Business Strategies for Fiscal 2019
Molding Machinery Business
While the domestic market saw replacements
of aging machines and an increase in capacity widening plans in response to rising demand for lighter automobiles, new capital investment in the North American market plateaued owing to lower
Injection molding machines
automobile sales. There were some revisions in capital investment plans in China for manufacturing equipment of automobile components, for which demand has been solid to date, and there were some delivery delays because of Sino-American trade friction.
We will improve product efficiency in fiscal 2019 as we have already secured larger order backlogs than in normal years.
In die-cast machinery, we will develop advanced products for lighter automobiles. In extrusion presses, we will start expanding sales of a new product offering considerable energy savings.
We will develop global strategic injection mold- ing machines tailored to local needs and a new series offering improved performance. At the same time, we will build an efficient global optimum pro- duction framework to boost sales.
Industrial Machinery Business
In Japan, capital investment in large facilities peaked, with price competition intensifying. Over- seas markets slowed owing to excessive capacity in China. Demand for new capital investment in

SWOT AnalysisStrengths
• We have a robust record in serving the automotive, electric power, cement, steelmaking, and other key sectors, and have earned solid customer reputations for our efforts.
• We can draw on numerous domestic and overseas operations to cater to customer needs in everything from development through after-service.
• We have large processing facilities and skilled engineers and workers.Weaknesses
• Slow to take advantage of ICT because our business is based on manufacturing to order
Countermeasures: We have accordingly launched an ICT project to enhance product development and production efficiency.Opportunities Threats
• Customer needs and requests are diversifying as target markets globalize.
• An extremely responsive global service and support framework is increasingly
essential.
• There is a growing need for technologies that help lighten the weight of
automobiles and contribute to the environmentally friendly product and resource recycling fields.
emerging nations was low due to low crude oil and resources prices.
In fiscal 2019, we will focus on production pro- cesses and cost management for large domestic electric power plant orders received while develop- ing new products to enter markets for environmen- tally friendly products and resource recycling, taking advantage of our strengths in combustion, crushing, and materials handling technologies.
We will also focus on the licensing business.
Machinery Services Business
This business is a major source of income that generates more stable profits than machinery products businesses, which are more exposed
to various factors. That said, we need to reinforce the business because rivals have also focused in recent years on reinforcing services operations.
In fiscal 2019, we will bolster overseas services sites and support capabilities. In particular, we
will enhance our services structure by integrating and reinforcing sites while training and beefing
up service personnel. We will also become more responsive by stocking more components.
• Intensifying competition from the emergence of manufacturers in Europe, the United States, China, and emerging nations Countermeasures: We will tackle this challenge by developing new products, bolstering overseas sites, and reinforcing service and support capabilities to enhance customer satisfaction.
• Concerns about product competitiveness deteriorating amid rocketing raw materials costs and longer delivery times Countermeasures: We will resolve this issue by cutting costs Com- panywide, cultivating new vendors, and increasing productivity.
    Steel Products Business
The business environment is adverse because of surging costs of raw and indirect materials and electricity.
This situation is expected to per-
sist in fiscal 2019. As such, while
continuing to improve materials pro-
curement and production efficiency we will work to enhance profitability by constructing an optimal production framework that is responsive to changes in the operating climate and to expand our industrial waste recycling business.

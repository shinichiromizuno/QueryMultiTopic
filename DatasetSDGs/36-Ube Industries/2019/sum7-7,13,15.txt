• Energy (Coal and electricity)
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2019
Our construction materials are essential for society. We expect to remain profitable in the years ahead by expanding new businesses on top of stable business foundations. While construction related
to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games should create some construction demand in fiscal 2019, persistently high coal and heavy oil costs
is projected to continue to constrain near-term results.
Ready-mixed concrete
It is against this adverse business backdrop that the Company will strive to reach its new medium-term management plan targets while reaping the rewards from actions to date under the new medium-term management plan.
1. Strengthen business foundations
While building a stable shipment framework
and conserving energy and costs in cement, ready-mixed concrete, magnesia and calcia, and energy operations, we will improve profitability through consistent efforts to revise prices and overcome the challenges of a deteriorating busi- ness climate.
• Installing a high-efficiency clinker cooler at the
Kanda Factory to cut energy and costs (con- struction started in fiscal 2019, with operations slated to begin in fiscal 2020). Waste heat power facilities at the Isa Factory should start operating in fiscal 2019.

SWOT AnalysisStrengths
• We can optimize Group synergies through our diverse Groupwide product businesses.
• We maintain a solid infrastructural setup through our coal and power supply structure and large port facilities.
• We are able to harness a wide range of waste substances and draw on our advanced technical capabilities to conserve resources.Weaknesses
• Aging facilities
Countermeasures: We will overcome this issue
by lowering opportunity losses through formulating long-term facilities maintenance plans and using
ICT to consolidate facilities maintenance information.Opportunities
• We continue to enjoy solid demand in urban areas in line with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, redevelopment, Osaka Expo, and other projects.
• We must ensure stable supplies of materials that are essential for building social capital and competitive energies.
• We anticipate further synergies through the integration of energy and environmental businesses.
• Deploying Renewal Phase II (covering fiscal 2019–2021) at the Ube Factory of Ube Materials Industries to maintain stable operations and deliver high-added-value for magnesia (fiscal 2019–2021).
• Rolling out environmental measures, aging facilities countermeasures, and efficiency improvements to maintain competitive and stable supplies of energy.
2. Enhance growth strategy
We have positioned fine materials, biomass, and recycling as growth businesses and are pursuing new ideas beyond existing business frameworks to expand by commercializing businesses and generating profits.
• In fine materials, we will lift production capability in MOS-HIGE magnesium oxysulfate whiskers (Thai plant construction started in April 2018, with operations scheduled to begin in fiscal 2020).
• In biomass and recycling, we will expand sales of environmental materials, notably by increasing biomass incinerations at IPP, and are looking to produce polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) over- seas while creating new recycling operations and expanding sales of such environmental materials as neutral stabilizers and heavy metal immobilizers.
ESG-Related Initiatives
Threats
• Sluggish domestic cement demand and increasing thermal energy costs Countermeasures: We will tackle this challenge by constantly revising cement prices while building solid, low-cost operating foundations.
• Tighter environmental regulations
Countermeasures: We will undertake the following energy-saving measures, which aim to (1) deploy high-efficiency facilities,
(2) reuse waste heat, (3) use more biomass fuel in power generation, and (4) streamline kiln operations.

3. Pursue Group synergies
From the beginning of fiscal 2019, the energy & environment business (coal and electricity) have been integrated into the Construction Materials Company. Although operations collaborated closely with cement factories and Group compa- nies, being in the same company should further generate new synergies. These will include maxi- mizing and optimizing the use of waste and bio- mass and more effectively harnessing and devel- oping human resources.
Finally, this fiscal year is the start of our new medium-term management plan. While responding flexibly to business climate changes in the years ahead, we will accelerate independent operational management as a new company and ensure safety, security, stability, and growth.
Self-leveling materials
           • We are installing waste heat power facilities at the Isa Cement Factory that should start operating in February 2020. We plan to install a high-efficiency clinker cooler at the Kanda Factory to begin operation from summer 2020. Together, these measures should reduce annual emissions of CO2, a greenhouse gas, by roughly 80,000 metric tons - CO2e/y.
• We are endeavoring to greenify former limestone quarries. Since fiscal 2008, we have planted citrus trees, ivy, and other vegetation on the slopes of the Kanda Mine. Since fiscal 2011, we have planted wild cherry trees and round leaf holly on the slopes of the Ube Isa Mine.

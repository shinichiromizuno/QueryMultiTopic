ESG: Underpinning Value Creation and Sustainable Growth
Coexisting with Communities
The UBE Group contributes to local communities by working alongside them based on the spirit of coexistence and mutual prosperity that underpins its CSR efforts. This is in recognition that its viability depends heavily on engaging with local residents. Our report this year focuses on interaction between local commu- nities and our support for culture and the arts.
    Responsible Care (RC)* Regional Dialogue Meetings
Local member companies of the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) RC Committee hold biennial RC Regional Dialogue Meetings in each of that entity’s districts to deepen mutual understand- ing with local residents about environmental pres- ervation, process safety and disaster prevention, and other RC activities.
Our chemical factories are committee members in the western Yamaguchi, Sakai/Senboku, and Chiba districts. In fiscal 2017, we explained our activities for the year and exchanged views with participants from industry, government, academia, and the public in the 11th RC Regional Dialogue Meeting in the western Yamaguchi and Sakai/Senboku districts.
There were keynote speeches presented by two of the Graduate School of Sciences and Tech- nology for Innovation faculties at Yamaguchi Uni- versity at the November 2017 gathering in western Yamaguchi. One was by Professor Hiromori Tsutsumi, in which he discussed everything from
The 11th RC Regional Dialogue Meeting in western Yamaguchi
common everyday polymers up to leading-edge polymers. The other was by Associate Professor Takaya, covering the basics of measuring, assess- ing, and formulating measures to address odors and recent developments in this respect.
At the Sakai/Senboku district Regional Dia- logue Meeting in February 2018, a general man- ager of the JCIA’s RC Committee commented
on RC and its communication initiatives. An official from the Citizen Autonomy Promotion Section of Sakai Ward Office finished the proceedings with
a speech on disaster preparedness.
We will continue to focus on regional dialogue and maintain RC activities to foster coexistence and mutual prosperity with communities.
Support for Culture and the Arts in Japan
UBE provides financial and personnel support for the activities of the UBE Foundation and the Wata- nabe Memorial Culture Association. In fiscal 2017, we donated ¥500 million to the Foundation as part of our 120th anniversary celebrations. Since fiscal 2008, we have invited the Japan Philharmonic

  Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
The process safety component of the UBE Group Environmental and Safety Principles for Process Safety states that, “Maintenance of process safety shall be part of the UBE Group’s basic mission as a manufacturer.” We accordingly focus process safety on preparedness for facilities-related acci- dents and major earthquakes. In fiscal 2017, we continued efforts to prevent industrial accidents by focusing on key measures in our fiscal 2017 action plan. These efforts entailed continuing to share accident data and confirm its impact, using information to enhance internal process safety
Occupational Safety and Health
Measures to Prevent Occupational Accidents
Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven corpo- rate culture, encompassing eight elements.
These are organizational governance, positive involvement, resource management, work man- agement, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual under- standing. We are examining existing activities in light of these elements, and are stepping up efforts to tackle and overcome weak areas.

  Using Resources Effectively
Our cement factories recycle diverse waste and by-products as raw materials (material recycling) and alternative fuels (thermal recycling). Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conven- tional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possi- ble to use ash from incineration as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.

Overview of Waste and By-Products Usage Flows during Cement Production
In fiscal 2017, our three cement factories harnessed 3.30 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.91 million metric tons of which we sourced externally, contributing considerably to a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new businesses to use waste materials in applications other than as mate- rials for cement. In fiscal 2017, for example, we began recycling plasterboard, for which we expect demand to increase. We will continue to boost our capacity for handling various waste as part of efforts to expand our recycling business.

 Reducing Industrial Waste and Chemical Substance Emissions
Industrial Waste Reductions
The Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) Volun- tary Action Plan on the Environment targets a 70% reduction in the final disposal volume of industrial waste from fiscal 2000 levels by fiscal 2020. We strive through industry-led initiatives to recycle industrial waste and reduce final disposal waste
to contribute to a recycling-based economy.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2017, we lowered such waste by 84% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeavor- ing to cut volumes from fiscal 2018.
Reducing Chemical Substance Emissions
The Japanese government is driving efforts to cut chemical substance emissions through a combina- tion of legislation and voluntary initiatives. Voluntary efforts include industry initiatives to constrain emis- sions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)*1 and a system to disclose substances based on the PRTR Law*2.
In terms of the UBE Group’s activities, 20 sub- stances*3, which it emits in relatively large amounts, were voluntarily selected from substances subject to the PRTR Law as well as VOCs. We will focus on the Group’s emissions of these substances and strive to reduce them.
Minimizing VOC Emissions
Our industry reached the Japanese government’s targets for VOC emissions constraints by fiscal 2010, thereafter continuing efforts. The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2017 were 38% lower than those in fiscal 2010.
Reducing PRTR Substances
We handle 68 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2017 were down 30% from fiscal 2010.

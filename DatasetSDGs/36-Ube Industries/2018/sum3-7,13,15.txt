Opportunities
• We will integrate production, sales, and logis- tics to cater to rising demand, particularly in urban areas, to generate solid earnings.
• We will maintain profitability by stably supplying materials that are vital for building social capital.
• We will optimize synergies by deploying a wide range of Groupwide businesses based on limestone.
Challenges
• Minimize profitability impacts of rising coal and heavy oil costs by streamlining operations and revising prices.
• Over the medium and long terms, uphold and reinforce the profitability of core businesses, bolster and extend our growth strategies, and maintain and enhance our operational infrastructure.
• Accelerate and strengthen efforts to address energy and environmental issues.
Strengths
• We maintain a solid infrastructural setup through our coal and power supply structure and large port facilities.
• We can optimize Group synergies through our diverse Groupwide product businesses.
• We are able to harness a wide range of waste substances and draw on our advanced techni- cal capabilities to conserve resources.
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2018
Our cement and construction materials are vital elements of social infrastructure, and by integrating production, sales, and logistics we can maintain profitability by stabilizing supplies of our offerings.
Although we anticipate construction related to the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games to generate some demand in fiscal 2018, the high costs of coal and heavy oil will likely drive significantly higher manufacturing expenses.
We will tackle these challenges by reconfirming our objectives and achievements and pursuing our goals under our medium-term management plan to fulfill our vision.
Maintain and strengthen the profitability of core businesses
• Install waste heat power generation facilities at the
Isa Factory to help cut costs and rationalize opera- tions (we started work in fiscal 2017 and plan to make these facilities operational in fiscal 2019).
      We will continue to support the Group
as a core infrastructure business by identifying,
demonstrating, and bolstering our inherent strengths.

    • Set up fourth-stage waste plastic treatment facili- ties at the Isa Factory to expand the use of waste products (work began in fiscal 2017 with a view to facilities going on line in fiscal 2018).
• Secure limestone resources by developing the Kanayamadai mining zone (mining scheduled to start in fiscal 2018).
• Upgrade the Ube Factory of UBE Material Indus- tries, Ltd., to rationalize production. (work began in fiscal 2016 and is scheduled to finish in fiscal 2019)
• Develop new organic construction materials products for construction and infrastructure.
• Optimize Group synergies by reinforcing collabo- ration between Group companies and rebuilding and integrating operations (we consolidated the construction materials business at Ube Industries in April 2018).
Bolster and extend our growth strategies
• Expand our business area by reinforcing over- seas operations (we reinforced ties with a stable buyer of cement exports and in April 2018 began constructing a Thai factory for MOS-HIGE, an automotive filler, with operations scheduled to start in fiscal 2019.
• Expand our business domains by increasing sales of environmental offerings including neutral solidifying materials and heavy metal insolubilized
Our cement factories recycle diverse waste and by-products as raw materials and they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. Thus,
we are contributing to a recycling-oriented society.
Ready-mixed concrete
Self-leveling materials
   ESG-Related Initiatives
materials, enter the gypsum board recycling busi- ness, and develop and commercialize new prod- ucts and technologies.
Maintain and enhance our operational infrastructure
• In addition to strengthening R&D, cultivate human resources while building a management structure that remains robust in times of change, thereby enhancing our six operating fundamentals of earnings and capital, facilities, R&D, personnel development, information systems, and environmental safety.
This fiscal year, we will plan our next medium-term management plan. In the current business climate, we will endeavor to maintain and increase profits in existing businesses while clarifying specific approaches to expanding our business domains and areas. At the same time, we will act decisively to identify, demonstrate, and bolster our inherent strengths.
 • Following a move by the Kanda Factory, we decided to install waste heat power generation and waste plastic treatment facilities at the Isa Factory. These measures should lower annual greenhouse gas emissions by 90,000 metric tons.
• We are endeavoring to greenify former limestone quarries. Since fiscal 2008, we have planted citrus trees, ivy, and other vegetation on the slopes of the Kanda Mine. Since fiscal 2011, we have planted wild cherry trees and round leaf holly on the slopes of the Ube Isa Mine.

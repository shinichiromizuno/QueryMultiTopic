   Initiatives to Create Value and Drive Sustainable Growth
Business Strategies of Energy & Environment
Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Help strengthen UBE Group earnings by
maintaining stable supplies of competitive energy (coal and electricity).
• Strengthen and enhance our infrastructure to drive sustainable growth.

Business Strategies for Fiscal 2018
While CO2 emissions are a drawback, coal is positioned as an essential energy source under the Japanese government’s energy policies. The Energy & Environment segment’s main business is coal and coal-fired thermal power generation, and it is a key challenge for us to address the needs of a low-carbon economy while maintaining stable supplies of this competitive energy source.
We will tackle these challenges by increasing the operating efficiency of our coal centers and power plants. We will thereby enhance the inherent competitiveness of coal as an energy source for internal and external users, and consider it vital to use more biomass fuels for co-firing with coal to ameliorate CO2 emissions. We therefore recently decided to construct wood briquette fuel demon- stration facilities in the Ube area.
It is easy to co-fire this fuel with coal, and
we will use our coal centers and power plants to demonstrate a business model in which we mix, transport, crush and co-fire this fuel with coal. We thereby aim to position the Energy & Environment segment to accommodate social needs even in a low-carbon economy.

Opportunities
• Import and sales
• Coal center (storage and distribution)
• Independent power producer (IPP) • In-house power plant
  • Start demonstrating a business model that harnesses wood briquette fuel to help lower environmental impact.
• The coal and coal-fired thermal power genera- tion business can become more efficient and a stable source of competitive energy.
Challenges
• Respond to and contribute to a low-carbon economy.
• Manage facilities more efficiently.
Strengths
• Our infrastructure, including our ports, the nation’s largest coal center, power stations, and internal and external user networks.
• The cost competitiveness of our private and IPP plants, which have achieved the thermal power generating efficiency required under the Energy Conservation Act.
  We will create energy and environment businesses that do not harm social value, even in
  a low-carbon economy.

 ESG-Related Initiatives
  • We will build on efforts to lower environmental impact in addition to our biomass and solar power and micro-hydropower operations, by starting wood briquette fuel production to push forward with biomass fuel usage.

  Initiatives to Create Value and Drive Sustainable Growth
Business Strategies of Chemicals
Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Generate at least ¥20 billion in operating profit.
• Spend management resources on expanding nylon, synthetic rubber, LIB separator, and high-performance coating businesses.
• Create unique value by integrating diverse materials and technologies.
• Strengthen and develop global marketing capabilities.
• Quickly materialize development themes through seamless cooperation among research, development, technology, production, and business.
Synthetic rubber
        Principal Products and Businesses
• Leverage information and communication technology (ICT) and cultivate human resources to solidify business underpinnings.
Strengths
• Our broad lineup extends from our core nylon and caprolactam product chain to specialty and fine products.
• We integrate diverse materials and technolo- gies to supply differentiated products and services worldwide.
• We have the technology and manufacturing know-how to meet sophisticated customer needs as a trusted joint development partner.
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2018
We aim to achieve or exceed ¥20 billion in operat- ing profit, which is the final year’s target of our three-year medium-term management plan.
Our strategy for the medium and long terms is to shift from commodity products that are vulnera- ble to market fluctuations to unique and added- value products, as well as products and services that provide customer solutions. We would thereby strengthen profitability and transform the business structure into one that can deliver steady growth even in business climate changes.
While the caprolactam market conditions should remain favorable in the near term owing to such factors as Chinese environmental regulations and raw materials shortages, we expect profit

Opportunities
• Nylon resin
• Caprolactam
• Industrial chemicals
• Battery materials (Electrolytes and separators)
• Fine chemicals
• High-purity chemicals
• Polyimide
• Ceramics
• Separation membranes
• Tyranno Fiber®
• Telecommunications devices
     • Large-scale investments in fiscal 2017 should contribute to earnings growth.
• Sales are projected to rise for specialty prod- ucts, battery materials, and fine chemicals, with market conditions remaining favorable.
• In view of buoyant demand for LiB separators, we aim to significantly boost production and earnings of both raw films and coated films.
Challenges
• Improve quality assurance system and strengthen risk management and internal controls.
• Respond to strong demand by stabilizing production and minimizing avoidable losses.

Due to regular shutdown maintenance at the Fujimagari Factory of ammonia, we expect manu- facturing costs to rise because of higher mainte- nance expenses. Nonetheless, we seek to exceed the medium-term management plan’s target oper- ating profit through contributions from new facilities, increasing operation rates for existing facilities, and boosting sales volumes.
Particularly, we will harvest from major past investments for new nylon plants in Spain, for new LiB separator plants in Japan, for cyclohexanone production by phenolic processes, and for expan- sion of large-crystal ammonium sulfate production. For existing facilities such as for polyimide and gas separation membranes, we seek to expand sales by utilizing available capacities.
Active Growth Businesses
As for the synthetic rubber business, we plan to strengthen collaboration among manufacturing units in Thailand, Malaysia, and China. At the same time, we will explore local needs and make our best efforts to create customer value through differentia- tion and specialization.
We aim to fully reap the contribution from nylon plant capacity expansion in Spain last fiscal year. With regard to LiB separators, we expanded capacity at the Sakai Factory to meet customer demand growth. We will lower costs to further enhance profitability.
ESG-Related Initiatives
As for high-performance coatings, we will accelerate our global expansion and reinforce our proposal-oriented business model through collaboration with customers while cutting costs to improve earnings.
Restructuring Businesses
We have greatly improved the profitability of the polyimide business due to the demand growth for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and other products. We will keep trying to lift earnings from film and varnish by improving technologies for stable production while cutting costs. As for the LiB electrolyte business, we will strive to swiftly benefit from business integration with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation in China.
Regarding the administration side, we will strengthen management through the establish- ment of key performance indicators (KPIs) so we can respond swiftly to changes in the business climate and reach our earnings goals.
Reinforcing Our Management Foundation
We will prepare for the start of our next medium-term management plan by allocating management resources to key themes such as overhauling our quality management systems, reinforcing risk management and internal con- trols, leveraging ICT, and developing human resources.
Nylon resin
    • We adopted a new manufacturing method for cyclohexanone, an intermediate raw material for caprolactam. We thereby look to reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 190,000 metric tons. We will continue to develop and select processes that help safeguard the environment.
• We will supply products that lower environmental impact and contribute to society. Such offerings include eco-friendly high-performance coating materials, synthetic rubber and nylon that improve the fuel economy and lower the weight of automobiles, battery materials for electric and hybrid vehicles, and separation membranes for fuel cell vehicles.

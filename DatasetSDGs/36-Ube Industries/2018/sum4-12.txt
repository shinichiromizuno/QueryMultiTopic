Industrial Machinery Business
• Reach quality, cost, and delivery levels suitable for large IPP projects.
• Draw on core technologies (combustion, pulveri- zation, and materials handling) to develop new products and technologies for the environmental and recycling markets.
Steel Products Business
• Establish a structure to raise monthly billet pro- duction capacity to 30,000 metric tons and expand recycling operations.

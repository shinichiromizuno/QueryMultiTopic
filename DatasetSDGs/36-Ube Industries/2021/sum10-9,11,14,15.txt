Construction Materials
Principal Products and Businesses
• Cement, ready-mixed concrete
• Biomass, industrial waste recycling
• Building materials (Self-leveling materials, waterproofing materials, and renovation)
• Magnesia and calcia
• Fine materials
• Energy (Coal and electricity)
Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Strengthen our business infrastructure and cultivate strategic growth businesses
• Create an optimal business management system by integrating the cement and related businesses with those of Mitsubishi Materials
• Become more competitive in a decarbonized economy
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2021
Our construction materials are essential for society. We expect to remain profitable in the years ahead by expanding new businesses on top of stable business foundations. In fiscal 2021, however,
we expect domestic demand for cement to rise minimally despite a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. This is because of operational and construction delays stemming from labor
shortages and a sluggish recovery in housing demand. We expect steel and automobile produc- tion unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels.
At the same time, the business environment for our core products will likely remain adverse owing to rising energy prices amid tighter supplies and accel- erating moves to realize a decarbonized economy.
It is against this backdrop that we will work to respond to the present market demand based on stable production and undertake existing measures. We will also prepare for business integration with Mitsubishi Materials and tackle environmental issues. We will capitalize on changes in the business environment to build solid business foundations for tomorrow.

Senior Managing Executive Officer Company President,
Construction Materials Company
We will steadily prepare to integrate our cement and related businesses with those
of Mitsubishi Materials Corporation while stepping up our responses to global environmental issues
and endeavoring to build solid business foundations for the future.
       Strengthen business foundations and cultivate strategic growth businesses
We will improve profitability while building a stable operational structure and conserving energy and costs in cement, ready-mixed concrete, magnesia and calcia, and energy operations.
We have positioned fine materials, biomass, and recycling as growth businesses and are pursuing new ideas beyond existing business frameworks to expand by commercializing businesses and generating profits.
• We will cut energy and costs by installing a highly efficient clinker cooler at the Kanda Cement Factory, which should become operational in March 2023. We will set up Phase III waste plastic facilities at the Ube Cement Factory, which will begin operations
in October 2021.
• We are deploying Renewal Phase II (covering fiscal
2019–2021) at the Ube Factory of Ube Material Industries to maintain stable operations and deliver high added value for magnesia.
• We are rolling out environmental measures for
our coal center and power generation facilities, deploying measures for aging facilities, and improv- ing efficiency to maintain competitive and stable supplies of energy.
• In fine materials, we will strengthen sales and development for MOS-HIGE, magnesium oxysulfate whiskers, while cultivating new projects, lowering costs, and expanding applications.
• In biomass and recycling, we will expand sales
of environmental materials, notably by increasing biomass incinerations at IPPs, and are looking to produce Pelletizing Before Torrefaction overseas while creating new recycling operations and expanding sales of such environmental materials as neutral solidification materials and heavy metal immobilizers.
Preparing to integrate operations with those of Mitsubishi Materials
Both companies fully concurred that full integration, including of production units, would be necessary
to maintain a competitive edge and to uphold a cycle of investing management
resources in growth areas
in a changing business environment.
UBE, Mitsubishi Materials, and UBE-MITSUBISHI CEMENT CORPORATION will continue to explore ways to swiftly optimize synergies by April 2022 of the full integration.
Tackling environmental issues
In April 2020, we launched a project to combat global warming as a cross-company unit run from the new Global Warming Countermeasures Group to steer efforts to conserve energy, convert waste to energy, and use more renewables while helping develop new technologies.
• Install energy-saving facilities and expand the use of fossil energy alternatives to reach our (construction materials) fiscal 2030 target of reducing GHG emis- sions from fiscal 2013 levels by 15%.
• Expand torrefied pellets, palm kernel shell, and other biomass fuel businesses.
• Broaden range of environmentally friendly products.
• Undertake R&D into low-carbon materials, new fuel
usage, carbon dioxide capture and storage with utilization, and other areas.
Finally, fiscal 2021 will be a term in which we complete our medium-term management plan
and integrate operations with those of Mitsubishi Materials. We will prepare thoroughly for that move while pushing ahead flexibly and fast with steps to overcome an adverse business climate and build solid underpinnings for the future.
ESG-Related Initiatives
As well as implementing the above measures to combat global warming, we are also taking the following steps to tackle the issue of marine plastic waste, conserve water resources, and preserve biodiversity.
• We are developing materials that enhance the performance of biodegradable plastics while providing agents to enhance water and sediment quality.
• We are endeavoring to greenify former
limestone quarries. Since fiscal 2008, we
have planted citrus trees, ivy, and other
vegetation on the slopes of the Kanda Mine. Since fiscal 2011, we have planted wild cherry trees and round leaf holly on the slopes of the Ube Isa Mine.

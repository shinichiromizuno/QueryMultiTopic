 SWOT Analysis
Strengths Weaknesses
        • We have a robust record in serving the automotive, electric power, cement, steelmaking, and other
key sectors, and have earned solid customer reputations for our efforts.
• We can draw on numerous domestic and overseas operations to cater to customer needs in everything from development through after-service.
• We have large processing facilities and skilled engineers and workers.
• Slow to take advantage of ICT because our business is based on manufacturing to order
Countermeasures: We have accordingly launched an ICT project to enhance product development and production efficiency.
       Opportunities Threats
• Customer needs and requests are diversifying as target markets globalize.
• An extremely responsive global service and support framework is increasingly essential.
• There is a growing need for technologies that help lighten the weight of automobiles and contribute to the environmentally friendly product and resource recycling fields.
• A sudden global economic slowdown could drive consolidations in key markets. Countermeasures: We will leverage our strengths to reinforce our competitiveness and lift our presence when demand recovers.
• The global economy will remain lackluster owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying a recovery in capital equipment demand and intensifying price and delivery competition. Countermeasures: We will cut product costs and shorten production lead times
to secure business opportunities when
a recovery materializes.

Business Strategies for Fiscal 2021
An economic slowdown that started with China—American trade friction and the subsequent pandemic have affected global capital investments. The global business climate remains adverse in the automotive, electric power, cement, steelmaking, shipbuilding, and other key markets for the company, and we expect competition to intensify. We will clarify our outlook for the recovery period and further reinforce our business structure.
Molding Machinery Business
In anticipation of a demand recovery, we will
cut costs to be a winner in each product market, shorten production lead times, and focus on developing products that match market needs while strengthening our business structure.
In die-cast machinery, we are developing and launching new products and processes that cater to a fast-growing need for lighter automobiles and vehicle electrification. We are integrating and reor- ganizing domestic and overseas injection molding
         We will urgently establish our infrastructure
and reinforce our business structure
to materialize our vision.

machinery business sites. We will also build an integrated and optimal global production structure and thereby streamline operations and reinforce competitiveness while launching new offerings for the global market.
Industrial Machinery Business
In fiscal 2021, we will continue to focus on control- ling processes and costs in projects for which
we have already received orders, principally from domestic electric power companies. We will accel- erate efforts to develop environmental equipment and new products in light of a growing market recognition of a need to becoming more environ- mentally responsive.
In bridges, we will contribute to sustainable development of infrastructure through proposing of bridges more environmentally friendly and resilient.
Machinery Services Business
In injection molding machines, we will reinforce our capabilities in the United States, China, and else- where in Asia by training and hiring more local employees overseas and otherwise strengthening our structure while expanding our parts supply capabilities. In industrial machinery, we will strengthen alliances to bolster services proposal activities overseas, and will strive to expand our business by providing support for the products of other companies. Also, we will push ahead with
services such as providing remote support to construction sites utilizing ICT.
Steel Products Business
We expect the business climate to remain adverse in fiscal 2021 owing to the global economic down- turn and excess production capacity. We have accordingly harnessed our manufacturing capacity in specialty, niche, and large offerings in which we have a competitive edge, to keep shifting to an optimal business structure through which we have switched from quantity to quality. We will continue striving to create a stable profit structure.
  ESG-Related Initiatives
• Companies in the Machinery segment are focusing on developing products that help protect the environment while providing services that apply
to existing facilities.
• In the steel products business, the
company completely melts the industrial and medical waste in manufacturing processes, and is endeavoring to make environmental recycling a third core business.

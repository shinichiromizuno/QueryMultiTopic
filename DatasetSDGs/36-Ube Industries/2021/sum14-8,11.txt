Measures to Prevent Occupational Accidents
Pointing and Calling
Eliminating Major Disasters
We have undertaken a range of activities to prevent occupational accidents. In fiscal 2018,
we initiated efforts that centered on eliminating major incidents. We conduct risk assessments
of work that is highly susceptible to serious acci- dents. We implement systematic risk reduction measures and endeavor to make operations inher- ently safe. From fiscal 2020, we undertook safety activities with partner companies* that we added as a priority item.
We investigate the causes of all incidents regardless of whether they result in lost time, striving to prevent similar incidents by assessing and rolling out measures.
Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven corpo- rate culture, encompassing eight elements. These are organizational governance, positive involve- ment, resource management, work management, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual understanding. In keeping with findings from assessments based
on headquartersâ€™ evaluation standards, business sites identify issues and formulate and execute plans to cultivate a safety culture as part of ongoing improvement efforts.

Glossary
We endeavor to eliminate process accidents through initiatives that ensure our facilities are
safe and secure. We also undertake activities to minimize damage in the event of major natural disasters. In fiscal 2020, we focused on compre- hensive measures to address the risks of accidents at aging facilities, improving safety at certified high-pressure gas sites, and implementing
natural disaster measures.
Measures to address the risks of accidents at
aging facilities entail each business site inspecting and assessing aging facilities and formulating
improvement plans. We have rolled out initiatives to prevent electrical equipment problems that have arisen in recent years from recurring. By undertak- ing comprehensive risk measures, we endeavor
to build business sites that are impervious to accidents.
For certified high-pressure gas sites, we set
up an improvement agenda in line with assessment findings from the Japan Safety Competency Center and engage in systematic improvement initiatives.
We push ahead with measures to address natu- ral disasters by having each business site conduct self-assessments in line with self-assessment criteria for such measures, and pursue ongoing improvements. We also respond to the Industrial Process Safety Action Plan of the Japan Petrochemical Industry Association.

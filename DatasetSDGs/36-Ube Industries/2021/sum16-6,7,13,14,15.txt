Environmental Issues
Initiatives to Address Environmental Issues
In April 2020, we identified four aspects of global environmental issues for which we have formulated a unified Group stance. These are tackling global warming, dealing with marine plastic waste, protect- ing biodiversity, and safeguarding water resources.
We now seek to generate at least 50% of consolidated net sales from environmentally friendly products and technologies by fiscal 2030.
levels by fiscal 2030. We will focus on developing technologies to recover and use CO2, thereby helping lower the overall GHG emissions of our supply chain.
• Creating and Expanding New Products and Technologies to Help Reduce Environmental Impact
We have reached the fiscal 2021 target ratio of
the sales of such products and technologies to net sales in fiscal 2020, one year ahead of the target year. Going forward, we aim for 50% or more by fiscal 2030.
(2) Dealing with Marine Plastic Waste
We use waste plastics as a source of energy for cement production, helping reduce the volume of this material going to landfills. We help prevent plastic from being discarded and flowing into the oceans by conducting
cleaning along the industrial roads around our plants.

Factory collects plastic
and other waste along
the Kotou River each
June as part of Environ-
ment Month and the Seto
Inland Seawater Conser-
vation Month. The Chiba Petrochemical Factory removes polyethylene pellets from wastewater and collects them at the final wastewater treatment facility. It regularly cleans one kilometer of roads

Goals and Initiatives
Generate at least 50% of consolidated net sales from environmentally friendly products and technologies by fiscal 2030
Provide materials and products that help reduce and recover GHG emissions
Develop and provide materials and prod- ucts that help resolve issues with plastic waste
Help safeguard the environment and conserve biodiversity through business activities
Help conserve water by properly using and managing these resources
Set targets for cutting GHG emissions as key environmental challenges
Global warming countermeasures
Targets
Reduce GHG emissions by 17% by fiscal 2030 (Chemicals: 20% reduction) (from fiscal 2013 levels)
Polyethylene pellet collection equipment at Chiba Petrochem- ical Factory
     within its premises. Approximately 100 employees from UBE Film, Ltd., take part in local cleanups each year, with 50 of them helping clean up plant environs once a month. UBE Steel Co., Ltd., uses high-temperature electric furnaces to melt steel scrap as a key raw material for mainstay billets and castings. It also melts glass and waste plastics at high temperatures during manufacturing processes to dispose of waste and use resources effectively.
(3) Safeguarding Biodiversity and Conserving Water Resources
• Private Business Partnership to Preserve Biodiversity
We support the Declara-
tion of Biodiversity by
Keidanren (Japan Busi-
ness Federation) and take
part in its Business and
Biodiversity Partnership.
The Chiba Petrochemical
Factory participates in
Chiba Prefecture’s biodiversity conservation activi- ties to help preserve the Japanese white pine*, growing this tree on its premises.
* The Japanese white pine in the Boso Hills is an extremely valuable cold season relic, but the local population of these trees has rapidly declined, prompting the Chiba prefectural government to designate it a most important protected species and undertake steps to both protect it and restore numbers.
• Forest Conservation Initiatives
In fiscal 2020, 54 employees volunteered to take part in the 13th Forest Creation Experiential Activity for Water Conservation, thinning and logging bamboo.
Although we had to reduce the number of participants and shorten the activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this annual initiative is held for employees of companies using the Kotou River system in Yamaguchi Prefecture. It helps forests retain water and educates participants about the links between water and forests.
Officials from the Mine Agriculture and Forestry Office lectured participants about the benefits of forest conservation, deepening their understanding about the environment and the importance of conservation.

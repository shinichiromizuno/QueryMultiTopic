Suppressing Chemical Substance Emissions
Scope of data: UBE’s domestic factories and laboratories and major domestic consolidated subsidiaries with factories (please see note)
The chemical industry complies with laws and regulations while endeavoring to voluntarily cut chemical substance emissions through a disclosure program based on the PRTR Law*1. The UBE Group chose 20 substances whose emissions

Released into the atmosphere
 We handle 66 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2020 were down 37% from fiscal 2010.
Suppressing VOC Emissions
The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2020 were 37% lower than those in fiscal 2010.

 are significant*2 from substances subject to the PRTR Law, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)*3. We positioned them as key substances Companywide. By fiscal 2021, we aim to lower their emissions by 37% from the fiscal 2010 level.
In fiscal 2020, we lowered emissions of these 20 substances by 29% from the fiscal 2010 level, suppressing emissions subject to the PRTR Law and VOC emissions.

 Reducing Industrial Waste
Scope of data: UBE’s domestic factories and laboratories and major domestic consolidated subsidiaries with factories (please see note)
The Japanese government’s 4th Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society targets a 77% reduction in industrial waste landfill amounts from 2000 levels by 2025. As
part of efforts to contribute to a recycling-based society, the UBE Group has set a target of reduc- ing external landfill volumes by 83% from the fiscal 2000 level by fiscal 2021, and is accordingly endeavoring to recycle industrial waste and cut landfill volume.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2020, we lowered such waste by 81% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeavor- ing to cut volumes from fiscal 2021.

*2 UBE’s 20 voluntarily selected chemical substances: Please see page 2 of the 2021 Integrated Report Supplementary Information (Environment and Safety).
*3 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): These organic chemicals evaporate or sublimate easily, entering the atmosphere as gases. They are factors in the forming of suspended
particulate matter (PM) and photochemical oxidant pollution.

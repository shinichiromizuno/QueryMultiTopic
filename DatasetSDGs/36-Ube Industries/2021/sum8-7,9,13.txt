 Tyranno Fiber®
SWOT Analysis  Strengths Weaknesses
• We maintain a lineup of prod- ucts in diverse business fields that draw on proprietary raw materials production and processing technologies that have unique characteristics according to their applications including for niche markets.
• Our production technology exper- tise is a key strength in specialty products, but while we have expanded, principally in Japan, our investment returns are deteri- orating in some projects. We are considering expanding overseas.
• We need to amply consider export control for functional (specialty) products.
Threats
• Notwithstanding high barriers to entry for functional products, competition could intensify as markets expand. We are relent- lessly developing products that match demand and have distinctive features that set them apart from rival offerings   Opportunities
• Demand is rising constantly in electronic components and electronic materials for which we anticipate market expansion, fueling higher performance requirements, and we have ample technological capabili- ties to cater to such needs.
• We offer diverse environmen- tally friendly products.          Polyimide

Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Expand primarily in high-quality electronic compo- nent substrates, organic electroluminescent display materials, and raw materials for semicon- ductor production that leverage the capabilities
of extremely heat-resistant polyimide
• Stably supply polyimide films and varnishes in response to a steadily increasing need for organic electroluminescent display materials
• Expand sales of environmentally friendly products employing proprietary technologies, notably sepa- ration membranes and silicon nitride powder
• Design and supply separators matching battery performance requirements to keep pace with rapidly growing demand
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2021
While in fiscal 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic caused automobile production to decline tempo- rarily, affecting our battery materials business, our performance in that area was basically on target, with electronic components driving demand.
In fiscal 2021, we are positioning polyimide as a premier product for electronic components and digitization products. It will be vital to promptly

construct a plant to lift production of biphenyltetra- carboxylic dianhydride (BPDA), a raw material. We will keep maximizing supplies by lowering losses in production efficiency and quality. In semiconduc- tors, we will review our production system in response to rising demand for boron trichloride, an etching gas. In environmentally friendly prod- ucts, we are planning to expand our biofuel purifi- cation separation membranes. Over the medium to long terms, we aim to expand the business of fuel cell modules, in which we have a solid record, mainly for larger FCVs, thereby contributing to the environment.
We have pushed ahead with digitizing processes, primarily to bolster our quality control systems. In fiscal 2020, we finished downstream conversions to make factory facilities smarter for some specialty products. We will roll these systems out in the years ahead.
ESG-Related Initiatives
• We will contribute to society by deliv- ering products that help reduce envi- ronmental impact. Among them are battery components, motor insulation, heat dissipation substrates, and other functional components for automotive electrification. They also include alter- natives to metal for the fuel-efficient aircraft of tomorrow, as well as fuel decarbonization by recovering methane gas from waste.
             We will focus on expanding digitization and environmentally friendly products for offerings in specialty areas.

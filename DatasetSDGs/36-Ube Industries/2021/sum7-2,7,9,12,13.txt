DMC manufacturing plant
contributes to realization of the Sustainable Devel- opment Goals (SDGs) by conducting development across units in Japan, Thailand, and Spain.
We have started exploring process digitization to optimize production, sales, and inventory planning and streamline sales through global data integration.
ESG-Related Initiatives
• We will contribute to a sustainable and prosperous economy through diverse products and services that help lower environmental impact. These include nylon that helps cut food losses in food packaging film, composites for fuel cell vehicle (FCV) hydrogen tanks and for helping lighten automobiles, and large-crystal ammonium sulfate that contributes to sustainable agriculture. Among others are eco-friendly C1 chemical chain and high-performance coatings, and technological development efforts related to the use of CO2 and recycling.

Business Strategies for Fiscal 2021
Large-crystal ammonium sulfate
     In nylon, we will explore optimizing our global polymerization capacity and product lineup to stabilize earnings. In composites, we will consoli- date sales and development at the Osaka Research & Development Center and reinforce marketing for the development of high-value-added products. In high-performance coatings, we will globally expand business of polycarbonate diol (PCD) and polyurethane dispersion (PUD). In
the C1 chemical chain, we will continue mulling production sites in the United States, Europe,
and China that deploy the C1 chemical chain worldwide, centered on dimethyl carbonate (DMC), for which we expect demand to expand as a raw material for lithium-ion battery (LiB) electrolyte, as an eco-friendly solvent, and as a raw material for PCD. We will expand large-crystal ammonium sulfate for fertilizer as a specialty business that

Human Resources
The UBE Group considers employees its most important resource for supporting sustainable growth. Accordingly, one of our management policies prizes people. We formulated the UBE Group Human Resources Management
Guidelines to motivate employees to do their best.
Details about the Group’s human resources management and strategies are available on the UBE Group’s website: https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/en/sustainability/laborrights/laborrights.html
 Diversity and Inclusion and Workplace Reforms
We have committed ourselves to diversity and inclusion* to foster a creative, enterprising corporate culture. In 2013, we established a diversity unit to champion women’s advancement by diversifying human resources while reforming work practices.
Addressing the Gender Gap
As of March 31, 2021, 8.4% of parent company employees were women, up from 8.1% a year earlier. Women represented 2.8% of our manage- ment pool, compared with 2.6% a year earlier. In fiscal 2019, we launched a three-year action plan based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Partici- pation and Advancement in the Workplace. The plan encompasses the following three benchmarks to create work environments that empower women. (1) A paid vacation usage rate of 80% or more
(2) At least 70% of eligible male employees taking childcare leave
Female Employee Activity Benchmarks
Women as percentage of new graduate hires Proportion of female employees
Proportion of women in managerial posts
(3) Women representing at least 20% of new grad- uate hires for generalist positions
Our efforts thus far have enabled women to broaden their career horizons and become frontline employees in a range of workplaces. Most of our female employees return to work after maternity leave. As well, the number of male and female employees balancing childcare and professional commitments is rising each year.

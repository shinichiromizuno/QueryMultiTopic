      Chemicals Business
Growth
as a chemicals company, transforming its business structure and specializing to shift to a structure that is less energy-intensive and less vulnerable to market fluctuations and building a resilient business portfolio with growth potential. UBE will broaden its global scale and drive the UBE Group’s expansion by allocating resources to priority businesses and products. Among them are fine chemicals, including high-performance coatings, nylon composites, separation membranes and other polyimide-related products, and peripheral fields.
 After integration to create the new company, the cement business will contribute to the UBE Group as an equity-method affiliate by leveraging synergies to enhance profitability. UBE will pursue further growth
      Fine Chemicals
•1 Including lithium-ion battery (LiB) materials, semiconductor materials, raw materials for polyurethane and polyester resins, intermediate raw materials for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and fragrances
•2 Globally and domestically unique specialty offerings including C1 chemical products from proprietary nitrite technology, divalent phenol products, C12 chemical products, and amine products
•3 In C1 chemicals, developing licensing business in China for technology to produce monoethylene glycol from dimethyl oxalate and looking to establish dimethyl carbonate production sites in China and the United States to drive global C1 chemical chain expansion
   Polyimide
•1 COF films for displays, polyimide for flexible circuit boards and flexible display circuit boards
•2 World’s only manufacturer integrating production from biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride
(BPDA) monomers
 Separation Membranes
•1 Separating and recovering CO2, H2, N2, dehumidification, dehydration of bioalcohol, and other gases and vapor
•2 Japan’s sole gas separation membrane manufacturer with a sophisticated separation technology that helps realize a green society
    Glossary
* Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): These organic chemicals evaporate or sublimate easily, entering the atmosphere as gases. They are factors in the forming of suspended particulate matter (PM) and photochemical oxidant pollution.

    Initiatives to Become Carbon Neutral by 2050
 From fiscal 2022, the UBE Group will shift to a new business structure, with Ube Industries taking on the chemicals business, Mitsubishi UBE Cement Corporation taking on the construction materials business, and UBE Machinery Corporation, Ltd. taking on the machinery business. Our operations will continue striving to become carbon neutral in light of the Japanese government’s commitment to such a goal for the nation overall. Please see page 15 for details.
• Construction Materials Company We invested heavily in waste heat power generation facili- ties that became operational at the Isa Factory in January 2020 and high-efficiency clinker coolers that should go online at the Kanda Factory in fiscal 2022. We are also continuing to undertake decarbonization initiatives, such as to step up the use of plastic and other wastes as thermal and energy alternatives. We set up the cross-company Global Warming Countermeasures Project organization in April 2021, and are accelerating the assessment of efforts to attain carbon neutrality. At the same time, we are implementing the following initiatives.
        Fiscal 2020 results
• Converted clinker cooler bag filter exhaust fans to inverter setups at Isa Factory
• Upgraded to energy-saving facilities
• Increased use of biomass fuel for indepen- dent power producer (IPP) setup
• Upgraded to energy-saving facilities Approx. 94,200 metric tons

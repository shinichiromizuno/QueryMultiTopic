ESG: Underpinning Value Creation and Sustainable Growth
Using Resources Effectively
  Our cement factories recycle diverse waste and by-products as raw materials for cement and ther- mal energy alternatives. Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possible to use ash from inciner- ation as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.
In fiscal 2020, our three cement factories harnessed 3.19 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.84 million metric tons of which we
sourced externally, contribut- ing considerably to a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new
businesses to use waste
materials in applications other
than as materials for cement.
For example, we are recycling waste plasterboard and exploring the use of sewage sludge, a biomass resource. We will continue to boost our capacity for handling various waste as part of efforts to expand our resource recycling business.
Please see Non-Financial Highlights on page 3 for details of our usage of waste substances and by-products.

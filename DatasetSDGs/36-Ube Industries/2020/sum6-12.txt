Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Develop products and cultivate markets in response to the need for lighter automobiles and the emergence of EVs (die-cast and extrusion).
• Globally integrate business operations and reinforce overseas sales expansion associated with a business integration (injection molding).
• Enter new markets for environmentally friendly products and resource recycling (industrial machinery). • Reinforce services and support capabilities at overseas service sites (machinery services).
Principal Products and Businesses
• Molding machines (Die-casting machines, extrusion presses, and injection molding machines)
• Industrial machinery (Kilns, vertical mills, transportation systems, water screen equipment, and crushers), bridges, deck machinery, grab buckets
• Machinery services
• Steel products (Billets and castings)
• Control boards
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2020
An economic slowdown that started with Sino-American trade friction has affected global capital investments. The global business climate remains adverse in the automotive, electric power,
Injection molding machines
cement, steelmaking, shipbuilding, and other key markets for the company, and we expect competi- tion to intensify. We will clarify our strategies and action plans in view of our forecasts and further reinforce our business structure.
Molding Machinery Business
We look to a recovery in demand from the second half of the year. We will accordingly cut costs to be a winner in each product market, shorten produc- tion lead times, and focus on developing products that match market needs. At the same time, we will bolster production management to strengthen our business structure.
In die-cast machinery, we are developing and launching new equipment and processes that cater to a fast-growing need for lighter automobiles and vehicle electrification. We are integrating and reor- ganizing domestic and overseas injection molding machinery business sites. We will take advantage of the opening in August this year of a new plant (Nagoya Factory) to build an integrated and optimal global production structure and thereby streamline operations and reinforce competitiveness.

Strengths
• We have a robust record in serving the automotive, electric power, cement, steelmaking, and other key sectors, and have earned solid customer reputations for our efforts.
• We can draw on numerous domestic and overseas operations to cater to customer needs in everything from development through after-service.
• We have large processing facilities and skilled engineers and workers.Weaknesses
• Slow to take advantage of ICT because our business is based on manufacturing to order
Countermeasures: We have accordingly launched an ICT project to enhance product development and production efficiency.Opportunities
• Customer needs and requests are diversifying as target markets globalize.
• An extremely responsive global service and support framework is increasingly essential.
• There is a growing need for technologies that help lighten the weight of automobiles and contribute to the environmentally friendly product and resource recycling fields.
 Threats
• A sudden global economic slowdown could drive consolidations in key markets.
Countermeasures: We will leverage our strengths to reinforce our competitiveness and lift our presence when demand recovers.
• The COVID-19 pandemic could cause a global economic down- turn, causing demand for equipment to plunge. Countermeasures: We will cut product costs and shorten produc- tion lead times to secure business opportunities when a recovery materializes. SWOT Analysis            Industrial Machinery Business
In fiscal 2020, we will focus on production processes and cost controls for mid and large projects, particularly for domestic electric power projects for which we have secured orders. Also, we will achieve results in environmental equipment and new product development and expand alli- ances and collaborations to enter environmentally friendly product and resource recycling markets, accelerating activities to contribute to earnings. We will also take advantage of the smooth trans- fer of the chemical equipment business of Hitachi Plant Mechanics Co., Ltd. (announced in fiscal 2019), and product lineup and human resources expansions to focus on improving earnings.
Machinery Services Business
We will further bolster services and support by training and hiring more local employees overseas and otherwise strengthening our structure while expanding our parts supply capabilities. We will
ESG-Related Initiatives
also reinforce our services capabilities by integrating and reorganizing business sites in the United States, China, and Asia, centered on injection molding machines. In industrial machinery, we will strengthen alliances to bolster services proposal activities over- seas, and will strive to expand our business by pro- viding support for the products of other companies.
Steel Products Business
We expect the business climate to remain adverse owing to the global economic downturn and excess production capacity. We have accordingly harnessed our manufacturing capacity in specialty, niche, and large offerings in which we have a com- petitive edge, steadily producing results in building an optimal business structure through which we have switched from quantity to quality. We will continue striving to create a stable profit structure. In addition, we will expand environmental recycling (industrial and medical waste treatment) to become a third core business.
Bridges
   • Companies in the Machinery segment are focusing on developing products that help protect the environment while providing services that apply to existing facilities.
• UBE Steel Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the company, completely melts the industrial and medical waste in manufacturing processes, and is endeavoring to make environmental recycling a third core business.

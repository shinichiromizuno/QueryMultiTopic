  Human Resources Management
Personnel System
UBE maintains a personnel system in which
it clarifies what it expects of employees and impartially evaluates individual effort. We seek to ensure that employees therefore fully under- stand what they need to do and create work- places that are challenging and motivating for all our employees.

Human Resources Development
As part of our personnel systems, we provide on-the-job training, workshops and other off- the-job training, and self-improvement support programs with systems that empower our employees to perform at their best in an array of businesses and in an increasingly global operating climate.
A good example of our approach is the Career Development Sheets that employees prepare every year, based on which they can discuss areas in which they should enhance their skills and their prospects with supervisors. We rotate employees in keeping with their apti- tude to broaden their perspectives and exper- tise. For workshops and other off-the-job train- ing, we keep pace with changes in the operating climate by providing employee training programs that reflect skills required for each job level. We offer a range of programs that help employees enhance their capabilities, such as distance
Human Resources
The UBE Group considers employees its most
important resource for supporting sustainable growth.
We therefore devote considerable attention to human resources development, and are endeavoring to expand our personnel systems to ensure that all our employees are able to acquire the skills they need to continue doing great work.

learning and in-house and external language courses. We foster employee retention by bolster- ing career development.
We are particularly determined to retain young employees, and are cultivating them as tomorrow’s leaders at the UBE Group by helping them to experience their own growth and find satisfaction in their work.
Another way in which we endeavor to attract outstanding people is a program that we set up to prioritize rehiring individuals who resigned owing to family circumstances.
Enhancing Work Style Reform
Work style reform is an important management priority. As such, we strive to ensure high pro- ductivity by reviewing tasks from a range of perspectives, including through the use of ICT. At the same time, we offer telework, flextime outside core times, and other programs enabling more work practice diversity. We manage the time people spend working by PCs, set annual working hours targets through labor–management negotiation, and endeavor to lower overtime and encourage people to take annual paid leave. In the year under review, we endeavored to create working environments offering a healthy work–life balance by measures such as reducing working times by 31 hours from a year earlier.
Efforts to Maintain Operational Health
We endeavor to ensure the mental and physical health of employees through health and safety systems at each business site and efforts to encourage employees to engage in activities
to maintain and enhance their health.
We provide mental health assistance through
internal experts and through an externally run Employee Assistance Program that draws on highly experienced specialists, thus helping reduce incidences of new cases and long-term work absences. Our regular health checkups include tests for cancer and seek to identify early signs of illnesses. They also focus on improving conditions for checking for and raising awareness of female cancers and enhancing medical assessment rates.
Our endeavors to address occupational diseases entail undertaking medical checkups based on work records and findings from work environment measurements to deliver early detections and responses to any issues.
We have tackled cigarette smoking by for- mulating plans to eliminate passive smoking based on the Health Promotion Act. We are reducing the number of smoking areas at busi- ness sites and are remodeling smoking rooms. We additionally conduct health contests in which we employ health insurance subsidies to encourage people to smoke less or give
up tobacco.
In fiscal 2019, we held 26 training and
education seminars for 562 attendees on such topics as mental health, lifestyle diseases, and the use of health information.
Our health endeavors have earned recogni- tion under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)’s Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program. We also look to obtain certification under the White 500 category for large enterprises. We will internally and externally strengthen our disclosure of progress with our activities, organize

Diversity Initiatives
Diversity is a key policy priority. We accordingly seek to build a corporate culture that respects individuality and broad perspectives and trea- sures creativity and ambition.
We endeavor to attract and retain diverse talent as part of efforts to overcome the looming challenges of a declining labor force and a changing business climate.
based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. The plan encompasses the following three benchmarks to realize more flexible working styles and provide greater opportunities for female employees.
(1) A paid vacation usage rate of 80% or more
(2) At least 70% of eligible male employees
taking childcare leave
(3) Women representing at least 20% of new
graduate hires for generalist positions
As part of our efforts to be more inclusive
for women, we have increased the number of
female employees at our factories and over- seas. Women are increasingly vital to our operations.
Most of our female employees return to work after maternity leave. The number of male and female employees balancing childcare and professional commitments is rising each year, driving efforts to make operations more efficient, review work practices, and otherwise undertake workplace reforms.
We recruit people with diverse talents regardless of career background, nationality,
or gender. The management team engages closely with employees, including through meetings to exchange opinions and through labor–management council gatherings. We endeavor to create workplaces in which employ- ees can fulfill their potential by performing great and satisfying work.

Addressing the Gender Gap
As of March 31, 2020, 8.1% of parent company employees were women, up from 7.5% a year earlier. Women represented 2.6% of our manage- ment pool, compared with 2.4% a year earlier. In fiscal 2019, we launched a three-year action plan

Thailand, and Spain, and have expanded personnel exchanges with overseas members of the UBE Group. We hire foreign nationals every year in Japan, and engage extensively with overseas business sites.
Rehiring Retirees
Percentage of Employees with Disabilities
We maintain a program to rehire employees after they reach the standard retirement age
of 60 so we can draw on their experience and skills and they can retain job security. We rehired 85.7% of new retirees in fiscal 2019.
We are reviewing the roles and benefits of these people to enhance their work environments and motivation.
Recruiting People with Disabilities
We do much to foster the employment of people with disabilities, and maintain the UBE Group Support Network for Employment of People with Disabilities. We draw on the accumulated know- how of Libertas Ube, Ltd., a special-purpose subsidiary that we established in 1991, to hire these individuals and create workplaces for them Groupwide.
Human Rights
Respect for Human Rights
The UBE Group Action Guidelines state our respect for individuals while fostering mutual understanding and eliminating discrimination. The guidelines also state that we oppose forced and child labor and all other inhumane practices and reject any ties with individuals or organiza- tions engaging in such practices.
We ensure that all employees understand and embody our stance on human rights in
all aspects of business by providing executive, business site, and job classification-based training while offering Groupwide e-learning
to further enhance issue awareness.
Detailed information about the Group’s stance on human rights and labor is available on the UBE Group’s website (in Japanese only): https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/jp/sustainability/laborrights/

Labor Rights
 The UBE Group respects the basic rights of workers, including the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
We have concluded an agreement with the Ube Industries Labor Union that encompasses worker rights. Management engages in negotia- tions and regular discussions with labor repre- sentatives to improve living standards and work- ing conditions for union members and provide comfortable work environments. We endeavor to maintain and enhance healthy relationships between management and labor by having senior executives participate in conference sessions with labor to exchange and honestly discuss views about the Company’s issues and direction and share management policies and plans with union members while reflecting their feedback in management.

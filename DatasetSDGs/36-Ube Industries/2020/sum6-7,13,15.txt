Initiatives to Create Value and Drive Sustainable Growth
Business Strategies of the Construction Materials Company
We will flexibly and swiftly address environmental changes and build
a robust business infrastructure in line with our Vision for 2025.
                     Medium-Term Management Plan Policies
• Strengthen business foundations. • Enhance growth strategy.
• Pursue Group synergies.
Principal Products and Businesses
• Cement, ready-mixed concrete
• Biomass, industrial waste recycling
• Building materials (Self-leveling materials, waterproofing
materials, and renovation)
• Magnesia and calcia
• Fine materials
• Energy (Coal and electricity)
Business Strategies for Fiscal 2020
Our construction materials are essential for society. We expect to remain profitable in the years ahead by expanding new businesses on top of stable business foundations. The outlook for fiscal 2020 is increasingly unclear reflecting the impacts of
an economic slowdown from last year and the COVID-19 pandemic, so sales of our products will likely remain sluggish. While it will take time for an economic turnaround to materialize after the impact of the pandemic abates, we look for domestic demand for cement to recover to a certain level, with that situation continuing for a few years and automobile production also recovering.
So, although the Construction Materials Com- pany will not dramatically alter its policies it will review priorities when implementing measures. It will flexibly accommodate changes in the business climate while accelerating efforts to boost the prof- itability of platform businesses and solidifying its footing, thereby reaching its Medium-Term Management Plan objectives.

1. Strengthen business foundations
While building a stable shipment framework and conserving energy and costs in cement, ready- mixed concrete, magnesia and calcia, and energy operations, we will improve profitability by maintain- ing and correcting prices while continuing to culti- vate new customers to overcome the challenges of a deteriorating business climate.
• We installed waste heat power facilities at the Isa Cement Factory to conserve energy and lower costs, with operations beginning in January 2020. We also installed a high-efficiency clinker cooler at the Kanda Cement Factory. This facility is expected to start operations in September 2021.
• Deploying Renewal Phase II (covering fiscal 2019– 2021) at the Ube Factory of Ube Material Indus- tries to maintain stable operations and deliver high added value for magnesia (fiscal 2019–2021).
• Rolling out environmental measures, aging facilities countermeasures, and efficiency improve- ments to maintain competitive and stable supplies of energy.
2. Enhance growth strategy
We have positioned fine materials, biomass, and recycling as growth businesses and are pursuing new ideas beyond existing business frameworks to expand by commercializing businesses and generating profits.
• In fine materials, we will strengthen sales and development for MOS-HIGE magnesium

Strengths
• We can optimize Group synergies through our diverse Groupwide products and businesses.
• We maintain a solid infrastructural setup through our coal and power supply structure and large port facilities.
• We are able to harness a wide range of waste substances and draw on our advanced technical capabilities to conserve resources. Weaknesses
• Aging facilities
Countermeasures: We will overcome this
issue by lowering opportunity losses through formulating long-term facilities maintenance plans and using ICT to consolidate facilities maintenance information. Opportunities
• We anticipate demand for cement and solidifiers for redevelop- ment, the Chuo Shinkansen maglev line, the Osaka Expo, inte- grated resorts, and other large projects, as well as for disaster prevention and mitigation work.
• We must ensure stable supplies of materials that are essential for building social capital and competitive energies.
• The integration of our cement and related operations with those of Mitsubishi Materials Corporation should enable us to bolster our profitability.Threats
• Sluggish domestic cement demand and lower sales of magnesia and calcia
Countermeasures: We will tackle this challenge by maintaining and correcting prices and continuing to cultivate new customers while building solid, low-cost operating foundations.
• Environmental issues
Countermeasures: We will undertake the following
energy-saving measures, which aim to (1) deploy
high-efficiency facilities, (2) reuse waste heat, (3) use more
biomass fuel in power generation, and (4) streamline kiln operations.   SWOT Analysis              oxysulfate whiskers while cultivating new projects, lowering costs, and expanding appli- cations.
• In biomass and recycling, we will expand sales
of environmental materials, notably by increasing biomass incinerations at IPPs, and are looking to produce polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) overseas while creating new recycling operations and expanding sales of such environmental materials as neutral stabilizers and heavy metal immobilizers.
3. Pursue synergies: Integrate cement and related businesses with those of Mitsubishi Materials
In February 2020, UBE and Mitsubishi Materials concluded a basic agreement on integrating their cement and related businesses. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both parties and pursue

synergies while bolstering profitability. The two look to finalize the agreement in September and under- take specific deliberations to launch the integrated entity in April 2022.
4. Strengthen governance
The Construction Materials Company set up the Gov- ernance Control Department in April 2020 as part of efforts to reinforce governance, including for Group companies through direct controls and an environ- mental safety and quality assurance structure.
Finally, fiscal 2020 is the second year of our Medium-Term Management Plan, based on which we will flexibly and speedily deploy measures to overcome an adverse operating climate while endeavoring to build a robust business infrastruc- ture in line with our Vision for 2025.
 • Waste heat power facilities at the Isa Cement Factory began operating in January 2020. A high-efficiency clinker cooler at the Kanda Cement Factory is expected to start operations in September 2021.
We set up the Global Warming Countermeasures Group in April 2020 to steer efforts to conserve more energy, use waste energy, and expand the use of renewable energy as part of a drive to cut our GHG emissions by 15% from fiscal 2013 levels by 2030.
• We are endeavoring to greenify former limestone quarries. Since fiscal 2008, we have planted citrus trees, ivy, and other vegetation on the slopes of the Kanda Mine. Since fiscal 2011, we have planted wild cherry trees and round leaf holly on the slopes of the Ube Isa Mine.

The key environmental challenges for the UBE Group are to help resolve global warming, safeguard biodiversity, address the issue of marine plastics, and conserve water resources. We consider it particularly important to deal with global warming. As well as low- ering GHG emissions from our plants, we will help decarbonize the economy through ongoing efforts to cut these emissions across our supply chain.

       We endeavor to safeguard the environment and comply with levels set through agreements with government bodies or with voluntary standards by stabilizing plant operations and by extensively controlling air and water emissions of pollutants, and also undertake ongoing environmental impact reduction activities. UBE plants are located along rivers, so the risks of water shortages are small.
However, each plant manages water consumption and discharges to use water more efficiently.
We will continue to engage in business activi- ties that contribute to a recycling-based economy as part of environmental management, such as by tackling environmental issues, reducing and recycling industrial waste, and lowering chemical substance emissions.

     The UBE Group’s Basic Stance on Environmental Issues
Addressing Environmental Issues
Our Stance on Environmental Issues
We have identified four aspects of global envi- ronmental issues for which we have formulated a unified Group stance. These are tackling global warming, protecting biodiversity, dealing with marine plastics, and safeguarding water resources.
Detailed information about our basic approach
to tackling environmental issues is available on the
UBE Group’s website (in Japanese only):
https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/jp/sustainability/rc/environment/ issues.html
Structure Relating to Environmental Issues
Please see page 17 for a chart on the structure relating to environmental issues.
(1) Tackling Global Warming
• Cutting GHG Emissions
We reached our fiscal 2021 goal of reducing GHG emissions by 15% from fiscal 2005 levels ahead of schedule. We are now striving to further con- serve energy and recycle more waste so we can reach our goal of cutting emissions by 17% from fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030. We will focus on developing technologies to recover and use CO2, thereby helping lower the overall GHG emissions of our supply chain.

(3) Dealing with Marine Plastics and Conserving Water Resources
We use waste plastic as a source of energy for cement production, helping reduce the volume
of this material going to landfills. We help prevent plastic from being discarded and flowing into the oceans by conducting cleaning along the industrial roads around our plants.
We will explore specific policies for our activities, including to conserve water resources.

     • Creating and Expanding New Products and Technologies to Help Reduce Environmental Impact
We look for such products and technologies to represent at least 30% of net sales by fiscal 2021 and at least 50% by fiscal 2030.

In fiscal 2019, 101 employees took part in the 12th Forest Creation Experiential Activity for Water Conservation, thinning and logging bamboo. This annual initiative is for employees of companies using the Kotogawa River system in Yamaguchi Prefecture. It helps forests retain water and educates participants about the links between water and forests.

   Using Resources Effectively
Our cement factories
recycle diverse waste
and by-products as raw
materials (material recycling) and alternative fuels (thermal recycling). Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possible to use ash from incineration as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.
In fiscal 2019, our three cement factories harnessed 3.30 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.91 million metric tons of which we sourced externally, contributing considerably to a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new businesses to use waste materials in applications other than as materials for cement. For example, we recycle plasterboard, for which we expect demand to increase. We will continue to boost our capacity for handling various waste as part of efforts to expand our recycling business.
Please see Non-Financial Highlights on page 11 for details of our usage of waste substances and by-products.

 Reducing Industrial Waste
The Japanese government’s 4th Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society targets a 77% reduction in industrial waste landfill amounts from 2000 levels by 2025. The UBE Group endeavors to recycle such waste and cut landfill volume to contribute to a recycling-based society.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most
of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2019, we lowered such waste by 80% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeav- oring to cut volumes from fiscal 2020.

 Suppressing Chemical Substance Emissions
The chemical industry complies with laws and regulations while endeavoring to voluntarily cut chemical substance emissions through a disclo- sure program based on the PRTR Law*1. The UBE Group chose 20 substances whose emissions
are significant*2 from substances subject to the PRTR Law, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)*3, and is striving Companywide to reduce emissions of these substances.
In fiscal 2019, we lowered emissions of these 20 substances by 29% from the fiscal 2010 level, suppressing emissions subject to the PRTR Law and VOC emissions.
Suppressing PRTR Substance Emissions
We handle 61 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2019 were down 33% from fiscal 2010.
Suppressing VOC Emissions
The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2019 were 40% lower than those in fiscal 2010.

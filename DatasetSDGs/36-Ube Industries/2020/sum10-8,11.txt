     Industrial Safety Action Plans
Page 3 of the 2020 Integrated Report Supplementary Information (Environment and Safety) presents these initiatives.
Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
We endeavor to eliminate process accidents through initiatives that ensure our facilities are safe and secure. We also undertake activities to minimize damage in the event of major natural disasters. In fiscal 2019, we focused on compre- hensive measures to address the risks of acci- dents at aging facilities, improving safety at certi- fied high-pressure gas sites, and implementing natural disaster measures.
Measures to address the risks of accidents at aging facilities entail conducting inspections at each business site, choosing facilities and areas
not subject to inspection and audit over the long term, and formulating and executing inspection and audit plans. By undertaking comprehensive risk measures, we endeavor to build business sites that are impervious to accidents.
For certified high-pressure gas sites, we set up an improvement agenda in line with assessment findings from the Japan Safety Competency Center and engage in systematic improvement initiatives.
We push ahead with measures to address natural disasters by having each business site con- duct self-assessments in line with self-assessment criteria for such measures, and pursue ongoing improvements. We also respond to the Industrial Process Safety Action Plan of the Japan Petro- chemical Industry Association.

Measures to Prevent
Occupational Accidents
Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven corpo- rate culture, encompassing eight elements. These are organizational governance, positive involve- ment, resource management, work management, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual understanding. In keeping with findings from assessments based
on headquartersâ€™ evaluation standards, business sites identify issues and formulate and execute plans to cultivate a safety culture as part of ongoing improvement efforts.
Eliminating Major Disasters
We have undertaken a range of activities to prevent occupational accidents. In fiscal 2018, we initiated efforts that centered on eliminating major incidents. We conduct risk assessments of work in which people might fall, be caught or entangled in machinery, or come into contact with hazardous materials. We implement systematic risk reduction measures and endeavor to make operations inherently safe.
We investigate the causes of all incidents regardless of whether they result in lost time, striving to prevent similar incidents by assessing and rolling out measures.

Caprolactam
      Nylon
Eybelis®
Engineering Plastics & Fine Chemicals
In caprolactam operations in Japan, Thailand, and Spain, we will cut costs by maintaining full produc- tion and sales while optimizing their benefits as a raw material for nylon. In the ammonium sulfate business, we will boost production and sales of high-value-added large-crystal ammonium sulfate.
In the nylon business, we will draw on com- pounding operations in Spain and the United States, where we acquired a production base, to accelerate efforts to build and expand composites solutions businesses.
Our focus in the industrial chemicals business is on solidifying our robust position in the domestic ammonia chain. In fine chemicals, we will step up the overseas development of our C1 chemicals business, which is a competitive strength.
In high-performance coatings, we will draw
on the launch of phase 2 polycarbonate diol (PCD) facilities in Thailand to drive market expansion as a leading global manufacturer. We aim to upgrade polyurethane dispersion facilities to cater to growing demand.
          • Quickly materialize development themes through seamless cooperation among research, development, technology, production, and business, and create advanced businesses.

Business Strategies for Fiscal 2020
Synthetic Rubber
We will actively codevelop with customers and identify their needs to supply high-value-added products on a timely basis. We will boost manufac- turing capacity, centered on high-value-added products.
Strengths
• Our product range is extensive, encompassing such basic chemicals businesses as our core lactam-nylon chains and synthetic rubber and such specialty chemicals businesses as specialty products, high-performance coatings, and battery materials.
• We integrate diverse materials and technologies to supply differentiated products and services worldwide.
• We have the technology and manufacturing capabilities to meet sophisticated customer needs as a trusted joint development partner, and to provide solutions to customers.Weaknesses
• Because our business emits a considerable amount of GHGs, we are exposed to regulatory risks, such as environmental taxes. Countermeasures: We will provide products and technologies that help reduce GHGs in the supply chain while reducing the UBE Group’s overall emissions.Opportunities
• We anticipate favorable market expansion for functional products, high-performance coatings, and nylon.
• Although the market conditions have deteriorated owing to plunging near-term automobile demand, demand will shift over the medium through long terms to electric and hybrid vehicles, with the market for coated separators expanding.
• We are expecting business opportunities for environmentally friendly products for new battery materials, EVs, lighter mobility, and fuel economy improvements. Threats
• Intensifying price competition from market entries of players in middle-income countries
Countermeasures: We will extensively cut costs to improve our competitive position and ally with other companies.
• Shorter product lifespans and swifter changes in the external environment
Countermeasures: We will anticipate customer needs by providing joint product development and other solutions, and create new applications.
    SWOT Analysis   Specialty Products
We will overhaul our polyimide business structure, moving away from a focus on film sales by expand- ing sales of varnish monomer powder as part of efforts to drive ongoing earnings growth. We will also endeavor to optimize profits by investing in production increases. In separation membranes, we will continue to boost our competitiveness in mainstay nitrogen membranes while expanding sales in railways and aerospace applications for the mobility area and in biogas and bioethanol applica- tions for the environment and energy area.
In ceramics, we will accommodate demand in the bearing, substrate, and other markets to maintain our superior position through high-end offerings. We will also reinforce our operational underpinnings by raising production capacity.
For the Tyranno Fiber® business, we will develop ceramic matrix composite fibers for civil aircraft engines and mass production technologies, establishing our position in next-generation sin- tered fibers.
In battery materials, we will leverage collabora- tion in China with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to build a global alliance structure. In separators, we will secure deals in advanced areas from key

customers and cultivate new customers while strengthening our supply capabilities and becoming more cost competitive.
Pharmaceuticals
We will embark on manufacturing nucleic acid APIs under contract and strengthen contract manufacturing efforts in fluorinated drug active ingredients, including for fluorination reactions. We will cater to the production of multiple varieties of active ingredients in small lots by establishing our fifth pharmaceutical plant while optimizing fac- tories and our supply chain.
R&D
We will sustainably develop existing businesses and bolster peripheral areas while reinforcing tech- nologies and intellectual property that is the foun- dation for creating new businesses. We will build
a structure that encompasses everything from planning and proposing R&D themes that harness external sources through business creation. We will draw on collaboration within and outside the Group to contribute to progress in reducing carbon foot- prints, developing environmental technologies and products, and tackling waste plastic issues.
 • We will supply products that lower environmental impact and contribute to society. Such offerings include environmentally friendly high-performance coating materials, synthetic rubber and nylon that improves the fuel economy and lowers the weight of automo- biles, battery materials for electric and hybrid vehicles, nylon for FCV hydrogen tanks, Tyranno Fiber®, which helps enhance aircraft engine fuel economy, and Heliofresh®, a synthetic fragrance derived from catechol instead of from wood.
• We will undertake R&D and verification testing that contributes to mineralization and other CO2 usage to reduce CO2 footprints while contributing to society by lowering CO2 emissions and creating new businesses. We will popularize the Ebara Ube Process, a materials recycling technology that breaks down waste plastics to produce a synthetic gas, and push ahead with R&D and verification testing into new recycling technologies.

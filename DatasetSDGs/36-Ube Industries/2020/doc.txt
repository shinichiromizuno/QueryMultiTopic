To Our Stakeholders
The UBE Group’s Management Policies
Accelerating Growth Primarily in the Chemicals Business and Stepping Up Efforts to Tackle Environmental Issues
Reflections on My First Year at the Helm
UBE’s Strengths Are the Integrity of Its People and Its Corporate Sincerity
The business climate is constantly changing, and we cannot hope to continue growing if we are behind the curve. Since our establishment more than 120 years ago, we have constantly expanded operations by tackling transformations in the industrial structure while also cultivating new businesses. We are now at another turning point.
Looking back over fiscal 2019, my first year at the helm, I devoted the year to engaging with fellow executives while interacting and exchang- ing views with employees. It was in doing so that I was able to convey to each business the cur- rent circumstances and the need to ensure that everyone was on board with our updated corpo- rate philosophy and management principles, and that we prioritize safety in everything we do in keeping with the UBE Group Environmental and Safety Guidelines. We also discussed how to address global warming, the greatest challenge for the UBE Group over the medium and long terms. We will continue to engage in dialogue and seek to steadily embed these values and situational perceptions throughout our organiza- tion through the statements and thoughts of leaders and employees who have been involved in ongoing talks.
It struck me in my opportunities for discus- sion over the past year that all employees seem to share my awareness of the issues and are earnestly endeavoring to better themselves. I believe UBE is a principled manufacturer, and
that one of the Company’s great strengths is that its integrity is the fruit of the collective hon- esty of its people. This capability unites the entire Group to progress as it should.
I have become convinced that as long as we are truthful we can work to help resolve climate change, transform ourselves, and pioneer new territory to leap further forward.
Highlights of
Vision UBE 2025 –Prime Phase–,
Our Medium-Term Management Plan
Steadily Progressing toward the Next Stage of Growth and Business Structure Reforms
Laying the Foundation for the Next Stage
of Growth in the Chemicals Business
The global economy trended downward after peaking in fiscal 2017, so we expected the oper- ating climate during the three years of the cur- rent medium-term management plan to be less favorable than under the previous initiative. Still, conditions in fiscal 2019—the first year of this plan—were more adverse than expected. Key factors were China’s economic slowdown and a manufacturing slump, particularly in automobiles, stemming from Sino-American trade friction. It was against this backdrop that we experienced particularly sluggish demand for such chemical products as nylon and caprolactam, and were consequently unable to reach our operating profit target for the year.
Despite our performance challenges, we progressed steadily toward our next stage of growth and business structure reforms.
3

One key growth initiative in the chemicals business was the acquisition of a North Ameri- can compound manufacturer in March 2020, following our purchase of a similar European company a year earlier. We made these moves to bolster our downstream strategy in nylon and expand our global network. In industrial chemi- cals, we made an ammonia manufacturer a wholly owned subsidiary. In October 2020, we plan to fully absorb that entity into the parent company to streamline operational efficiency.
In one effort to expand our fine chemicals glob- ally, we began upgrading Thai manufacturing facilities for polycarbonate diol (PCD), a high-performance coating material. The new setup is expected to start production in August 2020. In pharmaceuticals, we decided to build a fifth pharmaceutical plant that should become operational in June 2021. The new facility will focus on manufacturing high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in small lots.
Our basic policy approach remains unchanged despite results falling short of our goals. If anything, I am even more determined to accelerate growth initiatives.
Pressing Ahead with Business Structure Reforms to Propel Autonomous Growth in the Construction Materials and Machinery Businesses
The UBE Group’s business structure reforms aim to reinforce the growth underpinnings

of each of our three internal companies. We are making steady progress not just in the chemicals business but also in our construction materials and machinery businesses.
Our biggest reform decision in fiscal 2019 was to integrate the cement and other busi- nesses in our construction materials division with that of Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. We con- cluded a basic agreement on such integration. To date, the two companies have transferred and integrated their cement sales and logistics under UBE-MITSUBISHI CEMENT CORPORATION,
a joint venture with each party owning a 50% stake, established in 1998. We have thus lowered logistics and business site costs.
Still, the business climate for the domestic cement business has changed tremendously, such as a huge plunge in demand for cement, since that entity’s inception. To strengthen the cement businesses of UBE and Mitsubishi Mate- rials in the years ahead, we needed to build a structure that would further the existing relation- ship between the two. Integrating the manufac- turing and other aspects of the construction materials businesses of both partners should enable us to invest cash flows from our domestic cement business in Japanese and overseas oper- ations that offer growth potential. We expect to keep delivering sustainable growth as an enter- prise that contributes to social infrastructure and the development of a recycling-based society.

   We will focus on management
so we can demonstrate the
UBE Group’s growth, principally
in the chemicals business,
internally and externally.
The construction materials business set up a waste heat-fueled generating facility at the Isa Cement Factory, helping cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and conserve energy. We also completed a wood biomass facility as a renew- able energy alternative to coal, with full produc- tion slated to begin by the end of 2020.
In the machinery business, we decided to fully integrate our injection molding machine business in August 2020 with the one we acquired from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. In line with this move, in the same month we will start production at a new plant in Nagoya, thereby optimizing our production structure.
It is also worth noting that we purchased the chemical equipment business of Hitachi Plant Mechanics Co., Ltd., to reinforce our industrial machinery business.
Stepping Up Our Approach and Speed in Driving the UBE Group’s Growth, Principally
in the Chemicals Business
Earnings have dwindled since the global reces- sion began in the chemicals business, which supplies nylon, caprolactam, and other com- modity chemicals, and in the machinery busi- ness, which supplies products for manufacturing for the automotive sector. At the same time, the performance of the specialty chemicals business has exceeded our targets. For example, results were outstanding for polyimide resins for flexible organic light-emitting diode (LED) and smart- phone materials in the year under review. This is because we manufacture varnish and film from
our own raw materials and offer unparalleled thermal resistance and dimensional stability. Under our current medium-term management plan, we are pursuing growth in the chemicals business, especially in specialty offerings, and aim to accelerate expansion.
We plan to integrate the cement business
in our construction materials division with that
of Mitsubishi Materials in April 2022. Thereafter, the only UBE operation running autonomously will be the chemicals business. In other words, chemicals will be UBE’s core independent busi- ness. Ube Industries will become a chemicals business holding company who is an investor
of the construction materials and machinery businesses. We will accordingly focus on man- agement so we can demonstrate solid chemicals business growth internally and externally.
Our ESG Approach
Cultivating Operations in Line with the UBE Group’s ESG Principles and Founding Spirit
The UBE Group’s Stance on ESG
Our founding principles of Coexistence and Mutual Prosperity and From Finite Mining to Infinite Industry remain fundamental to our operations. Coexistence and Mutual Prosperity originally encompassed progress for us and the
 5

    6
communities we served but now embodies
our CSR commitment, covering shareholders, customers, business partners, employees, the environment, and all other stakeholders. The principle of From Finite Mining to Infinite Indus- try acknowledges that while we started out in coal mining, we eschew relying on limited coal resources and leverage technology to cultivate a range of businesses catering to contemporary needs and pursue sustainable growth while changing our business structure.
We are progressing by lowering our use of fossil resources while shifting to businesses that emit less CO2 and consume less energy. To operate sustainably, we must naturally continue improving governance while ensuring compli- ance. Through such approaches, we have embedded the essence of ESG in our opera- tions in line with our founding spirit.
For example, when pollution was a major social issue around Japan as its economy boomed, we collaborated with communities, local governments, and universities to cut coal ash emissions from factories, taking the lead with measures and achieving results. We garnered considerable attention throughout society for our successful environmental policy approach, which was called the Ube Method. We have accordingly tackled environmental issues while maintaining engagement with communities. We will continue to address such issues, noteworthy focuses being on cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ensuring
GHG emissions 17% from fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030.
biodiversity, safeguarding water resources, and dealing with marine plastics.
Seeking to Reduce GHG Emissions 17% from Fiscal 2013 Levels by Fiscal 2030 Environmental issues are a key ESG focus. The Japanese government’s vision is to lower GHG emissions 80% over the long term. We accord- ingly formulated UBE Group Environmental Vision 2050 to address issues.
We have set two targets under our medium-term management plan, which ends
in fiscal 2021. One is to reduce GHG emissions 15% from fiscal 2005 levels. The other is to have eco-friendly products account for more than 30% of net sales. We are on track to reach both goals. In view of this progress and the govern- ment’s vision, we look to lower our GHG emis- sions 17% from fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030.
As the target is feasible in terms of techno- logical capability and cost effectiveness, we will explore measures encompassing business structure reforms that augment these targets. A driver in our focus on specialty offerings in the chemicals business is a commitment to addressing environmental issues.
We also note that in April 2020 we announced our support for the recommenda- tions of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We will analyze scenarios for the business risks and opportuni- ties of climate change and disclose the financial impacts.
Under UBE Group Environmental Vision 2050, we seek to reduce

Strengthening Quality Assurance Initiatives
Inappropriate quality inspection practices came to light around two years ago. We have since taken steps in two key respects to prevent
a recurrence.
The first is to enhance awareness and edu- cate. We have top management reiterate the importance of quality in its messaging. We also recognize that quality assurance is a challenge not just for manufacturing and quality assurance units but for the entire Company, including sales and administrative departments. It is in keeping with this stance that we educate all employees about quality in line with the requirements of their respective departments and job descriptions.
Our second step has been to prevent issues from personnel and organizational perspectives. We have increased the number of employees involved in quality assurance and quality control while clarifying the roles of quality assurance departments at plants and other sites, internal companies, and Companywide, establishing
an overlapping check structure and employing internal controls.
By directly recording measured data, deploy- ing a quality control system that prevents irregu- larities and errors, and bolstering audits, as well as undertaking all other related initiatives, we aim to earn a solid customer reputation for maintain- ing a robust quality assurance structure.
Corporate Growth Essential to Ensure Rewarding Workplaces
We are nothing without our people. It is accord- ingly an important priority for management to provide workplaces that are safe, secure, comfort- able, and rewarding. People find that workplaces that experience steady growth are rewarding.
We will keep creating programs that ensure peo- ple can work comfortably, notably by enhancing efficiency through work style reform and offering telework that harnesses information and commu- nications technologies (ICT). At the same time, we believe all businesses must grow to be rewarding workplaces.
We also look to do more to be more inclusive for women, as they currently account for a small percentage of our employees and an even tinier proportion of our management pool. We will take the lead in identifying work that women find uncomfortable and exploring how we can improve our programs or facilities.
Message to Stakeholders
Addressing Current Challenges While Looking Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparing for Growth
The world has suffered its greatest economic setback since the Great Depression as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A full-fledged recov- ery could take several years. It is impossible at this juncture to accurately predict the pandem- ic’s economic impact.
In fiscal 2020, we will have to operate with great patience because of the pandemic’s mas- sive impact on our businesses and performance. We will endeavor to minimize its effects through a range of emergency measures, such as by first reducing fixed costs, but we will have to do more than that. Looking beyond the pandemic, we will continue preparing in various ways to progress to a growth trajectory as soon as possible.
We have built a healthy financial position to drive growth and are issuing bonds even under the current circumstances to secure sufficient financial flexibility. We will continue endeavoring to offer stable dividends while balancing growth investments and shareholder returns for the years ahead, and thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement.

With Revenues and Earnings Declining, Increasing Cash Holdings to Overcome Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In fiscal 2019, the first year of our medium-term management plan, revenues and earnings both declined owing to deteriorating conditions in the chemicals market. Our results were thus signifi- cantly less than initially targeted. Return on equity (ROE) was accordingly just 6.9%.
We constrained working capital and optimized the implementation timing of primarily maintenance and upgrade investments. We also secured free cash flow of ¥27.8 billion, which exceeded our tar- get. At the end of the term, we increased our cash holdings to prepare for a deteriorating financial climate owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. While interest-bearing debt was up somewhat, we were able to maintain our financial structure. The debt/ equity ratio was unchanged, at 0.57 times, while the equity ratio improved slightly, to 45.7%.
Masayuki Fujii
Director, Managing Executive Officer, CFO
Acknowledging a Need to Enhance Capital Efficiency While Continuing to Invest in Growth It is exceedingly difficult to pinpoint how the global economy or business climate will fare in fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will accordingly focus even more on our cash flows while maintaining financial discipline. At the same time, we will unhesitatingly invest in driving growth, reforming our business structure, and tackling envi- ronmental issues. We remain aware of capital cost in determining business expansion investments and seek to generate returns exceeding the cost. We will be even more conscious of delivering returns on invested capital, including in allocating business resources, and endeavor to boost capital efficiency while pursuing sustainable growth and seeking to increase corporate value.
Increasing Cash Dividends per Share to ¥10
The basic stance of UBE’s shareholder return pol- icy is to deliver stable and sustainable dividends. One of our key performance indicators (KPIs) is
a dividend on equity (DOE) ratio target of at least 2.5%. We also aim to maintain a consolidated total return ratio of 30.0% or more during our medium-term management plan.
In fiscal 2019, we paid interim cash dividends
of ¥45 per share, and paid the same amount for the end of the year. The ¥90 annual total represents a ¥10 increase from a year earlier. The total return ratio would accordingly be 40%, with DOE being 2.7%.
In keeping with the above policy, we will strive to balance growth investments and internal reserves while further enhancing shareholder returns.

Building Value to Materialize Sustainable Growth
Key Risks and Opportunities
Risk Management (in Japanese only)
Risk Management Policy and System
The UBE Group implements suitable risk counter- measures after assessing probabilities and impacts that might prevent it from reaching its business objectives in every decision-making process, including in gatherings of the Board of Directors and the Strategic Management Meeting.
We maintain Growth, Environment, Society, and Governance categories for risks that could
particularly affect operations. As a generator
of GHG emissions, the greatest risk we present is environmental. We accordingly endeavor to cut such emissions and expand businesses that help reduce environmental impact in a drive to lower risks while turning them into opportunities.
We established a Companywide integrated management system to assess risks and gather information on probabilities and impacts.
In pursuing business sustainability and progress, the UBE Group acknowledges threats to the environment’s sustainability and the inherent risks of individual busi- nesses, and recognizes the need to act. It is in keeping with this stance that the Group is extensively managing risks and undertaking initiatives that can generate new revenue opportunities.

 We also set up the Risk Management Department to centrally oversee related information, and main- tain internal systems to manage the Group’s risks.
Product Quality Initiatives
The UBE Group’s products are used in everything from automotive parts and digital appliances to social infrastructure. Shipping defective products could have dire consequences for the Group even if there are no safety or health issues. Examples include the costs of recovering the defective products, compen- sation to customers, and loss of social credibility.
The UBE Group accordingly endeavors to provide top-quality products and services that are safe and reliable. It does this by ensuring robust manufacturing processes, maintaining equipment to manage processes, formulating proper inspec- tion processes, improving operating manuals, educating employees, and building structures
for thorough inspections that prevent defective products from reaching the market.
Countermeasures
We adopted the following policies to prevent
a recurrence of the inappropriate quality inspection issues that came to light two years ago.
Measures to prevent recurrence
• Step up governance of the Board of Directors, notably to monitor regular business and audit reports relating to quality
• Ensure all employees are quality-conscious, such as by overhauling management policies and continuing to disseminate messages from top management
• Continue to educate executives and all members of the Group, including through e-learning and training
• Strengthen internal quality management controls, examples being to set up quality management rules and conduct quality audits at the head office
• Bolster quality underpinnings by deploying such business resources, including to systematically develop and allocate human resources and auto- mate processes

The UBE Group’s Measures
We will drive the expansion of active growth businesses and increase their weight in our business portfolio in an effort to build an operating structure that generates stable growth regardless of economic trends and improve profit margins. Active growth businesses encom- pass many operations that generate minimal GHG emissions, such as specialty chemicals. We look to lower emissions rates by lifting the contributions to sales of such businesses.
* Nylon, fine chemicals, high-performance coatings, synthetic rubber, polyimide, separation membranes, separators, magnesia and calcia, biomass fuel, and resource recycling
Please see pages 26–27, 30–31, and 34–35 for details.
The key environmental challenges for the UBE Group are to help resolve global warming, safeguard biodiversity, address the issue of marine plastics, and conserve water resources. We consider it particularly important to deal with global warming. As well as low- ering GHG emissions from our plants, we will help decarbonize the economy through ongoing efforts to cut these emissions across our supply chain.
Please see pages 15–19, 30–31, and 58 for details.
People will be the engine of the UBE Group’s growth over the medium and long terms. We will hire more women and foreign nationals while educating employees to cultivate people with diverse values and perspectives, thereby enabling us to respond swiftly to changes in the business climate and pursue sustainable growth.
Please see pages 28–29 and 50–53 for details.
In fiscal 2018 and 2019, we strengthened proactive and reactive governance by revamping our corporate philosophy and manage- ment principles, transitioning to a Company with Audit & Supervi- sory Committee, and reorganizing into a three-company operating structure. In pursuing progress from these efforts, we will endeavor to strengthen our business foundations for further growth.

        Leveraging Innovative Technological Capabilities to Reduce GHG Emissions
The Group is augmenting existing products and technologies by employing various technologies
in long-term R&D to cut GHG emissions, a good example being carbon fixation.
Please see the UBE Group’s Strengths: R&D and Intellectual Capital on pages 30-31 for details.
Initiative Example
Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd., Ube Industries, and the JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION formed
a study group to develop a technology that transforms waste CO2 into a resource.
The idea is to use industrial waste incorporating a lot of calcium and other materials, reacting it with CO2 to create carbonate and produce high added value. We look to use the carbonate and residues in construction, civil engineering, industrial, and other materials.
In January 2020, the Isa Cement Factory began generating exhaust heat power, following suit from the Kanda Cement Factory.
Reducing fossil fuels usage associated with power generation and CO2 emissions by 50,000 metric tons annually
Our facilities generating exhaust heat power can recover exhaust heat of kiln preheaters and clinker coolers up to a low temperature range of below 200°C, delivering greater efficiency and energy savings than conventional counterpart facilities.
                     17

     Cultivate Businesses That Help Reduce Environmental Impact
Proactive Strategies
Developing and Marketing Environmentally Friendly Products and Technologies
The Group’s growth strategy is to continue expanding sales of and developing environmentally friendly products and technologies that contribute to the environment. Such efforts will enable us to help decarbonize society by cutting GHG emissions across product lifecycles, notably for usage and disposal.
By fiscal 2030, we look for environmentally friendly products and technologies to account for more than 50% of consolidated net sales.

     Environmentally Friendly Products
Separators and electrolytes for LiB materials underpin the development of EVs, constituting vital products and technologies for zero emission vehicles. Nylon lightens automobiles, helping boost fuel efficiency, while high-performance coating materials reduce coating processes, helping lower GHG emissions.
Our Criteria for Choosing Environmentally Friendly Products and Technologies
We base our selection criteria on our internal Guidelines for Determining Environmentally Friendly Products and Technologies. These guidelines define environmental impacts for everything from global warming from GHG emissions to the extent of ozone layer destruction, marine plastics, decreases in wildlife species, and water resource depletion. We choose environmentally friendly products and technologies that can potentially help lower environmental impact. Our selections encompass not only products and technologies that we have developed but also prospective environmental impact reductions from applications of existing product and technologies.
Tackling Environmental Issues
Recent years have seen a rapid expansion in SDGs endeavors and ESG investments, reshaping the business landscape. We have entered an era in which presenting a long-term approach to helping resolve environmental issues will further improve corporate value.
We deployed a basic policy of responding to and helping resolve resources, energy, and envi- ronmental issues under Vision UBE 2025 –Prime Phase–, which we launched in fiscal 2019.
The UBE Group Environmental and Safety Guidelines underscore a clear commitment to helping create a recycling-based society, and present our approach to initiatives to tackle four specific envi- ronmental issues. These are to respond to global warming, preserve biodiversity, tackle marine plastics, and conserve water resources.
We will undertake a plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle based on a concerted Group approach to initiatives and endeavor to address environmental issues.

The UBE Group’s Strengths: Human Resources
Creating Better Workplaces for Women
Katrin Schüller

       Hideo Tamada
Managing Executive Officer CRO, CCO, with responsibility for Risk Management Dept., Human Resources Dept., CSR & General Affairs Dept. and Legal Dept.
The UBE Group prioritizes attracting and cultivating people who can help enhance corporate value and contribute to sustainable growth. We accordingly endeavor to create attractive workplaces. We asked several female employees how we are faring in that respect.
    28
Human Resources Development Stance
Hideo Tamada
Managing Executive Officer
We believe that people are crucial to driving sustainable growth. Diversity measures are vital for management, and female employees have led the way in such workplace reform initiatives as improving operational efficiency and review- ing work practices. We encourage women to play key roles in our organization through career development and work–life balance programs, notably for telework, taking annual leave by the hour, childcare and nursing care support, and self-improvement.
Roundtable Discussion about Positive Workplaces
What Is Your Role?
Narita: I work for the Legal Department. My role is primarily to review confidentiality, trade, and other agreements. I also oversee legal training.
Hatanaka: I help manage Group companies. This includes a subsidiary in China, which I visit frequently to identify operational issues and
formulate and propose solutions to local staff and then create a mechanism for these solu- tions to be implemented. Our local staff need to implement operational measures, so it’s impor- tant they accept proposals and work through things until they bear fruit. This is extremely challenging because you have to deliver results, but I find it rewarding.
Schüller: I am part of the Chemicals Company, and look after two products. One is an organic compound that suppresses paint skinning. The world is full of paint manufacturers, so I find it interesting that we have prospective customers everywhere. The other product is for agrochemi- cals and API manufacturers. I find it fascinating to work with people from different industries with these two product lines.
About Ease of Working
Narita: I’ve found the Company easy to work for ever since I joined, and that’s really helpful. Two years ago, I began looking after family members, so I took advantage of flextime to leave work early.
Hatanaka: When I joined the Company, people in my department didn't seem to use flextime,

  Mizuki Hatanaka

Legal Department
maternity leave, or childcare leave, but I think many take advantage of these programs these days. The Company began offering annual leave by the hour in fiscal 2019. I sense that there are more programs available to better balance professional and private commit- ments, so I feel increasingly able to work
at my own pace.
Schüller: The telework program is useful. When I returned to Germany last year, I teleworked there on a trial basis and found it great, experi- encing no work delays.
Positive Work Environment and Health Management
Narita: If there is a string of days in which I have to rush home from work to care for a family member, I tire mentally and physically, so I use flextime to recharge my batteries. I’ve been able to avoid catching a cold by feeling less stressed and having a time buffer.
Hatanaka: I take time off when I have to go to the hospital on weekdays. To continue working to the best of my abilities, I make sure that I maintain my health. I think the Company’s programs are conducive to this.
Schüller: I don’t think we can all use the same work practices because everyone is different. For example, I think it’s great to try what suits you well, such as using flextime to start at 8:00 a.m. and leaving early or beginning at 10:00 a.m. after attending to family and other
matters and clocking out late.
Aspirations
Narita: I want our people to learn more about legal affairs. In my department, people some- times say that since I’m the youngest there and am a woman I’m more approachable for those seeking consultations about the law.
For example, it would be great if people could feel free to consult with us about using their personal seals. People can encounter problems if they haven’t sought advice from the Legal Department. I think we can help prevent issues by being more approachable.
Schüller: I would like to contribute to diversity within the Company. I want to look after human resources development and recruiting and endeavor to improve the Company by looking after an increasing number of foreign employees and absorbing a range of opinions and ideas.
Hatanaka: I find it very rewarding helping Group companies to operate. Now, I’d like to be able to implement operational measures locally rather than providing assistance from head- quarters, working in management, management planning, and administration. I want to do my part to help improve local operations in Japan and abroad.

We explore new business opportuni- ties in our “environment and energy,” “mobility,” “construction and infra- structure,” and “healthcare” domains. The following are highlights of fiscal 2019 and plans for these domains.
Low Carbon Technology
In June 2019, we established the Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage with Utilization Study Group with Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd., and JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION to collaborate with universities and other research institutions in developing new technologies to immobilize and use CO2.
One particular goal is to make industrial waste containing a considerable amount of calcium react with CO2 from factories and other sources, and use the resulting carbonate as an

Advanced Maintenance Systems
We are developing chemicals for a new construc- tion chemicals business by bringing together the organic materials design, synthesis, and dispersion technologies amassed in our chemicals business with the sales channels
of our construction materials business.
Our first effort in this regard has been to develop a surface protection technique that
lengthens the service lives of bridges and via- ducts. We are preparing to obtain certification from an assessment institution to commercial- ize this technique. It eliminates the need for reinforcement mesh, as the resin offers excel- lent strength and extensibility. The technique

                     offers outstanding workability and maintenance, as simply coating concrete can prevent chunks from breaking off, while it can ensure the visibility of foundations because coatings
are transparent.
We have begun developing other techniques
that take advantage of features of the Company’s resin materials, PCD among them, and seek to swiftly establish and expand our construction chemicals business.
Fostering Drug Discovery Research
We are engaging extensively in drug discovery research, leveraging our experience in commer- cializing four pharmaceuticals. In fiscal 2019, we licensed a candidate development com- pound for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to a major European pharma. The licensee plans to push ahead with development for clinical trials. We also look to provide foreign pharmas with therapeutic drug candidates for cancer, fibrosis, and obesity, for which unmet medical needs remain high. We will endeavor
to bolster our pharmacology and pharmacoki- netics evaluation underpinnings and streamline the exploratory cycle to identify new candi- dates. We also plan to cultivate neural and other new treatment areas.
Glossary
Intellectual Property (IP)
The UBE Group’s initiatives to reinforce and optimally leverage IP aim to enable us to cre- ate new businesses and bolster competitive- ness, thereby helping to build and expand enterprise value.
We seek to maximize our enterprise and IP value by formulating IP strategies according to our business strategies and by implementing
the PDCA cycle of IP strategy activities. Further- more, to strengthen IP research and analysis capabilities, we are working to improve opera- tional efficiency, including in R&D departments, by utilizing tools with artificial intelligence (AI) functions and to utilize IP portfolios*1 and open/ close strategies*2 while promoting IP activities that contribute to business revenue. At the same time, we are promoting global IP management as the UBE Group, and are advancing the shar- ing of activity policies and IP information with Group companies in Japan and overseas.
    *1 IP portfolios: Patents, copyrights, know-how, and other IP that corporations can use to formulate strategies and assess competitiveness

In fiscal 2019, consolidated net sales declined owing to lower prices of nylon, caprolactam, synthetic rubber, and other offerings, as well as a decline in volumes for coal and other products. Operating profit was down, as a demand slowdown for nylon, caprolactam, and other products outweighed the impact of lower prices of coal and other raw materials. Profit attributable to own- ers of parent decreased. This reflected a drop in non-operating income in the absence of pro- ceeds from the previous year’s equity-method affiliate business integrations and an increase in extraordinary losses from the transfer of the golf course business of a consolidated subsidiary.
The graphs on the page on the left show consolidated net sales and operating profit.
• Chemicals Fiscal Year
• Caprolactam sales declined amid lower prices, owing partly to slower growth in the Chinese and other markets, as well as falling volumes.
• Nylon sales were down owing to a drop in caprolac- tam prices and an easing in supply and demand amid slower growth in the Chinese and other markets.
• Industrial chemicals sales were down because a decrease in ammonia prices overshadowed the absence of biennial ammonia product plant repairs and higher production and shipment volumes.
• Fine chemicals sales dwindled. This was because although demand remained broadly solid, volumes dropped for some products amid intensifying competition.
Revenues and earnings were down for the engineering plastics & fine chemicals businesses overall, largely as a result of drops in nylon and caprolactam prices.
Synthetic Rubber Businesses
• Synthetic rubber businesses revenues and earnings were down. This was because demand stagnated and volumes declined as prices trended downward with decreasing butadiene costs.
Specialty Products Businesses
• Battery materials sales fell because volumes were off amid intensified competition in the Chinese mar- ket and owing to the impact of production adjust- ments among key customers.
• Polyimide sales rose because volumes were
solid for chip-on-film for displays, while volumes increased amid greater demand for organic electrolu- minescent panel varnish in the Chinese market.
Specialty products businesses revenues and earnings were down overall because a decline in battery materials volumes overshadowed robust sales of some products.
Pharmaceutical Businesses
• Revenues and earnings climbed because sales of

   • Sales of cement and ready-mixed concrete declined largely because this was an off period for domestic demand, particularly in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Other factors were natural disasters and construction delays.
• Sales of calcia and magnesia dropped because while UBE benefited from price revisions for magnesia for the steel and electric power sectors, volumes were down owing to lackluster demand for steel and refractory offerings.
• Energy sales were off because of lower coal volumes and prices.
Construction materials segment revenues were down but earnings were up, as lower coal costs offset the impact of lower volumes for cement and ready-mixed concrete, calcia, and magnesia.

Business Strategies for Fiscal 2020
Our construction materials are essential for society. We expect to remain profitable in the years ahead by expanding new businesses on top of stable business foundations. The outlook for fiscal 2020 is increasingly unclear reflecting the impacts of
an economic slowdown from last year and the COVID-19 pandemic, so sales of our products will likely remain sluggish. While it will take time for an economic turnaround to materialize after the impact of the pandemic abates, we look for domestic demand for cement to recover to a certain level, with that situation continuing for a few years and automobile production also recovering.
So, although the Construction Materials Com- pany will not dramatically alter its policies it will review priorities when implementing measures. It will flexibly accommodate changes in the business climate while accelerating efforts to boost the prof- itability of platform businesses and solidifying its footing, thereby reaching its Medium-Term Management Plan objectives.

cement, steelmaking, shipbuilding, and other key markets for the company, and we expect competi- tion to intensify. We will clarify our strategies and action plans in view of our forecasts and further reinforce our business structure.
Molding Machinery Business
We look to a recovery in demand from the second half of the year. We will accordingly cut costs to be a winner in each product market, shorten produc- tion lead times, and focus on developing products that match market needs. At the same time, we will bolster production management to strengthen our business structure.
In die-cast machinery, we are developing and launching new equipment and processes that cater to a fast-growing need for lighter automobiles and vehicle electrification. We are integrating and reor- ganizing domestic and overseas injection molding machinery business sites. We will take advantage of the opening in August this year of a new plant (Nagoya Factory) to build an integrated and optimal global production structure and thereby streamline operations and reinforce competitiveness.
        38

Strengths
• We have a robust record in serving the automotive, electric power, cement, steelmaking, and other key sectors, and have earned solid customer reputations for our efforts.
• We can draw on numerous domestic and overseas operations to cater to customer needs in everything from development through after-service.

• A sudden global economic slowdown could drive consolidations in key markets.
Countermeasures: We will leverage our strengths to reinforce our competitiveness and lift our presence when demand recovers.
• The COVID-19 pandemic could cause a global economic down- turn, causing demand for equipment to plunge. Countermeasures: We will cut product costs and shorten produc- tion lead times to secure business opportunities when a recovery materializes.
   SWOT Analysis
                 Industrial Machinery Business
In fiscal 2020, we will focus on production processes and cost controls for mid and large projects, particularly for domestic electric power projects for which we have secured orders. Also, we will achieve results in environmental equipment and new product development and expand alli- ances and collaborations to enter environmentally friendly product and resource recycling markets, accelerating activities to contribute to earnings. We will also take advantage of the smooth trans- fer of the chemical equipment business of Hitachi Plant Mechanics Co., Ltd. (announced in fiscal 2019), and product lineup and human resources expansions to focus on improving earnings.
Machinery Services Business
We will further bolster services and support by training and hiring more local employees overseas and otherwise strengthening our structure while expanding our parts supply capabilities. We will
ESG-Related Initiatives
also reinforce our services capabilities by integrating and reorganizing business sites in the United States, China, and Asia, centered on injection molding machines. In industrial machinery, we will strengthen alliances to bolster services proposal activities over- seas, and will strive to expand our business by pro- viding support for the products of other companies.
Steel Products Business
We expect the business climate to remain adverse owing to the global economic downturn and excess production capacity. We have accordingly harnessed our manufacturing capacity in specialty, niche, and large offerings in which we have a com- petitive edge, steadily producing results in building an optimal business structure through which we have switched from quantity to quality. We will continue striving to create a stable profit structure. In addition, we will expand environmental recycling (industrial and medical waste treatment) to become a third core business.
Bridges
   • Companies in the Machinery segment are focusing on developing products that help protect the environment while providing services that apply to existing facilities.
• UBE Steel Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the company, completely melts the industrial and medical waste in manufacturing processes, and is endeavoring to make environmental recycling a third core business.

 ESG: Underpinning Value Creation and Sustainable Growth
Roundtable Discussion between Directors, Institutional Investors, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors
 UBE adopted a Company with Audit & Supervisory Com- mittee structure in June 2019. As such, we are transfer- ring authority to executives and enhancing management
flexibility while bolstering Board of Directors’ oversight. That entity comprises nine members, of whom four are outside directors. We aim to enhance corporate value by incorporating third-party perspectives.
  Profile of Kazuya Uesako
Governance Structure and Positioning of Outside Directors
What do institutional investors think of UBE’s shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure? What do you seek from outside directors in terms of governance?
•
Kimura: I think this is a big step forward structur- ally speaking because the Company has clearly segregated supervision and implementation while strengthening monitoring. The shift to a Com- pany with Audit & Supervisory Committee struc- ture and a consolidation into a three-company operating structure should make selection and concentration easier. I look for this arrangement to prove effective.
Uesako: I believe it’s important to ensure that the Board of Directors is effective. The Corporate Governance Discussion section in last year’s integrated report outlined its initial aims. The tran- sition to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure was most likely the right move. Given changes in the auditing approach and an increasing reliance on internal control sys- tems, we will look for the committee to ensure that the system is functioning well.
Yamamoto: The consciousness of directors has changed over the past year. We require execu- tives to explain how they will increase corporate value. So, while they enjoy greater management
freedom, they also face the pressure of explain- ing their efforts to the Board of Directors. The nature of deliberations changed greatly during the year, as directors now ask executives on behalf of shareholders to explain what they will do over the medium and long terms.
Expansionary Perspectives
How are outside directors helping materialize Vision UBE 2025 –Prime Phase–, the medium- term management plan?
•
Higashi: I want executives to accord more time to explaining the background and direction of decisions rather than the details of implementa- tion. That’s a transformation of itself. The industry environment is changing rapidly, so we need to know if executives are identifying and responding to transitions. We also seek explanations in that respect, as business climate shifts could compel modifications to the medium-term management plan. Being an outsider makes you more sensi- tive to change.
Terui: Outside directors have varying back- grounds and experience, so I believe their role is to advise suitably and frankly about how best to create corporate value in view of the backdrop.
—
What do you seek from the Board of Directors to help foster growth for UBE?
•
Uesako: From a growth perspective, I would like the Board to help improve corporate value as a management supervisor. Instead of discussing details, I want it to advise accurately about areas relating to the overall essence of management.
Kimura: Diverse perspectives are vital for outside directors. The customer base is particularly broad in the chemicals field, so there are tremendous opportunities there. At the same time, there is a risk of missing changes in the business climate. Many of UBE’s outside directors have had solid experience in corporate management, so you

can anticipate views and oversight from a range of perspectives.
Yamamoto: Such diversity is very important. The views and expertise of outside members greatly benefit the Board of Directors because of their different backgrounds.
ESG Commitment
UBE emits a considerable amount of GHGs. How has the Board of Directors discussed this? And how do you think you will monitor efforts to reach your goals?
•
Terui: The Board often discusses environmental issues as important focuses for the Company. The future for coal is uncertain, so we need to work out where to take our business in that area. We have yet to determine a response timeframe, but we will set a course and act appropriately.
Cement is essential to society, but we gener- ate CO2 emissions through the production pro- cess. We naturally need to minimize emissions.
I think the UBE Group has been more willing even than others, including companies in its industry, to make cuts.
At the same time, we’ve created numerous products and technologies that contribute to a better environment, so the Company can help resolve environmental issues by expanding such efforts. Our endeavors very much prioritize the environmental element of ESG.
Higashi: It is a top priority to address environ- mental issues, and we have discussed them fre- quently in Board of Directors’ meetings. Individual businesses are exploring all sorts of ideas, such as by employing alternative, environmentally friendly materials, adopting alternative processes, and recycling resources. Still, if we fail to think of how to rebalance our business portfolio we will find it difficult to reach our goal of cutting our global GHG emissions under the Paris Accord and other agreements.
—
What do you seek from Ube Industries in terms of the environmental aspects of ESG?
•
Kimura: The issue of CO2 emissions is the Company’s greatest threat. It could also be
an opportunity. Your emissions could be from energy or from manufacturing processes. It is impossible to resolve emissions from non-energy sources without major technological advances.
I think the Company has a potential advantage
to drive technological changes in areas in which it operates. I would like the Company to highlight its long-term initiatives in this regard to the world.
Uesako: I also consider environmental issues extremely important. I would like to proceed to engage with the companies we invest in to work out how to cut GHG emissions. We request com- panies to use renewable energy, reduce energy usage intensity, and overhaul business portfolios. We also believe CO2 emissions are an issue for humanity to address, including people consum- ing goods and services, and not just producers. So, I would like the Company to proactively collaborate with industry groups to tackle problems rather than being forced to do so.
Yamamoto: The environment is the greatest focus for the UBE Group from an ESG perspec- tive, so efforts to lower environmental impact also serve as a growth strategy. People are coming
to understand that. You cannot change conven- tional manufacturing processes by yourself. We will collaborate with other industries to roll out various technologies and change things with them. I think that’s a mission for us.
Defensive Perspectives
Do you think your regular Evaluation Meeting for Effectiveness of the Board of Directors is worthwhile? What do you discuss?
•
Terui: Meeting attendees are non-executive directors, specifically Chairman of the Board Yuzuru Yamamoto, as well as Atsushi Yamamoto, who is director and a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, and four outside direc- tors. So, none of the participants are UBE executives. The meeting discusses the composi- tion of the Board of Directors, management approaches, the contents of its deliberations, and proactive and defensive governance from board perspectives. It also considers whether the Board of Directors properly supervises the execution of management. We conduct ques- tionnaires first and discuss and evaluate findings in the meeting.
Yamamoto: Primarily, outside directors deliber- ate after seeing questionnaire findings. It is also worth noting that UBE belongs to the Japan Association of Corporate Directors. We study
the effectiveness of other companies’ evaluations and incorporate good practices. So, all in all,

  I think we are assessing the current situation effectively.
—
Outside directors chair the Nominating Committee and the Compensation Committee. What are their decision-making processes
and how are they related?
•
Terui: Each committee has two outside directors and a non-executive director of the Company. Outside directors chair both bodies. The President and CEO is not on either commit- tee. Rather, he produces and explains drafts. Committee members point out issues, ask questions, advise, and make decisions.
Yamamoto: Outside directors are deeply involved with these committees. When we reviewed our executive compensation program last year, we reflected feedback from outside directors.
Uesako: From a defensive perspective, I partic- ularly look for a solid compensation and nomina- tion setup from outside directors. I want these people to fulfill a robust supervisory role.
Kimura: I think you disclose your compensation standards clearly and have solid goals. As such, if you maintain not only profit targets for your compensation standards but also your ESG perspectives you will make it clear that you are earnestly pursuing goals linked to remuneration. If you can emphasize that the Company has incorporated compensation standards in its specific initiatives, I believe you will further increase trust among external stakeholders.
Yamamoto: In reviewing our compensation program, we increased the number of qualitative elements of evaluation criteria for each year and over the medium and long terms. The criteria for assessing the President and CEO used to be exclusively management benchmarks, but we now also incorporate ESG and other qualitative factors in evaluations.
Challenges
How do you assess UBE’s governance and growth, and what are the issues?
•
Terui: Last year, we shifted to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure and decided to accelerate management while solidi- fying defensive elements. The prime issue for
governance is to make this approach effective. On the growth front, the main challenge is to cultivate emerging opportunities, especially in chemicals. Also, we need to promote further globalization, overhaul our business portfolios, undertake extensive M&As, and drive growth.
Higashi: The journey between UBE’s products and final markets is long. Given dramatic changes in the business environment, it will be extremely challenging to overcome the handi- caps of such distances. It is also worth noting that it is tough to ensure complete governance for what is a very broad and deep supply chain. Management will need to strengthen its capabili- ties in that respect.
Kimura: CO2 emissions are UBE’s biggest issue from an investor’s perspective. That’s also a business opportunity. I hope you can translate that challenge into growth in the years ahead. Your adopting a Company with Audit & Supervi- sory Committee structure positioned you to progress in that regard, and having a three- company operating structure makes selection and concentration easier. Over the past year, you have built your underpinnings far faster than anticipated. One fruit of your efforts is that your Construction Materials Company began looking to reorganize its cement business. While you face many challenges, you have so many opportunities. I hope you can maintain the
pace of the past year and keep the Company changing.
Uesako: We believe non-financial information
is vital for delivering growth, which is why
we adopted a Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management-created framework called MBIS (for management, business franchise, industry, and strategy). Under MBIS, the perfect score for the 500 companies in the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange would be 20 points. UBE’s score is 11.5 points, which is slightly below the average. That’s largely because of the Company’s high CO2 emissions and shortfalls in terms of lowering emissions or in the previous planning for the future. On the upside, UBE rates highly in terms of its business strategy implemen- tation. This is because of the people underpinning your ability to execute strategies. I have found through various contacts that your Company has many top-notch people. We hope you can bring together the strengths of all your people
to deliver sustainable growth.
Yamamoto: Thank you all for your time today.

Corporate Governance
The UBE Group’s fundamental mission is to achieve sustainable growth and increase the corporate value of the Group over the long term. As a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee, we accord- ingly created a structure in which directors in the Audit & Supervisory Committee with rights to audit and state their opinions at the General Meeting of Shareholders can vote in Board of Directors’ meet- ings, strengthening the Board’s supervision of busi- ness execution, and delegating important business implementation decisions to the President and Rep- resentative Director. We consider it important to maintain appropriate business activities and fulfill our duties toward and gain the trust of all stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, business part- ners, employees, and communities, as well as share- holders, by creating an effective corporate gover- nance, including to accelerate business execution.
Board of Directors
In principle, a director who does not serve concur- rently as an executive officer serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes decisions about important management issues in accordance with laws, regulations, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, and the rules of the Board of Directors, and also supervises direc- tors and executive officers to ensure they are

            performing their duties appropriately and efficiently. As a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee, we will accelerate operational execution by delegating decision-making on important operations to the Presi- dent and CEO while consistently reinforcing supervision.
Audit & Supervisory Committee
The Audit & Supervisory Committee monitors and ver- ifies the creation and running of internal control sys- tems and oversees the execution of duties of directors and other executive officers, thereby contributing to the sound and sustainable expansion of the UBE Group and helping improve corporate value over the medium through long terms. The committee operates based on annual audit policies and plans. Directors on the committee attend and express their opinions at important meetings, including for the Board of Direc- tors. They audit executive directors, executive officers, and Group companies, including their departments, and the Internal Control Department, to assess impor- tant decision-making processes and business execu- tion. The committee also receives audit reports from the Auditing Department, issuing instructions as needed, and regularly engages with the President and Representative Officer to confirm management poli- cies and exchange opinions about important issues. Directors on the committee are permitted to attend meetings of the Nominating Committee and Compen- sation Committee, which the Board of Directors
45

 oversees, and express their opinions at the General Meeting of Shareholders as needed as part of their supervision of directors and their remuneration (excluding those who are Audit & Supervisory Com- mittee members). The Audit & Supervisory Committee comprises three directors, including two outside ones, with an outside director serving as the chairman.

Effectiveness Assessment of the Board of Directors
Each year, we convene the Evaluation Meeting for Effectiveness of the Board of Directors for delibera- tions based on a self-assessment questionnaire. Meeting participants are outside and non-executive directors. The Board of Directors receives and assesses a report on those discussions.
The Board of Directors accordingly determined at a meeting in May 2020 that it had functioned effectively in fiscal 2019. It also found that this entity’s composition and operations were appropriate and that it had engaged in vigorous debate and deliberations.
The shift to a Company with Audit & Supervisory Committee structure broadened the scope for dele- gating decisions on important business matters to the President and CEO. This move also led to the gradual deployment of a structure for operating and internal control unit business reports. The Board concluded that it had strengthened management oversight effectively.
The Board will endeavor to become more effec- tive through its oversight focus to contribute to sustainable growth and enhance corporate value with respect to three key challenges. The first is to explore further broadening the scope of delegating decisions on important business matters to the
   Outside Directors
UBE has appointed outside directors to add indepen- dent, third-party viewpoints to the decision-making process and to the monitoring of management to ensure efficiency, transparency, and objectivity from June 2005. In addition, UBE employs a Nominating Committee and Compensation Committee that report to the Board of Directors. Each comprises three members—two outside directors (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee) and one non-executive director (Chairman of the Board)—and is chaired by an outside director.

Third, the Board will con- tinuously monitor systematic risk management prog- ress for the Group as a whole and strive to strengthen the effectiveness of internal control systems.
Effectiveness Assessment Process
(1) base compensation (fixed compensation),
(2) an annual incentive (Companywide performance-linked compensation and annual individual target-based compensation), and
(3) long-term incentives (medium-to-long term individual target-based compensation and stock options).
(b) The ratios of base compensation and annual and long-term incentives are set to allocate about 50% for base compensation, 30% for annual incentives, and 20% for long-term incentives. The ratios of annual incentives for the President and the Chairman are higher, and base compensa- tion lower, compared to those for other directors and executive officers.
(c) Directors who are also members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee and outside directors receive fixed, base compensation only.
(d) The objective validity of standards for director and executive officer remuneration is confirmed by constantly referring to remuneration study data from external research institutions and by making comparisons with levels at major manufacturers of similar sizes and in comparable industries.

Director and Executive Officer Remuneration
UBE revised its director and executive officer remuneration system effective April 1, 2019. The new system will apply to the target set for fiscal 2019, and evaluation of target achievements will
be reflected in remuneration for fiscal 2020. Remu- neration for fiscal 2019 was based on the old system is shown in Table 1 on page 44.
Please read Securities report for detailed infor- mation on the old system system (in Japanese only). https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/jp/ir/ir_library/securities_report/index.html
The major differences from the old remuneration system include the simplification of various bench- marks to aid understanding, with the compensation ratio for performance-linked portions increasing.
A. Outline of director and executive officer remuneration
(a) The remuneration structure for directors (exclud- ing directors who are also members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee and outside directors who are not members of the committee)
and executive officers at UBE consists of:
● Long-term incentive Approx. 20%
● Annual incentive Approx. 30%
● Base compensation Approx. 50%
Securities Report
  Note: The ratios of annual incentives for the President and the Chairman are higher, and base compensation lower, compared to those for other directors and executive officers.
B. Procedure to determine director and execu- tive officer remuneration
The amount of compensation for each director (excluding members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee) and executive officer will be deliberated by the Compensation Committee, which reports to
47

 the Board of Directors and is chaired by an outside director and a majority of which is comprised of out- side directors. After reviewing compensation, the committee forwards its recommendations and find- ings to the Board of Directors for a decision. The compensation of directors who are also members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee shall be decided through deliberations of members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee.

Establishing Internal Control is available on the UBE
Group’s website:
https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/en/corporate/management/ internalcontrol.html
Compliance
UBE established the UBE Action Guidelines as a code of conduct guiding basic behavior within the UBE Group and among constituent members. The guidelines outline the standards and criteria for com- pliance in corporate activities, which directors and employees are expected to adhere to.
UBE appoints a Compliance Officer for the UBE Group and maintains the UBE Group Compliance Committee including general counsels as an advi- sory body. Within the committee, it set up the UBE Group Competition Law Compliance Committee to prevent acts that impede fair competition and to ensure the soundness of business operations. It additionally set up the UBE Group Restricted Cargo and Export Management Committee to increase awareness within the Group of the need to prevent the unauthorized export or provision of goods and technology that are restricted under export control laws and regulations designed to maintain interna- tional peace and stability.
UBE is working to upgrade and strengthen structures and frameworks for compliance. Initia- tives include the introduction of the “UBE C-Line,” a hotline that allows executive officers and employees to directly report compliance issues without going through normal channels. This encourages the rapid finding and swift correction of compliance issues. By providing compliance-related information, e-learning, team coaching, and other programs, UBE continu- ously educates and enlightens its employees.
In fiscal 2019, UBE conducted internal training and education on laws and regulations such as the Antimonopoly Act, Subcontract Act, and Unfair Competition Prevention Act. The Company trained instructors for general compliance education at each office and facility to cultivate capabilities based in workplaces. We trained instructors to provide gen- eral compliance education at each business site and conducted workplace-based training. There were around 5,800 participants in fiscal 2018 and 2019.

Preventing Corruption
Chapter 3 of the UBE Group Action Guidelines
for Business Conduct, titled, Fairness and Integrity, states a commitment to maintaining healthy
relationships with governments and regulators. The objective is to prevent the bribery of public officials in Japan or abroad as well as other forms of cor- ruption. We accordingly formulated the UBE Group Anti-Bribery Guidelines, and provide e-learning
and collective training courses for executives and employees. We maintain a framework such that if matters of concern come to light through our inter- nal hotline, compliance officers and departments collaborate to swiftly inquire into the facts and take the necessary measures. In fiscal 2019, there were no incidences of corruption, which would be sub- ject to disciplinary action, or any penalties or other charges for corruption.
Please visit the Compliance section of the UBE Group’s website for the UBE Group Anti-Bribery Guidelines (in Japanese only). https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/jp/sustainability/compliance/
Thorough Procurement in Line with Basic Pur- chasing Policies (Supply Chain Management) The UBE Group endeavors to build fair and honest business relationships. We purchase in line with the Basic Purchasing Policies—Fair Transactions, Objective Selection of Suppliers, Compliance with Laws and Regulations and Confidentiality, Green Purchasing, and CSR Procurement*, as disclosed in the purchasing information on the UBE Group’s website.
Detailed information on these policies is avail- able on the UBE Group’s website: https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/en/koubai/index.html
CSR Procurement
The UBE Group prepared CSR Procurement Poli- cies and CSR Procurement Guidelines that encom- pass respecting human rights, complying with laws and social norms such as eliminating anti-social forces, and safeguarding the environment to foster CSR procurement that boosts standards across the entire supply chain.
In fiscal 2019, we conducted a third survey of 276 major business partners accounting for 90% of our procurement costs for materials, construc- tion, packaging materials, and fuel oil. We com- piled and analyzed the survey results, providing feedback Companywide. The goal of the survey was to assess CSR progress among business partners and seek improvements as needed. We spoke with business partners providing inadequate responses to drive improvements.

Personnel System
UBE maintains a personnel system in which
it clarifies what it expects of employees and impartially evaluates individual effort. We seek to ensure that employees therefore fully under- stand what they need to do and create work- places that are challenging and motivating for all our employees.

Human Resources Development
As part of our personnel systems, we provide on-the-job training, workshops and other off- the-job training, and self-improvement support programs with systems that empower our employees to perform at their best in an array of businesses and in an increasingly global operating climate.
A good example of our approach is the Career Development Sheets that employees prepare every year, based on which they can discuss areas in which they should enhance their skills and their prospects with supervisors. We rotate employees in keeping with their apti- tude to broaden their perspectives and exper- tise. For workshops and other off-the-job train- ing, we keep pace with changes in the operating climate by providing employee training programs that reflect skills required for each job level. We offer a range of programs that help employees enhance their capabilities, such as distance
Human Resources
The UBE Group considers employees its most
important resource for supporting sustainable growth.
We therefore devote considerable attention to human resources development, and are endeavoring to expand our personnel systems to ensure that all our employees are able to acquire the skills they need to continue doing great work.

Description
Employees whose spouses have given birth can take four days of paid leave.
Leave can be taken until the day before the child’s first birthday (or the child’s second birthday, in certain circumstances).
The first seven days of leave are fully paid.
Employees can take leave to provide nursing care for family members (up to a total of 365 days).
Employees can take leave on a half-day basis to provide nursing care for family members (up to a maximum of 5 days a year for one family mem- ber, 10 days a year for two or more family members).
Employees can take leave to nurse children in the third grade of elemen- tary school or younger. (Five days per child can be taken each year, up to a maximum of 10 days a year.)
The working hours of employees caring for children in the third grade
of elementary school or younger, nursing family members, seeing a doc- tor, and going to school can be shortened by up to two hours per day on request.
Employees can work from home as a means to raise productivity, improve work–life balance, and prepare BCPs.

learning and in-house and external language courses. We foster employee retention by bolster- ing career development.
We are particularly determined to retain young employees, and are cultivating them as tomorrow’s leaders at the UBE Group by helping them to experience their own growth and find satisfaction in their work.
Another way in which we endeavor to attract outstanding people is a program that we set up to prioritize rehiring individuals who resigned owing to family circumstances.
Enhancing Work Style Reform
Work style reform is an important management priority. As such, we strive to ensure high pro- ductivity by reviewing tasks from a range of perspectives, including through the use of ICT. At the same time, we offer telework, flextime outside core times, and other programs enabling more work practice diversity. We manage the time people spend working by PCs, set annual working hours targets through labor–management negotiation, and endeavor to lower overtime and encourage people to take annual paid leave. In the year under review, we endeavored to create working environments offering a healthy work–life balance by measures such as reducing working times by 31 hours from a year earlier.
Efforts to Maintain Operational Health
We endeavor to ensure the mental and physical health of employees through health and safety systems at each business site and efforts to encourage employees to engage in activities
to maintain and enhance their health.
We provide mental health assistance through
internal experts and through an externally run Employee Assistance Program that draws on highly experienced specialists, thus helping reduce incidences of new cases and long-term work absences. Our regular health checkups include tests for cancer and seek to identify early signs of illnesses. They also focus on improving conditions for checking for and raising awareness of female cancers and enhancing medical assessment rates.
Our endeavors to address occupational diseases entail undertaking medical checkups based on work records and findings from work environment measurements to deliver early detections and responses to any issues.
We have tackled cigarette smoking by for- mulating plans to eliminate passive smoking based on the Health Promotion Act. We are reducing the number of smoking areas at busi- ness sites and are remodeling smoking rooms. We additionally conduct health contests in which we employ health insurance subsidies to encourage people to smoke less or give
up tobacco.
In fiscal 2019, we held 26 training and
education seminars for 562 attendees on such topics as mental health, lifestyle diseases, and the use of health information.

Diversity Initiatives
Diversity is a key policy priority. We accordingly seek to build a corporate culture that respects individuality and broad perspectives and trea- sures creativity and ambition.
We endeavor to attract and retain diverse talent as part of efforts to overcome the looming challenges of a declining labor force and a changing business climate.
based on the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. The plan encompasses the following three benchmarks to realize more flexible working styles and provide greater opportunities for female employees.
(1) A paid vacation usage rate of 80% or more
(2) At least 70% of eligible male employees
taking childcare leave
(3) Women representing at least 20% of new
graduate hires for generalist positions
As part of our efforts to be more inclusive
for women, we have increased the number of
female employees at our factories and over- seas. Women are increasingly vital to our operations.
Most of our female employees return to work after maternity leave. The number of male and female employees balancing childcare and professional commitments is rising each year, driving efforts to make operations more efficient, review work practices, and otherwise undertake workplace reforms.
We recruit people with diverse talents regardless of career background, nationality,
or gender. The management team engages closely with employees, including through meetings to exchange opinions and through labor–management council gatherings. We endeavor to create workplaces in which employ- ees can fulfill their potential by performing great and satisfying work.

We are reviewing the roles and benefits of these people to enhance their work environments and motivation.
Recruiting People with Disabilities
We do much to foster the employment of people with disabilities, and maintain the UBE Group Support Network for Employment of People with Disabilities. We draw on the accumulated know- how of Libertas Ube, Ltd., a special-purpose subsidiary that we established in 1991, to hire these individuals and create workplaces for them Groupwide.
Human Rights
Respect for Human Rights
The UBE Group Action Guidelines state our respect for individuals while fostering mutual understanding and eliminating discrimination. The guidelines also state that we oppose forced and child labor and all other inhumane practices and reject any ties with individuals or organiza- tions engaging in such practices.
We ensure that all employees understand and embody our stance on human rights in
all aspects of business by providing executive, business site, and job classification-based training while offering Groupwide e-learning
to further enhance issue awareness.

Process Safety and Disaster Prevention
We endeavor to eliminate process accidents through initiatives that ensure our facilities are safe and secure. We also undertake activities to minimize damage in the event of major natural disasters. In fiscal 2019, we focused on compre- hensive measures to address the risks of acci- dents at aging facilities, improving safety at certi- fied high-pressure gas sites, and implementing natural disaster measures.
Measures to address the risks of accidents at aging facilities entail conducting inspections at each business site, choosing facilities and areas
not subject to inspection and audit over the long term, and formulating and executing inspection and audit plans. By undertaking comprehensive risk measures, we endeavor to build business sites that are impervious to accidents.
For certified high-pressure gas sites, we set up an improvement agenda in line with assessment findings from the Japan Safety Competency Center and engage in systematic improvement initiatives.
We push ahead with measures to address natural disasters by having each business site con- duct self-assessments in line with self-assessment criteria for such measures, and pursue ongoing improvements. We also respond to the Industrial Process Safety Action Plan of the Japan Petro- chemical Industry Association.

Fostering a Safety-Driven Corporate Culture
To make existing safety activities more compre- hensive and effective, in fiscal 2016 we launched initiatives aimed at fostering a safety-driven corpo- rate culture, encompassing eight elements. These are organizational governance, positive involve- ment, resource management, work management, motivation, learning and knowledge transmission, risk perception, and mutual understanding. In keeping with findings from assessments based
on headquarters’ evaluation standards, business sites identify issues and formulate and execute plans to cultivate a safety culture as part of ongoing improvement efforts.
Eliminating Major Disasters
We have undertaken a range of activities to prevent occupational accidents. In fiscal 2018, we initiated efforts that centered on eliminating major incidents. We conduct risk assessments of work in which people might fall, be caught or entangled in machinery, or come into contact with hazardous materials. We implement systematic risk reduction measures and endeavor to make operations inherently safe.
We investigate the causes of all incidents regardless of whether they result in lost time, striving to prevent similar incidents by assessing and rolling out measures.

     The UBE Group’s Basic Stance on Environmental Issues
Addressing Environmental Issues
Our Stance on Environmental Issues
We have identified four aspects of global envi- ronmental issues for which we have formulated a unified Group stance. These are tackling global warming, protecting biodiversity, dealing with marine plastics, and safeguarding water resources.
Detailed information about our basic approach
to tackling environmental issues is available on the
UBE Group’s website (in Japanese only):
https://www.ube-ind.co.jp/ube/jp/sustainability/rc/environment/ issues.html
Structure Relating to Environmental Issues
Please see page 17 for a chart on the structure relating to environmental issues.
(1) Tackling Global Warming
• Cutting GHG Emissions
We reached our fiscal 2021 goal of reducing GHG emissions by 15% from fiscal 2005 levels ahead of schedule. We are now striving to further con- serve energy and recycle more waste so we can reach our goal of cutting emissions by 17% from fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030. We will focus on developing technologies to recover and use CO2, thereby helping lower the overall GHG emissions of our supply chain.
Employees participating in the 12th Forest Creation Experiential Activity for Water Conservation
(3) Dealing with Marine Plastics and Conserving Water Resources
We use waste plastic as a source of energy for cement production, helping reduce the volume
of this material going to landfills. We help prevent plastic from being discarded and flowing into the oceans by conducting cleaning along the industrial roads around our plants.
We will explore specific policies for our activities, including to conserve water resources.

   Using Resources Effectively
Our cement factories
recycle diverse waste
and by-products as raw
materials (material recycling) and alternative fuels (thermal recycling). Our cement kilns operate at up to 1,450°C, so they can burn and detoxify substances that conventional counterparts could not handle. They can also process large waste volumes. It is also possible to use ash from incineration as an alternative to the clay used in cement, thereby eliminating the need to maintain final disposal sites.
In fiscal 2019, our three cement factories harnessed 3.30 million metric tons of waste and by-products, 2.91 million metric tons of which we sourced externally, contributing considerably to a recycling-oriented society.
We are developing new businesses to use waste materials in applications other than as materials for cement. For example, we recycle plasterboard, for which we expect demand to increase. We will continue to boost our capacity for handling various waste as part of efforts to expand our recycling business.
Please see Non-Financial Highlights on page 11 for details of our usage of waste substances and by-products.

 Reducing Industrial Waste
The Japanese government’s 4th Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society targets a 77% reduction in industrial waste landfill amounts from 2000 levels by 2025. The UBE Group endeavors to recycle such waste and cut landfill volume to contribute to a recycling-based society.
Industrial Waste Recycling
Our chemical factories, in-house power stations, machinery factories, and other facilities generate an array of industrial waste. We recycle most
of this material at cement factories and other Group facilities.
Industrial Waste for External Final Disposal
In fiscal 2019, we lowered such waste by 80% from the fiscal 2000 level. We will keep endeav- oring to cut volumes from fiscal 2020.

are significant*2 from substances subject to the PRTR Law, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)*3, and is striving Companywide to reduce emissions of these substances.
In fiscal 2019, we lowered emissions of these 20 substances by 29% from the fiscal 2010 level, suppressing emissions subject to the PRTR Law and VOC emissions.
Suppressing PRTR Substance Emissions
We handle 61 of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR Law. Our emissions of these substances in fiscal 2019 were down 33% from fiscal 2010.
Suppressing VOC Emissions
The UBE Group’s VOC emissions in fiscal 2019 were 40% lower than those in fiscal 2010.

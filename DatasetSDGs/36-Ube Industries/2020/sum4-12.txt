In fiscal 2018 and 2019, we strengthened proactive and reactive governance by revamping our corporate philosophy and manage- ment principles, transitioning to a Company with Audit & Supervi- sory Committee, and reorganizing into a three-company operating structure. In pursuing progress from these efforts, we will endeavor to strengthen our business foundations for further growth.

Message from the Chairman 

With our technologies and culture of taking on challenges, we will work to solve the most pressing issues of the new era. The IHI Group’s mission is to support people’s prosperity, safety and security. 
Tsugio Mitsuoka 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer IHI Corporation

The IHI Group conducts its business activities guided by the two tenets of its Management Philosophy: “Contribute to the development of society through technology” and “Human resources are our single most valuable asset.” 
Since its founding as a shipbuilder in 1853, IHI has continuously developed original technologies for each era, and contributed to the development of society by providing products and services that are the foundation of daily life. 
Our unwavering mission is to support prosperity, safety and security for people worldwide by solving the social issues of each era through the tireless pursuit of monozukuri (“manufacturing”), advanced engineering capabilities and technological excellence that have been passed down to us, and the achievements and trust that they have led to. 

We will respond to a rapidly changing social environment 
and further accelerate our transformation. 
Today, society and values are undergoing significant change; in particular, as regards sustainability. One such change is the move toward decarbonization in response to global warming and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events worldwide. To ensure sustainable development in the future, there is a need for diverse solutions adapted to the different industries that support people’s lives in each country and region. It is still too early to accurately gauge the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it will reshape the very structure of society. 
We have been working to transform our business model and operational structure based on our long-term approach: Tackle social and customer issues with customers and create new value. 
Amid these environmental changes, I believe we should return to our original purpose as a company and rethink our businesses. 
We will put the IHI Group back on a growth track 
under a new management structure. 
In June 2020, I became Chairman of the Board and CEO, and Hiroshi Ide was appointed President and COO. Mr. Ide, my successor, has broad vision on a global scale, agility and outstanding communication skills, 
along with experience, particularly in overseas sales in the energy field and including as managing director of an overseas subsidiary. 
In the face of this period of rapid change, we have appointed as president someone who has the sensitivity to understand what goals we should set and what we should do to support the sustainable growth of society. By strengthening our business execution framework, we will further advance our strategic allocation of resources, and complete the transformation of our business structure as early as possible. 
Under a new leadership structure and with the determination to transform the IHI Group, the entire management team is committed to putting the Company on a new growth track. We will show the world once again the true value of our relentless pursuit of monozukuri and our advanced engineering capabilities.

Message from the President

Management that is fully prepared to transform IHI 
I was appointed chief operating officer in April 2020, and president and representative director in June. In a business environment that is changing significantly, I have braced myself for taking on the responsibilities of president, and am fully prepared to transform the IHI Group. 
Previously, I worked in overseas sales in the energy field and as managing director of a subsidiary in Singapore. I became vice president of the Resources, Energy & Environment Business Area three years ago, and president last year. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, there have been increasing calls to shift to a carbon-free recycling-oriented society to achieve social sustainability. Having worked in the energy field for many years, I feel strongly that the IHI Group must urgently transform to ensure its future. My duty as president is to align the various businesses of the whole Group with its long-term approach—“Tackle social and customer issues with customers and create new value”—without letting up on the reforms of the last three years. I am determined to change everything that should be changed, even in businesses that currently seem to be doing well, to continue on our path of transformation. 


Changing our mindset to become a lean, flexible and agile company 
First, I will work to change our mindset to become a lean, flexible and agile company. This means being a company that swiftly reacts to and takes action on the issues it faces, including those of customers. To that end, every employee needs to be highly responsive in sensitively perceiving and acting on changes in society, customers and the people we work alongside. This will be the starting point for all that follows. 
As such a company, what do we need to do to transform? We will carry out reforms that cover all aspects of our operations, including human resource development, quality, safety, technology development and proposals to customers. As a company with a long history, we tend to think of the future as an extension of the past. Of course, it is true that we have been able 
to create socially useful businesses because of the achievements of our predecessors, and I have great respect for that. To achieve further sustainable growth, however, we must evolve into a company that can respond quickly while asking ourselves how we should transform. Just as the large dinosaurs became extinct because they were unable to adapt to changes in the natural environment, we cannot survive simply by remaining massive and heavy. Like the mammals that adapted to changes, we need to become lighter and more agile. 
When I became managing director of one of our Group companies in Singapore, I was the only Japanese person among employees of many different nationalities, and there was a sense that they were waiting for me to show them what I could do. I took action by creating a management policy that reflected my intention to transform the company, and by 
communicating the policy with perseverance until it was shared by all the employees. At the same time, whenever a problem occurred, I made sure that I reacted immediately and that we moved together to solve it. Over time, this approach led to more active communication, and employees started to ensure that I was kept in the loop about small risks they noticed in their daily work, and began taking me to visit local customers. In my responsibilities as president of IHI, I aim to take the same approach. I will continue to value dialogue with our various stakeholders, while pursuing a lean, flexible and agile management style. 
Getting started on restructuring our business to respond to the social changes brought on by COVID-19 
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of our major external challenges. In immediate terms, there are delays in new investment in infrastructure and facilities and equipment, and the pandemic is having a significant impact on results for civil aero engines in particular, due to the sharp decline in passenger demand and deteriorating business conditions for airlines. On the other hand, new needs have arisen, such as extension of the service life of existing equipment and enhancement of production efficiency. As featured in Group Management Policies 2019 (see page 23), I believe lifecycle businesses are the answer to these issues. Such businesses provide comprehensive support for operation throughout the equipment lifecycle, thereby giving customers confidence in using our infrastructure and equipment over a long period. 

6 

In our Group Vision, we seek to “offer the safety and security for the benefit of both the environment and humanity.” Even amid the current pandemic, climate change is having an enormous impact on society. We believe this is a social issue that we should address, and we will contribute to both mitigation and adaptation. With societal demands regarding safety and security, including health, becoming stronger, we have reaffirmed that providing the infrastructure for people to live with peace of mind must be our purpose. Although the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, the IHI Group will not change its direction. However, in view of the changing social and 
industrial landscape, we will not restrict ourselves to our current business areas as we restructure our business portfolio to incorporate future growth businesses. 
Refining our technologies and human resources and sharing a healthy sense of urgency to advance with frontline operations 
The most important resources for fulfilling the IHI Group’s long-term approach are our technologies and our people. The technological strength, human resource power and relationships with customers cultivated over our 167-year history are foundations we must continue to cherish. 
Human resources are essential to a company’s vitality. In light of the increasingly diverse nature of society, we are rethinking how we nurture talent and whether we should change our approach to recruiting. For IHI, which provides prosperity, safety and security to the global community, diversity and inclusion is a critical theme. This is because “prosperity” is a subjective value that differs completely depending on the country, region and individual. Can an organization without any diversity in racial background, gender and age group really provide that? The answer is no. 
“Contribute to the development of society through technology” is one of the tenets of our Management Philosophy, and our social mission. As the speed of change accelerates, our ability to respond quickly to society’s needs will be key. How can we sharpen and apply our technological 
 
7 

strengths, and who should we form partnerships with? We must be more flexible in our thinking about our technologies, and not insist on doing everything ourselves. 
Additionally, we are reinforcing quality assurance, safety and compliance based on the principles of Sangen-Shugi (“three realities”) from the viewpoint of risk management. Sangen-Shugi espouses taking action after taking a close look at the genba (“actual site”), genbutsu (“actual thing/ service”), and genjitsu (“reality”). It is the departure point for all our businesses. Furthermore, a healthy sense of urgency is important to 
properly managing risk. Nevertheless, if management simply preaches a sense of urgency from the top down, the desired effect may not be forthcoming because frontline workers may have difficulty picturing specific risk factors and feel anxious about the future. For that reason, it is important to create opportunities for bridging that gap through dialogue about what employees are thinking in their respective posts. If management shows employees in concrete terms the direction they should face and outlines the situations that could occur, their worries will turn into a healthy sense of urgency. They will then be able to take precise measures on the front lines to make sure that risks do not materialize. 
The IHI Group has a long history of striving to build industries and infrastructure in concert with the development of society. That DNA has been passed down to the Group today, and we have a firmly rooted culture of wishing to work for and with society, which includes being first on the scene to repair infrastructure during times of disaster. This culture is not something that can be created overnight; it is a strength that has been shaped by the steady, sincere efforts of employees over the years. When I was in charge of energy plants overseas, I saw first-hand how a power plant was built where there was nothing; the electricity went on, people came, and a new town sprang up around it. I am proud and happy that I was able to participate in that moment of history as a part of the IHI Group. 
Going forward, as a manager that forges new paths, I will work with employees to pass on this unique DNA and dedicate my efforts to building the IHI Group into an enterprise that society can continue to rely on.

Realizing a Carbon-Free Society 
Social Issue 
The IHI Group contributes to the realization of a carbon-free recycling-oriented society by reducing CO2 emissions throughout the value chain in the energy and industrial sectors. 
Solutions 
The IHI Group works to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the value chain not only by reducing emissions from its own business activities, but also by providing technologies, products and services that help customers reduce emissions. 

The Emissions Gap Report 2018 issued by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warned that unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 7.6% annually from 2020 to 2030, achieving the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement will not be attainable. 
The movement to switch from conventional to renewable energy resources is accelerating as a powerful measure for decarbonization. It is predicted that photovoltaic power generation will become the number-one energy supply source among all means of power generation by 2040. 
To ensure the stable use of renewable energy, electricity supply and demand control systems as well as efficient battery storage systems will be needed.

CASE STUDY 1 
One of the largest biomass power plants in the prefecture begins commercial operation in Kagoshima City 
Annual reduction in CO2 emissions 
Approx. 200,000 

In January 2019, Nanatsujima Biomass Power LLC, which was established by IHI and eight investment-partner companies, started commercial operation of the Nanatsujima Biomass Power Plant in Kagoshima City, Kagoshima Prefecture. 
Its power generation capacity is 49 MW, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of approximately 77,000 ordinary households. Based on the provisions of the Act on Special Measures Concerning Procurement of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources by Electricity Utilities, all the power the plant generates will be sold to Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. for a 20-year period. 
The plant uses three types of fuel: palm kernel shell, wood pellets and timber from forest thinning. Generating power with carbon-neutral biomass is expected to lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of about 200,000 tons per year compared to conventional fossil energy resources. Use of timber from forest thinning (from Kagoshima Prefecture) contributes to sustainable forest cultivation.

Social Issue 
In the aviation industry, while demand for air transport is falling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry continues to regard the implementation of climate change countermeasures as an issue it should prioritize. 
According to a survey by the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, the annual amount of CO2 emitted by international air transport is 560 million tons (figure for 2016), which is estimated to be approximately 1.7% of the 32.8 billion tons of CO2 emitted worldwide. 
In terms of CO2 emissions from international aviation, the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global goal of carbon- neutral growth from 2020 onwards.

One global-scale climate change goal is the reduction of CO2 emissions from aircraft. The IATA has set the target of reducing net aviation CO2 emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2050. Achieving that will require not only conventional technological improvements, but all-new aircraft systems that radically improve environmental performance while maintaining safety and economic efficiency. 
IHI launched the MEAAP (More Electric Architecture for Aircraft and Propulsion) project in 2012 with domestic aviation-related companies, and is conducting research and development aimed at practical application in the 2030s. 
The biggest challenge is development of a large-capacity electric motor-generator that can handle the necessary 
increase in power consumption. IHI is developing an engine embedded electric machine,1 which achieved a rated output of 250 kW in ground tests in February 2020. In May 2020, we completed the world’s first successful evaluation test of an air cooling system for 100 kW-class power electronics.2 In addition, we will optimize the system by linking it with electrification of the fuel system and the air conditioning and cabin pressurization control system, which are currently under development. 
IHI will further develop advanced technologies and aims to establish a new position in the aircraft industry, and thereby better contribute to mitigation of climate change through total energy management of aircraft. 
Engine embedded electric machine 
 
1. A motor-generator with excellent heat resistance that connects directly to the engine to provide the large amount of electric power needed by an electrified aircraft. It is mounted inside the tail cone of the engine. 
2. A clean, efficient cooling system for cooling power electronics (semiconductor- based electronic power conversion and control systems) that uses cabin air, which is typically emitted as exhaust outside the aircraft, instead of a conventional cooling system that uses cooling water, etc.

To reduce CO2 emissions related to air transport, there is a worldwide need for development of renewable alternative aviation fuels. IHI, under the consignment from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), is undertaking a project to develop technology for stable production of bio-jet fuel from fast-growing microalgae (hyper-growth Botryococcus braunii).3 
The project, which started in FY2017 has seen the progression of algal culture tests in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan and Saraburi Province, Thailand targeting future commercialization. We have also been developing an integrated process for reforming oil extracted from the 
algae to manufacture fuel. We are the first Japanese corporation to apply for and 
obtain ASTM D7566 Annex 7 standardization approval. Fuel that conforms to this standard can be mixed as is with existing fuels, meaning that engines and fuel supply infrastructure would need no modification. 
Based on the progress of this technology development, we aim to quickly begin commercial production of bio-jet fuel. In FY2020, we plan to supply our fuel for use in the aircraft of domestic regular airline routes for commercial demonstration flights.

CASE STUDY 1 Rehabilitation of three bridges in Bangladesh to improve safety and extend service life 

IHI Infrastructure Systems Co., Ltd., an IHI Group company, formed a joint venture with Obayashi Corporation, Shimizu Corporation and JFE Engineering Corporation for the construction and rehabilitation of bridges in Bangladesh. The project was completed in January 2020. 
National Highway 1, which connects the capital city of Dhaka with the major port city of Chittagong, is an important artery in the economic activity of Bangladesh. In recent years, worsened congestion due to increasing traffic, damage and deterioration of existing bridges had become issues. 
To solve these issues, a project to rehabilitate the Kanchpur, Meghna and Gumti bridges and construct second bridges 
parallel to the existing bridges was carried out. Measures to prevent scouring,* enhancement of seismic resistance, and other upgrades were implemented. These improved the safety performance and extended the lives of the existing bridges, while enabling them to accommodate rapidly increasing traffic demand. This project was financed through a Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) yen loan. 
The IHI Group will continue its contribution to ensure the 
safety and security of societies through construction of 
social infrastructure. * Erosion of soil around the foundation due to rain, wind and waves

Robo QS (simple remote control system) installed in backhoe 

CASE STUDY 2 Simple remote control system Robo QS used in disaster recovery work 
 
At the sites of landslides caused by typhoons and heavy rains, which have recently become increasingly frequent in Japan, fast work is required to prevent the damage from spreading. Due to the risk of secondary disasters, it is necessary to operate construction machinery remotely from a safe location, but the high cost of special construction machinery for use in disasters limits the number of machines that can be deployed. 
To solve this problem, IHI has developed and launched Robo QS, a remote control system for construction machinery, together with Fujita Corporation and the Kyushu Technology Office of the Kyushu Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, InfrastructureTransport andTourism. 
Robo QS is fitted to the driver’s seat of general-purpose backhoes to enable unmanned operation via remote control. Installation is very simple, and manual operation is also possible without removing the device. Currently, Robo QS has been deployed to the Kyushu Regional Development Bureau, and to the Chugoku Technology Office of the Chugoku Regional Development Bureau, and is being used at disaster recovery sites.

Whether developing and manufacturing next-generation engines or rockets, we are paving the way for the future of aerospace, using our organizational and technical skills to pursue the latest in global innovations.
External Environment
The movement to respond to climate change and the world’s shift towards a carbon-free society are accelerating. Accordingly, the issues facing society and our customers are becoming more diverse.
Energy management for the diffusion of renewable energy and distributed power sources, as well as for stable energy supply, is also strongly required.
In Japan, the increasing severity of disasters in recent years and aging infrastructure are fueling the needs to upgrade resilience and extend longevity.
Overseas, our concession businesses, which encompass
every stage from design and construction to operation and maintenance, are expanding, and we are carrying out road and railway construction projects, including bridges and tunnels.
There is a concern that conditions, including the global market slowdown in the automotive industry, which started with China, the associated slump in related components industries, and the prolonged stagnation of economic activity brought on by the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, will have a significant impact on this business area, especially on our automotive-related businesses.
The sharp decline in air travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected sales of aero engines and spare parts.
Many aircraft with IHI engines are newer models, which will be given priority when carriers restart operations, and therefore a relatively early recovery of profits can be expected in areas such as maintenance and the sale of spare parts.

  FY2020 Initiatives
Under Group Management Policies 2019, the medium-term management plan now in its second year, we are aiming to create new value and to contribute to social sustainability by working with our customers to tackle social and customer issues from the perspective of product lifecycles.
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in values and altered social and consumer behavior. Consequently, restructuring of corporate business operations and
the progress of digitalization are expected to accelerate. Under the approach set forth in Group Management Policies 2019, we will reassess how to respond to the new normal as a sustainable company, ascertain our business direction and promote structural reforms and portfolio management.
The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the performance of the Civil Aero Engines Business, as sales of engines and spare parts have fallen due to the sharp decline in passenger demand and deteriorating business conditions for airlines. In the automotive industry, despite expectations of an early recovery in the Chinese market, sales in the Vehicular Turbochargers Business are also projected to decrease due to the decline in global automotive demand and suspension of production operations of auto manufacturers.
Taking these conditions into account, we have reexamined the current medium-term
management plan,* and will work on formulating the next plan.
* A revision to the management policies was announced on November 10, 2020:

Next medium-term management plan

 Financial Strategy
   Takeshi Yamada
Executive Vice President Senior Executive Officer
Anticipating changes in the business environment, we will reconfigure our business portfolio and work to enhance the Group’s overall investment efficiency.
We invested in growth business areas, particularly the Aero Engine, Space
& Defense Business Area.
In Group Management Policies 2019, our medium-term management plan, our aim was to strengthen cash generation, and to use that cash to transform our business model in order to solve social issues, thereby enhancing the IHI Group’s corporate value. However, we were unable to avoid a short-term decline in production efficiency in the Aero Engine, Space & Defense Business Area, which requires a large amount of working capital, as we took corrective steps following the inadequate inspection case in the Civil Aero Engine Maintenance Business that occurred in 2019. Consequently, cash generation was unsatisfactory.
As a result of our efforts to correct this issue and prioritize safety and quality in everything we do, productivity generally recovered to its previous level. However, moving into FY2020, the Civil Aero Engines Business is being significantly impacted by movement restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our efforts to improve cash flows will continue, but in the short term, our main focus will be on securing liquidity using diverse financing sources.
In the current medium-term management plan, we planned to generate sufficient cash by balancing profitability and efficiency, and to use that cash to make growth investments of ¥420 billion over the three years. That comes to an average of ¥140 billion per year. Our investments in FY2019 did not reach the scale we expected because we are executing investments only after screening and other assessment of the anticipated investment effect. About
70% of investments were allocated to businesses positioned as growth businesses, particularly the Aero Engine, Space & Defense Business Area.
We will transform our corporate structure while minimizing the impact of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a steep decline in sales, mainly in the Civil Aero Engines Business, and significant deterioration will be unavoidable not only in profits, but also in cash flows. In response, we have implemented countermeasures in the short term, including the securing of financing to ensure liquidity on hand, partial freezing and/or reduction of investments, and reduction of total cost/fixed cost. The short-term partial freezing and/or reduction in investments mean that narrowing down the businesses to which we should allocate resources will be even more important.
Consequently, to achieve Group Management Policies 2019, we also need to swiftly advance the review of our business portfolio and corporate structure based on the assumption of a “with-COVID-19” scenario. First, after building a business continuity framework that ensures the safety of employees by thoroughly reviewing work systems and business processes, we will work toward the early recovery of the Civil Aero Engines Business and accelerate the transformation of our business model with a focus on ESG. In addition, we will flexibly allocate cash generated through reduction of working capital, as well as human resources to businesses where we have a strong competitive edge. In this allocation of resources, we will emphasize
  25

 the growth potential and profitability of businesses and investment efficiency, balanced with contribution to solutions for the issues facing customers and society. We plan to revise the targets of Group Management Policies 2019 to reflect the results of our consideration of these factors.
Based on our cross-shareholding policy, we sold all our holdings of seven stocks and part of our holdings of two stocks.
As a general rule, we look to reduce cross-shareholdings after having engaged in suitable dialogue with the issuing company. However, we may hold shares in strategic partners for business alliances, joint research and development, or other forms of collaboration, for the purposes of pursuing medium- to long-term growth and increased corporate value. Based on this policy, the Board of Directors reviews all cross shareholdings every year to verify the economic rationality of continuing to hold them. In FY2019, of the 57 cross-held stocks (including 26 stocks contributed to
the retirement benefit trust), we sold all of our holdings in seven stocks and part of our holdings in two stocks.
We strive to pay stable dividends with a target consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30%.
Our shareholder return policy of distributing stable dividends with a target consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30% remains unchanged. For FY2020, however, it is difficult to rationally calculate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our consolidated results at present, and whether we will have adequate funds for dividends at the end of the fiscal year is not certain. Therefore, we have regrettably decided to forgo the interim dividend for this period. We have yet to make a decision on the year-end dividend, as we need to give further consideration to the forecasts of results.
We aim to solve social issues through the initiatives of Group Management Policies 2019.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IHI Group is being buffeted by changes in the business environment unlike anything previously experienced. However, we will continue to operate while protecting the health of employees,
and by implementing the initiatives described in Group
R&D Expenses, Capital Expenditure and Depreciation
Management Policies 2019* we will help to solve social
issues and enhance corporate value while meeting the
expectations of stakeholders.

 Cultivating Human Resources as Change Drivers
   Basic Approach to Human Resources Management
Based on the tenets of its Management Philosophy, “Contribute to the development of society through technology” and “Human resources are our single most valuable asset,” the IHI Group works to develop and secure professionals as its most important management resource.
IHI has made diversity part of its human resources strategy, and strives to provide workplace environments where diverse individuals are empowered to reach their full potential.
The Attributes We Seek in Change Drivers
In Group Management Policies 2019, we seek to contribute to social sustainability from a long-term perspective by enhancing both customer value and the IHI Group’s corporate value. To achieve these goals, we will develop talent capable of driving our business transformation by responding flexibly and swiftly to changes in the business environment.
Based on our Management Philosophy and the IHI Group Vision, we formulated the Group Human Resource Management Policy as our basic policy for talent development. The policy defines our “ideal human resources” and identifies five qualities—“integrity and trust,” “for customers and society,” “innovation and creation,” “teamwork,” and “world- class professional”—as the values that all IHI Group employees should embody. We reflect these values in employee recruitment, development and evaluation.
World-class Professional
People who not only have world- class capabilities in their fields of responsibility, but can practically apply their abilities to produce results and continuously strive for further growth.
Teamwork
People who can collaborate with diverse stakeholders and at the same time make maximal use of their abilities to fulfill the shared Management Philosophy, Group Vision, and objectives, both as a team and as members of the
IHI Group.
For Customers and Society
People who through their work are able to bring prosperity, safety, and security to our clients, society, the Earth, and humankind, and at the same time endeavor to contribute to continuing this development.
Innovation and Creation
People who can think on their own to identify, take on and overcome issues for the purpose of creating new value through the use of
new technical skills, technologies and ideas.
Integrity and Trust
People who earn trust by fulfilling job responsibilities, and by conducting themselves according to higher standards in addition to norms and rules, alongside three principles: genba, genbutsu, genjitsu.*
* The real place, the real thing and the real situation. This includes seeing, hearing and feeling for oneself, being proactive, and visiting customers and work sites.
  Ideal Human Resources
   27
   
  Treat people with a commitment to integrity and trust
I think it is important to think of work as much more than just an assigned task, and to go about it with a sincere desire to help others as a fellow human being.
That feeling will always come through to the other person. Build a good relationship, then good work will follow.

       Our “ideal human resources” represent the work values IHI Group employees share and uphold in their work.
VOICE
We aim to grow as professionals by keeping these five qualities in mind as we work.
Think first about what you can do for customers and society
My job is to weld the pipes that make up boilers. Normally, I have very few opportunities to hear from customers directly, but knowing that the
finished product is being put to good use gives me pride that my welding is of service to society. Working with pride changes how you look at each
job and provides the inspiration to do even better.
Pursue the creation of new value by tirelessly striving for innovation and creation
When attempting to create something new, it is important to also talk outside the division with people in other business areas or external parties. Establishing connections across the Company is a way to encounter ideas and ways of thinking that may not have otherwise
occurred to you, and new combinations will be created.
Act while coordinating with others and thinking about teamwork
The IHI Group has about 29,000 employees. In that context, we should think about what we want to accomplish, and how we want to contribute
to realizing the vision of the Company and the division. When the position of each person is clearly defined, our relationships as part of one Company-
wide team will grow stronger.
Aim high as a world-class professional
            I joined IHI after studying business administration, with a major in English and Japanese, at a university in South Korea. Of course, I encountered various
differences at the Company, such as in its practices and philosophy. Whenever I felt a difference, I would dig deeper on my own with a spirit of inquiry to discover its root
causes. I think that kind of proactive attitude leads to world-class professionalism.
28
  
 Diversity and Inclusion
To achieve our goal of “cultivating human resources as change drivers,” it is important to organically link activities such as recruitment, training and assignment, evaluation, remuneration and promotion, and ensure that they are functioning effectively.
Moreover, the growth of employees is a collaborative endeavor between the employee and the Company, with the employee making efforts to grow through his or her daily work, and the Company providing opportunities to connect those efforts to growth.
The IHI Group clearly defines human resource development responsibilities for employees and responsibilities for the Company, as well as the roles of supervisors, departments and HR divisions in providing development opportunities. Furthermore, development is supported through the formulation of educational frameworks and training curricula, as well as a unique development path for each person in the workplace.

   CASE STUDY 1 Introduction of Career Development Program (CDP)
In 2019, IHI introduced a Group-wide Career Development Program (CDP) that tailors to the needs of each employee. This program encourages independent career development, accelerated growth, and lifelong learning.
For the program to work effectively, it is important to bring out employee motivation and workplace vitality through interviews and coaching by supervisors. Therefore, IHI provides training to supervisors to continually enhance their coaching skills.
CASE STUDY 2 Selection and Development of Management Talent to Lead Change
To carry out our business transformation, management talent to lead change will be essential. The IHI Group is taking a number of steps to that end, including succession planning for systematic development of successors, job grading to measure responsibility with a common yardstick across the Group, and identifying successor candidates among younger employees.
Effective from FY2020, we have revised the employee compensation system. This system will ensure that the right people are in the right positions throughout the Group, and that we are able to actively select, develop and promote capable and motivated employees.
   Empowering all employees to fulfill their potential
    Through the formulation of individual career plans, employees take an active role in thinking about their own career development.
Provide options for lifelong learning with learning opportunities tailored to growth objectives.
Interviews and coaching by supervisors accelerate growth and boost motivation and enthusiasm.
Bring out the abilities and growth of each employee by giving them opportunities to acquire a range of experiences and different viewpoints.

 Messages from Outside Officers
  Taketsugu Fujiwara
Outside Director
Career background: Mr. Fujiwara is currently a special advisor of Asahi Kasei Corporation, where he previously held the posts of president and representative director, and vice chairman. In providing advice and recommendations to IHI’s management, he draws on his extensive experience and broad insight from implementing multifaceted management.
  Pushing for further transformation driven by the conviction of IHI’s beliefs
Promoting Change with Strong Determination under the New Management Structure
Since my appointment as an outside director, I have exchanged opinions and offered advice and suggestions on initiatives for business structure reforms. IHI is truly a leader of the heavy industry that has underpinned Japan’s postwar growth. Because of its history and eminence, changing its culture and business model is no easy matter. Nevertheless, top management has maintained strong determination in its commitment to change since Chairman Mitsuoka’s time as president. Now I believe that IHI will be able to take its reforms a step further through President Ide’s energy and vitality.
Accelerating Change in Governance
The Board of Directors has changed. Directors who also have executive roles have come to express opinions in a supervisory capacity, and I feel that the separation of execution and supervision is effective. I also get a sense that IHI is moving toward autonomous governance—for example, risks are brought up not only by outside directors but also from within the Company.
Responses to misconduct are not left to frontline staff, but are handled at the management level. In the response to inadequate inspection practices in the Civil Aero Engine Maintenance Business, frontline employees themselves thought of and proposed actions for improvement. In addition, organizational changes were made to put a person in charge of consulting with rule makers to establish rules at the management level.
I am chairperson of the Remuneration Advisory Committee. For FY2020, we debated how the impact of COVID-19, which existing mechanisms are unable to take account of, should be reflected in remuneration.
In order to allow for factors specific to FY2020, we clarified issues to address through dialogue between the President and other officers, and made it so that responses to those issues will be evaluated and reflected in remuneration.
Sustainable Growth through a Well-Substantiated Renewal
Due to the impact of COVID-19, the global business landscape has shifted dramatically, and created a situation where nobody has the right answers. Rather than being fenced in by the past, President Ide and the executive team will forge new paths by communicating their values to stakeholders, heeding how stakeholders respond, and taking quick action.
IHI has carried out the job of “building society” by applying the shipbuilding technologies on which it was founded to branch out into bridges, power plants and other businesses. The Aero Engines Business in particular has expanded and grown into a key earnings driver. With this business as a cornerstone, I think IHI needs to accelerate its transformation by taking a fresh look at what it does well, based on its technologies and the trust it has built.
In further deepening discussions at Board of Directors meetings, I will do my utmost to ensure that IHI carries out a well-substantiated renewal.

  Toshio Iwamoto
Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member
Career background: In his audit work at IHI, Mr. Iwamoto draws on his abundant experience and broad insight gained while serving as CEO and director in charge of the Financial Segment at NTT DATA Corporation.
  Strengthening risk management and being flexible and adaptable to changes in the business climate
Impressions after One Year as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member
My first encounter with IHI goes back more than a quarter-century. NTT DATA’s head office was built on land owned by IHI, so I used to watch the new ship launching ceremonies of the shipbuilding works of Ishikawajima- Harima Heavy Industries, as the Company was known at the time. I was appointed as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member one year ago, but my impression of IHI has not changed—I still see it as a very serious company. IHI has a well-established reputation for its technological strengths, and the Company has consistently earned trust through its integral role in the building and maintenance of the social infrastructure, while evolving technologies to meet the demands of the times, from shipbuilding to energy and aero engines.
I believe management is the art of adapting to the business environment. Society will always change. It is important to assess the implications from a business management perspective, and then transform what the company does accordingly. That includes responding to the current pandemic. The president is the one who holds the key to corporate management and his or her primary job is to set the direction for the company. The timing for IHI’s appointment of a new president comes amid the tumultuous situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, I am rooting for President Ide.
Measures for Continuing Growth and Advancement
The Company has two main challenges to address for future growth. First is the active exchange of technologies and human resources across business divisions. One can find a silo mentality at every company,
but I think having a long history can make it especially hard to cross organizational boundaries.
Second is the strengthening of risk management. Currently, under the leadership of Chairman Mitsuoka, the Board of Directors receives regular reports on risks that have materialized. That is certainly a good thing. However, dealing with an event such as corporate misconduct or a quality problem after it occurs is only risk response. Risk management entails looking at the overall value chain to predict what could happen, and then taking proactive measures. It is this area where further improvement is needed.
Advancing Digital Transformation and Globalization through Practical Advice
My role as an outside Audit & Supervisory Board member is to audit operations in the Company’s strategic business areas based on two perspectives. The first is digital transformation. Such transformation will become increasingly important in streamlining business activities and enhancing the sophistication of products and services. The second is global management. A company that sells products to customers abroad is merely an “international company,” but that does not make it a “global company.” To be a global company in the truest sense, the Group must establish management systems suited to each country and region, while sharing a common set of values.
I will fulfill my duties by providing practical advice based on my management background at a tech company and contribute to the IHI Group’s development.

 Corporate Governance
 Corporate Governance Initiatives
Basic Views
Our corporate governance system improves management efficiency as a way to fully leverage our unique capabilities and in turn ensure sustainable growth and maximize corporate value. As a means to this end, we have separated management supervision and business execution functions, which heightens the efficiency and aptness of internal decision-making and lays a foundation to draft and put internal rules into practice. This approach ensures proper business conduct throughout the entire Group.
IHI is consistently enhancing corporate governance to earn long-standing trust and support from all of our stakeholders, including shareholders.
We strive to further corporate governance according to the following basic policies.
(1) Respect shareholder rights and ensure equal treatment
(2) Strive to maintain proper working relationships with all of our shareholders, including stakeholders
(3) Proactively disclose accurate corporate information, ensure transparency, and remain accountable to our stakeholders
(4) Clarify roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board to enable members to fulfill management, audit, and supervisory functions
(5) Engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders whose investment policy aligns with medium- to long-term shareholder interests
Overview of Corporate Governance Structure
The Company has an Audit & Supervisory Board, which comprises Audit & Supervisory Board members who audit the duties executed by directors. The Board of Directors makes decisions related to all important matters concerning the management of the Company and the Group, in addition to
supervising directors in their business execution. Outside directors, who are elected from among individuals with extensive experience and broad insight gained at the helms of management or with a high degree of specialist knowledge and diverse experience, participate in the Board of Directors’ decision-making process, offer advice and make recommendations independently of managers who handle business execution.
Business Execution Framework
The Company introduced its Executive Officer System to strengthen decision-making and supervisory functions of the Board of Directors, as well as to improve efficiency of business execution. The Company appoints executive officers by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Remuneration Advisory Committee and
Nomination Advisory Committee
The Remuneration Advisory Committee determines the suitability and objectivity of the officer remuneration brought before it by the Board of Directors. This six-person committee comprises three outside directors (one of whom is the chairperson), one outside Audit & Supervisory Board member, the director in charge of human resources, and the director in charge of finance and accounting.
The Nomination Advisory Committee oversees and advises the Board of Directors on appropriate officer nominations. This five-person committee comprises the President (who is the chairperson), and four outside directors.
Corporate Governance Structure
Policies Relating to Appointment of Officers
We have defined “Ideal Officer Attributes.” Furthermore, we have drafted the Independence Criteria for Outside Officers in accordance with the Tokyo Stock Exchange Independent Officer Requirements to ensure the independence of outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members. The Board of Directors has formulated a basic policy to appoint corporate officers who can best ensure sustainable growth and enhance medium- to long- term corporate value throughout the IHI Group according to these ideal attributes and the Independence Criteria for Outside Officers.
Evaluation of Board Effectiveness
The Board of Directors has been conducting evaluations of its performance annually in principle since FY2015 to further its effectiveness. The Board of Directors evaluation (self-assessment) carried out in FY2019 once again verified the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
However, we were able to identify several new risk factors from a broader view, including a need to strengthen oversight and monitoring of business execution and prevention of the spread of COVID-19. IHI affirmed these measures will deepen discussions and further enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.

 Policies and Procedures in Determining Officer Remuneration
Policy on Determination of Remuneration for Officers
Officer remuneration provides powerful motivation for IHI officers to achieve specific management goals by encouraging business execution founded in the Management Philosophy, Group Vision, and Group Management Policy for the purpose of fostering sustainable growth and increasing medium- to long-term corporate value of IHI. A fixed salary is merely one part of officer remuneration. IHI also sets appropriate performance-based bonuses
Calculation Method for Incentives
linked to fiscal performance in addition to performance-based share remuneration tied to corporate value and medium- and long-term performance. This incentivizes officers to demonstrate a sound entrepreneurial spirit.
Procedures for Determining Remuneration
IHI determines the remuneration for directors and executive officers through deliberation and recommendations from the Remuneration Advisory Committee with the final decision made by the Board of Directors. This process ensures fairness and objectivity.
Remuneration of Outside Directors and
Audit & Supervisory Board Members
IHI provides only a fixed amount to outside directors that takes their duties into account. We also provide only a fixed salary to outside Audit & Supervisory Board members based on their duty to oversee business execution throughout the entire IHI Group. IHI determines the specific amount of remuneration together with the Audit & Supervisory Board.
 We calculate incentives using consolidated ROIC and consolidated operating margin as performance evaluation indicators as these are important management indicators under Group Management Policies 2019.

 Risk Management
 Risk Management Initiatives
Policies
The IHI Group considers and engages in risk management as one of the top material issues of management.
The basic objectives of risk management are ensuring business continuity, ensuring the safety of executives, employees and their families, protecting managerial resources, and maintaining public trust. We manage risk in accordance with the following action guidelines based on the Basic Code of Conduct for the IHI Group.
1. Ensure the continuity of the IHI Group’s business operations.
2. Improve the public reputation of the IHI Group.
3. Protect the IHI Group’s managerial resources.
4. Avoid jeopardizing stakeholders’ interests.
5. Achieve recovery from damage as soon as possible.
6. Take responsible action when an issue arises.
7. Meet public requirements regarding risks.
Risk Management Structure
The IHI Group established the Risk Management Conference chaired by the CEO as a body to review policy initiatives, annual plans, corrective measures and other matters important to overall risk management.
We formulated the IHI Group Key Risk Management Policies to prioritize risks that need to be addressed. Each IHI division and Group company worldwide moves forward with independent risk management in accordance with these policies.
Some risks though are common throughout the entire IHI Group. Therefore, the Group Risk Management Unit made up primarily of head office divisions shares information and provides training to take advantage of expert knowledge and support risk management activities of each Group division. The Internal Audit
Division also strives to secure a suitable level of risk management by assessing the readiness and progress of the Group risk management structure.

Key Risk Management Policies in FY2020
Today, the business environment around the IHI Group is changing significantly. To accelerate business transformation while responding to the significant change, IHI must thoroughly identify the risks accompanied by the ever-evolving business climate, strengthen rapid response capabilities, and spearhead uncompromising risk management through the PDCA cycle. This understanding is the basis on which we formulated and are implementing the Key Risk Management Policies.
Key Themes
1. Evolve compliance program
2. Settle quality assurance framework
3. Enhance risk management for important business risk
 
 Measures in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Basic Approach
The IHI Group understands that responding to various situations including states of emergency is vital as an organization that supports social infrastructure. Therefore, we ensure business continuity of the Group.
We responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by urgently setting up a Crisis Management Headquarters led by the President as chief. As we continue our business activities, the Headquarters takes the steps necessary to prevent the spread of the virus by prioritizing the health and safety of our customers as well as officers and employees and their families above all else.
Initiatives
Providing a Work System to Prevent Infection
Administrative departments have increased the ratio of employees that work from home. Our works and other production bases have taken steps to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible when commuting and while at work. These measures include fewer on-site staff, alternative work schedules, and encouraging employees to commute using personal vehicles rather than public transportation. IHI also checks on the health of not only officers and employees but also their families every day and takes measures such as instructing employees that may be infected to not attend the workplace.
Securing Items for Infection Prevention
We have even secured stable procurement routes for masks, alcohol-based disinfectants, and other items for infection prevention to distribute and stockpile at each site.
Establishing Work Environment Guidelines
Division-specific guidelines to prevent infection have been formulated for offices, works, construction sites and other workplaces.
• Avoid the 3Cs (closed spaces, crowded places and close-
contact settings) at workplaces and work sites (rules including
two-meter distancing)
• Install transparent acrylic panels and use face shields
   38
  Helping to Prevent the Spread of Infection through IHI’s Businesses
   1
Launched FeverCheck® for Temperature Screening
IHI Inspection & Instrumentation Co., Ltd. has launched FeverCheck®, which measures body surface temperature distantly. Using AI to accurately identify human faces, the system can measure the body surface temperature of multiple people simultaneously without contact, and automatically notifies the operator when it detects someone with an abnormal body temperature.
At offices, factories, schools, hotels, airports, event sites and other public places, the system efficiently screens the temperatures of people walking by without the need to stop them. This reduces the risk of infection through contact, thereby contributing to sustainable social activity while preventing the spread of the virus.
IHI Agri-Tech Corporation has developed and launched medical devices and public health equipment (air cleaning and sterilization/deodorization equipment) that use ozone gas.
IHI Agri-Tech recently developed and launched a simple negative-pressure isolation tent as a quarantine space that can be used in conjunction with ozone-related products. This isolation tent is now being used in hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities where there are an insufficient number of negative-pressure rooms.
While strengthening the production system, production of these high-performance ozone-related products is being ramped up to meet demand in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

 Quality-Related Compliance Initiatives
The IHI Group strives for sound compliance founded on the Basic Rules of Compliance for IHI Group and other guidelines. These activities are conducted not only to address legal compliance but also to respond to the needs of society with a full grasp of the ever-changing values and expectations of society.
IHI Group Code of Action and IHI Group Quality Declaration were newly established to ensure that the entire IHI Group practices uncompromising compliance as a basic rule in light of inadequate inspection in the Civil Aero Engine Maintenance Business in 2019. We also conducted Quality & Compliance Training and follow-up support to nurture an even greater awareness about compliance in all IHI Group directors, officers and employees.
We will continue to ensure uncompromising compliance and prevent recurrence by finding the root causes of quality issues in an effort to rebuild trust.
Strengthening Quality Assurance and Quality Management Systems
The IHI Group established the IHI Group Quality Committee as a Group-wide committee on quality. The Committee deliberated and drafted important quality policies as well as promoted activities with the officer in charge of overall Group Quality Assurance as chair. The members are made up of the presidents of business areas, executives in charge of quality for business areas, and executives of head office divisions.
Creating Workplaces Where Everyone Has a Voice
Our president and other senior management visit worksites to engage in a dialogue where top management and employees have an equal standing for an active exchange of ideas.
In FY2019, we launched Quality Assurance (QA) teams made up of members from design, technology and quality departments at our plants in Japan to address any problems or issues faced on-site. IHI promotes ideal workplaces where employees can work in good health by solving problems from a Quality Assurance (QA) rather than Quality Control (QC) perspective based on communication and facts about the situation unique to each site.

 Report on Large-Scale Project Risks
Project Risk Management for Large-Scale Projects
The Project Risk Management Division was established in April 2017 following extensive losses on large-scale overseas projects from FY2014 through FY2016. The division has been strengthening the risk management system in collaboration with the risk management groups of each business unit.
To minimize project risks, the division performs pre-order and pre-investment reviews, and monitors projects that are under way. Present and former employees who are knowledgeable about IHI businesses, as well as outside experts, are appointed as certified reviewers, and conduct thorough, multifaceted reviews. In addition, given that some projects can take as long as four or five years, interim reviews timed to significant milestones are conducted to assess whether initial targets are being met.
Embedding Risk Management into the Corporate Culture
The number of major downside events occurring in large-scale projects has been declining. Lessons learned are being incorporated into the risk management framework, and those lessons are now at the stage of being embedded as part of the IHI Group’s corporate culture.
In FY2019, IHI took measures to prevent recurrence of downside events, including systematizing project risk management expertise and developing more practical training that incorporates case studies.
Impact of COVID-19 on Projects
To date, there have been no instances of the COVID-19 pandemic having a significant impact on the execution of projects. However,
at certain overseas construction projects, restrictions on the movement of construction personnel, the temporary withdrawal of locally stationed Japanese staff and other effects have arisen, and we are therefore monitoring these situations carefully. On the front lines of projects, measures are being taken to minimize the impact on work, such as establishing online management systems that enable prompt and safe communication with customers at the site.

 Addressing Climate Change
 Initiatives to Address Climate Change
Approach
Climate change has an enormous social and economic impact and is a vital social issue for companies to address in order to realize sustainability. The IHI Group sees climate change as one important management issue and is doing everything possible to combat it.
Our products and services strive to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the entire lifecycle. We monitor the environmental impact from business activities at our plants, offices and other business establishments to help us reduce CO2 emissions.
In May 2019, the IHI Group became a signatory to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by resolution of the Board of Directors. This framework plays a role as a tool to formulate strategies able to strengthen risk management and cultivate business opportunities.
TCFD Initiatives
In FY2019, the IHI Group conducted simple scenario analyses of four business domains with a significantly large impact on climate change: the Energy Business, Vehicular Turbochargers Business, Bridges/Water Gates Business, and the Civil Aero Engines Business.
The first step set (1) a carbon-neutral world as the highest transition risk and (2) a world greatly impacted by climate change as the highest physical risk in our own independent scenarios drafted with reference to external scenarios drafted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The second step identified risks and opportunities for all four business domains. The third step assessed the impact on each business. The fourth and last step drafted countermeasures according to our findings.
    1. Main Risks and Countermeasures Shared Across All Businesses
IHI Group Scenarios
(1) A carbon-neutral world
This scenario presents a world where society at large shifts to mitigate climate change to stop all greenhouse gas emissions.
(2) A world greatly impacted by climate change
This scenario presents a world that needs to adapt to the physical impact to directly confront drastic devastation by natural disasters.
Risks, Opportunities and Countermeasures
IHI divides the risks and opportunities identified for each of the four business domains and the countermeasures into two categories: 1. Risks, opportunities, and countermeasures shared across all businesses, and 2. Risks, opportunities, and countermeasures specific to each business.
Countermeasures set to address the two extreme worlds anticipated by these IHI scenarios enhance the resilience of IHI Group businesses against future risks.
Reduce costs in business activities through efficient production and distribution as well as the proper management of energy consumption
Concentrate investments in technological development while staying acutely aware of policies, technologies, markets, and other social trends
Actively draft and promote business plans that always anticipate multiple business scenarios to adapt to dramatic changes in market structures
Disseminate easy-to-understand information about products and services that can help both mitigate and adapt to climate change
Incorporate the response to climate change into the business continuity plans of plants and offices to ensure the safety of officers and employees and strengthen the supply chain

Value Creation Story 1 Mitigation of Climate Change (Part 1) 
      
Realizing a Carbon-Free Society 
Social Issue 
The IHI Group contributes to the realization of a carbon-free recycling-oriented society by reducing CO2 emissions throughout the value chain in the energy and industrial sectors. 
Solutions 
The IHI Group works to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the value chain not only by reducing emissions from its own business activities, but also by providing technologies, products and services that help customers reduce emissions. 

The Emissions Gap Report 2018 issued by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warned that unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 7.6% annually from 2020 to 2030, achieving the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement will not be attainable. 
The movement to switch from conventional to renewable energy resources is accelerating as a powerful measure for decarbonization. It is predicted that photovoltaic power generation will become the number-one energy supply source among all means of power generation by 2040. 
To ensure the stable use of renewable energy, electricity supply and demand control systems as well as efficient battery storage systems will be needed.

CASE STUDY 1 
One of the largest biomass power plants in the prefecture begins commercial operation in Kagoshima City 
Annual reduction in CO2 emissions 
Approx. 200,000 

In January 2019, Nanatsujima Biomass Power LLC, which was established by IHI and eight investment-partner companies, started commercial operation of the Nanatsujima Biomass Power Plant in Kagoshima City, Kagoshima Prefecture. 
Its power generation capacity is 49 MW, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of approximately 77,000 ordinary households. Based on the provisions of the Act on Special Measures Concerning Procurement of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources by Electricity Utilities, all the power the plant generates will be sold to Kyushu Electric Power Co., Inc. for a 20-year period. 
The plant uses three types of fuel: palm kernel shell, wood pellets and timber from forest thinning. Generating power with carbon-neutral biomass is expected to lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of about 200,000 tons per year compared to conventional fossil energy resources. Use of timber from forest thinning (from Kagoshima Prefecture) contributes to sustainable forest cultivation.

The importance of solar power generation and other renewable energy in the fight against climate change is receiving increasing global attention. In order to effectively generate renewable energy, which varies in output depending on the weather and time of day, a sophisticated energy management system and energy storage system will be an integral part of dispatchable energy. 
IHI Terrasun Solutions, Inc. is expanding an energy management services business for effective use of renewable energy in North America. Based on advanced hardware and software, as well as data analysis technology, IHI Terrasun Solutions provides support for 
maximizing customer profit not only in the design and construction stages, but throughout the project lifecycle. 
In the project executed in FY2019 with Convergent Energy + Power Inc., IHI Terrasun Solutions delivered a solution that utilizes the electricity pricing system for the peak-shaving market in Ontario, Canada by discharging battery during peak periods, and substantially reduces electricity costs to end-customers. 
With this and other projects, IHI Terrasun Solutions now has a total of more than 320 MWh of energy storage installed and contracted, and expects to reach 600 MWh in FY2021.

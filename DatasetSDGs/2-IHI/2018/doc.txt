Tomiji Hirano (1846-1892) An entrepreneur who established the Ishikawa Hirano Shipyard (now IHI). 

Enduring Legacy from 165 Years Ago 
The arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry’s fleet in Japan in 1853 prompted the Tokugawa Shogunate to establish the Ishikawajima Shipyard to counter Western power. Tomiji Hirano later set up the Ishikawajima Hirano Shipyard with a lease from the Meiji Government as Japan’s first private modern shipbuilding site. The construction of warships there propelled the nation’s progress through industrialization and technology. It is from Mr. Hirano that the IHI Group derived the management philosophy of “Contribute to the development of society through technology” that remains central to its DNA.

Message From the CEO 
           
Technology, people, and a commitment to change are in our DNA. We will marshal the IHI Group’s comprehensive strengths to bolster corporate value. 
Tsugio Mitsuoka 
IHI Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer 
IHI has continued to contribute to social progress and change through manufacturing over its more than 165 years of operations. In 1853, the Tokugawa Shogunate set up our predecessor, the Ishikawajima Shipyard, ahead of the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry in Uraga, which led to Japan’s opening to the West. It is from this origin that we have amassed outstanding technologies, people, and a commitment to change in our DNA. 
We have always operated in eras of constant change. What is different now is that the pace of change is accelerating. Key examples are the digitization of information through the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and other vehicles, which are transforming the business landscape. There is a growing need to prevent global warming and safeguard the environment by reducing carbon emissions or decarbonizing while embracing diversity and reforming work practices. 
We must strive to match social expectations and our responsibilities to society. 
The IHI Group will help materialize a sustainable economy by changing with the times and generating ongoing growth while resolving social issues. 
   
11 IHI Integrated Report 2018 
Fiscal 2017 Review 
We recognized a greater need to adopt more robust project implementation and risk management structures and accelerate the pace of change. 
Group Management Policies 2016, which the IHI Group rolled out in fiscal 2016, aims to strengthen its earnings foundations. We aim to reach our management goals by pursuing concentration and selection through new portfolio management, boosting profitability by reinforcing our project implementation structure, and employing common Group functions to transform our business model. 
P. 9 Group Management Policies 2016 In fiscal 2016, the first year of this initiative, we 
undertook a range of measures in keeping with the top priority, which was to restore stakeholder trust. Unfortunately, the profitability of large projects declined, and we were unable to reach our initial earnings targets. 
In fiscal 2017, our efforts included strengthening project and risk management in keeping with a new slogan, “Recover trust and drive reforms.” To restore stakeholder trust, we need to remain consistently profitable by preventing earnings downturns in projects. We will drive reforms by accelerating business structure reforms 
to bolster our earnings foundations and reach our management targets. 
Challenge ESG Management Data Section 
Resolving Social Issues through Business The Foundation for Sustainable Growth 
Priority policies in fiscal 2018 
We aim to materialize Group Management Policies 2016 by pushing ahead under a new slogan. 
For fiscal 2018, we unveiled a new slogan to guide our endeavors in view of changes in the operating climate that have made it imperative to transform the organization. The slogan is, “First year for change.” The idea is to encourage our people to collaborate with each other beyond business or divisional boundaries. 
The slogan underscores our commitment to swiftly reforming our business structure and model amid relentlessly dramatic changes in the operating climate. 
Priority companywide policies for fiscal 2018 
Strategy 
Creating Value for Businesses and Society 
We helped to recover trust by surpassing our initial operating income target, demonstrating our ability to strengthen our earnings foundations. That said, profitability deteriorated at a North American process plant project and at affiliate Japan Marine United Corporation. We must build more robust project implementation risk management structures to truly recover trust. 
We have already addressed the situation at the North American process plant project by putting experts in the right places, including some former IHI Group employees, and undertaking frontline-focused risk management efforts. Our endeavors at Japan Marine United include reinforcing governance and dramatically increasing our cost competitiveness. 
To drive reforms in keeping with the business area setup that we adopted in April 2017, we shifted away from the individual management of strategic business units to consolidate business domains and accelerate decision making under selection and concentration, focusing resources on growth areas. Notwithstanding these efforts, the operating climate changed faster than expected, and our business structure and model reforms did not progress swiftly enough. 
In fiscal 2018, we rolled out companywide priority policies to tackle these issues. 

“First year for change” 
ー Drive change through teamwork beyond divisional boundaries and effective communication ー 
Switch to robust project implementation and risk management structures 
Reform quality and operational systems to bolster manufacturing capabilities 
Increase profitability by changing business structure in line with operational strategies 
Transform business model to create customer value 
Create new workplaces by reforming work practices and cultivate human resources 
IHI Integrated Report 2018 12 
Adopting a more robust project and risk management structure 
A top priority measure is to adopt a more robust project and risk management structure. We will manage risks more attentively under the setup that we put in place in fiscal 2017. We will additionally enhance communications at business sites to tackle risks in a timely manner. 
We cannot avoid all risks, of course, and in fact we should be prepared to embrace them where necessary. If we fail to do so, we cannot expect to generate growth or great returns. This is particularly true in deploying new technologies or engaging in new national projects. 
Boosting profitability by matching the business structure to business strategies 
We will deploy resources in any business area with profitability potential. In the Civil Aero-Engine business, for example, we have enhanced profitability by supplying high-value- added products based on proprietary technology. We have focused on developing and engineering proprietary materials to greatly increase the lightness and fuel economy required of such engines and building production processes. This effort led to the selection of our composite components for the PW1100G-JM engine, for example, helping us to expand our market share. 
On top of that, we will step up our post-sales maintenance and other aftermarket efforts. We have long and outstanding records in the Civil Aero-Engine, boiler, and other businesses in this respect. We will also allocate resources to cultivate our aftermarket capabilities in the Industrial System and General-Purpose Machinery and other businesses to increase groupwide profitability. 
Changing our business model to create customer value 
It is vital for the IHI Group to serve advanced information society needs to generate growth in the years ahead. We accordingly position digital technology as the engine for changing our business model. 
We developed the IHI Group Lifecycle Partner System (ILIPS), for example, a shared remote maintenance platform that we apply to a range of products and services. ILIPS analyzes operational data from equipment delivered to customers to identify potential failures, 
and we have begun using it to recommend optimal maintenance and operational regimes. 
It is through such efforts to bring together digital technology and our manufacturing expertise to provide solutions that help increase customer value and thereby build a new business model. 
Improving business processes to reinforce our manufacturing capabilities and reform work practices 
Steady and ongoing improvements are essential for us to materialize the goals of our management policies. Since fiscal 2013, we have deployed I-Project activities groupwide. I-Project entails cutting costs, streamlining tasks, and reforming work practices by formulating and rolling out initiatives to improve business processes. We are determined to generate results by implementing PDCA cycles, and our management team exchanges views with employees at business sites to help step up activities. 
We will make improvement efforts integral to our corporate culture so we can ensure that our businesses can respond robustly to changes in the operating climate.

ESG initiatives 
We will resolve social issues and materialize a sustainable economy. 
The sustainability of society and businesses has returned to the spotlight among stakeholders, who increasingly demand growth based on long-term perspectives. Many companies maintain strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments. It is also worth noting that even the United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such developments illustrate the importance of the public and private sectors partnering to overcome social issues and ensuring that this planet is permanently habitable. 
We will strengthen ESG efforts as business underpinnings. We also look to our products and services to contribute to economic sustainability by resolving social issues that are the subject of Sustainable Development Goals. 
We will additionally contribute to conserving energy and lowering environmental impact by supplying products and services that increase manufacturing efficiency for customers. The need for products that lead to low- carbon emissions or decarbonization will increase in 
the years ahead. The Carbon-Free Energy Project unit, which Corporate Research & Development launched, exemplifies our dedication to resolve social issues through intensive technological development. 
We consider it essential to improve corporate value by embracing diversity. We will step up efforts groupwide to enhance our employment systems and corporate culture to enable diverse people to reach their potential regardless of gender, race, nationality, disabilities, age, or sexual orientation. 
We also believe that the diverse talents of individuals are important for us to flexibly address changes in the business climate. We will transfer personnel among Group companies so younger employees can become more experienced. 
P. 51 Human Resources Management 
We strengthened governance in fiscal 2018 by amending agenda criteria so the Board of Directors can better deliberate on important matters and monitor management. Another key improvement was to require from the end of June 2018 that outside members constitute one-third of the Board of Directors. Having our management incorporate the views of external directors with diverse backgrounds enables us to create a transparent business structure by strengthening domestic and overseas governance and risk management. 
P. 41 Corporate Governance Initiatives 
The notion of using SDGs to resolve social issues through business is consistent with our corporate philosophy, which is to contribute to the development of society through technology. We believe that striving to resolve such issues unleashes new innovation and business opportunities, and will pursue progress in that regard. 
We have positioned fiscal 2018 as a year for formulating our next medium-term management plan. I look to identify where we will direct corporate activities down the track, starting with resolving social issues.

Project Risk Management Division Report 
Mission of Project Risk Management Division 
IHI inaugurated the Project Risk Management Division in April 2017 to strengthen the Company’s position in view of extensive losses on large projects in fiscal 2014 through 2016. 
The division’s main task is to analyze these projects and investment risks and support implementation to prevent downturns. Another key role is to report swiftly to relevant departments and management upon becoming aware of risks that could compromise corporate operations. 
Project management structure 
The division assesses large projects prior to bids, monitors ongoing projects, and audits and monitors investments. It allocates more of its people to monitoring ongoing projects. In fiscal 2017, the division set up a certified reviewer program, through which IHI retirees and external experts 
versed in our operations bolster its monitoring setup. Most of those reviewers were formerly division director or executive expert with extensive project management experience. These people overview projects from overall 
and frontline worker perspectives to ensure proper execution. 
Management targets and auditing and monitoring processes The division audits prospective projects and monitors ongoing projects and investments. Projects can be as short as two years or extend to four or five years. So, around half of the projects were already under way started before IHI strengthened pre-bid assessment processes in fiscal 2016. Ongoing projects are subject to deliberations at each major milestone so the division can determine whether they have reached targets set at the outset and take proactive measure before risks materialize. At the pre-investment assessment stage, the division

establishes prerequisites for each milestone and exit strategies to minimize the impacts of financial losses. The division rigorously assesses the consistency of business strategies and policies, competitive positions, and investment frameworks, as well as total and annual investment levels, investment returns, and other factors. After investment initiation, the division liaises with business area Risk Management department to monitor whether things progress as planned. 
Collaborating with business areas and overseas bases At the same time we set up the Project Risk Management Division in fiscal 2017, we established organizations to oversee risk management for each business area. Since projects execution procedure and expertise vary across the SBUs, the division deepens communication with each business area by sharing key risk management points and improving screening and monitoring. For overseas projects, we collaborate with bases in New York for the 
in accordance with specific characteristics. Projects and investments can never be risk-free. In order not recur large scale downturns at all we will therefore do our best to eliminate risk factors by screening more carefully, and will exert ourselves utmost to early identify and minimize risks by communicating closely with frontline sites.

Fiscal 2017 review and outlook 
At this juncture, no major downside elements have arisen with projects for which we have received orders since fiscal 2016, so we have concluded that pre-bid assessments have helped to lower risks. Still, our monitoring efforts have focused on detecting risks at early stages. For the year under review, we accordingly booked losses to cover several downside risks, including for a North American process plant project. Most downturns have stemmed from failing to sufficiently identify risks and take countermeasures against them when estimating project expenses in the proposal stage. So, risks materializing during projects have exceeded budgeted amounts. To eliminate downside factors we are focusing on comprehensively estimating risks based on our experience and systematically dispensing with them. We will assist efforts to produce more accurate estimates

Financial Strategies 
Maximizing cash generation by undertaking measures that prioritize ROIC improvements Under Group Management Policies 2016, our medium- term management plan, for fiscal 2018 we target an operating margin of 7%, a ROIC (see note 1) of 10%, and a debt-to-equity ratio (see note 2) of 0.7 times or less. 
By strengthening our earnings foundations, we aim to maintain an ROE (see note 3) of 10% or more over the 
Key financial indicators 
(in bold are management objectives under Group Management Policies 2016) 
medium to long terms. The IHI Group’s management has traditionally emphasized earnings. Under the current medium-term management plan, we made generating cash another priority as an ultimate business goal while also seeking to increase our return on capital. In other words, we are focusing on such key capital efficiency benchmarks as ROE and ROIC. 
Pursuing concentration and selection efforts that are commensurate with the IHI way Under Group Management Policies 2016, we allocated 25 strategic business units to five future mission classes according to their business positions and established two categories to optimize our business portfolio. One category designates investment priorities for management resources. The other designates rehabilitation or reorganization for businesses 
posing viability concerns, notably in terms of market attractiveness and assets held. By thus clarifying business-specific missions, we have created a framework for making swift concentration and selection decisions. 
Some investors may point out that having an array of strategic business units might impede optimal management resource allocation. On that note, it is important to note that areas like our core aero engines business inherently take years to become profitable. We can only cultivate our investment strategies by diversifying and investing in a wide range of businesses. So, while 25 strategic business units may be too many, it is vital to diversify investments to an extent to cultivate tomorrow’s core businesses. 
Focusing on generating cash flows and swiftly enhancing long-term shareholder value The IHI Group’s capital policy prioritizes producing shareholder returns, remunerating employees, and making growth investments rather than simply retaining cash. We fundamentally seek to pay stable shareholder dividends, amounting to ¥60 per share annually. Notwithstanding minor swings in current yearly investment levels in view of business strategies, basically it is our policy to maintain capital expenditure, R&D, and investment and lending at more than ¥100 billion. 
We seek to swiftly generate more than ¥100 billion in operating profit to further enhance shareholder value. That would be sufficient to repay loans, deliver shareholder dividends, and undertake growth investments. If we thereby reinforce our financial position, we will be able to improve our credit rating and secure higher quality funding that we can use to invest in growth. In entering a virtuous circle like this, we should be able to take steps to improve shareholder value even more, notably by reassessing our shareholder returns policy. We look forward to the ongoing support and encouragement of stakeholders for our efforts.

Delivering optimal solutions to customers while catering to diversifying energy demand 
Conserving the environment while stabilizing energy supplies We have a social responsibility to ensure stable supplies of the energy that is vital to people’s lives while lowering environmental impact. We provide products and services that are optimal for humankind and the planet throughout their life cycles, drawing on our technological strengths in handling such energy sources as coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables. 
Overviewing fiscal 2017 and looking ahead 
Orders were far lower than targeted in fiscal 2017, a key factor being a global downturn in plant construction demand. We collaborated with the Project Risk Management Division to more tightly monitor and stem profitability downturns on large projects that have caused concerns. Analyzing the causes of previous drops enabled us to significantly improve business processes and position ourselves more solidify to eliminate such downturns. We were unable to eliminate an operating loss, however, owing to large losses on a project in North America. We will continue to reduce engineering, procurement, and construction costs in fiscal 2018 to become more cost competitive and secure orders. It is also worth noting that we adopted a structure in which we can flexibly reallocate capital investments, R&D expenses, personnel, and other resources as order volumes change. We seek to return to the black in fiscal 2018 by steadily implementing our measures. 
Harnessing the IHI Group’s technologies and network to build new ties with customers In fiscal 2018, we established a business development 
department that integrates business development functions and sales supervisory functions directly under business areas. Here, we look at the customer's needs widely from the viewpoint of business areas, promote development to realize customer value, and are accelerating commercialization. At the moment, about 30 projects, mainly renewable energy-related projects, are moving. Recently, we are also increasing the number of customers who are aiming to expand business overseas. We are extremely pleased to make use of customers overseas as partners by utilizing the track records of overseas plant construction and the networks around the world. Of course, throughout the entire life cycle of products such as maintenance and preventive maintenance, we work hard not only to build facilities but also to contribute to efficiency improvement and profit maximization by optimal operation of facilities as a long-term partner of customers. 
Utilizing its strengths such as combustion technology, contribute to the realization of a low-carbon society The global community increasingly demands the creation of a low-carbon economy. Nonetheless, some regions and customers still need affordable fossil fuels to maintain stable power supplies. We are accordingly endeavoring to provide renewables that employ our strengths in technology that optimizes combustion efficiency. A good example is the use of biomass and ammonia with coal in boiler fuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
In March 2018, we completed construction at the Nippon Paper Ishinomaki Energy Center. The center can derive up to 30% of its fuel from wood biomass, and is the largest facility 
of its type in Japan. We have started proposing an energy management setup that combines storage batteries and gas turbines with renewable energy facilities, whose output fluctuates according to the weather, to optimize operations in keeping with demand changes. We have made significant progress in research and development into producing hydrogen from brown coal with a view to expanding the use of hydrogen energy. We will help materialize a sustainable economy by fulfilling our commitment to providing stable energy supplies and lowering environmental impact by drawing on the technologies we have cultivated over the years and the Group’s comprehensive strengths.

Grow as a corporate group that develops social infrastructure worldwide with its partners
Our sustainable growth mission and strengths in supporting business strategy implementation Our Social Infrastructure & Offshore Facilities business encompasses such areas as social infrastructure development, security, and offshore and urban development. We have a particularly strong record in shield tunneling machines for bridges and tunnels. Through these projects, we pursue our mission building social infrastructure that safety and security.
Many projects are large, bespoke, and extend over several years. Engineering has to reflect progress with specific works, customer requirements, and other factors, with installation matching local characteristics. Our integrated manufacturing capabilities empower us to satisfy these needs.
Overviewing fiscal 2017 and looking ahead
We performed better in almost every aspect of operations in the year under review.
Improvements were particularly noteworthy in the floating natural gas facility business, which had hampered operating income. In the year under review, our numbers were
much better, as we shortened construction lead times
by collaborating more closely with Japan Marine United Corporation and leveraged information and communication technology to boost productivity.
In the mainline bridge and watergates business, the number of large projects has increased to repair facilities constructed during Japan’s fast economic growth period. We have also undertaken many new projects in emerging nations, and seek to expand this business area with local partners.
The Linear Chuo Shinkansen project will enable us to
demonstrate the comprehensive capabilities of such offerings as shield tunneling machines and concrete segments1.
We will endeavor improve the production capacity at each works and generate solid orders for the project.
In urban development, redevelopment of the Toyosu area of Tokyo’s Koto Ward will end with the completion of Toyosu Bayside Cross, an office and hotel complex. We will draw on our achievements in Toyosu to redevelop a factory site in Sunamachi, Koto Ward.
Improving customer value and productivity through information and communication technology
Improving customer value will be central to our efforts beyond fiscal 2018. Corporate Research and Development, which we established in fiscal 2017 provides services
that employ information and communication and artificial intelligence technologies. One application is the use of remote monitoring devices in locations that are difficult to access to streamline inspections of bridges, watergates, shield tunneling machines, and other facilities. Another service deploys information and communication technologies to enable real-time management of progress at construction sites. This setup could not only enhance productivity but also improve site work practices.
Working with partners to grow as a corporate group that contributes to social infrastructure development
We will need to accelerate global development to grow over the long term. We aim to lift overseas from around 10% of earnings, to 40% or 50% by 2023.
Collaborating with overseas partners will be essential as cultural norms and rules differ from country to country. Outside Japan, we will shift away from solely engaging in bridge construction to engage in the concession business2. It will thus become more important to build long-term relationships and optimize supply chains.
We are also proceeding in cooperation with local companies for two projects whose construction started in 2018.
The construction is for the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link in India and for a suspension bridge over the Danube in Braila, Romania.
We aim to grow with our partners by becoming an enterprise that contributes to safety and security by constructing and operating transport infrastructure throughout life cycles.

Demand rising for infrastructure development in fast- growing emerging economies
China, Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and other emerging markets are experiencing swift economic development. Urbanization will likely accelerate in the years ahead, inevitably generating demand for large infrastructural development. To date, we have constructed the Nhat Tan Bridge in Vietnam and the Osman Gazi Bridge in Turkey.
We plan to keep participating in infrastructure development in emerging markets.
Forming consortiums that harness our strengths
In emerging markets, we have formed partnerships with firms that are familiar with local business norms, rules, and supply chain conditions. For the road bridge order from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, we teamed up with Larsen & Toubro Limited, India’s largest general contractor.

Employing advanced technological capabilities to construct 10-kilometer bridge for Mumbai Trans Harbour Link
IHI Infrastructure Systems Co., Ltd., is part of a consortium that received an order to construct a bridge for the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, a maritime road that is around 22 kilometers long. Once completed, the road will slash travel times between the Mumbai city cener and the suburb of Navi Mumbai. This will alleviate traffic congestion and cut carbon dioxide emissions. The consortium is manufacturing and transporting box girders for the bridge. Since the structure will be constantly exposed to sea breezes, we are applying a heavy corrosion-proof coating on the girders. This coating will be a first in India. Advanced Japanese technology will contribute to the safety and reliability of this infrastructure.

Changing our business model to sell value rather than products and reinforce customer value
Business area situation and goals
The Industrial Systems & General-Purpose Machinery business has seven strategic business units offering an array of products in key industry fields. They are logistics and machinery, transport machinery, parking, thermal
and surface treatment, vehicular turbochargers, rotating machinery, agricultural machinery and small power systems. We seek to eliminate inefficiencies and resolve social issues worldwide in manufacturing, mobility, logistics.
Overviewing fiscal 2017 and looking ahead
Sales and operating income exceeded initial forecasts in fiscal 2017. This reflected higher revenues in vehicular turbochargers and increased thermal and surface treatment orders.
Products accounted for the bulk of sales. After analyzing our earnings structure, we found that it was more profitable to sell value than products. This was particularly so in such areas as maintenance, parts replacements, and contracted processing.
In fiscal 2018, we will accelerate a shift away from selling products in keeping with a companywide focus on changing its business model to create customer value.
Business model transformation initiatives
Around half of the 10,000 people or so in our business area are outside Japan. We have traditionally focused on selling individual products, but to expand after-sales services we
need to strengthen cooperation within and outside that area, partly by setting up service units that can accommodate our product diversity.
In a drive to sell more value, we joined hands with Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc., to research the use of the Internet of Things for advanced coal unloading yard facilities operations services. We are deploying ILIPs®, our proprietary shared remote monitoring platform, at coal unloading facilities that we have delivered to date to oversee facility operations. This setup replaces humans in daily inspections, with these labor savings improving customer value.
Developing new technologies in response to change
We believe that the vehicular turbocharger market will keep expanding for the foreseeable future as manufacturers downsize engines to lower environmental impact. We are accordingly developing new models to match customer needs and are also working on electromotive turbochargers for hybrid cars. The business development department that we established in fiscal 2017 is developing technologies for electric vehicle contactless power supply systems, and will serve changing customer needs.
With artificial intelligence (AI) evolving rapidly, Corporate Research & Development collaborated with an American venture to develop the IHI Depalletizing System, a robotic setup that unloads cardboard and other items in logistics warehouses. We believe that demand for such unmanned
systems has surged as tools for resolving such social problems as an aging population and labor shortages.
One of our key strengths is that we have a diverse product range and networks of customers in an array of industries. We will take advantage of those capabilities to overhaul our profit structure by guiding our business model away from selling products toward selling value. We will strengthen our ability to suggest ways to resolve customer issues by building open and global partnerships.

Eliminating increasing labor shortages
in logistics sector
The spread of smartphones has boosted the scale of online ordering, exacerbating logistics labor shortages. It will likely become difficult to secure sufficient workers for heavy tasks. Palletizing and depalletizing loads at distribution centers will probably become more difficult, making it vital to deploy robots to overcome labor shortages.
Developed with American startup to dramatically improve processing capacity
We combined the IHI Group’s robotics control technology with the 3D vision and AI technology of Kinema Systems Inc., an American startup, to develop and commercialize the world’s first AI-equipped depalletizing system.
This setup employs AI-based object recognition technology to determine positions, sizes, and orientations of cardboard items. This makes it possible to unloading 450 packages and mixed pallets per hour, representing a 30% capacity improvement.

Opening new frontiers by collaborating with global partners to cater to growing needs
Roles and business strategies
for sustainable growth
In this business area, we supply civil and defense aero engines, rocket systems, space utilization systems, and defense equipment and systems. We are Japan’s dominant producer of aero engines. Our operational mission is to contribute to safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly aviation and to Japan’s national security and help realize the dreams of humankind through space development.
What sets us apart from other areas of the IHI Group is that we engage more in mass production. We face a greater challenge in calibrating supply to fluctuating demand levels. We must manage operations based on teamwork that involves customers and the supply chain to streamline production and generate cash flows, and such a capability is one of our key strengths.
Overviewing fiscal 2017 and looking ahead
Sales in fiscal 2017 were down amid lower unit demand because of a shift to new civil aero engine models. In contrast, operating income increased, owing largely to stronger demand for spare parts and favorable exchange rates.
The business model in civil aero engines is to inject forward investments to undertake development, begin mass production, and thereafter recoup investments over long periods, notably through maintenance and spare parts sales. We participate in programs to develop such engines as the Passport20 and GE9X as foundations for sustainable, long-term growth. Earnings may flatten out for several years after fiscal 2018, as we are pushing forward with development. I am confident that such investments will
result in future growth.
Spare parts sales for defense aero engines were solid in
the year under review. We are developing a production framework for the F135 turbofan for the Japan Air Self Defense Force’s F-35A fifth-generation fighter. As a primary contractor of Japan’s Ministry of Defense, we developed and delivered a prototype engine for a future fighter jet in June 2018.
In the rocket systems and space utilization systems, we are developing technologies to improve satellite load capacities to foster private sector demand. January 2018 saw the launch of the Epsilon-3 launch vehicle, which offers additional capacity.
Contributing to society through business
by delivering new solutions
Societies place growing expectations on solutions that use satellite data. We accordingly launched a service to provide ship location information around the world, and we are cultivating ways to ensure safe and efficient maritime traffic. We plan to develop satellite data usage services by bringing together resources from the IHI Group’s diverse business. Applications include long-term weather forecasting and early forest fire detection.
Responding to market needs
and progressing with partners
In fiscal 2016, we constructed building employing advanced technology to manufacture composite parts at the Soma
No. 1 Works in Fukushima Prefecture to serve rising demand for civil aero engines.
We are concentrating functions by extending the capabilities
of our Akishima office in Tokyo to ensure rapid and efficient technological development and engine design. The Mizuho Works in Tokyo catered to our expanding maintenance business by building a disassembly and assembly facility for the PW1100G-JM engine. We plan to construct a new factory for additional projects.
We seek to double productivity, and are accordingly rolling out Internet of Things technology to create smart factories. We are creating a system that digitally links people, objects, and facilities to enhance efficiency and are endeavoring to improve capacity utilization rates and work efficiency.
We seek to progress further with customers and partners by catering to growing market needs.

Contributing to safer, more comfortable, and affordable air transportation through proprietary advanced technology
- Developing new materials and technologies for aero engines -

Air passenger demand should remain strong worldwide in the years ahead. In the next two decades, it is estimated that roughly double the current number of aircraft will be needed. We must cultivate high-value-added manufacturing to capitalize on such market growth. We contribute to safer, more comfortable, and more affordable air transportation, and are thus working on a range of proprietary production technologies.
Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP)
We developed techniques to employ light and strong CFRP on large fan parts that create thrust on aero engines. Such parts have been used on the advanced PW1100G-JM engine. The results are considerable weight savings, improved fuel economy, and lower noise.
Ceramic matrix composites (CMC)
As well as lightening engine fans, which is pivotal to improving fuel economy, we are working on CMC, a
light and extremely heat-resistant material, for turbine parts. With engine manufacturers worldwide making new breakthroughs, we are accelerating development with materials producers and domestic research organizations to swiftly cultivate practical uses for CMC.

Additive manufacturing (3D printer) technology
We are developing additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, technologies, which have captured considerable attention worldwide in recent years.
The advantages of 3D printers include flexible designs, low manufacturing cost for small runs, short production lead times. These printers could revolutionize parts designs and development lead times. We have already demonstrated the benefits of 3D printing for shaping large components of rocket turbo pumps, and are pushing ahead with 3D technology development to drive aerospace manufacturing innovations.

The IHI Group’s digital transformation Our digital transformation entails changing our
products, services, business models, and other aspects of our operations with IoT, artificial intelligence, and other technologies to create new value.
We collect and analyze operational and other information across product life cycles through ILIPS®, our shared remote maintenance platform.
It is through this approach that we will innovate predictive diagnostics, optimal drive assist, and other unique services.
IHI Transport Machinery Co., Ltd., started field tests with Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc., to jointly develop advanced coal conveying facilities services that would be a world first in the electric power sector.
Belt conveyors take coal from ships to power station boilers. Over the years, personnel have had to inspect the conveyors several times daily, regularly replacing or repairing parts, to keep everything up and running around the clock.
The tests with Kansai Electric are at its Maizuru Power Station. The coal unloader is connected through the Internet to ILIPS® to remotely monitor the facilities. An artificial intelligence setup analyzes
running data in real time, predicting and preventing problems to ensure operational stability.
We are developing sensing technology to identify belt damage and roller deterioration on the belt conveyor. Timely parts replacement before deterioration goes too far would minimize costs and labor.
We could apply such remote monitoring and predictive diagnostics to a range of facilities that we supply. We will draw on advanced IoT-based services to help resolving problems, notably by stabilizing the operations of social infrastructure and plant facilities and cutting costs.

Technology Strategy
Driving R&D at unprecedented speed and contributing to social needs
New value in technological development comes from understanding and catering to the customer needs that predate services and products. Corporate Research & Development’s mission is essentially to ensure the timely delivery of vital technology.
The world and customer needs are changing as never before. But R&D does not change overnight. So, how can we reduce that gap? One approach is to undertake R&D after anticipating customer needs. Another is to accelerate R&D by harnessing open innovation with partners who can compensate for our shortfalls.
Establishing Works Lab to cultivate new fields with business areas
In fiscal 2017, we established the Works Lab to focus on high priority areas to accelerate the R&D that customers
demand. The Works Lab collaborates with our business areas in renewable energy, electrification, and advanced manufacturing. The focus in the latter areas is to automate manufacturing processes. In aero-engines, for example, IHI has already deployed a process to automatically laminate carbon fiber-reinforced composites, enabling it to handle increased orders. Naturally, customers can also employ our advances.
Strengthening activities of IHI Tsunagu Lab activities and accelerating innovation
We opened the IHI Tsunagu Lab in 2014 as an open innovation hub. It has since welcomed more than 10,000 visitors from enterprises, universities, and research institutions in Japan and abroad.
This facility showcases the seeds of IHI Group innovation and holds seminars on technologies that the Group is exploring to identify matches with external technologies.
It is also a direct engagement vehicle for researchers and customers, and has contributed to ideas to resolve issues and accelerate technological development.
IHI is a manufacturing and engineering enterprise that remains dedicated to the best interests of its customers. That is the IHI way. Companies cannot hope to survive without anticipating and addressing change, but this fundamental commitment should remain perpetual. By staying close to our customers, we will always continue to explore manufacturing the IHI way.

Tackling an aging social infrastructure 
Quickly and carefully injecting new life into social infrastructure 
        
Roads are vital to the quality of life and economic activity. Much of Japan’s social infrastructure was developed when the nation experienced high economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s. Given that some of this infrastructure exceeds 50-year life planned life spans, such aging poses serious social issues. There have also been maintenance issues with some younger infrastructure. A tragic outcome was the December 2012 collapse of concrete ceiling panels in the Sasago Tunnel that killed nine people. It is increasingly important in Japan and even overseas to upgrade infrastructure to prevent such catastrophes from recurring. 
In the next decade, around 30% of Tokyo’s Metropolitan Expressway will be more than 50 years old. Around a million vehicles a day travel along the network, making construction very challenging. The daily traffic volume of large vehicles is around five times greater than that on general roads in Tokyo’s 23 wards. As a result, cracks have increased in decks supporting expressway bridges, and 
steel decks and girders are incurring more fatigue damage. Over the next 10 years or so, expressways and bridges around Japan will undergo upgrades and repairs at an estimated cost of ¥4 trillion. Around ¥1.6 trillion has 
Reconstruction of Shiodome Viaduct on Yaesu route of Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway 
been earmarked to replace decks. In fiscal 2017, the IHI Group won an order to replace the deck Kawabata Viaduct deck on the Central Nippon Expressway Company’s Odawara-Atsugi Road.

Slashing construction periods for large replacement projects 
We undertook a major project from 2011 through 2014 to reconstruct the Shiodome Viaduct on the Yaesu route of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. It was a challenge on this congested section of the road to minimize closures without compromising quality and safety. The project involved removing all of the bridge girders in a single overnight operation in view of safety and location considerations. 
We then installed new ones. We shortened installation and reduced road closures by using the large block batch erection method. This entails assembling bridge girders at the site and lifting sections with modular transporters above intersections. 
This process enabled us to complete the project in 17.5 months, 2.5 months faster than planned. We received the Tanaka award from the Japan Society of Civil Engineers in 2014 in recognition of this achievement. 
Project handling decks with complex structure 
We rebuilt the deck of the Tsunakigawa Bridge on the Tohoku Expressway in 2012 through 2014. The bridge is near the Sendai-Miyagi Interchange, opening in 1975. The reinforced concrete deck had suffered considerable corrosion from aging, increased heavy vehicle traffic, and the application of de-icing salts in winter. Maintenance had entailed adding concrete to the top of the deck and repairing parts of the pavement. We replaced the deck in 
view of repairs becoming more frequent recently. The bridge has a complex structure because of a nearby interchange. Deck replacement also necessitated imposing traffic restrictions as the bridge crosses a national highway. Other complications to the project were the engineering challenges and the mandate for replacement work to be only at nights. We tackled the engineering by replacing the bridge’s conventional reinforce concrete deck with a precast prestressed concrete (PCa) one that could work with complex linear shapes. We developed a light PCa deck and lines to connect deck slabs and ensure compactness to quickly undertake construction. We completed the project within the allotted time despite the nocturnal nature of the work.

Leveraging Japanese technology to ensure long service lives 
Our outstanding partial bridge replacement and deck repair technologies are designed to deliver long service lives for existing infrastructure. Even for facilities with just a few years of service left if nothing is done, we can extend lifespans for decades through proper repairs and reinforcements. Another benefit is that unlike with new construction, we can more quickly use existing resources, conserving them and energy. 
The aging of infrastructure is set to peak in North America, with renovation demand similarly rising in Japan. Asia, Africa, and other emerging markets are pushing ahead with building bridges and other social infrastructure that will ultimately need renovations. We accordingly look to accelerate overseas business development by drawing on the technology and knowhow we have cultivated in Japan. We will quickly undertake top-quality infrastructure innovations to contribute to transport safety and security the world over.

Cutting carbon dioxide emissions 
Supporting the energy needs of circular societies with low-carbon and decarbonization technologies 
Twin IHI Gasifier demonstration unit in Indonesia 
Developing IHI’s low-carbon and decarbonization technologies 
Biomass is a carbon neutral energy source because carbon sequestration through plant photosynthesis balances out carbon dioxide emissions from burning biomass. For thermal power plants, you can reduce emissions by co-firing biomass chips from thinned timber and other wood sources with fossil fuels. Conventional setup limit the biomass mixture to 2% or 3% of the heating value in co-firing. We developed a wood biomass high-ratio co-firing system that raises the calorific value of wood biomass in utility power boilers to 50%. Companies can deploy this technology with minimal modifications to existing facilities, for which 
IHI received a New Energy Award of the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Prize in fiscal 2016. 
 
Energy demand should rise in coming years as the global population grows, urbanizes, and industrializes At the same time, that the Paris Agreement adopted at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference set national reduction targets for carbon dioxide emissions, a factor in climate change. The global community thus faces the challenge of lowering environmental impacts while accommodating greater energy demand. 
Fossil fuels play an important role in generating electricity and stabilizing power supplies. Combustion produces carbon dioxide, creating a need for technology to streamline power generation and reduce emissions to tap fossil fuels more effectively. 
The IHI Group seeks to help materialize circular societies that do not depend on finite resources by reducing emissions through its low-carbon and decarbonization technologies.

Trillions of kilowatt-hours 
If half of the calorific value of coal-fired boilers of Japan’s leading power producers came from wood biomass, the nation’s annual carbon dioxide emissions could reduce by almost 100 million metric tons. 
Creating biomass fuel from waste 
As well as developing biomass combustion technology, we are also producing biomass fuels. In Southeast Asia, palm trees are grown extensively for palm oil. Empty fruit bunches resulting from production contain a lot of water, ash, and salt, and are often dumped as is. The resulting unpleasant odors 
and methane are among the resulting environmental problems. IHI created a technique to pelletize empty fruit bunch waste as biomass fuel for thermal power plants. We have constructed a pilot plant in Malaysia with a view to commercializing this process. 
Creating biomass fuel from palm tree waste 
does not generate carbon dioxide when burned, and could be a useful clean fuel in power production if a technique can be developed to stabilize combustion. IHI is participating in the Cross-Ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program of the Japanese Cabinet Office’s Council for Science, Technology and Innovation to develop ammonia-fueled combustion technology. We created a technique to co-fire ammonia with conventional fuels in gas turbines and boilers it. 
We were the first in the world to achieve a co-firing ratio representing 20% of the gross heating value for a 2,000 kilowatt-class gas turbine. The nitrogen oxide emissions were lower than the regulatory limit. With boilers, our technique can cut carbon dioxide emissions and lower maintenance by reducing sulfide corrosion and ash volumes. It is also worth noting that we were able to generate power from a one-kilowatt-class direct ammonia solid oxide fuel cell. 
Lignite accounts for half of global coal reserves. While this low-grade coal is inexpensive, it has not been used effectively because of its low heating value and handling challenges. 
We accordingly developed the Twin IHI Gasifier, also known as TIGAR®, which converts untapped resources into valuable fuel substances by applying circulating fluidized-bed technology. TIGAR can produce syngas, which consists of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. 
Syngas is versatile intermediate resource not only for producing such high-value-added offerings as ammonia, methanol, and synthetic natural gas but also for generating heat and power TIGAR® can be combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage technology to produce hydrogen without carbon dioxide emissions.

The IHI Group should make its working climate even more conducive to fostering the talents of its people, who are its strength
Kazuhiko Ishimura
Outside Director
      Outside Director
Kazuhiko Ishimura
Director and Chairman, AGC Inc. Outside Director, TDK Corporation
Outside Director, Nomura Holdings, Inc.
Outside directors take part in the decision making of the Board of Directors and provide independent advice to the Company’s management team, which is responsible
for business execution. Management audits reflect the outstanding expertise, experience, and independence of outside audit & supervisory board members.
These outside directors and audit & supervisory board members extensively assist and advise the Compensation Advisory Committee and the Nomination Advisory Committee.
The IHI Group’s management aims to strengthen corporate governance by drawing on the views of these individuals.
Composition of corporate governance entities
I believe that it is management’s mission to fulfil corporate social responsibilities to stakeholders. I accordingly became involved in business management to thus help enhance corporate value.
Overseas revenues account for 75% of consolidated net sales at AGC Inc., where
I am chairman. As an outside director of IHI, I can leverage my international corporate management experience to help the Company globalize and advise on commensurately strengthening management to improve the Company’s corporate value.
IHI’s greatest strength is its combination of people and technology to pursue
the creation of products that resolve social issues. The Company has long prized and invested in human resources, and in stepping up business concentration and selection it will be crucial to better assess the suitability of people and provide assignments in which they can shine. I also think it important to set up a fairer evaluation system.
We are contributing to the environment with our highly efficient technology for coal-fired power plant boilers. I chair the Japan Association of Corporate Executives’ Environment, Natural Resources and Energy Committee, which assesses the role
of coal in optimizing the energy mix with a range of resources. India and other emerging economies with strong energy demand levels will continue to need coal. So, for the foreseeable future IHI’s highly efficient high-efficiency technology should play a significant role in lowering environmental impact in such nations.
IHI is formulating its next medium-term management plan this fiscal year. Management should ideally do more to incorporate concentration and selection into its plans for and beyond fiscal 2019 so it can better deploy human resources. I will extensively present my views from the perspectives of external stakeholders on optimizing IHI’s overall business portfolio.

    Increasing social and corporate value through diversity management Yayoi Tanaka
Outside Director
    One of my roles as an outside director for IHI is to draw on my experience in assessing and studying nonprofit organizations to present my independent views
on how such entities should function. Corporate performances go beyond financials to encompass elements that are more qualitative than quantitative, examples being measuring social trust and employee motivation levels. Non-financial activities buttressing business efforts are pivotal to sustainable corporate growth. Such activities are increasingly a social demand, which is why the Japan Business Federation, commonly called Keidanren in Japan, reviewed its Charter of Corporate Behavior to encourage members to deliver on SDGs. In my view, we can help boost corporate value by determining whether he Company’s organizational governance properly factors in non-financial activities.
Today, the focus of diversity is on fostering the workplace success of women,
and the Japanese government has accordingly set targets for the proportion of managerial positions held by women. Female account for around 15% of IHI’s workforce, so reaching the targets will be challenging. That said, IHI is very aware of this, and is providing more vehicles for women to study and engage in workplaces.
I also want to increase communication opportunities at worksites and contribute to greater diversity.
I believe that IHI’s employees are very earnest and proud and passionate about technology. On the downside, I do not think they are always sufficiently aware
of the contributions of their products and services to society. I look forward to disseminating internally and externally.
We will actively disseminate to the inside and outside of the company the social commitments that are built into IHI’s product and business and how they help resolve social issues.
My role as an outside Audit & Supervisory Board member is to assess implementation
by directors from independent perspectives and offer suitable advice from the stances of attorneys and certified public accountants. One recent focus for the IHI Group has been to focus on reinforcing risk management, and I extensively share my risk management views from legal and accounting standpoints through board meetings and other channels.
The scale of IHI’s operations is massive, and over its long history Company has contributed
to the Japanese economy’s growth by propelling it forward. The technological clout that IHI has demonstrated in manufacturing is a tremendous strength for the Company. By the same token, IHI undertakes projects entailing large risks that can lead to significant losses. It is paramount for all business units to pay due diligence before starting projects to minimize
risks and for the Company to comprehensively manage risks once projects begin. So, close communication between work sites, administrative and management units is essential. Outside Audit & Supervisory Board members engage in frequent discussions with internal auditors to project management units to be able to point out risks and conduct four site audits every year, including overseas.
Bolstering profitability is a key to enhancing IHI’s corporate value, and efforts are under
way to build a structure to manage risks and produce consistent earnings. IHI will have to expand globally to generate growth in the years ahead. It will accordingly need to step up risk management, including at foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, and reinforce governance.
The Group has around 150 subsidiaries and affiliates overseas. I consider it vital to push ahead with business selection and concentration in view of the commensurate administrative costs and importance of allocating resources to growth areas.
IHI’s corporation governance is functioning well in my judgment, as management decision-making processes are transparent and sufficiently effective. The current Board of Directors already engages in vigorous debate. Still, we external directors seek to hear worksite views and ask questions that insiders would otherwise find hard to pose to contribute to creating an even more open management structure.

Corporate Governance
Corporate governance
initiatives
– Ensuring corporate management integrity –
Basic Views
IHI defines corporate governance as a system that assures sustainable growth and maximization of corporate value by enhancing management efficiency so that the Company can leverage its innate capabilities to the fullest extent possible. To achieve this, the Company targets efficient and appropriate internal decision-making by clearly separating management monitoring and supervisory functions from functions related to their execution of duties. Furthermore, by establishing the relevant internal rules and building
a system to administer them, the Company ensures appropriate operations across the entire Group.
The Company promotes constant improvement of its corporate governance, aiming to earn the trust and support of its shareholders and other stakeholders over the long term.
Basic Policies for Enhancing Corporate Governance
The company will work to enhance its corporate governance in line with the following basic policies.
❶ Respect shareholders’ rights and ensure equal treatment ❷ Strive to cooperate appropriately with shareholders and
other stakeholders
❸ Fulfill our responsibility to be accountable to stakeholders
and ensure transparency by appropriately and proactively
disclosing information relating to the company
❹ Clarify the roles and responsibilities of the board of
directors, the audit & supervisory board members and the Audit & Supervisory Boad to enable them to adequately fulfill their management-monitoring and supervisory functions
❺ Conduct constructive dialogues with shareholders whose investment policies accord with the medium-to long-term interests of shareholders
Overview of Corporate Governance Structure
The Company has an Audit & Supervisory Board, which comprises audit & supervisory board members who audit the duties executed by directors.
The Board of Directors, which consists of directors, makes decisions related to all important matters concerning the management of the Company and the Group, in addition
to supervising directors in their business execution. The outside directors, who are elected from among individuals with extensive experience and broad insight gained at the helms of management, or with a high degree of specialist knowledge and diverse experience, participate in the Board
of Directors’ decision-making process, offer advice and make recommendations independently of managers who have been delegated the authority to handle day-to-day operations.
Business Execution Framework
The Company has an executive officer system to strengthen
the decision-making and supervisory functions of the Board of Directors, as well as to improve the efficiency of business operations. The executive officers are appointed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Compensation Advisory Committee
To ensure that directors and audit & supervisory board members are remunerated appropriately, the Company has the Compensation Advisory Committee, a voluntarily established body consisting of six members: three outside directors, one outside audit & supervisory board member, one director in charge of human resources, and one director in charge of finance and accounting. The chair is an outside director.
Nomination Advisory Committee
The Company established a Nomination Advisory Committee to supervise the representative director’s nomination of candidates for directors and audit & supervisory boad members, checking that such appointments are conducted appropriately and offering related advice. The committee has five members: President and Representative Director, and four outside directors, with the President and Representative Director serving as chair.
Policies Relating to Appointment of Officers
The Boad Directors decides on ideal attributes for officers and draws up standards of independence
for outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members. These standards are based on the requirements for independent directors/ audit & supervisory board members stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The emphasis is to assure that outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members are genuinely independent.
The Boad Directors sets the basic policy of appointing the most appropriate officers according to ideal attributes and independence standards for outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members*. The aim is to ensure sustainable growth and increased corporate value for the IHI Group over the medium to long term.

– For Sustainable Development –
Basic Policies for Risk Management
Risk management is a top priority for the IHI Group, which strives to reinforce its overall capabilities in that regard. We constantly identify, analyze, and evaluate risks to ensure business continuity, maintain the safety of executives, employees and their families, protect operational resources, and ensure social credibility.
Risk Management System
We established the Risk Management Conference under the leadership of the CEO. The Conference assesses key general risk management matters, and considers policies, annual plans, corrective measures, and other important matters.
We formulated the IHI Group Key Risk Management Policies. All parent units and Group companies in Japan and abroad independently pursue risk management in keeping with those policies.
Regarding commonly existing risks in the IHI Group, the Group Risk Management Units, which comprise parent divisions, take responsibility for supporting each group units, as well as monitoring the implementation of the rules and developing effective risk management measures. The Internal Audit Division assesses Group risk management structure deployments and progress to ensure their suitability.

Reform quality and operational systems
One priority under Group Management Policies 2016 is to reform our quality and business systems to reinforce our manufacturing capabilities. Our efforts in this respect include reviewing engineering, production, and other business systems while accordingly rebuilding our quality management systems and strengthening our framework for guaranteeing the quality of our products and services.
Initiatives include educating engineers and technicians about quality, and enlightening directors, managers, and employees about compliance. As well as informing about quality, we provide opportunities to better understand customer needs and the importance of complying with relevant legislation and regulations,
fostering a corporate culture that is conducive to proper business practices. Internal audits have confirmed that our quality management system is functioning properly. We aim to involve people outside the Audit & Supervisory Board in such checks to enhance monitoring.
In November 2017, we conducted an internal survey about quality, confirming the results of our initiatives in that regard.
We will continue to improve our quality assurance process ensuring close engagement with customers and workplaces.

IHI believes that meeting society’s expectations is
one of its basic corporate social responsibilities (CSR). In accordance with this belief, the Company’s Basic Code of Conduct compiles the necessary practices
IHI is obliged to carry out. A guide to the Basic Code
of Conduct has been translated into 18 languages other than Japanese to ensure that all IHI employees understand and follow these practices in their work. The United Nations adopted SDGs in 2015. We believe that society expects us to help attain these goals. We will contribute to these SDGs through business and materialize social sustainability.

Environmental initiatives – Creating More Sustainable Societies –
Basic Policies
Our lives and business activities could not function without a diverse environment and natural resources. The IHI Group undertakes environmental initiatives because it recognizes the importance of reducing environmental impact and creating more sustainable societies.
Our business encompasses such social infrastructure as plant facilities and bridges, increasing the social impact of our activities. We will endeavor to lower our overall ecological impact on communities by offering customers products and services that are more environmentally friendly and by streamlining our own operations.
Materializing Environmental Management
We formulated IHI Group Environmental Vision 2013
in fiscal 2013. The vision established three core eco strategies through fiscal 2018. These are to reduce the environmental impact of our products and services, lower the environmental impact of our operations, and strengthen environmental management. We seek to realize this vision by formulating three-year activity plans through the IHI Environment Committee, which the chief CSR officer chairs. Business areas and regional environmental committees undertake initiatives in keeping with these plans as part of an ongoing environmental management approach.
Environmentally Friendly Products Certification Scheme
Since FY2014, we have implemented the Environmentally Friendly Products Designation Scheme to encourage further reductions of the environmental impact of products and services. Under the scheme, the environmental performance of products and services
is evaluated against self-established criteria and those exhibiting particularly outstanding performance are designated “environmentally friendly products.”
  IHI Group Environmental Vision 2013
IHI, as a responsible global group,
strives to help preserve the global environment
on a continuous basis in collaboration with customers and business partners around the world.

    Educating about the environment
The IHI Group maintains tiers of companywide educational programs, educates about the environment at sites acquiring ISO 14000 certification, and undertakes collective training to enhance specialist knowledge among key people in environmental activities.
In August 2017, each business site conducted
collective training on energy conservation for 52
energy and environmental managers from IHI and 10 Group companies. The training encompassed lectures from external energy conservation experts and group discussions in which participants shared issues and developed initiatives.
One month later, we conducted waste collection training to ensure proper processing of production byproducts. We instituted practical exercises about sharing information and waste treatment sites with regard to the revised Waste Management and Public Cleansing Act
to deepen the practical knowledge of participants. We will continue to enhance environmental efforts through training and other educational activities.

Environmental Communication
In December 2017, we took part in EcoPro 2017, an international environmental and energy exhibition that is the largest such event in Japan. For prospective science experts attending this gathering, we used simple explanations to showcase products and services that help stabilize energy supplies. We received considerable encouragement from its roughly 6,000 visitors.
June is Environment Month for the IHI Group. It is during this time that we conduct environmental quizzes and disseminate in-house news to increase employee awareness of environmental issues. In fiscal 2017, 5,072 employees took part in quizzes.
In the years ahead, we will engage extensively with stakeholders and harness such efforts in environmental management.

 Supply Chain Management
Supply Chain
Management Initiatives – Collaborating with Suppliers –
Basic Policies
IHI’s Group Procurement Policy is based on three core principles ̶ fair and impartial procurement, mutually beneficial partnerships with business partners and satisfying compliance and societal needs.
The procurement of materials or equipment involves not only compliance with legal requirements but also consideration of human rights, the environment and conflict minerals1. In addition to education for employees, IHI also satisfies societal demands by educating suppliers for beneficial coexistence and co-prosperity.
Considering that IHI conducts business on a global
scale, strategically sound supply chains are a vital part
of the effort to achieve medium-terms goals. Under the
current three-year business plan, IHI is focusing on
three main activities.
Note 1: Minerals from conflict regions that, if purchased, sometimes result inadvertently in funding armed insurgents or fueling regional disputes.
IHI Group Procurement Policy
❶ Fair and impartial procurement
IHI provides business opportunities in an open manner to business partners around the world, aiming to work with creative and competitive partners. Partners are evaluated and selected in a fair and comprehensive manner based on factors such as quality, price, delivery schedule, technology and financial conditions.
❷ Mutually beneficial partnerships
IHI regards partners as value creators. To secure
optimal quality, prices and deliveries as well as reliable procurements, the company aims to establish relationships of trust with partners for mutual competitiveness and prosperity.
❸ Satisfying compliance and societal needs
IHI complies with all laws that govern its local and
global businesses. IHI procurements give priority to consideration for the environment, human rights, labor conditions, occupational safety and health, and information management.
Building an optimal procurement network
IHI has established Product-Specific Expert Councils to strengthen groupwide procurement capabilities. Council members endeavor to build optimal procurement

IHI Transport Machinery Co.,Ltd.’s multi-storey parking systems are installed in many commercial buildings and condominium complexes. The systems are shipped by numerous four-metric-ton trucks because installation sites are so narrow. To ship to remote locations, the company has switched to marine transportation in which it is more feasible to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and logistics costs. In fiscal 2017, the company deployed that approach for Kyushu. Compared with transportation modes to date, the company succeeded in reducing carbon dioxide emission by 74% and transportation cost by 44%.

      IHI Aero Manufacturing Co., Ltd., uses cutting technology to produce
a range of parts. The company is endeavoring to reuse cutting oil when processing parts.
Metal machining processes employ
a lot of oil. Traditionally, the company shipped out oil incorporating metal shavings for recycling. Facilities
to perform such separation were installed to enable the repeated use of oil.
The company can thus recycle the shavings, reuse oil, and reduce waste. It is expected to save around ¥20 million annually by decreasing
oil purchases and waste disposal. The company plans to roll out this approach throughout its plant to further shrink its environmental footprint and procurement costs.

Recognizing supplier excellence
The IHI Group recognizes excellence among suppliers and endeavors to strengthen collaboration with them. In January 2017, we bestowed an excellence award to OSR Vietnam Joint Stock Company.
Since its establishment in 2013, OSR has supplied a range of products to IHI Group companies, centering on steel frames and ducts for generator boilers. Our award expressed gratitude to that partner for maintaining reliable deliveries and high product quality.

We have rolled out various programs that exceed legal requirements to help employees balance their professional and provide commitments.
In fiscal 2017, we set up two in-house nurseries for
the families of Group employees to ease returns from childcare leave. These facilities at business sites in Soma, Fukushima Prefecture, and our Mizuho Works
in Tokyo foster healthy growth for children, and feature many indoor plants to make them feel more comfortable.
Feedback from employees entrusting their young ones to these nurseries has been very positive. Some have noted the safety aspect while others highlight the time savings in dropping children off and picking them up. Such advantages have made it easier for employees to enhance their work-life balance.

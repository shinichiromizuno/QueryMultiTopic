IHI Solid Biomass Malaysia Sdn Bhd (ISBM) was established in Malaysia to fully expand the manufacture, export and sale of solid biomass fuel, or EFB pellets, derived from palm empty fruit bunches. 
Biomass fuel made from palm trees 
Large quantities of EFB generated during the extraction of palm oil tends to be discarded and unused, resulting in soil contamination and methane gas release due to the high content of moisture, ash and salt making EFB vulnerable to rot. IHI has established a method to convert and mass-produce EFB into high-quality low-

ash pellets, which can be used effectively as solid biomass fuel. 
IHI also developed and is piloting a system to treat palm oil mill effluent and a facility to manufacture pellets from discarded oil palm trunks in Malaysia. Both initiatives will help to utilize palm oil production waste and reduce the environmental impact of the palm industry. 
Developing an eco-friendly industrial estate 
Also, together with Nextgreen Global Berhad (NGGB), 
a major Malaysian printing company, and Nomura Holdings, Inc., IHI is evaluating the feasibility of producing pulp for paper-making and using EFB for biomass fuel production. The three parties also are considering a collaboration to support the use of palm waste at NGGB’s eco-friendly industrial estate, Green Technology Park. 
IHI aims to improve the sustainability of the palm industry, one of the major industries in Malaysia, and contribute to the stable supply of solid biomass fuel, for which demand is expected to rise greatly in Japan. 
Achieve SDGs by providing products and services.

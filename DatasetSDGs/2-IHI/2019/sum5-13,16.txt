Delivery of XF9-1 aero engine prototype for future fighter jets 
  
In June 2018, XF9-1 jet engine prototype for future fighter jets was delivered to the Aerial Systems Development Division of the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA). 
ATLA began developing the engine based on the Hyper Slim Engine concept in FY2010. Incorporating world-leading technology, the compact, lightweight engine achieves high output and has already been confirmed as satisfying required functional and performance requirements. 
Leading-edge technologies incorporated in the engine include an aerodynamic design based on highly advanced simulation technology, a proprietary single- crystal alloy and turbine components made with ceramic matrix composites (CMC). In achieving 15 tons of thrust, on par with the world’s top-class engines and a first for a domestically made engine, ATLA and IHI have demonstrated to the world the advanced state of Japanese engine technology. 
Going forward, IHI will continue to push the envelope for manufacturing fighter jet engines by advancing and integrating the company’s world-class technologies.

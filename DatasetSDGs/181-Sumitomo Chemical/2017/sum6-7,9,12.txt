 In this sector, 10 products and technologies have been designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions. One of the designated technologies, the propylene oxide-only (PO-only) process, is a groundbreaking, environmentally friendly process that produces propylene oxide, a raw material in polyurethane, without producing by-products. This process also contributes to the effective use of heat generated in chemical reactions, and the reduction of wastewater emission. In addition to this, Sumitomo Chemical develops and offers polyethylene and polypropylene suited for use in retort pouches for food or easy-to-open refill pouches for soaps, which have a lower environmental burden, using less energy in manufacturing than other containers.

 Sumika Sustainable Solutions FY2016 Sales Â¥20.8 billion
In this sector, a variety of products conducive to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating new forms of energy have been designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions. Major designated products include separators for lithium-ion secondary batteries used in green cars, such as electric vehicles, and PES, an additive for carbon-fiber reinforced plastics used in aircraft, making aircraft lighter and hence fuel-efficient.
Beyond this, Sumitomo Chemical is working to develop a business around a new product called a CO2 separation membrane. CO2 separation technology using a membrane separation process can greatly reduce energy consumption, as the process is simpler than existing chemical absorption methods, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

  Sumika Sustainable Solutions
FY2016 Sales ¥109.6 billion
 In this sector, products such as color resists and the UV adhesive curing process in polarizing film manufacturing are designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions. Manufacturing polarizing film, which is made by pasting together multiple sheets of film, previously used a great deal of electricity for the superheated drying process for the water-soluble glue. By adopting a UV adhesive curing process that uses ultraviolet curing technology, Sumitomo Chemical was able to significantly reduce the amount of power consumed in this process. Moreover, Sumitomo Chemical’s color resists create color filters with higher brightness than competing products, enabling a reduction in the power consumed by an LCD’s backlight. These solutions enable significant energy savings, contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

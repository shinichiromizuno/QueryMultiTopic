To Our Stakeholders
 We Seek to Help Solve the Major Problems Facing the World and Build a Sustainable Society by Creating New Value.
At the September 2015 meeting, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), marking the start of efforts at achieving a set of 17 goals to address problems such as poverty, food security, energy, and the environment, with the aim of enabling all people to lead prosperous and fulfilling lives. In addition, with the Paris Agreement going into force in November 2016, a global agreement has been established to mitigate climate change.
In light of these continuing, significant demonstrations of a commitment to bring about a sustain- able society, the chemical industry is expected to serve a leading role in the industrial arena in boldly taking on the challenge of resolving global-scale problems through technological innovation.
Chemistry is a field of study that holds unlimited potential for creating new substances and unleashing functionality never seen before. By using this knowledge of chemistry, we at the Sumitomo Chemical Group are working to develop new products and technologies that lead to solutions to environmental and food problems and the achievement of affluent and comfortable lives, thereby contributing to a sustainable society.
Sumitomo’s business philosophy emphasizes that our businesses must benefit society at large, not just our own interests. We, the Sumitomo Chemical Group, will remain deeply committed to put- ting this philosophy into practice in our day-to-day operations, and will continue striving to achieve sustained growth and build a sustainable society by leveraging the unlimited potential of chemistry and providing innovative solutions for people around the world.
Thank you very much for your continued support and cooperation. July 2017

Annual Report 2017

  Q A
Despite a strong yen and other headwinds, we achieved a ROE of over 10% again this year.
Looking back on fiscal 2016, what is your evaluation of the Company’s results?
 Amid growing uncertainty due to the issue of Brexit and the inauguration of the new U.S. administration, the world economy was overall on a firm footing, with the U.S. econ- omy remaining robust against the backdrop of strong employment situations and expectations of a fiscal expan- sion. In Japan, although consumer spending continued to be rather weak, the economy stayed on a moderate recovery path due to improvement in employment and wages as well as strong corporate earnings.
In terms of our business environment, we temporarily faced headwinds such as a strengthening yen during the first half of fiscal 2016 and an economic slowdown in emerging market countries. Starting in the middle of the period, however, we saw signs of improvement. The yen became weak after the presidential election in the U.S., while the petrochemicals market in Asia significantly recovered.
Our net sales for fiscal 2016 were 1,954.3 billion yen, 147.5 billion yen less than the previous year. Although sales volumes increased in the Pharmaceuticals Sector, the stronger yen had a negative effect on the value of
Comparative Table of the Company’s Results
overseas sales in yen terms, and selling prices declined in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, IT-related Chemicals Sector, and Health & Crop Sciences Sector.
Operating income decreased by 30.1 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, to 134.3 billion yen. In addition to lower selling prices in the IT-related Chemicals Sector and Health & Crop Sciences Sector, the strong yen hit profit- ability while amortization expenses increased because of unrecognized actuarial differences on pension assets.
Net income attributable to owners of the parent rose 4 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, to 85.5 billion yen. Contributing factors include improvements in equity in earnings of affiliates and the net gain on foreign currency transactions, as well as a lower burden of income taxes.
ROE reached 11% for fiscal 2016, meeting our target— achieving a ROE of 10% or higher—for two consecutive years.
We have declared a year-end dividend of 7 yen per share. Combined with the interim dividend, our dividend for fiscal 2016 totaled 14 yen per share, the same as for the previous fiscal year.

  Q A
We seek to achieve sustained growth by creating new value through innovative technologies.
Could you provide an overview of Sumitomo Chemical’s vision?
 Capabilities to develop innovative solutions by leveraging extensive technological expertise, global market reach, and highly loyal employees—these are Sumitomo Chemical’s core competencies, which we have built up through our operations spanning over a century. Going forward, by making full use of these strengths, we will continue to strive to solve problems that society faces in the areas of the environment, food, resources, and energy,
and contribute to promoting health, building comfortable societies, and improving the quality of life for people around the world.
We also aim to achieve sustained growth by creating new value through innovative technologies, and strive to constantly realize a ROI of above the cost of capital and 7% or higher.
At the same time, to achieve this vision, it is essential that we maintain financial strength robust enough to withstand any changes in our business environment. Specifically, we aim to hold a D/E ratio at approximately 0.7 times, and constantly achieve a ROE of 10% or above.
In addition, for the time being we set our dividend payout ratio at around 30%, and by investing about 70% of net income in new growth opportunities in the fields of the environment and energy, life sciences, and ICT, we seek to achieve an annual profit growth rate of 7% or over.

 Annual Report 2017 15
Interview with the President

  Q
A
We will further improve our business portfolio by focusing our resources in specialty chemicals businesses where we have technological advantages.
Please recap Sumitomo Chemical’s current Corporate Business Plan.
 Under the current Corporate Business Plan, we are com- mitted to our slogan “Change and Innovation—Create New Value,” and by capitalizing on the robust financial strength we built on the previous Corporate Business Plan period, we are going to aggressively pursue growth opportunities and further spur our transformation into a more resilient Sumitomo Chemical that continues to grow.
Specifically, we are working on five priority initiatives, including further improving our business portfolio, gen- erating more cash flow, and accelerating the launch of next-generation businesses.
In the initiative of further improving our business port- folio, we will direct 70% to 80% of capital expenditures
and investments that we will determine from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, and 90% of our R&D expenses over the same period, to the area of specialty chemicals, primarily the life sciences area.
In the efforts toward generating more cash flow, we will work to retain our lean financial structure and, at the same time, will strive to build and maintain robust earn- ings power to consistently generate strong cash flow, so that we can take advantage of large-scale investment opportunities when they arise.
In the initiative of accelerating the launch of next-gen- eration businesses, we will continue to invest in the fields of the environment and energy, ICT, and life sciences, as well as their cross-over areas, and will speed up the pro- cess of bringing to market our products and technologies under development.
In addition to these three initiatives, we continue to promote globally integrated management while also ensuring full and strict compliance and establishing and maintaining safe and stable operations.
For fiscal 2018, the final year of the current Corporate Business Plan, we anticipate net sales of 2,540 billion yen and net income attributable to owners of the parent of 110 billion yen, with a ROI of 7% and a ROE of 12%.

Interview with the President

  Q A
We implemented many of our planned measures ahead of time and strengthened our platform for creating new value.
In what areas did you make major progress in fiscal 2016, the first year of the current Corporate Business Plan?
 In fiscal 2016, the first year of the current Corporate Business Plan, we carried out many of our major initiatives planned for the three-year period ahead of time.
In the Petrochemical & Plastics Sector, we made prog- ress in construction of the Rabigh Phase II Project, as well as our efforts to enhance high value-added businesses.
In the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, we worked to expand production capacity for lithium-ion secondary battery separators and polyethersulfone, a super engi- neering plastic, both anticipated to see strong growth. Meanwhile, for the S-SBR business, where we had sought for measures to improve competitiveness, we established a joint venture with Zeon Corporation.
In the IT-related Chemicals Sector, we decided to increase production capacity for touchscreen panels, and made progress in the development of flexible display materials and PLED light-emitting materials. In addition, we restructured our production operations for polarizing films, for which profitability has been lowering.
In the Health & Crop Sciences Sector, we acquired Excel Crop Care Ltd., an agrochemicals company of India, where the market is expected to grow, and also decided to increase production capacity for methionine.
In the Pharmaceuticals Sector, we acquired the Canadian company Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. and the U.S. company Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and entered into a licensing agreement with Novartis, achieving a significant expansion in our pharmaceutical development pipeline.
With the goal of further improving our business portfo- lio, we plan to make capital expenditures and investments of 400 billion yen over the three years of our current Corporate Business Plan, while we also consider investing up to 300 billion yen in strategic mergers and acquisi- tions in order to quickly expand our specialty chemicals businesses.
We also plan to make decisions on capital expenditures and investments of approximately 620 billion yen over the three-year Plan period, and in fiscal 2016 we already committed half that amount, or approximately 310 billion yen. By swiftly and successfully implementing our com- mitted investment projects and quickly developing them into businesses that contribute to our earnings, we at Sumitomo Chemical will accelerate creation of new value.

  Q
A
We will remain committed to our ESG initiatives, particularly focusing on “contributing to society through our business,” the commitment Sumitomo Chemical has adhered to since its founding.
Please describe your ESG initiatives.
 About a century ago, Sumitomo Chemical got its start by manufacturing fertilizers from harmful gas emitted from copper smelting operations, aiming to solve envi- ronmental problems of smoke pollution while helping to increase the output of agricultural produce. Since then, we have put into practice CSV or “creating shared value,” a concept that a business should not just work to sustain its economic activity, but should also strive to create value for society.
For example, to have every employee work to put into action the philosophy of “contributing to society through business,” each of our business sectors has developed an action plan and set their targets for contributing to the 17 development goals laid out in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
In addition, last year we launched an internal program in which we select, from our products and technologies, those that contribute to mitigating global warming and reducing the burden on the environment, designate them as “Sumika Sustainable Solutions,” and promote their development and use. We have selected 34 products and technologies under this program, and are striving to double their sales as soon as possible.
Along with these initiatives for addressing environ- mental problems and contributing to the SDGs, we are stepping up efforts to make our governance more effective. To increase the transparency and objectivity
Expressing Our Commitment to the SDGs and Raising Employees’ Awareness
The 17-color lapel pins worn by the officers appearing in this report represent the 17 development goals of the SDGs. By wearing the pin, designed by the United Nations, the officers both show their commitment to the SDGs and help raise the Sumitomo Chemical Group employees’ awareness of the international efforts.
of management and further strengthen our governance system, we increased the number of outside directors and also established our non-mandatory nomination advisory committee and remuneration advisory com- mittee. In addition, we are working to reform the way the Board of Directors is administrated and to enhance the monitoring, oversight, and advisory functions of the outside directors.
Going forward, we at Sumitomo Chemical will con- tinue our ESG initiatives to help solve various problems facing people around the world, and to achieve long- term sustained growth.

     Advantages of Sumitomo Chemical’s Pervio® Separators
Separators are placed between anodes and cathodes in a battery, mostly serving to maintain insulation between the electrodes. Because contact between an anode and cathode—a short—can cause a fire, these are critically important materials for ensuring the safety of lithium-ion secondary batteries.
Sumitomo Chemical sells Pervio® separators, which are made from polyolefin film coated with aramid resin using a proprietary technology to increase heat resistance. These separators allow for batteries with a higher capacity, an espe- cially valuable quality in batteries for automotive use. There are other heat-resistant separators in which a polyolefin film is coated with alumina or other ceramic particles, but aramid coated separators have the edge in terms of heat resistance.
Milestones in Sumitomo Chemical’s Separator Business
More than 20 years has passed since we began developing separators in 1993. Since full-scale production began in 2006, in order to meet soaring demand, Pervio® production capacity has been increased by enhancing production capacity at the Ohe Works (Niihama, Ehime Prefecture), and by building a new plant at the subsidiary company SSLM (Daegu, South Korea).
With demand expected to continue increasing, the decision was made in September 2016 to approximately quadruple production capacity at SSLM from current levels. Facilities will be added in stages, and mass production will start ramping up after the first quarter of 2017.

        Creating Value in the Separator Business
Our research, production technology, quality assurance, and sales divisions each have a role to play in the development of Sumitomo Chemical’s separator business, as introduced below. This section also explains how these divisions contributed to the new plant at SSLM, which has been set up in stages since 2016.
Production Technology
Designing
Manufacturing Processes to Mass-produce Separators
Koji Yano
General Manager,
Process & Production Technology & Safety Planning Dept.
We design manufacturing processes so that the separators developed by the research division can be mass-produced. Since operations began in 2006, we have focused our energies on increasing the production capacity of each machine. We designed new machines when they were installed, and work on increasing separator productivity. We also repeatedly adjust the newly installed machines as many improvements were made to them, in order to ensure that a product of required quality will be produced.
The new SSLM plant takes advantage of all the expe- rience we have cultivated, and has been able to introduce new machines with high levels of productivity, realizing a major rationalization. We are also training the staff at SSLM to pass along the advanced technology we have cultivated over the years in Japan.
      Research
Developing Separators that Satisfy Customer Needs
Yasunori Nishida
Group Manager,
Battery Materials Group, Energy & Functional Materials Research Laboratory
The basic concept behind aramid coated separators was almost established, but every day we stay focused on mak- ing such improvements as thinner films to increase battery capacity, and doing a better job of meeting customer expec- tations. Technologies to evaluate and analyze separators and batteries are also important, and we are working on that by forming a team of specialists. At the same time, we also develop improvements to the separators we are now selling to make them easier to handle for customers in their battery manufacturing process, and to increase productivity and enhance cost-competitiveness.
Because we currently have no separator research loca- tions outside Japan, we are also doing production grade development for the new SSLM plant. Moreover, when the SSLM plant encounters issues or defects, we work together to resolve them.

Annual Report 2017

  Working with Japan to Expand SSLM’s Production
In just a year and a half since the decision was made to invest in production here in June 2015, starting mass production of a separator we had never made before was an extremely significant challenge for us at SSLM. Our employees worked with their counterparts from Sumitomo Chemical in a variety of functions, including research, production technology, quality assurance, and manufacturing, and by resolving issues and problems one by one, we were able to begin commercial production in February 2017.
Because we were bringing in cutting-edge equipment that would dramatically improve productivity over what we had previously had, there was some initial scrambling, but with the help of technicians from Sumitomo Chemical’s Ohe Works, we have been able to get the equipment running smoothly. We have also been emphasizing training in order to manufacture high-quality products. Because processing and assembly are such important processes at a separator plant, the operator’s skill can greatly affect the product’s quality. So we have been sending our operators to Japan, to receive technical training from veteran operators at the Ohe Works.
Right now we are undertaking a project to quadruple production capacity. We will continue to work with Sumitomo Chemical to meet the rapidly growing demand from customers, and to deliver a high-quality, cost-competitive product.

        Quality Assurance
Working to Maintain Product Quality and Stable Supply
Kazunori Akiyoshi
General Manager, Quality Assurance Dep., Quality Assurance Office (Ohe), Energy & Functional Materials Sector
To supply products that meet customers’ expectations for quality, it is not enough to simply ensure products meet specifications. We have a lot of different responsibilities, from development to mass production, aimed at maintaining uni- form product quality without variations. This includes main- taining clean environments, raising employee awareness of quality, and generally creating a strong quality-oriented ethic. During the process of designing and developing products and equipment, we painstakingly identify risks in advance, to nip troubles in the bud. When quality problems do occur, we move quickly to ascertain and address the root causes and act decisively to prevent reoccurrence.
We evaluated technologies being used for the first time at SSLM’s new plant in cooperation between Japanese and Korean teams. We share the latest information on such issues as dealing with contaminants, to help the new plant’s quality assurance system reach the same level as the Ohe Works’.
Sales
      Acting as the Point of Contact for Customers to Resolve Their Problems
Shinichi Mitsui
Deputy General Manager,
Business Planning and Development Group, Battery Materials Division,
Energy & Functional Materials Sector
Our day-to-day job involves cultivating new customers, and serving as the point of contact for existing customers to exchange all kinds of information about the separator busi- ness in general. We periodically share information with cus- tomers about demand forecasts and production schedules, sound out customers about their new requirements, and work with the research division to improve battery quality and lower costs. Thus, we have the important role of sharing information we receive from customers with other divisions in the company, and meeting the demands of customers. And when a quality problem occurs, we work with members of the quality assurance division to respond and resolve the problem quickly.
As the overall coordinators of a business that is carried out on a global level, we sign contracts with customers, coordinate production quantities and sales quantities for all our locations, and support the business of SSLM.

Process of Biorational Products before
 The Sumitomo Chemical Group defines biorationals as crop protection products and solutions, derived from natural sources, such as microbial pesticides that protect crops from pests, and plant growth regulators and microbial agricultural materials that improve crop quality and yields.
Valent BioSciences LLC was established in 2000 by Sumitomo Chemical acquiring a certain business unit from Abbott Laboratories. Since then, Valent BioSciences has expanded its business to over 90 countries around the world, establishing its presence as the leading company in microbial insecticides, plant growth regulators and other products, and supporting the biorational business of the Sumitomo Chemical Group.
Sumitomo Chemical, by providing both conventional chemical and biorational products globally, is helping to meet the growing worldwide demand for reliable supply of safe food. Sales of microbial pesticides should grow with rising demand for organic foods in developed countries, while sales of plant growth regulators are expected to benefit from increased demand for high-quality fruits and vegetables.
Leveraging the synergies between chemical and biorational products, we will continue to develop unique, innovative solutions that contribute to increased food production and the reliable production of safe agricultural crops.
   World Population and Demand for Grains
By 2050 the world population is forecast to reach 9.7 billion, an increase by 3.6 billion from 2000. Against the back- ground of this rising population and economic growth, demand for grains in 2050 is expected to be 1.6 times higher than in 2000.

Darin Osier
Production Manager, VBC Osage Affairs
I aim to bring products that can contribute to global food production to market efficiently and at low cost.
I manage Valent BioSciences’ Pipeline and Product Life Cycle Management (PLCM) processes to facilitate the commercialization of new products and develop new uses for current products. The Pipeline and PLCM represent a formal process for controlling and monitoring the flow of projects into successful product launches. By leading this process, I help to keep our global management team informed and to maintain our global biorational leadership position. In this position, I work with all functional departments, including Research, Business and Marketing, Regulatory, Production, and Supply Chain, to get products to the market in the most cost-effective and effi- cient manner possible. Coordinating our company’s twice-annual Biorational Field R&D review meetings – where data is presented and reviewed from ongoing trials around the world – is also a key part of my responsibility.
I am working to enable us to sell our products around the world,
in accordance with the laws and regulations of each country and region.
Regulatory affairs for Valent Biosciences ensures that authorities in each country have the necessary data to evaluate the safety of the products we plan to sell by complying with requirements set by each country’s regulations. In my role, I provide leadership on global regulatory activities by interfacing with Sumitomo Chemical affiliates around the world. I also manage dossier creation and re-registration for all biorational products to meet global requirements, which is a complex process that requires a true team effort. Through Regulatory Affairs, I consistently interact with other departments such as Quality Control, Research, Project Management, and others to ensure all departments are aware and working towards the same goals.
I am working to produce the highest-quality products,
as well as to analyze and improve our production processes.
I oversee the Production Operations and Production Engineering for Valent BioSciences’ Supply Chain at the state-of-the-art Osage facility. Our team of fermentation and recovery process experts not only produces our Best in Class biorationals, but also analyzes and implements process improvements that keep our manufacturing plant running profitably, efficiently, and sustainably. Here in Osage, every meeting starts with a focus on safety as it is our primary focus. Our motto is “no job is so urgent or important that we cannot take the time to do it safely.” We are always facing a lot of challenges, such as increase of production yields and development of new processes that are extremely difficult. We pull the teams together to drive success. We have a very strong group of people here who have the desire to be the best.

I aim to put our sales strategy into practice,
working closely with sales managers around the world.
I lead the marketing, business management, and product lifecycle management activities of Valent BioSciences’ plant growth regulator (Biorational Crop Enhancement (BCE)) business unit. Working with senior leadership, I am responsible for developing global strategies to grow and maximize the value of our BCE products, and for interfacing with regional affiliates toward execu- tion. I work closely with the Regional Marketing Managers, who manage the day-to-day business interactions with the regions. Together we are passionate about the BCE business because our products help farmers maximize the value of their crops in an environmentally sustainable way. We are also excited about the excellent business opportunities ahead for BCE. These opportuni- ties – like ReTain that contributes increasing yield of almond – will make a significant contribution to business growth of the Sumitomo Chemical Group of Companies.
I provide products and technical support, earnestly meeting farmers face to face.
I not only offer our company’s products to customers, I also provide technical support, explaining how to use these products. Through communication with customers, I also propose products and ways of using them that meet their various needs. For example, recently I have been pro- posing the use of mycorrhizal fungi, a type of useful microorganism, on crops such as potatoes and large-scale field crops such as wheat and soy, in order to improve both yield and quality. To meet our customers’ demands as much as possible, our whole team works hard every day to understand what is actually needed in the fields. Going forward, I would like to grow Sumitomo Chemical’s biorational business by earnestly meeting farmers face to face.
Through communication with customers, we propose products and ways of using them that meet their various needs. Through this type of activity, we build deep relationships of trust.

Change in Business Sector Classification Methods
As of April 1, 2015, the Basic Chemicals Sector was eliminated and businesses in this sector were split and transferred to the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector and the Energy & Functional Materials Sector that was established as a new business sector. In addition, a part of businesses in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector was transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. Inorganic chemicals, raw materials for synthetic fibers, organic chemicals, and methyl methacrylate that had been included in the Basic Chemicals Sector were transferred to the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector. Alumina products, aluminum, functional materials, additives, and dyes that had also been included in the Basic Chemicals Sector were trans- ferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. In addition, synthetic rubber that had been included in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector was transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. The business sector categorization of one of the consolidated subsidiaries has been changed. For comparison, the figures for fiscal 2014 have been adjusted to reflect the organizational revision as of April 1, 2015, except for return on assets in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, and the Health & Crop Sciences Sector.
To further strengthen the Energy & Functional Materials business, as of April 1, 2016, battery materials and engineering plastics that had been included in the IT-related Chemicals Sector were transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. For comparison, the figures for fiscal 2015 have been adjusted to reflect the organizational revision as of April 1, 2016, except for return on assets in the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, and the IT-related Chemicals Sector.

food packaging. We are also making progress in enhancing our ability to provide solutions employing high value-added products through a variety of measures, including deciding to turn a polycarbonate joint venture into a wholly owned subsidiary, and deciding to expand our production capacity for polypropylene compounds.
Our greatest issue at present is getting production at the new plant in Saudi Arabia on track as soon as possible to mobilize its initially planned capabilities. We aim to quickly transfer the technology developed through many years of experience in plant operation in Japan and Singapore to Saudi Arabia in order to achieve stable plant operations. Moreover, in Singapore and Japan, we are putting effort into developing high value-added applications for polyolefin, while in Japan we are enhancing our licensing business and increasing our catalyst production capacity. On top of this, we aim to improve the competitiveness of our naphtha cracker in Singapore through such measures as building a new naphtha tank and updating compressors.
Going forward, Sumitomo Chemical will not only con- tinue to enhance our strengths in these three locations, but will also aim to consistently achieve a return on assets in excess of our cost of capital by working to streamline assets, including working capital.

Main Initiatives in the Major Businesses
Advanced Polymers Business
We manufacture and sell super engineering plastics including liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and polyethersulfone (PES). LCP is used mainly in connectors and other electronic parts, taking advantage of its outstanding thermal resistance, flowability, and dimensional stability. PES, with excellent flame resistance, thermal resistance, and dimensional stability, is used mainly in carbon fiber composite materials in aircraft. Use of both polymers in automotive components is expected to grow, as both feature light weight and make possible lower processing costs. By developing new applications for polymers that can benefit from their superior properties, we hope to expand sales of these products.
Resorcinol Business
We manufacture and sell various chemical products such as resorcinol and polymer additives. Resorcinol is primarily used as a raw material for adhesives for bonding tire rubber with reinforcing material and for wood used in construction applica- tions. Worldwide demand for resorcinol is estimated at 60,000 tons. As the world’s top manufacturer of resorcinol, we have an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons and supply highly cost-competitive resorcinol by taking advantage of our out- standing manufacturing technology and production capacity.
Inorganic Materials Business
We provide distinctive high-performance inorganic materials using our advanced technologies for precisely controlling such physical properties as particle size and form. Sumitomo Chemical is the global leader in manufacturing high-purity alumina, for which demand is expanding for applications such as materials in lithium-ion secondary batteries.
Moreover, Sumitomo Chemical is manufacturing and selling products such as fine alumina for glass substrates used in such products as liquid crystal displays, as well as aluminum hydroxide for artificial marble, and high-purity aluminum, used in applications such as condensers and as circuitry material for semiconductors.
Battery Materials Business
We manufacture and sell separators for lithium-ion secondary batteries and are also developing cathode materials. Our heat-resistant separators are highly valued by battery manufac- turers for their high heat resistance, reliability, and safety, and are used in a wide range of applications. As high-capacity lithium- ion secondary batteries can be produced by the use of our separators, demand for our separators is rising sharply for use in high-capacity batteries for eco-cars such as electric vehicles. At the new factory in South Korea, which was completed in the autumn of 2016, Sumitomo Chemical began expanding pro- duction capacity in stages starting from the first quarter of 2017, and it eventually will have up to four times its current capacity. We are also developing low-resistance, high-capacity cathode materials targeting automotive applications.

    Value Provided by the SEPs Business
SEPs are materials used in aerospace components, automotive components, and electronic components, which can contribute to the competitiveness of components produced by customers. Sumitomo Chemical is working hard to expand the adoption of SEPs, particularly for automotive components. By replacing the metallic components used in cars with components made from SEPs, the weight of the components is reduced, improving vehicle performance, fuel consumption, and even comfort. In addition, it can also lead to lower costs for customers, as components with complicated shapes can be mass-produced in a short period of time using injection molding* technology.
Sumitomo Chemical not only proposes SEPs as materials for customers, we also propose and support total solutions, including product design and processing methods for customer products.

In 2016, NMP made the decision to establish the eleventh production base in Toyama Prefecture.
In addition, to diversify our brachytherapy seeds, which are medical devices that use brachytherapy to treat prostate and other cancers, we received manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan for Thera AgX100 and TheraStrand-SL, prod- ucts developed by Theragenics Corporation, and began sales of these products. NMP has also conducted the contracted business of PET imaging for both nonclinical and clinical studies for drug development by using its expertise and experience accumulated in the manufacture and supply of radiopharma- ceuticals. To cement its position as a leading company in the field of nuclear medicine, NMP is also developing diagnostic agents that allow the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and new tumors by PET procedures.

     In the research process, the first step in drug discovery is searching for candidate substances for new drugs. In addition to promoting internal innovation by having labs at multiple internal loca- tions where small groups of people are engaged in drug discovery research, we are also aggressively pursuing joint research with universities and other research institutes inside and outside Japan, as well as alliances with venture companies. We are working to create innovative drug treatments that employ cutting-edge science.
Research activities
In the development process, we take the devel- opment candidates created at our laboratories and scientifically evaluate their safety and efficacy through preclinical and clinical trials. To promote efficient development with the aim of quickly receiving regulatory approval, we use our global clinical development organization. As quickly as possible, we seek to deliver new drugs to patients, not just in Japan but also in the U.S., the world’s largest market for pharmaceuticals.

Human Resource Strategy
  Promoting a Deepening of Global Management from
the Perspective of
Human Resources Initiatives and Talent Development
Yasuaki Sasaki
Executive Officer, Human Resources Dept.
 Based on our Corporate Business Plan, with the slogan “Change and Innovation—Create New Value,” Sumitomo Chemical’s basic HR (Human Resources) policy is to encour- age employees to grow through carrying out rewarding and worthwhile day-to-day duties and bring about the sus- tainable growth of the Sumitomo Chemical Group through their individual growth.
In order to achieve this, we are continuing to create envi- ronments and organizations that make it easy for employ- ees to work. We are also enhancing various measures to secure, develop, and encourage the active participation of talented employees, in order to develop our businesses around the world while creating new value. In particular, we are working at a global level on our HR initiatives and human resources development, promoting a deepening of global management from a HR perspective.
As a platform supporting the execution of these mea- sures, Sumitomo Chemical has implemented an HR system based on duties (roles) that enables employees with the desire and capability to take on the challenge of a broad range of advanced duties regardless of age, gender, or nationality, and that treats in an appropriate way employ- ees who work hard and contribute. This unified HR system applies not only in Japan, but also to those in the manager layer and above in overseas Group companies.
In terms of personnel evaluation, we do not just look at results. We also put emphasis on what actions were taken to produce those results, and on what sorts of processes and attitudes employees bring to their work. In this way, we support not only the pursuit of short-term results, but also the medium- and long-term growth of the company and the talent development of employees.
 Global HR Network
In order to promote Global HR initiatives, Sumitomo Chemical has established HR functions in four locations around the world (Singapore, New York, Brussels, and Beijing) to manage their respective regions, promoting enhanced coordination with overseas Group companies. In addition, the Company holds a HR Managers Forum once a year, where HR managers from around the world gather together in either the head office or in each region to share policies and discuss issues.

Global HR Initiatives
Under common Global HR system for the manager layer and above for overseas Group companies, Sumitomo Chemical is sharing values among employees based on its corporate philosophy, promoting human resources development, and providing opportunities for advancement.
Sumitomo Chemical designated the core local personnel, who fill major positions in overseas Group companies, as Global Position Holders (GPH). Those designated GPHs are asked not only to share the corporate philosophy themselves, but also to take the lead in spreading those values within the Group companies.
In addition, Sumitomo Chemical holds a Global Managers Meeting once a year for those designated as GPHs, at either
Developing Next-generation Leaders
Sumitomo Chemical is carrying out a staged training program in human resources development for employees both in Japan and at overseas Group companies, in order to discover and develop next-generation leaders in a systematic way, empha- sizing the creation of global leaders who can take on the role of core management.

The Capabilities Supporting Corporate Value

Responsible Care
  Valuing Society’s Trust, Promoting Responsible Care Activities
Hirokazu Murata
Associate Officer, General Manager, Responsible Care Dept.
 Responsible Care (RC) activities refer to the voluntary ini- tiatives undertaken by business operators in the chemical industry, with the goals of ensuring safety, the environment, and health throughout the lifecycle of chemical products, from development through to the manufacture, sales, use, and disposal after final consumption, maintaining and improving the quality of those products. These activities also strive to gain the further trust of society through con- tinuous dialogue.
As part of our responsibilities engaged in the chemical industry, all employees of the Sumitomo Chemical Group are working to establish and maintain safe and stable opera- tions, which is a basic policy of the Corporate Business Plan, with a strong determination to make safety our first priority, and are also working to preserve safety, the environment,
and health with respect to the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s products. Through a global meeting attended by those in charge of Responsible Care at Group companies, as well as through training and drills at each production site, we are continually building up people who can put the philosophy of Responsible Care into action. At the root of these initia- tives is the desire to value the society’s trust in us.
As global-scale issues pile up, including the response to climate change, as represented by the 2°C goal the world agreed to in the Paris Agreement, as well as the creation of a circulate society, and considerations for biodiversity, the role of Responsible Care is becoming even greater to create a sustainable society. We will continue to promote Responsible Care activities throughout the Group, contrib- uting to the creation of value at Sumitomo Chemical.
  Occupational Safety and Health, Industrial Safety and Disaster Prevention
Initiatives to Ensure Safety at All Group Facilities
The Sumitomo Chemical Group aims to achieve zero labor accidents across all facilities through safety measures focused on people, in particular. Specifically, based on the rule of thumb that the majority of labor accidents can be prevented by thoroughly carrying out basic safety activities, such as hazard prediction, we have set Safety Ground Rules for the entire Group, and notified all Group employees of them, in order to eliminate labor accidents and improve safety activities. Moreover, in order to ensure the safety and security of the local community, we are thoroughly undertaking voluntary industrial safety and disaster prevention management, intensifying efforts to minimize damage when a natural disaster occurs, such as a large- scale earthquake.

Environmental Protection and Addressing Global Climate Change
Toward the Creation of a Sustainable Society
Sumitomo Chemical and its major Group companies have set common goals for environmental activities, endeavoring to reduce the environmental burden of the Group as a whole. In particular, as a response to climate change, we aim to achieve the world’s highest level of energy efficiency and develop processes and products that help build a low carbon society. Specifically, we have set overall goals for energy efficiency and CO2 emissions per unit production on a consolidated basis, and are working to achieve them. As a result, we reduced the amount of CO2 emissions from energy use by 23% over the period from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016. In addition, we reduced water usage volume by 32% over the same period. Moreover, in fiscal 2016, we started an internal certification system called Sumika Sustainable Solutions (see p.25), in an effort to further develop and spread the Group’s products and technologies that contribute to such issues as global warming countermeasures and reducing envi- ronmental burdens, with the goal of creating a sustainable society.
Product Responsibility and Product Stewardship
For the Safety and Peace of Mind of Our Customers
The Sumitomo Chemical Group estimates the degree of impact our chemical products have in terms of safety on people and the envi- ronment through their lifecycles, and promotes activities to protect people’s health and the environment based on those risks. Also, we continually work to ensure thoroughgoing management day to day, in order to deliver quality products and services that customers around the world can use with peace of mind, while continuing to improve quality.
The Sumitomo Chemical Group efficiently promotes the safety of chemical products from development through the manufacturing stage with an independently developed risk evaluation program. This evaluation is made in cooperation with its laboratories and pro- duction facilities which have specialized technology. In addition, the evaluation of products we offer considers not only the direct custom- ers of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, but also the ways customers beyond that (end-users) use and dispose of the products.
Furthermore, the Sumitomo Chemical Group is working to be able to respond appropriately to regulatory trends in each region by positioning dedicated personnel to regional headquarters in areas that have a significant impact on legal and regulatory trends for chemical products around the world, such as Europe, the US, and China, to collect and analyze information on the regulatory trends as soon as possible.

CSR Promotion Activities
Based on our Basic CSR Policy of contributing to the sustainable development of society through business, the Sumitomo Chemical Group has emphasized the need for each individual to undertake tasks with a constant awareness of their connections with society. In addition, Sumitomo Chemical has decided to actively use the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a common language among all types of stakeholders, in order to understand connections between business and society and act accordingly.
Our Sustainable Tree: Things We Can Do to Build a Sustainable Society
The Sumitomo Chemical Group Global Project was started in 2014, in order to encourage Group employees both inside and outside Japan to individually think about and act to resolve issues in society, and also to develop a sense of unity within the Group.
Since fiscal 2015, Sumitomo Chemical has provided a dedi- cated Group website where individuals and groups can submit information from their PCs or smartphones on the measures they have taken regarding resolving issues in society.
In fiscal 2016, Sumitomo Chemical implemented a dedi- cated website, called “Our Sustainable Tree: Things We Can Do to Build a Sustainable Society,” as a place where people can consider how they can contribute to resolving issues in society through their work and in their daily lives, and submit informa- tion about their efforts in light of the 17 SDGs, which took effect in January 2016. During the 100 days in which submissions were accepted, over 6,000 submissions were received from Group companies, both inside and outside Japan, of which 1,270 consisted of contributions employees made through their work.
In fiscal 2017, Sumitomo Chemical has implemented the second Sustainable Tree program, “Work Together towards the SDGs!” where employees can submit descriptions of the efforts
they have made in their jobs and workplaces relating to the 17 SDGs.
Going forward, the Sumitomo Chemical Group will continue listening to the voice of society, taking on the challenge of finding improvements and innovative solutions that individuals can personally use to help create a sustainable society.

  Education Support Initiatives
Sumitomo Chemical has been implementing such programs as visiting classes and sci- ence experiment workshops through events held at schools and in areas near its various facilities and Group companies. These provide opportunities for children to come into contact with the wonders of chemistry through experiments and craft projects using Sumitomo Chemical’s products. These initiatives are also being actively promoted at Group companies outside Japan, as in 2016, when multiple Group companies in China came together to hold the fifth science experiment workshop event.
In Africa, we consider it important to create learning environments that will help toward realizing self-standing economic development. To that end, since 2005 we have been providing educational support mainly for elementary and junior high school construction, using part of the proceeds from sales of OlysetTM Net mosquito bed nets. In the past 12 years we have supported 22 projects in 11 African countries, benefitting a total of more than 12,000 people.

The Capabilities Supporting Corporate Value

Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
  Fulfilling Our Accountability to Shareholders so that an Accurate Understanding of the Company is Properly Reflected in the Stock Price and Higher Corporate Value
Kunio Nozaki
Representative Director &
Senior Managing Executive Officer
 The basic policy guiding Sumitomo Chemical’s IR activities is to provide planned, effective, and strategic communica- tions with shareholders and other investors regarding our management policies, business strategies, and performance trends, so as to fulfill our accountability to shareholders and maintain and raise market confidence, while endeavoring to convey an accurate understanding of the Company that will be reflected properly in the stock price and in higher corporate value.
Based on this basic policy, the president gives manage- ment strategy briefings to investors twice a year, while sec- tor heads give a business strategy briefing to investors once yearly. In addition, the president and I, as the director in charge of IR, periodically visit major shareholders and have an active dialogue with them. Moreover, as a new initiative, since last year we have arranged opportunities for directors who are in charge of a sector or head-office function to
meet with investors and analysts and directly exchange views. By having senior executives directly communicate with major shareholders, we seek to have our shareholders develop a deeper understanding of Sumitomo Chemical.
Furthermore, I do not just disseminate information out- side the Company. I also periodically provide information on the views of investors, such as at meetings of the Board of Directors, and in doing so strive to deepen the mutual understanding we have with shareholders and other inves- tors. We are also putting efforts into soliciting the interest of a broad base of shareholders and other investors in our value creation story with well-prepared IR materials, such as our annual report and our Investors’ Handbook.
We will continue to squarely face our shareholders and other investors and work to build an even more construc- tive dialogue with them.

Intellectual Property
Basic Policy on
Intellectual Property Activities
Sumitomo Chemical’s intellectual property (IP) activities are aimed at contributing to the creation, maintenance, and increase of the Company’s business value through unified efforts by business sectors, research laboratories, and the IP Department.
While respecting the others’ valid patents after conducting comprehensive IP search and analysis, we endeavor to acquire and protect “wider, stronger, faster-registered and longer-last- ing” patents from the results of our research and technology development, and then promote and operate our businesses strategically. By effectively utilizing the patents so obtained for the businesses of Sumitomo Chemical and Group companies and further in the third-party licenses, we will maximize the Company’s business value.
As our businesses have developed more globally, it becomes more important for us to share the basic policy of IP activities with Group companies and work coordinately with them for the patent application / prosecution in a respective business. We then hold the annual Global IP Meeting where our IP-related colleagues from Group companies can get together.
Based on these perspectives, Sumitomo Chemical has set the basic policy on IP activities as follows.
Enhancing IP Search & Analysis Capability, Improving Patent Quality and Supporting Global Business Development
IP search and analysis is essential to the performance of businesses. We are in active use of such IP search and analysis software with AI functions as concept search and text mining, which leads to improvement of work efficiency at the IP Department and R&D organizations.
We have been also working on improvement in the quality of patents. In order to acquire higher-quality patents that con- tribute to the creation and performance of businesses, we have assigned the Intellectual Property Strategy Managers (ISMs) at the IP Department. Promoting mutual collaboration between business sectors, research laboratories and the IP Department, ISMs have been coordinating to apply for useful and effective patents fitted to business strategy and building a portfolio of quality patents. Since fiscal 2012 there has been a particular emphasis on careful selection of patent applications.
We have been pursuing registration of patents abroad including Asia, Americas, and Europe as well as Japan and it has supported our global business development.

Koichi Ikeda Outside Director Kunio Ito Outside Director Hiroshi Tomono Outside Director
Sumitomo Chemical has been transforming its governance, with the goal of achieving sustained growth and improving corporate value in the medium-to-long term. Our outside directors, who each have diverse backgrounds, shared a few words about these initiatives and other topics.
  Sumitomo Chemical’s Efforts at a Rapid and Authentic Transformation have Changed the Board of Directors
KunioIto OutsideDirector
As a result of Sumitomo Chemical’s executives accepting our suggestions as outside directors and responding to them quickly and sincerely, Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors has changed significantly over the last two years. The Board of Directors has now become more active than ever before, and this change is due to the dramatically more thorough explanations from the executive side. When explanations are too concise or important points are not reported, it is difficult for outside directors to speak up, and we quickly lose motivation. Because confidential information, such as mergers and acquisitions transactions in progress, is now also explained very frankly, without creating a wall beyond which nothing can be said to outsiders, our discussions have become much livelier, and proceed from a variety of viewpoints. I think it is this attitude of flexibly accepting suggestions from us outside
directors and actively working to change that is a strength of Sumitomo Chemical’s governance, and is part of this company’s earnestness.
Sumitomo Chemical is now working to further improve our business portfolio under the Corporate Business Plan, concentrating in fields that will increase profitability. I think this is extremely appropriate as a direction, but I think I can say that it is a problem that there are still many fields that can be affected by market conditions. In terms of capital efficiency, taking into account the high profits achieved by its rival global chemical manufacturers, I think Sumitomo Chemical should raise its goals for ROE even higher. I look forward to seeing the Board determine what Sumitomo Chemical should do now while looking three or even five years into the future, without falling into short-termism, and then quickly and decisively do what needs to be done.

  An Unchanging Spirit and Universal Language will Further Strengthen Sumitomo Chemical
KoichiIkeda OutsideDirector
In the six years I have been involved with management as a corporate auditor and a director, Sumitomo Chemical has bravely dismantled and rebuilt its businesses, and is currently working to further improve its business portfolio.
In order to transform, things that need to be discarded should be discarded quickly, and things that need to be done should be done well in advance. The reason Sumitomo Chemical is able to do this is perhaps because it has things that should not be changed. In other words, it has a clear sense of the “Sumitomo Spirit.” For example, the concept of harmony between the individual, the nation, and society is a way of thinking that underlies all of Sumitomo Chemical’s governance and CSR activities, and it could be said that Sumitomo Chemical’s efforts with regard to the SDGs are initiatives that reconceptualize
this way of thinking in more universal terms and from a more modern angle. While continuing to take on new challenges, we need to further strengthen the things we have protected until now. I think that it is this attitude that has enabled this company to succeed for over a century.
It is important to use more universal language. Since the changes made to governance in 2015, the discussions and reports in Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Director have become much easier to understand, even for us outside directors, with our different backgrounds. I believe these efforts not only maximize the use of our knowledge as outside directors, they will also become a significant source of strength in promoting greater diversity and globalization of our organizations.
 An Environment where Outside Directors can Contribute to Creating Value through Discussion
HiroshiTomono OutsideDirector
Honestly stating my opinion and contributing to the making of decisions—this is the role expected of me, and Sumitomo Chemical has created an environment where outside directors can fully embody that role. At Sumitomo Chemical, because important issues are reported to and discussed fully at meetings of the Board of Directors before a decision is reached, outside directors also have plenty of opportunities to express their opinions. Reports from business divisions and informal discussions includ- ing executive officers after official Board meetings are extremely useful in understanding the current situation of Sumitomo Chemical, and I think they form an excellent method of information-sharing that does not just stop at a general explanation of proposals. Moreover, because proposed resolutions are reported in combination with discussions in the Management Meetings, it is particularly
easy to share opinions.
Not a few of these initiatives were actually begun after
taking in the opinions of us outside directors. It could be said that the flexibility to welcome outside directors with diverse backgrounds, accept their views, and rapidly implement suggested improvements is characteristic of Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors. Another characteristic of Sumitomo Chemical is that a viewpoint of “for the good of people, for the good of the world” runs through both the proposals submitted and the discussions in the Board of Directors meetings. I hope to be able to further contribute to discussions of Sumitomo Chemical’s growth going forward, while continuing to value this way of thinking, which could be said to be an intangible asset of the company, suited to a company that was started to resolve an issue in society through technology.

The Capabilities Supporting Corporate Value

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Initiatives
Sumitomo Chemical has been committed to continual efforts to improve corporate governance. In response to demands for further raising the governance level, including application of the Corporate Governance Code, we are taking measures to achieve the optimal governing structure and decision-making processes, while remaining faithful to the intent and spirit of the Code.
Basic Stance
Sumitomo Chemical cherishes deeply the Sumitomo Spirit which has been passed down through generations over nearly 400 years, the basic teaching of which is, among others, not to seek its own interests alone, but to contribute to society through its business activities. In accord with this business credo, the Company strives to take on challenges constantly of creating new value by capitalizing on its proprietary technolo- gies toward achieving the Company’s sustained growth while at the same time cultivating corporate culture full of vigor and growing as a company that earns trust from the public at large.
Recognizing that highly effective corporate governance is vital to attaining these ends, the Company keeps working to further enhance its corporate governance in accordance with the following policies and principles, centering particularly on closer cooperation with shareholders and various other stake- holders, faster decision-making, proper oversight of business execution, enhanced systems of compliance and internal control, and active dialog with stakeholders.
Measures to Date for Strengthening Corporate Governance
Sumitomo Chemical not only shall respect the rights of share- holders, but shall endeavor to provide an environment where shareholders can exercise their rights smoothly and also to ensure the effectively equal treatment of shareholders.
Recognizing that cooperation with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, business partners, creditors, and local com- munities, is essential to sustained growth, Sumitomo Chemical shall proactively work to fulfill its corporate social responsibility and strive to cultivate corporate culture of a company that can be trusted by society. As part of efforts to build a foundation for constructive dialog with stakeholders, Sumitomo Chemical shall endeavor to provide information that is highly reliable and useful to recipients. Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors shall fulfill its role and mission properly, based on their fiduciary responsibilities and accountability to shareholders and recognizing the important role of Independent Outside Directors & Auditors, through such mea- sures as presenting appropriate corporate management policies and business strategies that have taken into account changing socioeconomic conditions, and conducting highly effective over- sight over the execution of business.
Sumitomo Chemical shall endeavor to promote constructive dialog with shareholders with the aim of seeking to attain the Company’s sustained growth and to enhance corporate value in the medium to long term.
Sumitomo Chemical has prepared Corporate Governance Guidelines, in accordance with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code. These Guidelines can be viewed on Sumitomo Chemical’s website.

Recent Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate Governance
Composition of Board of Directors
In June 2015, we added two outside directors to the Board of Directors, raising their number to three, in order to strengthen the oversight functions of the Board and to increase the transparency and objectivity of management. Moreover, we appointed accounting specialists as outside corporate auditors. We are working to establish a solid governance structure to enhance oversight and management functions of the Board of Directors.
of those operations. The changes also expand the scope of decision-making delegated to Executive Officers with the aim of speeding up execution of business. At board meetings, reporting on the performance of duties by each Director has been enhanced, and three types of reports are defined based on the contents, aiming for effective reporting. Along with enhanced reporting, the monetary threshold the Board of Directors to resolve has been raised, faster decision-making has been achieved, and the monitoring functions of the Board of Directors have been strengthened.
Establishment of Nomination Advisory Committee
and Remuneration Advisory Committee
A nomination advisory committee and a remuneration advisory committee were established in October 2015. Currently both committees are made up of a majority of independent outside directors. By nominating candidates for Directors or Corporate Auditors and advising on remuneration, they are helping to make the decision-making process more transparent, fair, and open.
Use of Outside Director Functions
To make maximum use of the oversight and advisory functions of the outside directors, the relevant organizations provide outside directors with detailed explanations of agenda items before they are deliberated in the Board. Important matters such as management policy, M&A, and large-scale projects are explained to the Board of Directors in advance so that the views of Directors can be reflected; and advice is given by outside directors and others based on their expert knowledge.

     Assessing the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Assessment Methods
Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors carries out analysis and appraisal regarding the effectiveness of the Board of Directors through exchanging opinions at Outside Directors & Auditors meetings attended by Outside Directors, Outside Corporate Auditors, the Chairman, and the President, and at Management Committee meetings attended by Directors, etc., as well as by taking into account questionnaire replies from Directors and Corporate Auditors and opinions expressed by the Board of Corporate Auditors. Based on these opinions, the Board of Directors makes an overall review of the appraised effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
Assessment for Fiscal 2016 and
Improvements over the Previous Fiscal Year
The effectiveness of the Board of Directors was determined with regard to its composition, operation, deliberation, and report- ing at the Board of Directors meetings, that duties entrusted to the Management are being carried out properly. Sumitomo Chemical has confirmed improvements over the previous year (invigorating deliberations at the Board of Directors meetings through sharing discussion in internal meetings with Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors, improving practices for regular reports on business activity to the Board of Directors meetings).
Independent Director
Toward the Future
From the perspective of further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, a few matters to be improved have been pointed out, including risk analysis in the launch of new, important businesses, progress reviews for new businesses in the process of launching, and feedback of dialog with investors and analysts. Sumitomo Chemical is committed to address them further.
    Pick Up Visit to Production Sites by Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors
In order for Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors to further understand our business, Sumitomo Chemical provides them with opportunities to visit our produc- tion sites both inside and outside Japan each year. In fiscal 2016, they visited the Osaka region of Sumitomo Chemical and Group companies in Singapore. They have expressed the opinion that this initiative is extremely valuable, enabling them to grasp the overall picture of the company.

 Organizational Structure
1 Board of Directors
The Sumitomo Chemical Board of Directors decides important matters concerning the Company’s management, including management policy and business strategies, in accordance with the law, the Articles of Incorporation, and Board of Directors regulations. It also receives reports from Directors and others on the performance of duties, financial situation, and operating results, and oversees the performance of duties by each Director.
The Board currently consists of 11 Directors, three of whom are independent outside directors having no conflict of interest with general shareholders. The term of office of Directors is one year, in order to make the administrative organization respon- sive to changes in the business environment and to establish clear administrative responsibility and roles of Directors.
Board of Directors meetings are held monthly as a rule, with special meetings convened as needed. To ensure the effective- ness of the Board of Directors, assessments and analyses are conducted annually and the follow-up to the results is done.
2 Board of Corporate Auditors
We have a Corporate Auditor System, with a Board of Corporate Auditors consisting of five Corporate Auditors including three outside corporate auditors.
The Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate Auditors play a vital role in our corporate governance, by auditing the performance of duties by Directors in accordance with the
law and the Articles of Incorporation. The Board of Corporate Auditors meets once a month as a rule.
Standing Corporate Auditors and outside auditors attend meetings of the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors. In conducting their audits, they receive reports and explanations as needed from the Internal Control & Audit Department, operating divisions, and accounting auditors. In addi- tion, Standing Corporate Auditors attend meetings of the Internal Control Committee and other important company meetings.
The results of audits and the objective views of outside auditors are appropriately reflected in internal audits, corporate auditors’ audits, and accounting audits, so as to raise the effec- tiveness and efficiency of auditing.
The Corporate Auditors’ Office has been established with staff dedicated to providing assistance in auditing functions under the direction of Corporate Auditors.
Management Organizations for Decision-making, Execution, and Auditing
3 Executive Officers
We have appointed Executive Officers to expedite the implementation of business operations. Executive Officers are responsible for carrying out operations in accordance with the policies adopted by the Board of Directors. We have 36 Executive Officers, with seven acting in dual capacity as Directors. The Executive Officers are 33 Japanese and three non-Japanese, consisting of 35 males and one female. The term of office for Executive Officers is one year.

4 Management Meeting
The Management Meeting supports the decision-making of our management by providing a forum for deliberation on such vital matters as corporate strategy and capital investment, including matters to be deliberated in the Board of Directors for discussion and reports to be made to the Board. The Management Meeting consists of all the Directors (excluding outside directors), some of the Executive Officers of corporate divisions, and one Standing Corporate Auditor. Meetings are held 24 times a year as a rule.
5 Committees
We enhance its business activities and oversight functions by establishing internal meetings (committees) to deliberate on important matters concerning the management of the Company, and the Group from broad and diverse viewpoints. Of these committees, the Internal Control Committee, the Compliance Committee, and the Responsible Care Committee and others are attended by Directors and others, as well as the Standing Corporate Auditor, who serves as an observer.

7 Remuneration Advisory Committee
The Remuneration Advisory Committee was established in October 2015, as an advisory body to the Board of Directors on the remuneration system for top management and Directors, remuneration levels, and other related matters. The committee is made up of outside directors and Sumitomo Chemical representative directors. It holds regular meetings annually and convenes ad hoc meetings as needed. With a majority of members being outside directors, the committee advises the Board of Directors in deciding the officer remuneration system and levels, in order to achieve greater transparency, fairness, and openness.
Remuneration System
Remuneration for directors consists of basic remuneration and bonuses. Basic remuneration is paid as fixed remuneration assigned to each rank, reflecting the duties of Directors and the Company’s medium- to long-term performance. The intention is that directors will not take actions having only short-term effect or be content with less than full optimization. Bonuses are paid to heighten incentive to meet the business plans for each year, with the amount being determined based on con- solidated performance for the fiscal year.
Remuneration Levels
To ensure objectivity and appropriateness of remuneration, levels are set by an outside third party based on the results in a database relating to executive pay, comparison with pay levels of the Company’s employees, past amounts paid, and other data.

 Internal Control / Risk Management
Status of Development of Internal Control System
We recognize the continuous development and enhancement of our internal control system as a necessary process in main- taining a sound organization, and believe this system should be actively utilized for the achievement of business objectives.
Based on the Basic Policy for Enhancement of the Internal Control System (revised in March 2015) established by the Board of Directors, we have formed the Internal Control Committee (chaired by the President) to review and strengthen the internal control system of the Sumitomo Chemical Group in response to changing circumstances. The Internal Control Committee monitors the implementation status of initiatives based on the Basic Policy, promoting various measures in order to enhance internal control systems.
Internal Auditing
Sumitomo Chemical’s internal auditing is conducted on Sumitomo Chemical and major Group companies by depart- ments which are organized especially for the function, such as the Internal Control & Audit Department. The Departments carry out internal auditing to evaluate and ascertain designs, opera- tions, and effective functioning of internal controls from the following perspectives in the execution of business duties by executives and employees of the Sumitomo Chemical Group: (1) effective and efficient operations; (2) reliability of financial reporting; and (3) compliance with relevant laws and statutes in all business activities. The Internal Control & Audit Department works to improve internal controls for applicable departments through internal auditing. It also regularly holds meetings of the Internal Audit Coordination Board to share with relevant depart- ments the reports of deficiencies detected by internal auditing and progress on their countermeasures, promoting initiatives to strengthen the internal control systems of the Sumitomo Chemical Group. The department reports summaries of audits relating to internal controls to the Internal Control Committee. The Department also evaluates the effectiveness of Sumitomo Chemical’s internal control over the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s financial reporting, in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, and also reports on the status of such evaluation to the Internal Control Committee.
Timely Disclosure
The Corporate Communications Department is in charge of working in conjunction with other relevant departments to continually disclose necessary information in a timely manner. In addition to items requiring disclosure under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and under stock exchange regulations, we also actively disclose information that may be

considered material to the decisions of investors.
We endeavor to build stronger relationships of trust with
society and capital markets by publishing documentation in accordance with the rules stipulated by the security exchanges in Japan, including reports on the Company’s corporate gover- nance philosophy and system, and notifications showing that independent directors and corporate auditors have no existing conflicts of interest with general shareholders. These documents are available on the website of Japan Exchange Group Inc.
Risk Management
We seek to improve and enhance our risk management system to detect risks at an early stage that have the possibility of hin- dering the achievement of business objectives and to prevent them from occurring as well as to respond quickly and appropri- ately on their occurrence.
Each organization of the Sumitomo Chemical Group takes various measures to appropriately manage risk. To support and ensure the risk management measures of each organization, the Internal Control Committee determines Group-wide risk management policy and deliberates initiatives pertaining to collection of risk information and its dissemination throughout the Group.
For enhancing the risk management system, each organiza- tion of Sumitomo Chemical Group including Group companies both in Japan and abroad conducts a risk assessment every fiscal year in terms of the probability of risk occurrence and its possible impact, and the Internal Control Committee determines based on the assessment results Group-wide priority risks which are to be implemented across the Group. Each organization takes appro- priate measures based on the Group-wide risk response plans, which are developed by Sumitomo Chemical’s risk response coordination departments designated for each priority risk.
We also establish a Risk Crisis Management Committee to deliberate the Group’s response policies and plans, pertaining to the individual risk crisis in order to make prompt responses in the event that a significant risk is realized, such as large-scale disasters (earthquakes, storms, floods and other), pandemics, and a deterioration in security (terrorism, riots and wars and other).

Compliance
The Sumitomo Chemical Group’s Compliance-Focused Mindset:
Passed Down from One Generation to Another
Sumitomo Chemical places “compliance” at the bedrock of corporate management. As we engage in business in many parts of the world, all companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are devoting earnest efforts to stay in strict compliance with not only laws and regulations, but also ethical principles in a business environment.
The spirit and letter of ensuring compliance in business activities have consistently been enshrined at Sumitomo Chemical ever since the company was founded. This unwav- ering resolve towards compliance is embodied succinctly in the “Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business Conduct,” which serves as the guideline of conduct for every employee to abide by and constitutes the backbone of our day-to-day compliance activities. In recent years in particular, greater emphasis is placed on the importance of companies fulfilling their responsi- bilities to society while relevant laws and their enforcement are continually strengthened around the world. Given the circum- stances, all companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are mak- ing concerted endeavors in furthering compliance activities, keeping duly in mind that thoroughgoing compliance efforts are becoming ever more important in the Group’s increasingly globalized business operations.
The Compliance Manual and the Charter for Business Conduct embody Sumitomo Chemical’s Business Philosophy

(1) Sumitomo Chemical’s Compliance Committee = The Linchpin of Sumitomo Chemical Group’s
Compliance Activities
The Compliance Committee of Sumitomo Chemical establishes overarching principles of compliance from a global perspective, according to which it works with every Group company in Japan and abroad in building and operating their compliance systems locally in a manner required.
(2) Think globally, Manage regionally, Act locally = A Structure Focused on Effectiveness
As business globalizes, it becomes more important that a cor- poration’s compliance system operation be fine-tuned to a sit- uation specific to an individual country or company. In light of this, we have established Regional Legal & Compliance Offices (RLCOs) in Sumitomo Chemical’s major business regions. The RLCOs, grasping the concrete needs and tasks of respective Group companies, provide hands-on support and guidance to them, such as helping to set and implement necessary internal rules and procedures, building a company’s compliance sys- tem, and assisting in its operation.
(3) Latest Priority Initiatives
An area of our recent focus is to strengthen those initiatives which will more effectively serve to maintain sound business practices in a company’s supply chain, through implementing measures to prevent corruption, such as bribes and collusion with trading partners, as well as unchanged initiatives to ensure strict observance of competition laws in the world. In addition, with a firm belief that strict compliance can only be achieved with all employees having high awareness of com- pliance, Sumitomo Chemical attaches particular importance

    to carrying out “compliance education” on a continual basis, which includes training programs geared to management executives at Sumitomo Chemical and Group companies as well as e-learning trainings or face-to-face lecture-style training courses, depending on each company’s specific needs and situation. Overseas, the RLCOs are promoting these initiatives by providing tangible, practical, and visible support to each Group company so that they can more effectively develop and operate systems capable of ensuring strict compliance.
Moreover, as a means to quantify the effect of these edu- cation and training initiatives, Sumitomo Chemical conducts an employee compliance awareness survey regularly. In fiscal 2016, the awareness survey was expanded to include not just Sumitomo Chemical, but also all of the Valent Group compa- nies in the US, and Group companies in Singapore, such as Sumitomo Chemical Asia. These surveys have confirmed that employees’ compliance awareness is improving in each of the companies, which has led us to work on possible issues yet to be addressed for further improvement and on formulating con- crete measures to take accordingly. Going forward, Sumitomo Chemical, along with Group companies, will continue unabated and diligent efforts to improve employees’ compliance aware- ness across the Group both in Japan and overseas.
Speak-Up Reporting System
(1) A Speak-Up Reporting System Plays
a Key Role Towards Enhanced Compliance
All companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are constantly making every possible effort to detect any compliance viola- tions as early as possible or to prevent them from occurring in the future, by taking a variety of measures, including improving the operational effectiveness of the Speak-Up Reporting System. Sumitomo Chemical’s Speak-Up System is built on the basic thought that anyone involved in Sumitomo Chemical’s business, whether a management executive or an employee at the Company, or his or her family member, or an executive or employee of a Group company, or a trading partner, will be able to report a compliance violation or a suspected violation to the Compliance Committee without fail, whenever they come to recognize one in connection with activities of Sumitomo Chemical Group companies. Accordingly, various reporting channels are available for use, i.e. (1) A Compliance Committee of each Group company, (2) RLCOs, (3) the Compliance Committee of Sumitomo Chemical, and (4) external lawyers designated by the committee. A reporting person can use a reporting channel of his or her choosing.
(2) Recent Operational Status of Speak-Up Reporting System
The number of speak-up reports received in fiscal 2016 by the Compliance Committee of Sumitomo Chemical and those of Group companies combined totaled 39 (3 reports less than the previous year). Upon its receipt, each report was worked on, and an investigation was conducted promptly and cautiously into a reported incident. When violations were found or if a situation that might eventually develop into an incident of violation was recognized, corrective measures were taken properly. In addition, information on a violation incident and corrective measures actually taken was shared, as necessary, by other companies of the Group so that they could prevent similar incidents from occurring in their workplace in the future.
(3) Promoting Use of the Speak-Up Reporting System
An investigation based on a speak-up report is carried out with utmost consideration to protecting the privacy of a reporting person and maintaining confidentiality of information pro- vided. In addition, a maximal care is taken to ensure that a per- son who has made truthful reporting will never be put at any disadvantage on the ground of having made the report, such as dismissal, transfer, or discrimination. Moreover, to ensure that the Speak-Up System functions in a truly effective manner, Sumitomo Chemical’s Compliance Committee takes every opportunity to explain to employees that speak-up reporting will never disadvantage a reporting person. In this regard, the Committee has been working to help employees understand clearly that confidentiality about the reporting is maintained and any disadvantageous treatment to a reporting person is strictly prohibited. In addition, the Committee shares with employee’s information about how far the Speak-Up Reporting System is in use by employees.

 Realizing More Effective Operation of Compliance System
Every company of Sumitomo Chemical Group has their compliance system in place. The focus of our ongoing efforts is to examine all of these compliance systems individually and explore how each of them could be operated more effectively. Specifically, each Group company is supposed to assess compliance risks likely involved in its day-to-day business activities, then formulate appropriate countermeasures based on the results of the assessment and then implement them. The purpose of this exercise is to enable each Group company to undertake compliance-related risk management more practically and effectively. In this connection, RLCOs have an important role to play vis-à-vis Group companies, i.e. helping them to conduct a proper assessment of compliance risks involved, set appropriate rules and procedures based on the results of the assessment, and then carry them out. To this end, RLCOs are strengthening working relationships with individual companies in a region for which each RLCO is responsible. One of the forums to promote Group-wide compliance is a com- pany-wide campaign called “Compliance Promotion Month” which has been held in October every year, beginning in 2015, at Sumitomo Chemical and some of the Group companies (for details, please see the “Topics” column). It is our intention that the Compliance Promotion Month initiatives will be conducted continually to not only reduce concrete compliance risks in workplace, but also help elevate the compliance awareness of individual employees.
Four Areas of Focus for Enhanced Compliance Activities
Stronger Commitment to
Further Enhanced Compliance Initiatives
Being a global enterprise, Sumitomo Chemical is deeply com- mitted to fulfilling its corporate citizenship responsibilities. As Sumitomo Chemical Group companies continue to promote and expand business worldwide, the Sumitomo Chemical Compliance Committee, the RLCOs and each Group company will work jointly and more vigorously to strengthen their com- pliance initiatives by further cementing the closely-knit network of collaboration through various kinds of modus operandi, such as holding Global Legal and Compliance Conferences annually or the active use of IoT technologies.
     Topics Compliance Promotion Month initiatives In line with Nippon Keidanren’s (the Japan Business
Federation) “Corporate Ethics Promotion Month” initiatives, Sumitomo Chemical and some of the Group companies have designated October of every year as “Compliance Promotion Month,” in which all employees in each work- place participate in discussions to examine and identify all conceivable compliance risks, major or minor, that might arise in each workplace. They then go on to select those risks that need to be specifically addressed and formulate concrete measures to prevent the risks from occurring in the future. For those preventive measures which are already in place, they review once again whether or not the measures will be effective enough when implemented.
As far as Sumitomo Chemical is concerned, during the Compliance Promotion Month initiatives of fiscal 2016, all major compliance risks were examined in each depart- ment, including particularly so-called “fraud” risks in light of recent corporate scandals that had taken place in Japan or elsewhere. Then, concrete preventive measures were formulated and implemented. The Compliance Committee highly values and makes the best use of the outcome of these initiatives conducted at each department. Specifically, after the Compliance Promotion Month initiatives is over, the Compliance Committee evaluates campaign activities conducted at each department in the Company based on the reports they submit. With respect to “best practices” that the Committee finds among the campaign activities, they will be introduced to and information thereon shared by other departments within the company. In parallel, the Compliance Committee, seeking further enhanced com- pliance activities, maintains a dialogue with those depart- ments where improvement has been found necessary.

(5) Pharmaceuticals
In Japan, although sales of Aimix® (anti-hypertension drug), Trerief® (therapeutic agent for Parkinson’s disease) and other drugs increased, overall sales declined due largely to the impacts of Japanese National Health Insurance drug price revisions and a decrease in shipments of patent-expired originator drugs. In North America, sales of Latuda® (atypical antipsychotic) and other drugs increased steadily. The stronger yen had a negative effect on sales from overseas subsidiaries in yen terms. The segment’s sales increased by ¥8.7 billion (US$78 million) compared with the previous fiscal year, to ¥444.2 billion (US$3,959 million). Operating income rose by ¥12.4 billion (US$111 million), to ¥55.1 billion (US$491 million), due to the expansion of sales in North America.

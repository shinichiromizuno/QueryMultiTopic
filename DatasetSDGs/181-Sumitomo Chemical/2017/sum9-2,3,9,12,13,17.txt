Sumika Sustainable Solutions FY2016 Sales Â¥106 billion
In this sector, three products have been designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions: OlysetTM Nets, Hikari no Sumika rice, and methionine. OlysetTM Nets are long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets that incorporate an insecticide using proprietary technology, eliminating the mosquitoes that serve as a vector for malaria, and thereby preventing the spread of infection. Hikari no Sumika is a variety of rice that has been selectively bred to grow shorter than existing Koshihikari rice, enhancing its resistance to damage from falling over due to weather phenomena. These products, including methionine, contribute to building a sustainable society through means such as adaptation to the impact of climate change and reducing the burden on the environment.

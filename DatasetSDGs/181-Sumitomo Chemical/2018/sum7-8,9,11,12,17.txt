Creating More Affluent and Convenient Lives for People
By developing and manufacturing circularly polarizing films for OLED displays, Sumitomo Chemical is con- tributing to the creation of entirely new products. The company will continue to provide new materials and solutions going forward, enabling people to lead more affluent and convenient lives.
Sumika Sustainable Solutions
The UV adhesive curing process in polarizing film manufacturing is designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions. Manufacturing polarizing film, which is made by pasting together multiple sheets of film, previously used a great deal of electricity for the superheated drying process for the water-soluble glue. By adopting a UV adhesive curing process that uses ultraviolet curing technology, Sumitomo Chemical was able to significantly reduce the amount of power consumed in this process.

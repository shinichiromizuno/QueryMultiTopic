12 What Sumitomo Chemical Strives to Be
   Editorial Direction
Last fiscal year, Sumitomo Chemical adjusted the positioning of its annual report and CSR Report, reorganizing them as an integrated report, which is Sumitomo Chemical’s new Annual Report. With the aim of communicating its sustained growth in a way that is easy to understand for shareholders and other investors, as well as a broad array of other stakeholders, the new Annual Report comprehensively brings together financial information and non-financial information. In addition to a report on financial results and information on the strengths of businesses and business strategies, the Annual Report includes information on Sumitomo Chemical’s corporate governance system as well as its environmental and corporate social responsibility initiatives.
The Annual Report 2018 was created with the intention of having analysts and investors see, read, and feel our value creation story, serving as the “Sumitomo Chemical Museum” that introduces Sumitomo Chemical’s past, present, and future. The report also features new content such as an ESG dialogue with an investor, a discussion of governance with Outside Directors, and value creation models for each business sector. Sumitomo Chemical hopes this Annual Report serves as a bridge to its stakeholders and communicates its efforts to create new value by mobilizing the entire Sumitomo Chemical Group.
    The Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation, put forth by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, is a handbook that serves as a shared language connecting companies and investors, systematically and compre- hensively laying out the information that companies ought to convey to investors in order to raise the quality of information disclosure and of dialogue with investors. This report primarily relies on this guidance in the value creation models for each sector in the section on Creating Value through Business (starting on page 40).
 Forward-looking Statements
Statements made in this annual report with respect to plans, strategies, and future performance that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. Sumitomo Chemical cautions that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements including, but not limited to, general economic conditions in Sumitomo Chemical’s markets; demand for, and competitive pricing pressure on, Sumitomo Chemical’s products in the marketplace; Sumitomo Chemical’s ability to continue to win acceptance for its products in these highly competitive markets; and movements of currency exchange rates.
 Financial Statements in This Document
Beginning FY2017, the Sumitomo Chemical Group is adopting international financial reporting standards (IFRS) in place of Japanese GAAP, which it previously used, and is therefore restating figures for the previous consolidated fiscal year using IFRS for comparative analysis. However, as the consolidated statement of financial position was not calculated for the sectors using IFRS at the beginning of FY2016, the sectors’ ROA for FY2016 were not calculated.

 To Our Stakeholders
Through Our Business We are Working even Harder to Contribute to Solving Pressing Problems that Society Faces and to Building a Sustainable Society.
The efforts of the international community to build a sustainable society, as represented by the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), are gathering speed in earnest. In these circumstances, companies are expected to play a major role on both local and global levels, and particularly are being called upon to contribute as leaders in techno- logical innovation to resolving a wide range of problems facing people around the world.
Based on Sumitomo’s business philosophy, which emphasizes that our businesses must benefit society at large, not just our own interests, we at the Sumitomo Chemical Group have helped people to better their lives through continual technological innovation. In addition, we have striven to create new value by incorporating and integrating technolo- gies and insights from various fields beyond the boundaries of chemistry.
Against the backdrop of technological advancement in areas such as IoT, robotics, and AI, a structural change is taking place in industry. The Sumitomo Chemical Group views these societal changes as new opportunities. By fully utilizing our core technologies developed over many years as a diversified chemical company, while also collaborating with other companies, universities, and research institutions in a variety of fields, we will continue to bring together technology and expertise from inside and outside the company and thereby create innovative products and technologies. Furthermore, we will work even harder to contribute through our business to solving pressing problems that society faces in the areas of health, food security, the environment, and global warming, and to building a sustainable society.
Thank you very much for your continued support and cooperation. July 2018

Aiming for Sustainable Growth by Creating Value for Society
while Sustaining Economic Activity
At Sumitomo Chemical we focus our resources on specialty chemicals businesses, where we have distinct competitive advantages and where high growth is anticipated, and work to improve our ROI to enhance our enterprise value.
In addition, we aim to achieve sustainable growth by creating value for society while sustaining economic activity.
Q
A
Looking back on fiscal 2017, what is your evaluation of the Company’s results?
  We were able to achieve our highest income ever on the back of a strong global economy.
 The overall trends in the global economy in fiscal 2017 remained strong. In the US, economic growth continued, supported by increasing employment numbers and strong consumer spending, while the European economy continued its gradual recovery, despite factors such as the UK’s exit from the EU. In addition, signs of recovery were seen in emerging economies, including China. The Japanese economy remained on a moderate recovery path, with increased corporate income as well as an improved employment and income environment.
As for our performance in fiscal 2017, not only did sales volume improve across all segments, particularly in the Pharmaceuticals Sector and the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, market prices also rose for products in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector. Because of these factors, and a gain on conversion to the reporting currency resulting from the weak yen, our sales revenue increased by 251.4 billion yen over the previous fiscal year, to 2,190.5 billion yen, under the IFRS standards adopted beginning this fiscal year.
Core operating income increased by 78.1 billion yen over the previous fiscal year, to 262.7 billion yen, because of improvements in business performance in areas such
as the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, where margins have improved, and in the Pharmaceuticals Sector, where shipments of pharmaceuticals increased in North America.
Operating income rose by 124.5 billion yen over the previous fiscal year, to 250.9 billion yen, due to factors such as lower impairment losses.
Net income attributable to the owners of the parent increased by 57.2 billion yen over the previous year, to 133.8 billion yen, despite factors such as increasing for- eign exchange losses and an increased tax burden. Under Japanese accounting standards, operating income was 179.1 billion yen, 44.8 billion yen higher than the previous year, while net income attributable to the owners of the parent was 126.0 billion yen, 40.6 billion yen higher than one year earlier—both being the highest ever. In addition, this is the first time that our net income has exceeded 100 billion yen.
ROE for fiscal 2017 was 15.4%, making this the third year in a row, since fiscal 2015, that ROE has exceeded our target of 10% or higher.
We increased dividends by 8 yen over the previous year, to 22 yen, the highest ever.

  Interview with the President

Q
A
Please recap Sumitomo Chemical’s current Corporate Business Plan.
  We continue to further improve our business portfolio by focusing our resources in specialty chemicals businesses where we have technological advantages.
 Under the current Corporate Business Plan, we are com- mitted to our slogan “Change and Innovation—Create New Value,” and by capitalizing on the robust financial strength we built over the previous Corporate Business Plan period, we are aggressively pursuing growth opportu- nities and further spurring our transformation into a more resilient Sumitomo Chemical that continues to grow.
Specifically, we are working on five priority initiatives, including further improving our business portfolio, gen- erating more cash flow, and accelerating the launch of next-generation businesses.
In order to further improve our business portfolio, we are directing 70% to 80% of the capital expenditures and investments to be determined in the three years from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, and 90% of our R&D expenses over the same period, to the area of specialty chemicals, primarily life sciences businesses.
As for generating more cash flow, we retain our lean financial structure and, at the same time, are striving to
build and maintain robust earnings power to consistently generate strong cash flow, so that we can take advantage of large-scale investment opportunities when they arise.
In the initiative of accelerating the launch of next- generation businesses, we continue to invest in the fields of the environment and energy, ICT, and life sciences, as well as their cross-over areas, and are stepping up efforts to bring to market our products and technologies under development as early as possible.
Along with these three initiatives, we continue to promote globally integrated management while also ensuring full and strict compliance and establishing and maintaining safe and stable operations.
For fiscal 2018, the final year of the current Corporate Business Plan period, we seek to achieve sales revenue of 2,490 billion yen and net income attributable to the owners of the parent of 130 billion yen. We anticipate an ROI of 7% and an ROE of 13%, exceeding our targets for income.

Q
A
In what areas was major progress made in fiscal 2017, the second year of the current Corporate Business Plan?
  We made steady progress in implementing measures to further improve our business portfolio.
  In fiscal 2017, the second year of the current Corporate Business Plan period, we made steady progress in further improving our business portfolio, as we worked in each Sector to expand businesses that contribute to solving issues in society and to improving the quality of life.
In the Petrochemical & Plastics Sector, we completed construction on the Rabigh Phase II Project and began production, while we also made progress in our efforts to increase the added value of our products.
In the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, we expanded production capacity for lithium-ion secondary battery separators, for which demand continues to grow for use in electric vehicles. Meanwhile, we pushed ahead with business restructuring efforts, including exiting the diesel particulate filter (DPF) business.
In the IT-related Chemicals Sector, we enhanced our production capacity for a variety of materials used in the production of semiconductors, whereas we exited the sapphire LED substrate business.
In the Health & Crop Sciences Sector, the develop- ment of major next-generation agricultural chemicals progressed and we began applying for registration of

expenditures and investments of approximately 160 bil- lion yen in fiscal 2018. Of these expenditures and invest- ments of about 690 billion yen in total, more than 70% will go to the specialty chemicals field. In addition, over the same period, we plan to direct most of our research and development investment of approximately 490 billion yen to the Pharmaceuticals Sector and the Health & Crop Sciences Sector. With these investments, we will continue to further improve our business portfolio.

 Interview with the President

Q
A
Please describe the businesses where strong growth is anticipated.
  There are many businesses that we expect to contribute to our financial performance in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
 Some of the investments we decided on in the first two years of the current Corporate Business Plan period have already begun to contribute to our financial performance, but it will be after fiscal 2019 that several major invest- ments, such as the acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals area and the expansion of methionine production capac- ity, will contribute to a full extent. In the next Corporate Business Plan, we will seek to achieve growth by success- fully executing these major projects.
Furthermore, our development efforts are continuing to progress for products that are expected to see signifi- cant growth in the future, including next-generation bat- tery cathode materials, polymer OLED components and
materials, next-generation major crop protection chem- icals, and new pharmaceuticals. In the next Corporate Business Plan, we will strive to bring these products under development to market as soon as possible.
At Sumitomo Chemical, we have many sprouting seeds of future businesses that could not only contribute to solving pressing issues facing society, including those related to the environment, energy, and food supply, but could also help to promote health, make daily lives more comfortable and improve people’s quality of life. Under the next Corporate Business Plan, we would like to make these seeds grow into new businesses, and thereby create new value and contribute to building a sustainable society.

 Interview with the President

Q
A
Please describe your initiatives to build a sustainable society.
  Since the company’s founding, we have been putting into practice “creating shared value,” a concept that a business should not just work to sustain its economic activity,
but should also strive to create value for society.
 About a century ago, Sumitomo Chemical got its start by manufacturing fertilizers from harmful gas emitted from copper smelting operations, aiming to solve the environmental problem of smoke pollution while helping to increase agricultural output. Since then, we have put into practice “Creating Shared Value,” the concept that a business should not just work to sustain its economic activity, but should also strive to create value for society.
In order to encourage each employee to put into action the philosophy of “contributing to society through our business,” we work to have all employees participate in efforts to provide solutions through business and help achieve the SDGs, and all our top executives are commit- ted to the initiatives.
In our “Sustainable Tree” initiative, for instance, in which employees can express their own commitment to the SDGs on a dedicated website, more than 9,000 messages were posted in the year 2017. I believe the fact that two- thirds of them were from Group companies outside Japan shows that employees of Sumitomo Chemical Group are committed, beyond the boundaries of nations, to achiev- ing the SDGs.
In addition, we have a program to designate as “Sumika Sustainable Solutions” those Sumitomo Chemical Group
products and technologies that contribute to mitigating global warming and reducing environmental burdens, in which 44 products and technologies have been des- ignated. By promoting the development and the spread of these products, we will provide solutions to build a sustainable society.
In order to further promote these initiatives for creating a sustainable society, we established the “Sustainability Promotion Committee” in April 2018. This committee not only takes a comprehensive view of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s various initiatives relating to environ- mental and societal problems, but it also works to further accelerate the Company’s efforts by evaluating how much we are contributing to sustainability overall.
Along with these initiatives, we are stepping up efforts to make our governance more effective, increasing the number of Outside Directors from 3 to 4 in June 2018, and further enhancing the oversight and management functions, as well as the advisory functions, of the Outside Directors.
Going forward, we at Sumitomo Chemical will continue our ESG (environmental, social, and governance) initiatives to help solve various problems facing people around the world, and to achieve long-term sustained growth.

Q

Finally, could you provide an overview of Sumitomo Chemical’s vision?
  We seek to achieve sustained growth by creating new value through innovative technologies.
 The capability to develop innovative solutions by lever- aging extensive technological expertise, global market reach, and highly loyal employees—these are Sumitomo Chemical’s core competencies, which we have built up through our operations spanning over a century. Going forward, by making full use of these strengths, we will continue to strive to solve issues in society, particularly environmental, energy, and food supply issues, and continue to contribute to improving the quality of life by promoting health and making daily lives more comfort- able for people around the world.
We also aim to achieve sustained growth by creating new value through innovative technologies, and strive to constantly realize an ROI of above the cost of capital and 7% or higher.
At the same time, to achieve this vision, it is essential that we maintain financial strength robust enough to withstand any changes in our business environment. Specifically, we aim to hold a D/E ratio at approximately
0.7 times, and constantly achieve an ROE of 10% or above. In addition, for the time being we set our dividend payout ratio at around 30%, and by investing about 70% of net income in new growth opportunities in the areas of the environment and energy, life sciences, and ICT, we
seek to achieve an annual profit growth rate of over 7%.

  Due to improved performance and lower investment, the balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 41.9 billion yen com- pared to the end of the previous fiscal year. In addition, because retained earnings increased, total assets increased, and the debt/ equity ratio fell.
Cash flows from operating activities improved by 107.5 billion yen compared to the previous year, due to factors such as improved performance. In addition, compared with the previous fiscal year, in which large-scale corporate acquisitions were carried out, cash flows from investment activities decreased. As a result, free cash flow increased compared to the previous year.

    Sumitomo Chemical Received the Deputy Chief’s Award (by Minister for Foreign Affairs) of the Japan SDGs Award
This award primarily recognizes two initiatives.
1 Sumitomo Chemical has for many years contributed to promoting Africa’s integrated advancement in economy, society, and the environment through the OlysetTM Net business whereby mosquito net local production created job opportunities, the working environ- ment for women improved, and constructing school buildings helped enhance educational assistance.
2 Under the strong leadership of top management, the Sumitomo Chemical Group as a whole has undertaken efforts such as “Sumika Sustainable Solutions,” which designates products and technologies that will contribute to mitigating global warming or reducing the burden on the environment, and “Our Sustainable Tree,” in which employees post messages on the Company’s internal website about how they believe they can contribute to the SDGs.
With the Sumitomo business philosophy, emphasizing that our business must benefit society at large, as part of its DNA, Sumitomo Chemical hopes to further accelerate its efforts aimed at solving issues in society by using the SDGs as a shared language with society.
What are the Japan SDGs Award?

Incurable Diseases
Even today, with so many advances in medical technology, there are many incurable diseases that have still never been solved with existing medicine. Attention has been focused on nucleic acid medicine, a new type of pharmaceutical, as a treatment method for this sort of incurable disease.
Sumitomo Chemical is working with Bonac, a startup company that is working on development of nucleic acid medicine to make it more widely available. In 2013, we received consent from Bonac for the exclusive right to use intellectual property rights relating to the manufacture and distribu- tion of nucleic acid medicine, thereby entering the business of contract manufacturing. Thereafter, in 2016, we invested in Bonac, strengthening their relationship as development partners. In September 2017, the two companies strengthened their partnership even further, with Sumitomo Chemical making an additional investment.

Comparison with Treatments such as Small Molecule Drugs and Antibody Drugs
Many existing pharmaceuticals, including small molecule drugs*1 and antibody drugs*2, act on the anomalous proteins themselves. On the other hand, nucleic acid medicine acts directly on the genes that synthesizes the proteins causing the illness, so it is capable of inhibiting the illness.

Status of the Nucleic Acid Medicine Market
 Bio-venture companies have taken the lead in developing the seeds of drug discovery for nucleic acid medicine. Major pharmaceutical companies in the US and Europe have also entered the market with licenses from these venture companies. Moreover, several Japanese companies are also conducting clinical studies. The number of nucleic acid treatments that have been approved as medicines around the world is still quite small, but it is attracting attention as a next-generation treatment, and the market is expected to grow quickly going forward.
 Issues in Nucleic Acid Medicine
Benefits of Nucleic Acid Medicine
    Nucleic acid medicine makes it possible to target RNA molecules for drug discovery, which could not be done with existing small molecule drugs or antibody drugs, and it is expected to be a ground-breaking, next-generation therapy. It is expected to enable the creation of treatments for difficult-to-treat conditions, such as hereditary diseases, cancer, and viral infections, particularly influ- enza, and development is ongoing around the world.
Hereditary diseases Cancer
Influenza
 Diseases Targeted by Nucleic Acid Medicine
    Nucleic acid medicine is expected to provide next-generation treatments, but there have been some issues in achieving practical utility. These issues include the fact that the medicine is quickly degraded by enzymes when injected into the body, and there are also concerns about side effects. Drug delivery systems* to solve these problems are still in development.
* Technology to deliver minimum amount of drugs to the right part of the body at the right time.

  Bonac Nucleic Acid
Bonac is developing Bonac Nucleic Acid, a product that will solve issues with nucleic acid medicine. Unlike many existing nucleic acid products, which use a double-stranded structure, the major feature of the Bonac Nucleic Acid the company has developed is a unique single-stranded structure with secondary modification. As a result, Bonac Nucleic Acid has the following strengths.
Strengths of Bonac Nucleic Acid
Bonac Nucleic Acid
  nkRNA
PnkRNA
siRNA
Linker sites
  With a double-stranded structure, nucleic acid products can be easily degraded by enzymes from the two protruding ends (overhang) of the structure. Because the single long chain exists in the form of linker(s) with Bonac Nucleic Acid, however, its ends are not open to enzymes, making it more resistant to enzymatic degradation, and providing increased stability.
Because it is a single-stranded, not double-stranded, Bonac Nucleic Acid is more tolerant for the body to recognize as a foreign substance, and as a result the side effects can be reduced.
A variety of different components can be conjugated at the linker sites, so the structure of Bonac Nucleic Acid can produce a diversity of drug delivery systems.
Bonac Nucleic Acid (e.g. PnkRNA) contains amino acids besides ribonucleotides, which are natural products, at its linker sites, so there is no need for concern about toxicity due to chemical modification.
Bonac holds patents for this technology in Japan, the US, and in major countries in Europe.

   Synergies between Bonac and Sumitomo Chemical
Reasons Sumitomo Chemical Entered the Nucleic Acid Medicine Business
While nucleic acid medicine technology is currently still in development, and the scale of the market is still small, we believe that demand will grow in the future.
As a leading player in the pharmaceutical chemicals business, we have many technologies that can be used in the field of nucleic acid medicine. Of the next-generation medicines, antibody drugs must be made by culturing cells, while nucleic medicine can be made through chemical synthesis. As a result, nucleic medicine is a field where we have high affinity, as a company with strong tech- nical background in the field of chemical synthesis. Furthermore, by applying the organic synthesis technology developed through manufacturing active ingredients for small molecule drugs, along with the industrial process know-how to commercialize the business, we are capable of manufac- turing high quality active ingredients of nucleic acid medicines.
Synergies with Bonac
The Sumitomo Chemical Group would like to combine the drug development, manufacturing of active ingredients and analysis technology, as well as the medical diagnostic technology it has developed, with Bonac’s unique nucleic acid medicine technology. Currently, Sumitomo Chemical’s and Bonac’s researchers are working on a variety of projects, including joint research, while maintaining close communication.
In addition, pharmaceutical companies, our customers, are continuing development of nucleic acid medicine, so we expect demand for the active ingredients of nucleic acid medicine to also increase. In order to respond to these circumstances, we are working to prepare a supply system for the active ingredients in nucleic acid medicine. By doing so, we will contribute to the commer- cialization of the nucleic acid medicine that our customers are developing as soon as possible. We are already conducting contract manufacturing at a plant in Osaka (Utajima), and we are capable of manufacturing high-purity nucleic acid medicine. Moreover, that plant has a proven track record of manufacturing in strict compliance with GMP*1.
Sumitomo Chemical hopes to work with Bonac in contributing to the spread of nucleic acid med- icine from the active ingredient manufacturing perspective. In addition, the technology that we adopted from Bonac has the potential to be applied to an important tool for genome editing*2 as well. By continuing this sort of initiative, we are taking on the challenge of dealing with incurable diseases that modern medicine cannot handle.
*1 Good Manufacturing Practices. A standard for manufacturing and quality management for pharmaceuticals and other medical products.

 DIALOGUE
Welcoming ESG Investors
Hiroshi Ueda
Director & Senior Managing Executive Officer
Kunio Nozaki Ms. Shizuko Ohmi
Director & Senior Managing Amundi Japan Ltd. Executive Officer
Creating Value through ESG Management
ESG (Environment, Society, Governance) is something that long-term investors weigh heavily when measuring corporate value. We welcomed Ms. Shizuko Ohmi of Amundi Japan, whose headquarters is located in Europe, where ESG investing is expanding, and spoke with her about the current state and future of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, which is accelerating ESG management.
Sumitomo Chemical’s Way of Thinking about ESG
Nozaki I understand, Ms. Ohmi, that your company, Amundi, weights sustainability very heavily when evaluating companies. Ohmi Yes. As companies conduct business, factors such as the course of major trends around the world, and the changes made to regulations in light of those trends will impact
long-term corporate value. Whether a company can respond to a variety of situations is extremely important when thinking about future corporate value. In that sense, we consider the importance of ESG initiatives to be extremely high.
Nozaki The origin of Sumitomo Chemical is as Sumitomo Fertilizer Manufacturing, which was founded to make fertilizer from harmful gasses. For this reason, the top leadership of the company has always been committed to solving issues in society through business. Because this idea has been instilled in

  It is easy for us to accustom ourselves to
the ways of thinking found in ESG and the SDGs.
——— Kunio Nozaki
 Hiroshi Niinuma
Director & Senior Managing Executive Officer
our corporate culture, so to speak, it is easy for us to accustom ourselves to the ways of thinking found in ESG and the SDGs. Ohmi If we think about the fact that the chemical industry places a significant burden on the environment, I think there will continue to be a need for the industry to take a forward-looking position on subjects like the SDGs, as your company has done. You are actively working on these issues through such initia- tives as the Sumika Sustainable Solutions (SSS), are you not? Ueda Yes. SSS is an internal program that designates products that contribute to reducing environmental burdens, and cur- rently 44 products and technologies have been designated. Ohmi Your company recently established the Sustainability Promotion Committee, but what does this committee aim to do? Niinuma All of our divisions have been working on sustainabil- ity, but as sustainability of companies is attracting more atten- tion from the world now, this committee was established out of a need for an organization that could look over Sumitomo
Chemical as a whole. We would like it to thoroughly absorb points brought up both inside and outside the company, and to consider how future measures should be taken on a compa- ny-wide basis.
Nozaki We would also like to hold debates in the committee going forward.
Ohmi Ihopeyoudo.
The Environmental Issues and Responsibilities of the Chemical Industry
Nozaki Wehavebeenworkinghardinourownway,butfrom an investor’s perspective, what are you focusing on when you look at our company or the chemical industry?
Ohmi Lookingatthechemicalindustryfromtheenvironmen- tal side, I think that, while there are many business opportuni- ties, at the same time there is also the possibility of a significant burden. In that sense, it is also an industry in which the focus will be on environmental measures and responsible manage- ment. For example, the agricultural chemicals you deal with would generally be considered a high-risk business.
Ueda That is true, and it is for that reason that we are imple- menting a variety of initiatives in our agrochemicals business. We have Japan’s only independent organization specialized in researching the safety of agrichemicals, to properly evaluate the environmental risks of products within our own company, and then thoroughly explain those risks to society.
Ohmi Yes, I think your company is taking a very thorough approach to handling risk management. At the same time, how do things look from an even longer-term perspective? For exam- ple, looking at the E in ESG (Environment), what measures are you taking in preparation for the arrival of a low-carbon society?
 Annual Report 2018 37
 Feature

   Ueda The technologies that would enable us to achieve the targets set out in the Paris Agreement still do not exist any- where. Numerous companies and institutions are conducting a massive amount of research and development at the same time, working hard to somehow achieve an 80% reduction by 2050, and our company is among them. Our company would like its future research and development to proceed in the direction of global warming countermeasures and environ- mental measures.
Ohmi That is wonderful to hear. Right now, many companies are making long-term investments in research and develop- ment in order to preserve the planet. They will not generate returns right away, but I think that searching for solutions will ultimately generate significant value for both the planet and the companies.
Information Disclosure and Long-term Goals
Nozaki We are undertaking a variety of efforts, but looking at it from an outside perspective, where is our company falling short?
Ohmi I thoroughly understand that you are undertaking a vari- ety of efforts, but could you perhaps provide more specific and concrete transparency for them? It seems to me that you have a number of initiatives aimed at further raising outside evalua- tions of your company by more actively disclosing your efforts, such as the methods of safety management for agrochemicals mentioned earlier. Japanese companies are working on sustain- ability as a matter of course, so you might be inclined to think you do not need to specifically point it out. However, you have
I think key performance indicators relating to sustainability initiatives should be
shown in your management strategy.
——— Ms. Shizuko Ohmi
to make important information for your company public, and that is also extremely useful for outsiders like us. In particular, such information as the management of chemical substances and your future plans for handling substances of high concern are important in evaluating chemical manufacturers.
Ueda So you are saying that, even if it is obvious we are work- ing on it, if we do not provide sufficient disclosures about it, it will not be sufficiently considered in outside evaluations of us? Ohmi Exactly.
Niinuma Certainly, when we pointed out the effort we are putting into promoting the SDGs to the government, we received an SDGs award from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Until now, we had the sense that our efforts would be thor- oughly evaluated even if we kept quiet, but I understand that now active PR is important.
Ohmi Thatreallyistrue.Also,Ithinkitisnotjustaboutpubli- cizing your efforts. I think key performance indicators relating to sustainability initiatives should be shown in your management strategy. For example, if the theme of your Corporate Business Plan is “Innovation,” then if you include diversity ratios in your goals for that Corporate Business Plan, we will be able to see your company’s idea that promoting diversity will promote innovation. For intangible things like sustainability, by having indicators to review your degree of achievement fully incorpo- rated in your KPIs, it becomes easier to evaluate your company from the outside. ESG investment is taking off in Europe, but if a company does not have ways of measuring its performance when outsiders try to evaluate it, it will not lead to greater investment in the company’s shares.
Nozaki So you mean that we should both disclose our perfor- mance and have long-term goals for it, right?
Ohmi Yes, that is what I mean.

Annual Report 2018

Governance Reform for Sustained Growth
Ohmi In terms of your company’s governance, I think your Board of Directors is somewhat lacking in diversity.
Niinuma There is a female executive officer and there are non- Japanese executive officers, but as you say, we still have an issue with diversity on the Board of Directors. We are currently working hard on this point* (for details on our efforts to increase the diversity of the Board of Directors, please see pages 83-85). Ohmi I also think that there is room to improve in executive remuneration. Currently, it is quite hard to understand how the results of your company’s long-term initiatives will be reflected in executive remuneration. Do you not think it might be better to have initiatives that take sustainability indicators into account in annual remuneration?
Niinuma Thisissomethingthatwearediscussingatthisvery moment within the company. We are holding discussions in the Remuneration Advisory Committee about adding some variability to basic remuneration based on long-term indicators, as well.
Ohmi I see. Many Japanese companies are working hard to improve the environment, but when talking about governance, problems like the weakness of board oversight and their late- ness in promoting diversity stand out, and when compared with companies in countries that are advanced in ESG initia- tives, Japan is definitely falling behind. With regard to executive remuneration, as well, because of low transparency into remu- neration schemes, outside evaluations tend to be quite low. I think it is important to clearly set out the ways remuneration is tied to performance.
Niinuma Yes.Ourcompanyisnotperfect,butitseemswewill be able to take several steps forward.
Ohmi It does seem that a number of new policies will be set out going forward. I hope that you continue to work hard on the governance front, as well.
* As of the time of this conversation (May 7, 2018)
Nozaki Ihaveonceagainfelttheimportanceoftransparency. There are some ESG evaluation institutions that have given us a low rating because we are not publishing things, even though we are doing them. We will try to rectify this going forward. You have given us a number of suggestions, Ms. Ohmi, and I hope we will be able to take those suggestions and move even further forward.
Even if it is obvious we are working on it,
if we do not provide sufficient disclosures about it, it will not be sufficiently considered in
outside evaluations of us.

    Change in Business Sector Classification Methods
As of April 1, 2015, the Basic Chemicals Sector was eliminated and businesses in this sector were split and transferred to the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector and the Energy & Functional Materials Sector that was established as a new business sector. In addition, a part of businesses in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector was transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. Inorganic chemicals, raw materials for synthetic fibers, organic chemicals, and methyl methacrylate that had been included in the Basic Chemicals Sector were transferred to the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector. Alumina products, aluminum, functional materials, additives, and dyes that had also been included in the Basic Chemicals Sector were transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. In addition, synthetic rubber that had been included in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector was transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. The business sector categorization of one of the consolidated subsidiaries has been changed. For comparison, the figures for fiscal 2014 have been adjusted to reflect the organizational revision as of April 1, 2015, except for return on assets in the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, and the Health & Crop Sciences Sector.
To further strengthen the Energy & Functional Materials business, as of April 1, 2016, battery materials and engineering plastics that had been included in the IT-related Chemicals Sector were transferred to the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. For comparison, the figures for fiscal 2015 have been adjusted to reflect the organizational revision as of April 1, 2016, except for return on assets in the Energy & Functional Materials Sector, and the IT-related Chemicals Sector.

  Provide Customers with New Solutions Based on High Value-added Products
 Noriaki Takeshita
Representative Director & Senior Managing Executive Officer
Petrochemicals & Plastics
Sumitomo Chemical’s Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector manu- factures such products as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and methyl methacrylate (MMA) using the various strengths of its manufacturing locations in Japan, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia, and offers them to a wide variety of industries, including automobiles, electric appliances, and food products.
We are manufacturing cost-competitive products in Saudi Arabia, taking advantage of the low prices of raw materials and fuel in that region. At our locations in Singapore and Japan, we are developing high value-added products in anticipation of customer needs, and we also provide a stable supply of high-quality products. Our relationships of trust with core cus- tomers in the Asian market, cultivated over many years, are also a major strength of Sumitomo Chemical.
Currently, we are working to achieve stable plant operations in Saudi Arabia, and to enhance our ability to offer solutions through high value-added products in Singapore and Japan.
In fiscal 2017, stable operations continued at the Rabigh Phase I plant in Saudi Arabia, enabling us to record our highest ever profit. In addition, we completed construction on the
Rabigh Phase II Project, and began production of products. Moreover, in Singapore, we further enhanced the cost compet- itiveness of our naphtha cracker through measures including the building of new naphtha tanks.
Our greatest issue at present is getting production at the Rabigh Phase II Project on track as soon as possible to mobilize its initially planned capabilities. We aim to quickly transfer to Saudi Arabia the technology we have previously developed in order to achieve stable plant operations. Moreover, in Singapore and Japan, we are continuing to put effort into developing high value-added applications for polyolefin, while in Japan we are enhancing our licensing business. In addition, we aim to improve the competitiveness of our naphtha cracker in Singapore by revamping equipment.
Going forward, Sumitomo Chemical will not only continue to enhance our strengths in these three locations, but will also aim to consistently achieve a return on assets in excess of our cost of capital by working to streamline assets, including work- ing capital.

  Contribute to Solving
Environmental and Energy Issues through the Revolutionary Technologies Resulting from a Long-term Perspective Research and Development
 Keiichi Iwata
Representative Director & Senior Managing Executive Officer
Energy & Functional Materials
The Energy & Functional Materials Sector was created in 2015 by integrating related businesses that had been spread across multiple business units within Sumitomo Chemical, with the goal of developing and strengthening businesses in the fields of the environment and energy. The goal of this sector is to contribute to solving global environmental and energy prob- lems through the revolutionary technologies resulting from a long-term perspective on research and development.
A major core competency of this sector is its global business development capability, as proved by high-purity alumina and resorcinol, our products that hold the top global market share, but also by our separators for lithium-ion secondary batteries, which offer world-class heat resistance. The above products are also results of our other core competencies: our research and development capabilities as well as our evaluation, manufactur- ing, and process technologies.
This sector’s medium-term strategy is to continue to expend every effort of investing its management resources particularly in those fields in which Sumitomo Chemical can offer compara- tive advantages technologically, and where the growth of those businesses can be expected. At the same time, we are working to restructure businesses that have become unprofitable.
In fiscal 2015, this sector’s first year of existence, an operating loss was posted, but through initiatives aimed at improving income across each of manufacturing, sales, and research, particularly increasing sales of super engineering plastics and resorcinol, we recorded core operating income of 19.2 billion yen in fiscal 2017. The sector is conducting a phased increase of production capacity in the heat-resistant battery separator materials plant built in South Korea in 2016. On the other hand, the sector also conducted a business triage, which for example led to exiting the diesel particulate filter business.
By focusing management resources on new research and development in the fields where Sumitomo Chemical has comparative advantages, and where long-term growth can be expected, we will actively work to develop the core businesses of this sector. In addition, to reliably record profits we are continuing our efforts to improve the earnings capacity for all businesses. Moreover, in our efforts to develop core businesses from a medium to long-term perspective, we aim to promote the development of our CO2 separation membrane business, which is a promising technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, one of the global issues.

Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma
Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. is
working to realize its vision of “Aspire to
be a globally active R&D-based company”
and “Contribute to medical care through
leading-edge technologies,” while
advancing initiatives aimed at medium- to long-term business growth, and always looking one step ahead of the times.
In its development of new drugs, which is a driver of business growth, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma aims to contin- ually create outstanding new drugs, conducting research and development activities incorporating cutting-edge technology with a number of methods, including not only its own internal research in focus areas with unmet medical needs, such as psychiatry & neurology, oncology, and regenerative medicine and cell therapy, but also the introduction of technology from other companies and joint research with biotech companies and academia.
In April 2018, the company was able to launch LONHALA® MAGNAIR® in the US market, a treatment for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) administered using a portable nebulizer. In addition, new drug applications in the US have also been submitted for dasotraline (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)), and APL-130277 (OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease), for which significant sales are expected, and the company hopes to receive approval for both during fiscal 2018.
Furthermore, the company is also developing anticancer drugs napabucasin and amcasertib, which were added to the company’s development pipeline by the 2012 acquisition of Boston Biomedical, Inc. Because napabucasin and amcasertib are designed to inhibit cancer stemness pathways, they may provide a new therapeutic option against the challenges in cancer treatment, such as treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis.
In its efforts to utilize cutting-edge technology, the com- pany is applying iPS cell technology to drug discovery, while also working on research and development of regenerative medicine and cell therapy. In the US, it is working with SanBio, Inc. to conduct a Phase IIb clinical trial of a cell therapy product

In addition to diagnostic pharmaceuticals, NMP also offers therapeutic products, such as a medical device for brachytherapy for prostate cancer, and a radiopharmaceutical that provides pain relief for cancer patients suffering from bone metastasis.
The Company’s main product is FDG scan Injectable for PET (positron emission tomography) procedures, which are
Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry
effective in the early detection of malignant tumors. Because the half-life of the radioisotope (18F) used in this product lasts for an extremely short time of about two hours, NMP has established production facilities in major regions across Japan in order to ensure swift and reliable delivery to various medical institutions after manufacturing. In March 2018, the eleventh manufacturing facility for PET products was completed in Toyama prefecture.
In November 2017, NMP began sales of Vizamyl®, an imaging agent used in amyloid PET scans. An amyloid PET scan can eval- uate the possibility of Alzheimer’s as a cause of dementia, and thus it is expected to contribute to the diagnosis of dementia.
In addition, when the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) was accepting projects under its Cyclic Innovation for Clinical Empowerment (CiCLE) program, one of the research topics adopted for support was the devel- opment of diagnostic agents using the Theranostics concept. As part of this research topic, NMP will not only prepare a drug discovery facility to put into practice the Theranostics concept, which aims to bring together diagnostics and therapeutics, it will also develop antibody-labeled therapeutic drugs as well as their companion diagnostics. This is expected to contribute to efficient and effective cancer treatment.
As a leading company in the field of nuclear medicine, NMP will continue to work to develop new diagnostic pharmaceuticals.

Promoting a Deepening of Global Management from the Perspective of Human Resources Initiatives and Talent Development
Based on our Corporate Business Plan, with the slogan “Change and Innovation— Create New Value,” Sumitomo Chemical’s basic human resource (HR) policy is to encourage employees to grow through carrying out rewarding and worthwhile day- to-day duties and bring about the sustainable growth of the Sumitomo Chemical Group as a strong global chemical company through their individual growth.
In order to achieve this, we are continuing to create environments and organiza- tions that make it easy for employees to work. We are also promoting a deepening of global management from an HR perspective by enhancing various measures to secure, develop, and encourage the active participation of talents at global level, in order to develop our business while creating new value.
Due to the current technological revolution and the advance of globalization, Sumitomo Chemical’s business management has become more and more complex and sophisticated. For that reason, placing greater weight on “people,” and increasing their abilities, is the key to sustained growth for the Sumitomo Chemical Group. The HR system of Sumitomo Chemical was revised in 2017, as the company decided to design the system from the perspective of how to best encourage the development and growth of its personnel. In addition, in light of the fact that ways of thinking about careers are becoming increasingly diverse, the company is deploying systems throughout the organization to contribute to increasing employee motivation. We are including making it possible to better evaluate employees with high-level expertise, and providing detailed support for each individual’s motivation and apti-
tude, instead of the sort of mass management used previously.
We will not only work to appropriately operate this system in accordance with its purpose, we will continue our efforts to promote the growth and development of personnel, including implementing revisions to our training system intended to develop leadership and
strengthen management in this time of intense change.
 Sumitomo Chemical’s HR System
Sumitomo Chemical has implemented an HR system oriented toward duties and results, in which the treatment of each employee is based on the details of the role they fulfill, the size of their responsibilities, and the results they achieve. In order to treat employees appropriately based on their jobs in this way, we have established a system that enables employees with motivation and ability to take on the challenge of higher-level roles as soon as possible. Furthermore, this system responds to employees’ self-motivated desire to improve and grow.
In addition, our annual evaluations not only evaluate to
what degree individual employees were able to fulfill the expectations of their position or role, but also evaluate them in terms of the degree to which they employ the knowledge and skills required for the role they are responsible for, and the degree to which they employ their capabilities to generate results. Through this evaluation process, we have adopted a system that can promote the development and growth of each individual, without being biased toward short-term results.
The Sumitomo Chemical Group will continue to promote the growth of employees, whether inside or outside Japan, through a mindset of cultivation, working to create an environ- ment where each employee can actively succeed.

Promoting Responsible Care Activities Rooted in Local Communities
At Sumitomo Chemical, policies and targets relating to Responsible Care are shared across the entire Group, in an effort not only to establish and maintain safe and sta- ble operations, which is a part of the basic policy for the Corporate Business Plan, but also in an effort to ensure safety, environmental friendliness, and health throughout the lifecycle of products, and to maintain and improve the quality of the chemical products and services we deliver.
Currently, we have positioned dedicated Responsible Care personnel at regional headquarters in Europe, the Americas, China, and the wider Asia-Pacific region. This has enabled us to develop Responsible Care activities rooted in each region. Since 2016, we have set Safety Ground Rules for the entire Group as a measure to ensure safety across all Group workplaces, and notified all Group employees of them, in order to eliminate labor accidents and improve safety activities. Furthermore, we strive to ensure safety and protect the environment in these regions, and explain these efforts to our neighbors, working to deepen mutual understanding through dialogue.
As global-scale issues pile up, including the response to climate change, the creation of a circular economy, and considerations for biodiversity, we, as people engaged in the chemical industry, duly regard the society’s trust in us as the starting point to continue our business. We also believe that it is the chemical industry that can deliver solutions to these issues. In order to secure the license to operate from our customers, our neighbors, and our employees, we will continue to promote Responsible Care activities throughout the Group.
  Occupational Safety and Health, Industrial Safety and Disaster Prevention
Initiatives to Ensure Safety at All Group Workplaces
The Sumitomo Chemical Group aims to achieve zero labor accidents across all workplaces through safety measures. Moreover, in order to ensure safety and peace of mind for the local community, we are conducting thoroughgoing voluntary safety management. Specifically, in order to minimize the risk of damage when a natural disaster occurs, such as a large-scale earthquake, we are periodically refurbishing facilities and build- ings to ensure earthquake resistance. We also aim to minimize safety risks by focusing not just on the risks hidden in regular operations, but also on risks in non-typical operations, such as when a plant undergoes an emergency stop or when it is restarted after being stopped.

  Environmental Protection and Addressing Global Climate Change
Toward the Creation of a Sustainable Society
Sumitomo Chemical and its major Group companies have set common goals for environmental activities, endeavoring to reduce the environmental burden of the Group as a whole. In particular, as a response to climate change, the Sumitomo Chemical Group has announced that it will set goals in accordance with the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative, which aims to help companies set goals to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions that conform to the 2°C goal set by the Paris Agreement, and the Group has already begun working to meet those goals. Specifically, we have begun reviewing systems to promote energy-saving investments, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at each plant. Moreover, starting in fiscal 2017, the Sumitomo Chemical Group began disclosing data that complies with the GHG Protocol, an international standard for greenhouse gas emission disclosure. Going forward, we will further enhance coordination between units such as plants, research facilities, and production technology departments, in an effort to accelerate technological innovations that promote reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, as it is a precious resource, we are working to reduce the amount of water we use, through effective utilization depending on the application.
Product Stewardship, Product Responsibility, and Quality Assurance
For the Safety and Peace of Mind of Our Customers
The Sumitomo Chemical Group estimates the degree of impact our chemical products have in terms of safety on people and the environment throughout their lifecycle, and promotes activities to protect people’s health and the environment based on those risks. As part of its Eco First Commitments, Sumitomo Chemical is currently reassessing that the products it sells are of sufficient quality so that customers can use them safely, and publishing the results as safety summaries*. Going forward, Group companies will periodically conduct similar reviews for the products they sell, disclosing such information from a global perspective. In order to be able to deliver products and services of a quality that customers around the world can use safely, we will not only ensure that day-to-day management is conducted thoroughly, we will also continue to work to improve our products and services.

Executive Officer
Fulfilling Our Accountability to Shareholders so that an Accurate Understanding of the Company is Properly Reflected in the Stock Price and
Higher Corporate Value
The basic policy guiding Sumitomo Chemical’s IR activities is to provide planned, effective, and strategic communications with shareholders and other investors regarding our management policies, business strategies, and performance trends, so as to fulfill our accountability to shareholders and maintain and raise market con- fidence, while endeavoring to convey an accurate understanding of the Company that will be reflected properly in the stock price and in higher corporate value.
Based on this basic policy, the president gives management strategy briefings to investors twice a year, while sector heads give a business strategy briefing to inves- tors once yearly. In addition, the president and I, as the executive officer in charge of IR, periodically visit major shareholders and have an active dialogue with them. Moreover, since fiscal 2016 we have arranged opportunities for directors who are in charge of a sector or head-office function to meet with investors and analysts and directly exchange views. By making this effort, we seek to have our shareholders develop a deeper understanding of Sumitomo Chemical.
Furthermore, recently we have begun receiving many questions and comments about our ESG initiatives. In light of this, we are now working to ensure an even more complete disclosure of ESG information on our website and in this Annual Report. We are also working to appropriately communicate both financial and non-financial information in other IR materials, such as the Investors’ Handbook.

Research and Development / Intellectual Property
Research and Development
Sumitomo Chemical has established six core technologies by enhancing the technologies accumulated through a broad range of research activities over many years: Catalyst Design, Precision Processing, Organic & Polymer Material Function Design, Inorganic Material Function Design, Device Design, and Biological Mechanism Analysis. Sumitomo Chemical’s fun- damental R&D strategy is to produce innovative technologies and products and create value by combining these core tech- nologies and by merging technologies inside and outside the Company through open innovation, a process we call Creative Hybrid Chemistry.
Based on its forecasts of the business environment and the economy over the medium- to long-term, we have set the fields of the environment and energy, ICT, and life sciences as areas where our company can utilize its competitive strengths, and where we can expect high growth. In addition, we believe that the cross-over areas where two or more of these three fields meet are areas where we can employ our strengths as a diversified chemical manufacturer. For this reason, we are focusing the allocation of management resources on these three areas and their cross-over areas.
Going forward, we will work to develop next-generation businesses, making maximum use of the creative possibilities of chemistry.
Intellectual Property
Sumitomo Chemical’s intellectual property (IP) activities are aimed at contributing to the creation, maintenance, and increase of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s business value, through unified efforts by its business sectors, research labora- tories, and the IP Department.
Utilizing AI technologies such as concept searches and text mining in the field of IP search and analysis, we have been improving work efficiency at the IP Department and R&D organizations.
While respecting the valid patents of third parties, we endeavor to promote our businesses strategically by acquir- ing and protecting “wider, stronger, faster-registered and longer-lasting” patents for the results of our research and technology development. We also endeavor to build a network of patents, not only in Japan, but also in Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, and Africa. In addition, we will continue to maximize the Company’s business value by effec- tively utilizing the patents so obtained for the businesses of Sumitomo Chemical and Group companies and further in the third-party licenses.

    DIALOGUE
Management by Phase
Under the previous Corporate Business Plan, we strove hard, with an unwavering resolve, to improve the Company’s financial strength.
Ito Sumitomo Chemical’s Corporate Business Plan represents what can be called “Management by Phase,” making extremely clear what the Company seeks to accomplish during the plan period. In the previous Corporate Business Plan (fiscal 2013 to 2015), it was very clear to me that Sumitomo Chemical was determined to reduce interest-bearing debt and generate greater free cash flow, and you made decisions toward this goal. Tokura At that time, we had a strong sense of crisis. The global financial crisis occurred just after we had taken three major stra- tegic actions, each requiring large-scale investments—first, the Rabigh Project, an undertaking intended to drastically enhance the competitiveness of our petrochemicals business; second, the launch of Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma and several major acquisitions in order to secure a critical mass in the life sciences business; and third, the establishment and expansion of the IT-related Chemicals Sector, an effort to develop new businesses that would become the Company’s central pillars in the future. As a result, our financial strength rapidly declined. We became aware that if we failed to make a turnaround and
rebuild strong business foundations without delay, we would have no future. We worked to improve our financial strength with unwavering determination, taking all possible measures, from reducing working capital to more rigorously assessing investment opportunities. We built up truly small initiatives, one by one, all across the Company. When we saw our D/E ratio halved—from a peak of 1.4 to 0.7—through these efforts, we were relieved.
Ito Under the current Corporate Business Plan (fiscal 2016 to 2018), launched following these positive results, you have shifted to a more aggressive strategy.
Tokura The current Corporate Business Plan is phase two of our commitment to ‘Change and Innovation.’ Our strategy is that having enhanced our financial strength in phase one (fiscal 2013 to 2015), we will further improve our business portfolio in phase two, which in turn will lead to phase 3, beginning next fiscal year, and beyond.
Ito I think it is very fitting for Sumitomo Chemical to adopt a strategy of identifying areas where you have competitive advantage and focusing your resources on these fields. Tokura We have made it clear that, rather than compete by going after scale, we will focus on areas where we can compete with technology, as well as marketing capability. Over the most recent three years, about 75% of our investment has gone to the specialty chemicals businesses.

 Governance Dialogue
Evolution of Our Corporate Governance that Supports Sustained Growth and
the Improvement of Corporate Value
Masakazu Tokura
Representative Director & President

 Sumitomo Chemical has established robust operations globally in the bulk chemicals field,
while also achieving strong growth in the specialty chemicals area, and is progressing steadily on the road to becoming a resilient company that is able
to continue sustained growth. Since the previous Corporate Business Plan, which provided the foun- dations for this significant performance, Dr. Kunio Ito* has kept a close eye on the Company’s strategy and the evolution of its corporate governance as a member of the Board of Directors. He spoke with Mr. Masakazu Tokura, President of Sumitomo Chemical, about corporate governance.
* Dr. Ito served as Outside Director of Sumitomo Chemical’s Board for six years after his appointment in 2012, and retired in June 2018.
Kunio Ito
Outside Director
    In the current Corporate Business Plan, we have achieved both a high income level and further improvement in our business portfolio.
Ito As part of your policy of ‘Change and Innovation,’ carried on from the previous Corporate Business Plan, you clearly express your commitment to contributing to the resolution of societal issues in the current Corporate Business Plan as well.
Tokura You have been promoting the concept of ROESG*1. We feel that that idea of pursuing both profits and ESG is in keeping with the way we do business. The Sumitomo business philosophy—our business must not just benefit Sumitomo, but also the nation, society and the local communities where we operate—has taken root within Sumitomo Chemical. Our products provide solutions to issues in society, as those of the Energy & Functional Materials Sector help solve problems related to the environment, resources and energy, those of the Health & Crop Sciences Sector food problems, and those of the Pharmaceuticals Sector people’s health. By using the power of chemistry, we strive to contribute to resolving issues facing human society and bettering people’s lives. In this way, we hope to help build a sustainable society through our business activities, and thereby continue to grow in a sustainable way. Ito I believe that Sumitomo Chemical is a company that
embodies ESG management to the core. Moreover, you are running your business in such a way that you increase capital productivity while also pursuing ESG management and the SDGs. The Energy & Functional Materials Sector*2, created by carving out related products and technologies from the IT-related Chemicals Sector and the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector, has grown significantly in just two and a half years, and the Company’s business portfolio has remarkably improved. Tokura We have a very well balanced portfolio in place, with one-third of our core operating income coming from bulk chemicals (Petrochemicals & Plastics) and two-thirds from spe- cialty chemicals in the fiscal year that ended March 2018. While the tightened petrochemical supply and demand in Asia was a major contributing factor, the most noteworthy factor is that after 10 years of unremitting effort, we have finally achieved a high-rate operation at the Petro Rabigh plant.
Ito That is all the more heartening to me because as a member of the Board I saw for myself the Rabigh Project going through a difficult period. You have dramatically increased your ability to generate cash flow and income over the last five years, to the point where ROE is over 15% and ROI is over 7%. I think there are only a very few companies that have changed this much. These last five years, I have been greatly impressed by Sumitomo Chemical’s ability to get things done.
 *1 A concept that does not see ROE and ESG as something opposing each other, but as ideas that are both important and should be pursued. Promoted by Professor Kunio Ito. *2 Please see “Change in Business Sector Classification Methods” on page 41.

 Evolution in ESG Management
Continuing to improve governance, making full use of the insights of Outside Directors
Ito Sumitomo Chemical’s governance is steadily getting better in a number of ways. A case in point is the initiative of addressing issues that emerge in the assessment of the effec- tiveness of the Board of Directors. After the Company conducts a survey evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, discussions are held on the results of the survey, and naturally, in those discussions, some specific issues are brought up that need to be addressed from the perspective of corporate gover- nance. Sumitomo Chemical never leaves them there; it follows through and takes action for improvement by the next year. That sort of sincere attitude and the accumulation of actions over time have caused the Company’s governance to evolve to where it is now.
Tokura I do not think of governance as just a system. Together with internal controls, we must deliver results through gover- nance. To that end, we should take full advantage of a Board that has Outside Directors, because they can provide valuable, eye-opening insights from on high, from a different angle.
Ito How transparent can a company be, for example, when sharing information about an M&A project it is considering at a Board of Directors meeting where Outside Directors are pres- ent? I think the answer to this question tells you much about the Company’s policy. In this respect, Sumitomo Chemical is extremely prompt in providing information, and is also very candid. Depending on circumstances, as much as several months before submitting an item to the Board for delibera- tion, explanations are provided in the form of “spot reports.” I
am sure that explaining an M&A project, which involves a body of insider information, to the Board members several months in advance requires a certain bravery, but I never felt an atti- tude in this company that said “we don’t have to disclose this information.”
Tokura I think that if a company really wants to put corporate governance into practice in management and develop it into a competitive advantage, it should pursue that level of trans- parency. Otherwise, the effort won’t pay off. If you want the insights of Outside Directors, it is essential that you share with them information necessary for discussion and deliberation as soon as possible. I am promoting this way of thinking through- out the Company.
Ito Another thing that I always considered impressive is that at Board of Directors meetings, you help communicate to Internal Directors what Outside Directors want to convey as well as the background of their comments, by saying, for example, “What the Outside Director meant to say is this,” or, “It is a kind of encouragement. He has made that comment because he wants it to succeed.” I have rarely seen this kind of thing at other companies. When we make suggestions, we have some reason for saying so. I think it is very important that you as President translate it for people within the Company.
Tokura Within the Company, we have no opportunities to see ourselves from a place a little bit further away. As a result, with- out knowing it, we have become a very homogenous group of people. But we have to remember that we are part of society. If we cannot take true care of the interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders and earn their understanding, in the long run we will end up unable to continue as a company.
Ito That is corporate governance in the original sense of the term.
  78
Annual Report 2018

Tokura Yes. That is why I am extremely grateful for Outside Directors’ suggestions. They push us forward by telling us to take more risk and be truly aggressive when we have decided to be aggressive. They also suggest that we should not hesitate to take a step back when a problem arises after we have made a commitment. Or regarding a project we are considering, they ask us if we have carefully studied critical issues, while calling for timely reporting. Meanwhile, because our Outside Directors have their own specialized fields, from time to time their comments about our business sound so general that some of our officers or employees do not understand exactly what the Outside Directors are trying to bring home to them. For that reason, I would very much like to somehow convey the full meaning of the Outside Directors’ messages to those at the Company—I am not making special efforts, but sometimes I think there is something I can add.
Ito At this year’s Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, a certain shareholder asked about Sumitomo Chemical’s cor- porate governance, and I answered with confidence that the Company’s corporate governance has improved remarkably over the last few years. It is no exaggeration to call the changes remarkable.
Tokura I am very grateful to you for the comment. Of course, there is no end to improvement in governance. We will con- tinue to work to make further progress, even in small steps.
Sumitomo Chemical’s Future
Aiming to be a company seen as having a conglomerate premium
Ito “Creative hybrid chemistry” is an appropriate basic strategy for this company. In order to continue implementing it, I think that human resource development will become more and more important. Sumitomo Chemical has many employees who have expertise in specialized areas. In order to create something new by combining technology and expertise from different types of businesses, however, it will be necessary to develop “producer-type” personnel, people who have a broader perspective and can help make new things happen. Tokura I think that is absolutely true. We need to develop personnel who are open-minded, always paying attention to changes and new things beyond their own specialized fields. Ito The capital market tends to value those companies operat- ing a variety of businesses, as Sumitomo Chemical does under the strategy of “hybrid chemistry,” at a conglomerate discount. But you have successfully improved your business portfolio, and have delivered results. I do hope that Sumitomo Chemical will become a company that is valued at a premium, not at a discount.
Tokura Going forward, solutions to issues facing society will involve not just isolated businesses or products, but combi- nations of many different things. That is exactly what creative hybrid chemistry tries to achieve, and that is what innovation is about. And I believe that is an area where we can display our unique strengths. In the next Corporate Business Plan, we would like to aim to become a company that is valued at a conglomerate premium. Thank you very much for being with me today.

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Initiatives
Sumitomo Chemical has been committed to continual efforts to improve corporate governance. In response to demands for further raising the governance level, including application of the Corporate Governance Code, we are taking measures to achieve the optimal governing structure and decision-making processes, while remaining faithful to the intent and spirit of the Code.
Basic Stance
Sumitomo Chemical cherishes deeply the Sumitomo Spirit which has been passed down through generations over nearly 400 years, the basic teaching of which is, among others, not to seek its own interests alone, but to contribute to society through its business activities. In accord with this business credo, the Company strives to take on challenges constantly of creating new value by capitalizing on its proprietary technolo- gies toward achieving the Company’s sustained growth while at the same time cultivating corporate culture full of vigor and growing as a company that earns trust from the public at large. Recognizing that highly effective corporate governance is vital to attaining these ends, the Company keeps working to further enhance its corporate governance in accordance with the fol- lowing policies and principles, centering particularly on closer cooperation with shareholders and various other stakeholders, faster decision-making, proper oversight of business execution, enhanced systems of compliance and internal control, and active dialog with stakeholders.
Measures to Date for Strengthening Corporate Governance
Sumitomo Chemical not only shall respect the rights of share- holders, but shall endeavor to provide an environment where shareholders can exercise their rights smoothly and also to ensure the effectively equal treatment of shareholders.
Recognizing that cooperation with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, business partners, creditors, and local communities, is essential to sustained growth, Sumitomo Chemical shall proactively work to fulfill its corporate social responsibility and strive to cultivate corporate culture of a company that can be trusted by society.
As part of efforts to build a foundation for constructive dialog with stakeholders, Sumitomo Chemical shall endeavor to provide information that is highly reliable and useful to recipients. Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors shall fulfill its role and mission properly, based on their fiduciary responsibilities and accountability to shareholders and recognizing the important role of Independent Outside Directors & Auditors, through such mea- sures as presenting appropriate corporate management policies and business strategies that have taken into account changing socioeconomic conditions, and conducting highly effective over- sight over the execution of business.
Sumitomo Chemical shall endeavor to promote constructive dialog with shareholders with the aim of seeking to attain the Company’s sustained growth and to enhance corporate value in the medium to long term.
Sumitomo Chemical has prepared Corporate Governance Guidelines, in accordance with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code. These Guidelines can be viewed on Sumitomo Chemical’s website.

Recent Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate Governance
Further Strengthening of the Board of Directors’ Oversight and Advisory Functions With the goal of further strengthening the Board of Directors’ oversight and advisory functions to increase the transparency and objectivity of management, in June 2018 we added one outside director, increasing the total number to four (including one female director). As a result, of the eighteen total members of the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors, seven are outside members. Outside directors have experience in a wide range of fields, including corporate management, eco- nomics, government, the legal profession, and accounting, and we leverage these perspectives to further revitalize the Board.
scope of decision-making delegated to Executive Officers with the aim of accelerating business execution. At board meetings, reporting by Executive Officers on the status of business execution has been enhanced, and three types of reports are defined based on the contents, with meaningful discussions taking place that contribute to sustainable growth and timely and decisive decision-making. The time required for board meetings has increased by three times since these changes have been implemented.
Changes in the Operation of
the General Meeting of Shareholders
To further promote a dialogue with shareholders, starting from the General Meeting of Shareholders held in June 2017, the way the meeting is administered have been changed, including relocation of the meeting place to a more convenient outside venue, as well as providing explanations and answers to questions that are more thorough and easier to understand. Attendees to the General Meeting of Shareholders held in June 2017 increased by three times compared to the previous year, and many shareholders were active in asking questions and making comments. In response, representatives of the company provided thorough explanations, leading to a further revitalization of the General Meeting of Shareholders.
Use of Outside Director Functions
To make maximum use of the oversight and advisory functions of the outside directors, it is essential to minimize asymmetries in information between internal directors and outside directors. The measures including those listed below have been imple- mented to revitalize board deliberation.

    Visits to production sites
   Outside directors gather together in advance of Board of Directors meetings to receive a detailed briefing from the relevant departments, along with a Q&A session, on issues to be discussed at the Board of Directors meeting.
Supplemental information is provided on issues raised in internal meetings, such as on the launch of a business or an acquisition.
Important matters, such as management direction, M&A transactions, or large-scale projects, are reported to the Board of Directors at an early stage of consideration so that the board’s intentions can be reflected.
Based on such materials as the survey result on the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, meetings consisting primarily of outside directors are held to enable a frank exchange of views.
Visits are made to our production sites both inside and outside Japan (twice a year).

Assessing the Effectiveness of
the Board of Directors
Assessment Method
Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors carries out analyses and appraisals regarding the effectiveness of the Board of Directors through an exchange of opinions at meetings attended by Outside Directors, Outside Corporate Auditors, the Chairman, and the President, as well as at Management Meetings attended by internal directors, while taking into account survey result from all Directors and Corporate Auditors and opinions expressed by the Board of Corporate Auditors. In addition, based on these opinions, every year the Board of Directors makes an overall review of the appraised effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
Assessment for Fiscal 2017 and
Improvements over the Previous Fiscal Year
The effectiveness of the Board of Directors is assessed from a variety of perspectives, including its composition, operation, and deliberations and reporting at the Board of Directors meet- ings, as well as its oversight of business execution. With thor- ough management of board meetings leading to questions and answers based on active discussions, at the end of fiscal 2017 Sumitomo Chemical confirmed steady improvements, including the initiatives listed below, and further advances in the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
Improvement Initiatives
Toward the Future
From the perspective of further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, a few matters to be improved have been identified. One is to further improve governance though multi- faceted reports on Group companies inside and outside Japan, including qualitative assessments of their internal control and responsible care initiatives, in addition to their business perfor- mance. Another is to have deeper discussions of the long-term strategy of the company as a whole. Yet another is to have detailed reports to the Board of Directors about background and the process regarding what has being discussed actively in internal meeting, thereby eliminating the asymmetries in infor- mation between internal and outside directors, and leading to further improvements in the deliberations and oversight by the Board of Directors.
  Visit to Production Sites by Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors
In order for Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors to improve their understanding of our business, Sumitomo Chemical provide them with opportunities to visit our production sites both inside and outside Japan each year. In fiscal 2017, they visited the Oita Works and a Group company in South Korea. They have expressed the opinion that this initiative is extremely valuable, enabling them to get a deeper understanding of our business.

  Messages from Newly Appointed Outside Directors and Corporate Auditor
We received the following messages from Sumitomo Chemical’s new outside directors and corporate auditor, who were appointed in June 2018.
 I will Provide a Perspective on Macroeconomic Issues and Global Trends.
My research has been on theories and policies in international economics. My impression is that Sumitomo Chemical is very resolutely taking on the challenges of global markets, with its petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia and its production of separators in South Korea, for example. Based on my personal experience, I would like to provide my perspective on macroeconomic issues and global trends, which are areas that are difficult to grasp when one is working on the actual front lines of business. Aside from the Board of Directors meetings, my understanding is that I will have opportunities to participate in visits to production sites and meetings with Executive Officers. In addition to my full intention of making discussions at the Board of Directors meetings more active, I would like to take a variety of opportunities to have repeated discussions about the company’s medium- to long-term vision.
In addition, I am interested in AI and IoT technologies, which are making striking progress recently. I expect these technologies to have an even more significant impact on corporate management and consumer behavior in the future. There is a need to think very carefully about how corporations should leverage these technologies in their business activities, and about how to generate added value by combining functions that can be replaced by AI and IoT with functions that cannot be performed by IT. I would also like to have discussions about the pace of technological innovation and the direction of the changes it generates.
Motoshige Itoh
Outside Director
   I will Actively Work on Promoting Diversity.
At the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, I worked on creating a society in which all people, including women and people with disabilities, can actively participate. In working to create such a society, corporations need to focus on providing opportunities that enable all kinds of employees to use the full extent of their capabilities. I understand that Sumitomo Chemical is also placing a lot of effort into promoting diversity. The promotion of diversity is not something that will advance on its own. Rather, it requires constant effort, step by step. As an outside director, I would like to actively work to address this issue.
Up until now, many of Sumitomo Chemical’s outside directors have been people with a background in business management, and I think I may be the first one whose experience is from a government agency. As someone with a different background, I want to actively express my opinions for constructive discussions at the Board of Directors meetings. Even beyond the meetings, I would like to examine the company’s business from a variety of perspectives. As part of these activities, in 2019 there are plans to visit Petro Rabigh’s complex in Saudi Arabia. Because it is a country that places restrictions on the advancement of women, I thought such a visit might be difficult, so I am very happy to have such a precious opportunity. It is an important complex for understanding Sumitomo Chemical’s business, and I am looking forward to it.
Atsuko Muraki
Outside Director
   I will Contribute to Enhancing Governance by Frankly Expressing My Opinions.
I am someone who has spent a long time in finance, such as at the Bank of Japan and securities exchanges. I understand that Sumitomo Chemical got its start by manufacturing fertilizers from sulfur dioxide emitted from smelting operations, aiming to solve smoke pollution caused by the emissions. Using innovation to solve an environmental problem, this approach, I feel, has been continually passed down to the present as Sumitomo Chemical’s DNA. I also have the impression that Sumitomo Chemical is very actively engaged in ESG initiatives, which have been attracting considerable attention in recent years, and this is an area that is significantly impacted by the company’s DNA.
As evidenced by the June 2018 reforms to Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, corporations in Japan are facing demands for enhanced governance. Of course, I think that corporate governance structures are being put in place. The goal of enhanced governance, however, is not to put structures into place. Rather, it is a method to enhance corporate value and achieve sustainable growth. I think we are just now entering the stage of actual improvements to ensure the proper functioning of governance in a variety of business activities. As an outside corporate auditor, I will work to contribute to enhancing governance by frankly expressing my opinions.

1 Board of Directors
The Sumitomo Chemical Board of Directors decides important matters concerning the Company’s management, including management policy and business strategies, in accordance with the law, the Articles of Incorporation, and Board of Directors regulations. It also receives reports from Directors and others on the performance of duties, financial situation, and operating results, and oversees the performance of duties by each Director.
The Board currently consists of 13 Directors, four of whom are independent outside directors having no conflict of interest with general shareholders. The term of office of Directors is one year, in order to make the administrative organization respon- sive to changes in the business environment and to establish clear administrative responsibility and roles of Directors.
Board of Directors meetings are held monthly as a rule, with special meetings convened as needed. To ensure the effective- ness of the Board of Directors, assessments and analyses are conducted annually and the follow-up to the results is done.
2 Board of Corporate Auditors
We have a Corporate Auditor System, with a Board of Corporate Auditors consisting of five Corporate Auditors including three outside corporate auditors.
The Corporate Auditors and the Board of Corporate Auditors play a vital role in our corporate governance, by auditing the performance of duties by Directors in accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation. The Board of Corporate Auditors meets once a month as a rule.

Auditors. In conducting their audits, they receive reports and explanations as needed from the Internal Control & Audit Department, operating divisions, and accounting auditors. In addition, Standing Corporate Auditors attend meetings of the Internal Control Committee and other important company meetings.
The results of audits and the objective views of outside auditors are appropriately reflected in internal audits, corporate auditors’ audits, and accounting audits, so as to raise the effec- tiveness and efficiency of auditing.
The Corporate Auditors’ Office has been established with staff dedicated to providing assistance in auditing functions under the direction of Corporate Auditors.
Management Organizations for Decision-making, Execution, and Auditing
3 Executive Officers
We have appointed Executive Officers to expedite the implementation of business operations. Executive Officers are responsible for carrying out operations in accordance with the policies adopted by the Board of Directors. We have 35 Executive Officers, with eight acting in dual capacity as Directors. The Executive Officers are 32 Japanese and three non-Japanese, consisting of 34 males and one female. The term of office for Executive Officers is one year.
4 Management Meeting
The Management Meeting supports the decision-making of our management by providing a forum for deliberation on such vital matters as corporate strategy and capital investment, including matters to be deliberated in the Board of Directors for discussion and reports to be made to the Board. The

5 Committees
We enhance its business activities and oversight functions by establishing internal meetings (committees) to deliberate on important matters concerning the management of the Company, and the Group from broad and diverse viewpoints. Of these committees, the Internal Control Committee, the Compliance Committee, and the Responsible Care Committee and others are attended by Directors and others, as well as the Standing Corporate Auditor, who serves as an observer. In 2018, we established a new Sustainability Promotion Committee, which is an enhanced iteration of its former CSR Promotion Committee, to strengthen its ESG initiatives.
remuneration levels, and other related matters. The committee is made up of outside directors and Sumitomo Chemical representative directors. It holds regular meetings annually and convenes ad hoc meetings as needed. With a majority of mem- bers being outside directors, the committee advises the Board of Directors in deciding the officer remuneration system and levels, in order to achieve greater transparency, fairness, and openness.
Remuneration System
Remuneration for Directors consists of basic remuneration and bonuses. Basic remuneration is designed to serve as an incentive for the actions of Directors to contribute to the company’s sustainable growth, rather than short-term effects or half-measures. Accordingly, in addition to a fixed remuneration assigned to each person’s rank, every year, from a compre- hensive and medium-to-long term perspective, including the company’s size, earnings capacity, and outside evaluations, if a determination is made that the position of Sumitomo Chemical has changed, it will be reflected in the remuneration amount. Bonuses are paid to heighten incentive to meet the business plans for each year, with the amount being determined based on consolidated performance for the fiscal year.
Remuneration Levels
Remuneration for Directors and Corporate Auditors is set at levels that, in addition to taking into consideration such factors as the scale and content of Sumitomo Chemical’s business, are designed to be objectively competitive to attract and retain outstanding talent. In addition, based on surveys by outside third party institutions and other materials, each year those levels are checked to determine whether they are objectively appropriate. With regard to basic remuneration, in accordance with the remuneration system described above, levels are changed if Sumitomo Chemical’s position is higher or lower than it previously had been. With regard to bonuses, bonuses are paid if performance for that fiscal year exceeds a particular level, with the amount of the bonuses designed to be highly correlated with business performance.

 Message from the Managing Executive Officer
As Non-Japanese Executive Officer,
I would like to Provide a Diversity of Perspective to Sumitomo Chemical.
I have served as President of Sumitomo Chemical Europe since 2001 and as an Executive Officer since 2010. The company regularly holds Executive Officers Meetings, which offer an opportunity for us to meet and exchange information. When I was inducted as an Executive Officer, the style of the meetings was more structured, but now I have realized the atmo- sphere is more open. We also hold lunch meetings before the formal Executive Officers Meetings. During this time, we are able to discuss a variety of things without restraint. This approach brings forth new ideas which then lead to innovation within the company. Additionally, non-Japanese Executive Officers can be integrated much more easily.
These changes in the meetings are important from the perspective of the progress of diversity. I believe in diversity benefits for companies in countless ways. Sometimes when people encounter diversity, they find it difficult to cooperate together. However, if we focus on and share initial targets strongly, diversity contributes to strengthen the organization and develop innovative solutions for the future.
We have always incorporated Sumitomo Chemical’s corporate values into the global management of the company and its worldwide operations. Having talented people in suitable positions, regardless of nationality, culture, or gender is essential for us to move away from being an international company to a truly global company. I would like to con- tribute to encouraging a productive discussion between all of the Executive Officers and eventually try to provide varying perspectives, cultures and experiences.

Managing Executive Officer
   Internal Control
Status of Development of Internal Control System
Sumitomo Chemical recognizes the continuous development and enhancement of our internal control system as a necessary process in maintaining a sound organization, and believe this system should be actively utilized for the achievement of busi- ness objectives.
Based on the Basic Policy for Enhancement of the Internal Control System (revised in March 2015) established by the Board of Directors, we have formed the Internal Control Committee (chaired by the President) to review and strengthen the internal control system of the Sumitomo Chemical Group in response to changing circumstances. The Internal Control Committee monitors the implementation status of initiatives based on the Basic Policy, promoting various measures in order to enhance internal control systems.
Timely Disclosure
The Corporate Communications Department is in charge of working in conjunction with other relevant departments to
continually disclose necessary information in a timely manner. In addition to items requiring disclosure under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and under stock exchange regulations, we also actively disclose information that may be considered material to the decisions of investors.
We endeavor to build stronger relationships of trust with society and capital markets by publishing documentation in accordance with the rules stipulated by the security exchanges in Japan, including reports on the Company’s corporate gover- nance philosophy and system, and notifications showing that independent directors and corporate auditors have no existing conflicts of interest with general shareholders. These documents are available on the website of Japan Exchange Group Inc.
Internal Auditing
Sumitomo Chemical has established dedicated organizations within the company to conduct internal auditing. Internal audits are conducted on Sumitomo Chemical and major Group companies to evaluate and ascertain the design, operation, and effective functioning of internal controls in the execution of business duties by executives and employees of the Sumitomo
  88
Annual Report 2018

Chemical Group from the following perspectives: (1) effective and efficient operations; (2) reliability of financial reporting; and (3) compliance with relevant laws and statutes in all business activities. These audits are carried out by the Responsible Care Department (technology reliability auditing), for matters that fall under the purview of the Responsible Care Committee, such as the environment, safety, and quality, and by the Internal Control & Audit Department for other topics relating to the execution of operations.
The Internal Control & Audit Department works to improve internal controls for applicable departments through internal auditing. It also regularly holds meetings of the Internal Audit
Risk Management
Sumitomo Chemical seeks to improve and enhance our risk management system to detect risks at an early stage that have the possibility of hindering the achievement of business objec- tives and to prevent them from occurring as well as to respond quickly and appropriately on their occurrence.
Each organization of the Sumitomo Chemical Group takes various measures to appropriately manage risk. To support and ensure the risk management measures of each organization, the Internal Control Committee determines Group-wide risk management policy and deliberates initiatives pertaining to collection of risk information and its dissemination throughout the Group.
For enhancing the risk management system, each organi- zation of Sumitomo Chemical Group including Group com- panies both in Japan and abroad conducts a risk assessment every fiscal year in terms of the probability of risk occurrence and its possible impact, and the Internal Control Committee determines based on the assessment results Group-wide pri- ority risks that are to be implemented across the Group. Each organization takes appropriate measures based on the Group- wide risk response plans, which are developed by Sumitomo Chemical’s risk response coordination departments designated for each priority risk.
We also establish a Risk Crisis Management Committee to deliberate the Group’s response policies and plans, pertaining to the individual risk crisis in order to make prompt responses in the event that a significant risk is realized, such as large-scale disasters (earthquakes, storms, floods and other), pandemics, and a deterioration in security (terrorism, riots and wars and other).

Coordination Board to share with relevant departments the reports of deficiencies detected by internal auditing and progress on their countermeasures, promoting initiatives to strengthen the internal control systems of the Sumitomo Chemical Group. The department reports the results of audits relating to internal controls to the Board of Directors via the Internal Control Committee. In addition, in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, the Department evalu- ates, promotes, and coordinates the effectiveness of Sumitomo Chemical’s internal control over the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s financial reporting as the secretariat, and also reports on the status of such evaluation to the Internal Control Committee.

  Compliance
Basic Policy of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s Compliance:
Passed Down from One Generation to Another
Sumitomo Chemical places “compliance” at the bedrock of corporate management. As we engage in business in many parts of the world, all companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are devoting earnest efforts to stay in strict compliance with not only laws and regulations, but also ethical principles in a business environment.
The spirit and letter of ensuring compliance in business activities have consistently been enshrined at Sumitomo Chemical ever since the company was founded. This unwavering resolve towards com- pliance is embodied succinctly in the “Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business Conduct” (please see P10), which serves as the guideline of conduct for every employee to abide by and constitutes the backbone of our day-to-day compliance activities. In recent years in particular, greater emphasis is placed on the importance of companies fulfilling their responsibilities to society while relevant laws and their enforcement are continually strengthened around the world. Given the circumstances, all companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are making concerted endeavors in furthering compliance activities, under the strong leadership of top management, keeping duly in mind that thoroughgoing compliance efforts are becoming ever more important in the Group’s increasingly globalized business operations.
The Compliance Manual and the Charter for Business Conduct embody Sumitomo Chemical’s Business Philosophy*
Sumitomo Chemical’s major business regions. The RLCOs, grasping the concrete needs and tasks of respective Group companies, pro- vide hands-on support and guidance to them, such as helping to set and implement necessary internal rules and procedures, building a company’s compliance system, and assisting in its operation.

An area of our recent focus is to strengthen those initiatives which will more effectively serve to maintain sound business practices in companies’ entire supply chains, through implementing measures to prevent corruption, such as bribes and collusion with business part- ners (see Topics 1), as well as initiatives to ensure strict observance of competition laws. In addition, with regard to competition laws, we implemented a thoroughly revised Competition Law Compliance Manual in fiscal 2017, and we will also promote to introduce the Manual in Group companies going forward.
(2) Compliance Promotion Month
In line with the “Corporate Ethics Promotion Month” initiatives of Keidanren (the Japan Business Federation), Sumitomo Chemical and some of its Group companies have designated October of every year as “Compliance Promotion Month,” in which all employees in each workplace, including manufacturing, sales, and various intermediate departments, participate in discussions to examine and identify all conceivable compliance risks, major or minor, that might arise in each workplace. They then go on to select those risks that need to be specifically addressed, and formulate concrete measures to prevent the risks from occurring in the future. For those preventive measures which are already in place, they review once again whether or not the measures will be effective enough when implemented. Continuous implementation of these measures not only reduces specific compliance risks in the workplace, but also helps in raising employees’ compliance consciousness.
During the Compliance Promotion Month initiatives of fiscal 2016, so-called “fraud” risks were made essential topics of discussion

Under the guidance and oversight of the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors, the Compliance Committee of Sumitomo Chemical establishes overarching principles of compli- ance from a global perspective, according to which it works with every Group company in Japan and abroad in building and operat- ing their compliance systems locally in a manner required.
(2) Think globally, Manage regionally, Act locally = A Structure Focused on Effectiveness
As business globalizes, it becomes more important that a corpo- ration’s compliance system operation be fine-tuned to a situation specific to an individual country or company. In light of this, we have established Regional Legal & Compliance Offices (RLCOs) in

in light of recent corporate scandals that had taken place, while in fiscal 2017, collusion and harassment were essential topics, as all major compliance risks were examined and identified in each department, and then, concrete preventive measures were formu- lated and implemented. Reports on these activities are submitted by each department, and an evaluation team that includes outside legal counsel objectively evaluated them. With the goal of further raising the level of compliance, we shared departments with positive evaluations and details of their initiatives within the company.
(3) Compliance Training
With a firm belief that strict compliance can only be achieved with each employee having high awareness of compliance, Sumitomo Chemical attaches importance to carrying out “compliance educa- tion” on a continual basis, which includes training programs geared to management executives at Sumitomo Chemical and Group companies as well as face-to-face lecture-style training courses and e-learning trainings, depending on each company’s specific needs and situation.
(4) Employee Compliance Awareness Survey
In order to measure the effect of the initiatives listed above, including compliance activities and training, Sumitomo Chemical regularly conducts employee compliance awareness surveys, and in fiscal 2017, a survey of more than 40 Group companies inside and outside Japan was conducted. Questions about topics such as the compliance awareness of individual employees were designated as key performance indicators (KPIs) for this survey, and observing trends in these KPIs each time a survey is conducted will lead to the discovery of issues and the setting forth of measures aimed at further improvement.
(5) Compliance Audits
As it is also important to conduct audits of whether the operations of the compliance structure and various compliance activities are being appropriately carried out in each department of Sumitomo Chemical, and in each Group company, the Internal Control and Audit Department and the Responsible Care Department conduct compliance audits.
Speak-Up Reporting System
(1) A Speak-Up Reporting System Plays a Key Role Towards Enhanced Compliance
All companies of Sumitomo Chemical Group are constantly making every possible effort to detect any compliance violations as early as possible or to prevent them from occurring in the future, by taking a variety of measures, including improving the operational effec- tiveness of the Speak-Up Reporting System. Sumitomo Chemical’s Speak-Up System is built on the basic thought that anyone involved in Sumitomo Chemical’s business, whether a management execu- tive or an employee at the Company, or his or her family member, or an executive or employee of a Group company, or a trading partner, will be able to report a compliance violation or a suspected violation to the Compliance Committee without fail, whenever they come to recognize one in connection with activities of Sumitomo Chemical Group companies. Accordingly, various reporting channels
are available for use, i.e. (1) A Compliance Committee of each Group company, (2) RLCOs, (3) the Compliance Committee of Sumitomo Chemical, and (4) external lawyers designated by the committee. A reporting person can use a reporting channel of his or her choosing. (Please see chart below)

(2) Promoting Use of the Speak-Up Reporting System
An investigation based on a speak-up report is carried out with utmost consideration to protecting the privacy of a reporting person and maintaining confidentiality of information provided. In addition, a maximal care is taken to ensure that a person who has made truth- ful reporting will never be put at any disadvantage on the ground of having made the report, such as dismissal, transfer, or discrimination. Moreover, to ensure that the Speak-Up System functions in a truly effective manner, Sumitomo Chemical’s Compliance Committee takes every opportunity to explain to employees that speak-up reporting will never disadvantage a reporting person. In this regard, the Committee has been working to help employees understand clearly that confidentiality about the reporting is maintained and any disadvantageous treatment to a reporting person is strictly prohibited. In addition, the Committee shares with employee’s information about how far the Speak-Up Reporting System is in use by employees.
(3) Recent Operational Track Record of the Speak-Up Reporting System
As a result of the above initiatives to promote the use of the report- ing system, in fiscal 2017, there were a total of 89 reports to the Compliance Committees of Sumitomo Chemical and each Group company, a significant increase of 50 reports over the previous fiscal year. Upon its receipt, each report was worked on, and an investiga- tion was conducted promptly and cautiously into a reported incident. When violations were found or if a situation that might eventually develop into an incident of violation was recognized, corrective measures were taken properly. In addition, information on a violation incident and corrective measures actually taken was shared, as nec- essary, by other companies of the Group so that they could prevent similar incidents from occurring in their workplace in the future.

(4) Guidance and Oversight by the Board of Corporate Auditors, Including Outside Corporate Auditors
On the grounds that Speak-Up reports given to the Compliance Committees of Sumitomo Chemical and the Group companies, as well as compliance violation incidents at each company, are also important from a governance perspective, the Board of Corporate Auditors will regularly, or as needed for important issues, receive reports on these reports and violations, and will provide guidance
and oversight.
Stronger Commitment to
Further Enhanced Compliance Initiatives
Being a global enterprise, Sumitomo Chemical is deeply committed to fulfilling its corporate citizenship responsibilities. As Sumitomo Chemical Group companies continue to promote and expand busi- ness worldwide, the Sumitomo Chemical Compliance Committee, the RLCOs and each Group company will work jointly and more vig- orously to strengthen their compliance initiatives by further cement- ing the closely-knit network of collaboration through various kinds of modus operandi, such as holding Global Legal and Compliance Conferences annually or the active use of IoT technologies.

 Initiatives Regarding Prevention of Corruption in the Supply Chain of the Sumitomo Chemical Group
   In order to thoroughly prevent corruption such as briberies to public officials or collusion with trading partners (including excessive business entertainment or giving and receiving of gifts, embezzlement, breaches of trust etc.), Sumitomo Chemical established the Committee on Antitrust Compliance and Corruption Prevention (reorganizing the previous Committee on Antitrust Compliance) in 2012, having the responsibility for building and operating a corruption prevention system for Group companies inside and outside Japan.
Under the guidance and oversight of the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors, this Committee conducts assessments of corruption risks, based on the situations and factors such as corruption prevention laws and regulations of each country, the status of trans- actions and the countries in which trading partners are located. In light of the assessment results, the Committee determines the policies, rules, procedures and other protocols, and ensures that they are abided by throughout the Group.
Specific measures include establishment of policies, rules, procedures and other protocols such as the corruption prevention manual and approval standards for approval, and operation of measures such as due diligence processes when entering into or renewing contracts with agents, consultants, and business or trading partners, including distribu- tors, and authorization processes for entertainment and the giving and receiving of gifts.
The company ensures that executives and employees are fully informed, through internal training and internal information systems, of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s commitment with regard to preventing corrupt activities, and of the compliance with relevant internal regulations. Sumitomo Chemical’s business and trading partners are also fully informed from time to time by providing training etc, during the process of con- cluding contracts and due diligence, and other meeting opportunities.
The company has in place and operates internal reporting hotlines (Speak-Up hotlines – anonymous reporting also possible) that can be used by anyone involved in Sumitomo Chemical’s businesses, including business and trading partners, enabling the Company to find out conduct of violation including corruption in its early stage of development and take remedial actions therefor promptly, hence conducive to ensuring compliance throughout the Company.
With regard to executives and employees who have been confirmed as undertaking corrupt activities, they will be subject to disciplinary actions per the internal regulations. With regard to business and trading partners, measures such as termination of a contract and other recourse will be taken.
In 2004, Sumitomo Chemical established a CSR Procurement Policy, based on the Basic CSR Policy, working to ensure socially responsible procure- ment across the entire supply chain, particularly in purchasing depart- ments. Since 2009, the company has issued the Sumitomo Chemical Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook to suppliers, and requested their compliance with it. The Guidebook includes items such as respect for human rights, the prohibition of harsh and inhumane treatment such as maltreatments and/or various harassment, the prohibition of discrimina- tion during the process of job offering and hiring, the implementation of equal opportunity and fair treatment, compliance with legal work hours, respect for the right to freedom of association of employees, the prohibi- tion of forced labor and child labor, and payment of legal minimum wage. After providing prospective new suppliers with the Sumitomo Chemical Supply-Chain CSR Development Check Sheets in advance, the company conducts due diligence for their compliance status, and only begins doing business with them after confirming that the evaluation result is positive. In addition, after beginning a business relationship, the company con- ducts regular monitoring of compliance status, and has decided to work to prioritize procurement from business partners working to improve CSR. If violations are confirmed, the company will demand an necessary remedial measure be taken by the supplier and itself take appropriate measures, including terminating the relationship.
In addition, in order to reconfirm its commitment to ensuring respect for human rights across the entire supply chain of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, and to ensure thoroughgoing compliance with initiatives related to this issue by executives and employees, the company expressed its agreement with the Joint Declaration on Rectifying Business Practices That Lead to Long Working Hours in October 2017, which has been joined by about 110 economic organizations, particularly Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation). Furthermore, in April 2018, the company added an item dedicated to its initiatives to ensure respect for human rights in its supply chain to the compliance manual, and is working to ensure that Group executives and employees comply with these measures thoroughly.

Financial Review
1. Results of Operations
(1) Sales revenue
Sales revenue increased by ¥251.4 billion from ¥1,939.1 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to ¥2,190.5 billion (US$20,618 million) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. This is mainly due to the increase in sales quantity associated with business expansion that has the most significant impact on the increase in sales revenue, the increase in selling price due to the increase in raw material purchase price, and the translation differences from local currencies into Japanese yen in foreign subsidiaries due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen.
(2) Core operating income / Operating income
Core operating income increased by ¥78.1 billion from ¥184.5 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to ¥262.7 billion (US$2,473 million) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 due to the increase in sales quantity as well as the improvement in share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method, such as Rabigh Refining and Petrochemical Company.
Loss from non-recurring factors, which is deducted from Operating income when calculating Core operating income, decreased by ¥46.3 billion from ¥58.1 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to ¥11.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 due to the large amount of impairment losses recorded in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. As a result, Operating income increased by ¥124.5 billion from ¥126.5 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to ¥250.9 billion (US$2,362 million) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
(3) Finance income and Finance expenses / Income before taxes
Finance income and Finance expenses worsened by ¥6.0 billion from loss of ¥4.1 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to loss of ¥10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen toward the end of the current fiscal year and recorded a large amount of exchange losses. As a result, Income before taxes increased by ¥118.5 bil- lion from ¥122.3 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 to ¥240.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

with ¥884.1 billion as of March 31, 2017.
Total equity was ¥1,252.2 billion (US$11,787 million) as of
March 31, 2018, a 12.2% increase from ¥1,115.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, mainly because retained earnings increased. The ratio of net worth to total assets stood at 30.2% as of March 31, 2018, compared with 28.2% as of March 31, 2017.
There were 1,635,056,024 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2018. Retained earnings amounted to ¥738.9 billion (US$6,955 million), an 18.5% increase from ¥623.5 billion as of March 31, 2017.
4. Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 was ¥293.3 billion, an increase of ¥107.5 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, due chiefly to a rise in operating income and a decrease in income taxes paid. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥154.5 billion, a decrease in cash outflows of ¥51.2 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the acquisition of Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (the present Sunovion CNS Development Canada ULC) and Tolero Pharmaceuticals Inc. by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical, in the previous fiscal year. This resulted in free cash flow of ¥138.7 billion for fiscal 2017, compared with negative ¥19.9 billion for the previous fiscal year. Net cash used in financ- ing activities was ¥94.3 billion. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2017 increased by ¥38.6 billion over the previous fiscal year, to ¥231.9 billion.

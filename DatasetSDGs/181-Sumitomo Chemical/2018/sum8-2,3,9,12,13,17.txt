Contributing to a Stable Food Supply by Improving Agricultural Productivity
With the growth in the world population and the development of the global economy, the need for a safe and secure food supply has been increasing. The crop protection and enhancement products Sumitomo Chemical provides around the world are aiming to contribute to a stable food supply by improving agricultural productivity.
Sumika Sustainable Solutions
Plant growth regulators (PGRs), a set of the products from a Sumitomo Chemical’s global agrosolutions business, have been certified as Sumika Sustainable Solutions. PGRs have such effects as improving fruit set, size and quality of fruits and vegetables. In addition, as the timing of flowering and ripening of crops can be adjusted by PGRs, they are effective in cultivating crops in areas where cooling or droughts caused by climate change has progressed, thereby contributing to an increase in food production around the world.

Contributing to Reducing Environmental Impact by Using Cutting-edge Technology in Plants
Petro Rabigh uses the breakthrough, environmentally friendly PO-only process to produce PO, which, compared with conventional produc- tion processes, reduces CO2 emissions by 300 thousand tons of CO2 for an annual production volume of 200 thousand tons of PO. We not only produce stable supplies of a product essential for society, we also use energy and resources efficiently throughout the plant with this sort of cutting-edge technology, thereby contributing to reducing environmental impact.

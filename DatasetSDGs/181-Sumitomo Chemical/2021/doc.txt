The History of Sumitomo Chemical
  The Story of Sumitomo
Chemical A Story of Evolving with the Times and
Pioneering the Future with the Power of Chemistry
The Sumitomo Group’s history dates back to about 400 years ago, when the Sumitomo family started its business in Kyoto, venturing into a broad range of fields, including copper smelting and refining, trading, and mining. In 1690, they discovered the Besshi Copper Mine in Ehime Prefecture. Sumitomo Chemical got its start by manufacturing fertilizers from harmful gases emitted from the family’s copper smelting operations, and has since been operating for over a century as one of the Sumitomo Group companies.

1913- 1940
Origin
The Besshi Copper Mine opened a smelter in 1884 and started full oper- ation in 1894. Expansion of this smelt- ing and refining business resulted in an unexpected problem of air pollu- tion: sulfur dioxide gas emitted from the smelting process caused damage to local agricultural production. Then the company decided to take a drastic measure to prevent the emission of the harmful gas—using sulfur dioxide to produce calcium superphosphate fertilizers.
To carry out this decision, the Sumitomo Fertilizer Works was established in 1913, becoming the origin of Sumitomo Chemical. This business not only helped prevent the air pollution from the emissions, but also con- tributed to the development of agriculture by supplying fertilizers to farmers at low cost.
The Sumitomo family has passed down from generation to generation the words “Jiri-Rita Koushi-Ichinyo,” which means that its business must benefit society at large, not just its own interests. This business principle is embodied in the way Sumitomo

 Building a Foundation as a Chemical Company
 
   Introduction to Sumitomo Chemical
addressed the problem of air pollution they faced, and its commitment to contributing to the development of a sustainable society through business, which that story demonstrates, is deeply embedded in Sumitomo Chemical’s corporate philosophy.
Venturing from the Fertilizer Industry into the Chemical Industry
The business that the company thus started, however, consumed only a small amount of sulfur in its production of fertilizer, accounting for only a mere 6% of the ore output of the Besshi Copper Mine. In order to increase the consumption of sulfur, in the form of sulfuric acid, the company decided to enter the ammonium sulfate business, which led to efficient use of sulfuric acid. Along with this, it also started manufacturing ammonia, a raw mate- rial for ammonium sulfate. After that, by introducing new technologies from out- side, the company further expanded its business scope to include other indus-
1941- 1970
Successively launching new businesses, Sumitomo Chemical grew to become a diversified chemical company.
Incorporating the Fine Chemicals Business
In working to expand from the fertilizer business to the industrial chemicals business, the company found it essen- tial to enter the field of fine chemicals, to grow into a diversified chemical com- pany that can create synergies with its varied businesses. In 1944, Sumitomo Chemical merged with the Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company, which was engaged in the dyestuff and phar- maceuticals businesses. This marked the start of Sumitomo Chemical’s fine chemicals business, which continued to grow in the years that followed.
Sumithion, a crop protection product developed in-house, became a block- buster. Driven by the twin engines of a household insecticide and a block- buster crop protection product with a high safety profile, the agrochemicals business grew to play an important role in the company’s fine chemicals sector.
Growth of the Pharmaceuticals Business
The pharmaceuticals business expanded through alliances and mergers with foreign companies. With new drug can- didates successively coming into its pipe- line and the launch of new treatments for psychiatric and neurological diseases and cardiovascular diseases, as well as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents, this business achieved solid growth.
Entering the Petrochemicals Business
In 1958, Sumitomo Chemical completed the construction of manufacturing plants for ethylene and polyethylene in Ehime, Japan, and entered into the petro- chemicals business. This was followed
5
      trial chemicals, including nitric acid, methanol, and formalin. In this way, a foundation was built for the company to develop from a fertilizer manufacturer into a chemical company.
Entering the Agrochemicals Business
After World War II, Sumitomo Chemical entered the agrochemicals business, comprised of household insecticides and crop protection products. In 1953, the company launched Pynamin, a household insecticide. Meanwhile,
by the construction of a larger-scale ethylene plant in Chiba, Japan, and the expansion of the business into a wide range of petrochemical derivatives. The petrochemicals business expanded on the back of the rapid growth of the Japanese economy.

immense significance for the company,
because in Singapore naphtha was
available at competitive prices and the

was expected. While there were times
when the future of this project became
extremely uncertain, including the

cessively launched new products from
the 1990s to 2000s, including crop
protection products and household
insecticides, by leveraging its advanced
R&D capabilities. In addition, we have

Cash flows from operating activities increased by 268.5 billion yen over the previous fiscal year, due to the receipt of one-time pay- ments relating to pharmaceuticals and an improvement in working capital. Cash outflows from investing activities decreased by 322.3 billion yen compared to the previous fiscal year because of pay- ments related to major M&A activities in the previous fiscal year. As a result, free cash flow was a net inflow of 197.1 billion yen.
Due to an improvement in net income attributable to the owners of the parent, both ROE and ROI exceeded figures for the previous fiscal year, but have not yet reached our targets of 10% and 7%, respectively.

Chairman’s Message
It is in These Times of Crisis for Humanity that We at the Sumitomo Chemical Group Renew Our Commitment to Contributing Broadly to Society as a Bearer of Innovation.
 Since last year we have been going through the major difficulties posed by COVID-19, and we have had to face unavoidable changes on every front. In addition, COVID-19 further intensified two fundamental crises that had already been facing society, namely, societal divisions and the crisis of sustainability. The rise of populism and nationalism caused by widening dis- parities has caused a rift between generations and between the rich and poor, as well as global divisions, as exemplified by the fight for dominance between the US and China. In addition, ecological damage, such as from global warming and pandemics, is threatening the sustainability of human society.
Against the backdrop of these crises, over the next five or ten years, the world is expected to work to form a new order. In doing so, I think it is critical that we maintain two important viewpoints. One is a viewpoint of justice and fairness. We need to develop a renewed appreciation for the universal values of basic human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. We also need to focus on another viewpoint: social interest. This is a concept that runs through the prin- ciple of ESG as well as the SDGs, which emphasize diversity and inclusion. It is also part of Sumitomo’s business philosophies—including the credo “Jiri-Rita Koushi-Ichinyo,” meaning that our business must benefit society at large, not just our own interests— that were handed down in the Sumitomo Chemical Group from the time of its founding.
In achieving societal change with the two view- points of justice and fairness, on the one hand, and social interest, on the other, what is essential is science and innovation. Chemistry has its origins in alchemy among others, and has developed as a natural science on the basis of logical positivism. Chemistry, which creates substances that are newly demanded by society or that have characteristics that had never been seen before, is truly the alchemy of our modern society. The chemical industry is an extremely far-reaching industry that touches upon every field, such as the environment, medicine, and food. One can also say that this industry is entrusted to lead innovation to help resolve a variety of complex and increasingly sophisticated issues including the realization of carbon neutrality and to make our soci- ety sustainable.
Especially now, as humankind faces the new crisis of COVID-19, we will redouble our efforts to generate innovation based on the credo of “Jiri-Rita Koushi- Ichinyo,” contribute to the creation of Society 5.0, and continue working to build a Sumitomo Chemical that can be trusted by society far into the future.
We would greatly appreciate your continued support and cooperation.

The year 2020 was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Can you share your view of that year?
Amid enormous changes in the business environment,
we were able to demonstrate the strong defensive power of
a diversified chemical company engaging in a variety of businesses.

  Operating a Business during a Pandemic
In fiscal 2020, we were forced to respond to the challenge of COVID-19 throughout the year. With lockdown mea- sures in countries around the world and the emergency declaration in Japan, people’s movements and interactions were severely restricted. As part of the chemical industry, Sumitomo Chemical has a responsibility to supply materials required for society’s infrastructure. To fulfill this respon- sibility, we devoted our efforts toward ensuring continued safe and stable operations, while protecting the health of employees through a wide range of measures to prevent infection. As a result, while there was an unavoidable decline in the capacity utilization rate at some of our sub- sidiaries outside of Japan, overall we were able to avoid a significant impact on our operations.
In our daily work, we saw a marked decline in oppor- tunities for face-to-face communication. That was a major change, but because we were quickly able to put in place systems for remote work, communication with locations both in and outside Japan has become easier than ever before. In addition, starting in October of 2020, I began an internal blog to convey my own words to all employees throughout the world. The topics I cover range from my morning walk and books I have read to such issues as human rights and climate change. I hope this blog helps in sharing with all employees the issues facing Sumitomo Chemical and the future direction of management.
Financial Results for FY2020: Demonstrating the Strong Defensive Power of a Diversified Chemical Company
Turning to our financial results for fiscal 2020, because automobile-related demand declined due to the spread of COVID-19 infections that began at the start of the year, shipments decreased in the Petrochemical & Plastics Sector and the Energy & Functional Materials Sector. In addition, we had a scheduled maintenance shutdown at Petro Rabigh, so that results in both sectors were weak in the first half of the fiscal year, but starting in the second half, they quickly improved with the recovery in automo- bile-related demand. In the IT-related Chemicals Sector, we initially expected that COVID-19 would have a negative impact, but because of the stay-at-home trend, results were actually strong throughout the year. In the Health & Crop Sciences Sector, shipments of crop protection products increased with the new addition of agricultural chemicals businesses in South America, and in the Pharmaceuticals Sector, sales of the atypical antipsychotic agent Latuda continued to be strong. In these two sectors, we were able to continue business operations without any major changes from the time before the spread of COVID-19. As a result, our financial results for fiscal 2020 were better than the prior fiscal year even in the face of unprecedented, enor- mous changes in our business environment. We were able to demonstrate the strong defensive power of a diversified chemical company engaging in a variety of businesses.
  
20 Sumitomo Chemical Annual Report 2021 Interview with the President
Two years has passed since the start of the current Corporate Business Plan. How has progress been?
We have been working on improving our competitiveness,
and I think we finally reached a position from which
we can aim to achieve a return on equity level of around 10%.
 Change & Innovation 3.0: Six Basic Policies
Since the start of the current Corporate Business Plan, there have been major changes in our operating environment, including the spread of COVID-19 and the acceleration in the movement in Japan and around the world to become carbon neutral. Despite these, we uphold the six basic poli- cies we put forth at the start of this period, including accel- erating the development of next-generation businesses, improving productivity through digital innovation, and further improving our business portfolio. We have, however, made appropriate changes to the weight of emphasis we have placed on them and our timelines for execution as we have implemented them.
Accelerate the Development of Next-generation Businesses
First, for accelerating the development of next-generation businesses, we have designated four priority areas: healthcare, reducing environmental impact, food, and ICT. Going forward, we will put more management resources in healthcare and reducing environmental impact, in which societal needs are increasing enormously because of COVID-19. Up to now we have worked on efforts to build our innovation ecosystem, such as expanding our Corporate Venturing and Innovation Office, an office dedicated to exploring innovation opportunities, and collaborating with a variety of startup companies. In the field of healthcare, we entered into the Contract Development and Manufacturing

  Organization business for regenerative medicine and cell therapy, and in the field of reducing environmental impact, we decided to build a new research facility at our Chiba site to accelerate the development of chemical recycling and other technologies. Going forward, we will step up efforts to strengthen our innovation ecosystem so that innovations will be produced one after another.
Improve Productivity through Digital Innovation
In terms of improving productivity through digital innova- tion, we have set an ultimate goal of creating new business models through digital transformation, and as milestones toward that goal, we have established a digital transfor- mation strategy with three components, 1.0 through 3.0. With DX Strategy 1.0, we have been working to significantly improve productivity in R&D, manufacturing, supply chain management, and administration. In parallel with that initia- tive, starting this year we are working to jumpstart our efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of our existing businesses with DX Strategy 2.0 and create new business models with DX Strategy 3.0. As we focus on these initiatives, we have fully absorbed our subsidiary, Sumitomo Chemical Systems Service Co., Ltd., and established a joint venture with Accenture to further strengthen our capabilities for accelerating our digital transformation.
Further Improve Business Portfolio
Further improving our business portfolio was an issue on which we placed particular emphasis in fiscal 2020. We made solid progress in post-merger integration for our large- scale acquisitions and worked to strengthen the competi- tiveness of each of our businesses in order to maintain our earnings power even in the midst of the major change in our business environment represented by COVID-19.
Regarding recent large-scale investments, we added two new blockbuster drug candidates to our pipeline through an alliance in 2019 with the biopharma company Roivant Sciences. Both of these have already been launched this year, and the prospects for securing earnings are in sight. In our crop protection products business, we acquired four South American subsidiaries from Nufarm Limited, a leading Australian agricultural chemical company. In South America,
including Brazil, the world's largest crop protection market, we will seek to achieve a significant increase in sales of INDIFLINTM, a promising novel fungicide for soybeans devel- oped using Sumitomo Chemical’s proprietary technology.
The Rabigh Phase II Project, another large-scale invest- ment of ours, began commercial operations in November of 2019. Subsequently, in September of 2020, our financial completion guarantee for project finance was terminated, enabling us to substantially lower our future financial risk. In addition, in our methionine business, which has been adversely affected by a weak market in recent years, we have enhanced our cost competitiveness by fully rationalizing our operations, and the market is on the path to recovery.
In addition, in the area of high-performance chemi- cals, primarily through our Energy & Functional Materials Sector and IT-related Chemicals Sector, we are developing materials for next-generation high-speed communications, enhancing the value added for display materials, and increasing our production capacity for semiconductor materials.
Financial Targets for Our Corporate Business Plan
For fiscal 2021, as a result of these initiatives to strengthen our competitiveness, we are projecting an improvement in our core operating income to 200 billion yen. Return on equity is expected to be at around 10%, the level we want to attain, and in my third year as president, I think we finally stand in a position from which we can aim to achieve it. Our target for core operating income for the current Corporate Business Plan, however, is 280 billion yen. Rather than revising this target, we are redoubling our efforts to achieve it as soon as possible. In our Health & Crop Sciences Sector and Pharmaceuticals, we have already taken needed measures, including making large-scale investments, which we expect to deliver concrete results over the next several years. We will take measures to achieve a level of total core operating income of 280 billion yen over the medium to long term, with 80 billion yen from the Health & Crop Sciences Sector, 80 billion yen from our high-performance chemical product businesses primarily in the Energy & Functional Materials Sector and IT-related Chemicals Sector, and more than 120 billion yen from the pharmaceutical business.
  
22 Sumitomo Chemical Annual Report 2021 Interview with the President
What kinds of initiatives are you taking to achieve sustainability and respond to climate change and other pressing issues?
We will work toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050,
and to this end, we have launched a new organization to formulate and implement a strategy that is characteristic of Sumitomo Chemical.
 Driving Sustainable Management
At the Sumitomo Chemical Group we strive to generate both economic value and social value through our business and seek to achieve sustainable growth for the Sumitomo Chemical Group and contribute to building a sustainable society. In the current Corporate Business Plan, we are implementing a variety of measures to further intensify and accelerate these initiatives.
First, at the same time we announced our current Corporate Business Plan, we defined our material issues to be addressed as management priorities for sustainable value creation, such as contributions to reducing envi- ronmental impact and to the healthcare field, while also identifying items that serve as the foundation for continuing our business, such as safety, respect for human rights, and compliance. In addition, we also established key perfor- mance indicators to make visible and manage our progress in addressing these material issues.
Toward Achieving Carbon Neutrality
In recent years, the world has increasingly focused attention on reducing environmental impact in the face of climate change, the problem of plastic waste, and other environ- mental challenges. For climate change, countries and regions around the world, including Japan, have pledged one after another to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 to limit the global average temperature increase to below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Governments and private companies have begun to explore ways forward and take action. Sumitomo Chemical has been making substantial efforts to address the issue of climate change for many years. In 2018 we gained certification from the Science Based Targets initiative for our targets to reduce the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 and by at least 57% in 2050*. Achieving these targets will not be easy, but to achieve the even more challenging target of carbon neutrality, we need to rethink * Scope 1+2, compared to fiscal 2013
the fundamentals of our strategy. Therefore, in February 2021 we established the Carbon Neutral Strategy Council and the Carbon Neutral Strategy Cross-Functional Team to formulate and implement the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are going to develop a strategy that is characteristic of Sumitomo Chemical, from the dual perspective of our obligation to minimize our own greenhouse gas emissions and our contribution through our products and technologies that enable us to indirectly achieve a reduction in society’s greenhouse gas emissions. P60
Addressing the Problem of Plastic Waste
Plastics are contributing to making products lighter and reducing food loss. In addition, amid the COVID-19 pan- demic, they are recognized as a useful material in helping to prevent infection when used in the form of personal protec- tive equipment and partition panels that reduce the spread of droplets. While continuing to utilize this useful material, we need to bring about a circular economy that recycles used plastic for use as a resource. Sumitomo Chemical has been developing and supplying products that lead to reducing and reusing plastic, and in recent years we have also been working on the development of technology for material recycling and chemical recycling. In April 2021, we established the Business Development Office for a Circular System for Plastics to accelerate the development of businesses based on our efforts towards building a circular system for plastics.

 What message do you have for shareholders and investors?
By leveraging the power of chemistry,
we will take on the challenge of resolving major issues to
achieve a sustainable society, and seek to enhance our corporate value.
 I recognize shareholders and investors as our essential stakeholders. As I lead Sumitomo Chemical and manage our business day-to-day, I always bear shareholders and investors in mind. Regarding shareholder return, we have made it a policy to maintain stable dividend payments, giving due consideration to our business performance and the dividend payout ratio for each fiscal year, the level of retained earnings necessary for future growth, and other relevant factors. Over the medium to long term, we aim to constantly achieve a dividend payout ratio of around 30%.
For fiscal 2020, the annual dividend was 15 yen per share, a reduction of 2 yen from the 17 yen per share dividend of the prior fiscal year. Regarding fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, as we were unable to secure a sufficient level of profit, we prioritized stable dividends over the dividend pay- out ratio in deciding the dividend amount, resulting in two
consecutive years of lower dividends. I would like to express my deep regret to our shareholders and investors for these results. For fiscal 2021, because we expect to achieve a certain level of profit in our financial results, we plan to pay a dividend of 20 yen per share.
By leveraging the power of chemistry, we at the Sumitomo Chemical Group will, through innovation and our business, continue to take on the challenge of resolving major issues to achieve a sustainable society and seek to enhance our corporate value. I sincerely hope that our shareholders share this aspiration, and we are determined to become a company whose shareholders can take pride and joy in being our shareholders.
Your continued understanding and support would be very much appreciated.

Financial Strategy
By FY2024, We will Improve
Our Financial Structure,
which has Deteriorated due to Conducting Large-scale Investments, through Returns on the Results of Our Investments and through
 Cash Generation Measures.
 Basic Policy
implementing projects that we believe can make an import- ant contribution to the solution of societal issues, as long as they are expected to be profitable. We set a target of 7% for ROI, in order to exceed our weighted average capital cost (WACC).
Our target D/E ratio is approximately 0.7, with a view to maintaining our current credit rating, which enables flexible financing. For new capital expenditures or M&A, we have decided to take into consideration economic indicators in each individual investment decision, including net present value (NPV), internal revenue rate (IRR), and the payback period. Since fiscal 2019, in order to contribute to the cre- ation of a sustainable society, we have been calculating an economic indicator that reflects our internal carbon pricing (10,000 yen per ton) for any project that is expected to increase or decrease CO2 emissions, which is used in our investment decision-making. In addition, we also regularly follow-up on the results of investments, including both capital investments and acquisitions.
Keigo Sasaki
Managing Executive Officer
  Sumitomo Chemical is aiming to reliably achieve its targets for ROE, ROI, and other financial indicators, and continu- ously improve corporate value. By controlling the balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the D/E ratio through rational- ization, cost cutting, and shortening of the cash conversion cycle (CCC), we will continue to expand and strengthen our business through active growth investments while maintain- ing the soundness of our financial base.
Key Financial Performance Indicators
Since 1999, we have been working to improve capital effi- ciency, including both ROE and ROI, from an early stage, taking measures such as considering capital costs in our performance results for each business sector as part of our management accounting system. Currently, ROI for each sector is an important financial performance indicator.
We set a target of 10% for ROE, a key financial perfor- mance indicator, with a view toward creating a sustainable society through our business activities, based on a policy of

Progress of the Corporate Business Plan
Our policy in the financial aspect of the Corporate Business Plan (FY2019-2021) is to recover cash steadily from capital expenditures already made, and to control costs and assets through disciplined operations. This policy itself will remain unchanged, but due in part to the fact that two large-scale strategic investments had been carried out (the acquisition of the South American business of Nufarm in the Health & Crop Sciences sector, and the strategic alliance with Roivant in the Pharmaceuticals sector), our financial structure tem- porarily deteriorated, with effects such as our balance of interest-bearing liabilities exceeding 1.3 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 2020 and our D/E ratio reaching 0.9, so we are taking measures to improve this situation.
As for capital expenditure and investment for FY2019- 2021 (on a decision-making basis), we aim to reduce the projected scale of 950 billion yen, inclusive of the planned

amount of each business sector, by 100 billion yen, by rigorously selecting investment projects with an eye toward growth. In addition, we are also working to sell assets and improve our cash conversion cycle, with targets of asset sales of 50 billion yen, including the sale of cross sharehold- ings and other unneeded assets, and cash generation of 50 billion yen by shortening the cash conversion cycle to 110 days, by the end of fiscal 2024.
Currently, we have already conducted sales of over 40 billion yen of assets, while also continuing to follow our plan of constricting investments. For fiscal 2020, the cash conversion cycle was 118 days, due in part to accumulating inventories relating to new products, but we are accelerating our efforts to achieve this goal, including not only setting up and launching a project to reduce inventories compa- ny-wide, but also strengthening management using DX. Going forward, we plan to improve our financial structure by steadily implementing these sorts of measures, and our goal is to achieve a D/E ratio of 0.7 by the end of fiscal 2024.
Shareholder Return
We consider shareholder return as one of our priority man- agement issues. We have made it a policy to maintain stable dividend payments, giving due consideration to our busi- ness performance, the dividend payout ratio for each fiscal period, the level of retained earnings necessary for future growth, and other relevant factors. We aim to maintain a dividend payout ratio of around 30% over the medium- to long-term. We will continue to sustainably improve corpo- rate value by improving capital efficiency and strengthening our financial structures, thereby meeting the expectations of our shareholders.

 Sumitomo Chemical’s DNA
The history of Sumitomo Chemical began when gasses from a copper smelting process caused a pollution problem, and there was an urgent need for a solution. Sumitomo Chemical was founded to resolve this problem, using those gasses as the raw material for fertilizer manufacturing, overcoming an environmental problem while also improving agricultural productivity. This philosophy of resolv- ing problems facing society through its business is in the DNA of the Sumitomo Chemical Group.

Sumitomo Chemical’s Path to Carbon Neutrality
We welcomed Mari Yoshitaka of Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, who is a specialist on climate change issues and who has also worked on government initia- tives, to a conversation with President Iwata about the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s response to climate change and its path toward achieving carbon neutrality.
29
   Initiatives to Address Climate Change and Carbon Neutrality
Iwata: The Sumitomo Chemical Group views climate change as a pressing challenge facing mankind, and we have been working on a variety of initiatives aimed at resolv- ing this issue for many years. Recently, many countries around the world, including Japan, have made a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. It is clear, however, that carbon neutrality will be difficult to achieve with just existing technology and that innovation will be necessary. The chemical industry is at the forefront of innovation, and we would like to take the lead in this industry in creating innovation that will lead to a solution to this issue. Yoshitaka: Carbon neutrality by 2050 is quite a significant hurdle for the industrial sector. What sort of direction will you aim to achieve it?
Iwata: We are proceeding in two directions, broadly speaking. First, we are aiming to reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted by our production activities and business activities toward zero. We are positioning this as our obligation. The other direction is our contribution to advancement toward carbon neutrality for society as a whole through our products and technologies. We will work on both our obligation and our contribution, as we move toward carbon neutrality. To this end, in February of this year, we established the Carbon Neutrality Strategy Committee and the Carbon Neutrality Cross-Functional Team, creating a system for advancing our efforts toward carbon neutrality globally.
Yoshitaka: The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) calls for information disclosure from four perspectives: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and KPIs. We could say that your references to corporate obliga- tion and contribution would fall under Strategy, as they are about how you view the risks facing your company, how you fulfill your responsibilities to address them, and how you grow as a company by contributing to society. In addition, ESG investors are particularly concerned about Governance. I think the fact that you have set up a global system will be rated quite highly in the respect of Governance.
Iwata: Thank you very much for your positive comments. We are going to formulate and implement a strategy which is supported by scientific technology (based on both the natural sciences and the social sciences). At the same time, we will also ensure that that strategy is characteristic of Sumitomo Chemical, which is a diversified chemical manufacturer, and that it raises an expectation that Sumitomo Chemical might be able to achieve despite the high technical hurdles. Looking back, Sumitomo Chemical got its start by producing fertilizer from the gasses emitted from the Sumitomo family’s copper smelters. It means that the Company was founded with a mission rooted in both the obligation to overcome environmental problems and the contribution to agriculture by supplying fertilizer. This history has an extremely close affinity to our current efforts toward carbon neutrality, and our spirit of working toward carbon neutrality is embedded in the DNA of every employee, so to speak.
Yoshitaka: Environmental problems are no longer negative externalities, but are becoming a growth factor for compa- nies. The very fact that Sumitomo Chemical has experience dating back to its founding in environmental initiatives raises our expectations that you might be able to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Yoshitaka: How will you approach to the reduction of greenhouse gasses your company emits, which you frame as your obligation ?
Iwata: In 2018, we became the world’s first diversified chemical company to receive certification from the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative for reduction targets, and we have been working since then to achieve goals set based on the 2°C target in the Paris Accords. In line with these goals, we have achieved a reduction of about 20% in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, from a baseline of 9.54 million tons in 2013 to 7.42 million tons in fiscal 2020. We achieved this by improving our business portfolio, through measures such as shutting down an ethylene plant in Chiba and replacing products with particularly high CO2 emissions. At the recent climate
   
30 Sumitomo Chemical Annual Report 2021 Special Dialogue
change summit, the Japanese government set a target of a 46% reduction compared to fiscal 2013 by fiscal 2030. To meet this new national target, we will reestablish our goals, in line with a target of well below 2°C, and we are now working toward reducing emissions by close to 50% compared to fiscal 2013 by fiscal 2030.
Yoshitaka: The 46% reduction by fiscal 2030 expressed by the Japanese government will certainly have a significant impact, and it might lead to a transformation in the struc- ture of industry. In these circumstances, it is quite impres- sive that you are realistically able to aim for a reduction of close to 50% by fiscal 2030.
Iwata: Obviously it will not be easy, but we have built up our track record to the point that it is not an absurd number. This is quite an important point, and there are many companies that, even if they can say their goal is carbon neutrality by 2050, cannot say they will achieve a 50% reduction by 2030, because 2030 is coming right up. To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, however, you will never make it in time if you start in 2045, for example. Accordingly, we are aiming for a reduction of close to 50% by 2030 and taking every measure as early as possible to deliver results and make steady progress. Now let me give you an overall picture of Sumitomo Chemical’s greenhouse gas emissions. In the chemical industry, we apply energy to raw materials in the form of electricity or heat from steam to promote chemical reactions, converting the raw materials into products. Of our 7.42 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, about 70% of that is energy-derived, broadly speaking, while about 30% is process-derived, generated by chemical reactions and waste processing. Currently, the steam that is the primary heat source of chemical plants is generated using fossil fuels, so we will consider electrifying all of our steam generation, presuming that we will use electricity derived entirely from renewable energy sources in the future. This will require a great deal of innovation. Yoshitaka: I am so impressed to hear that you are heading in the direction of full electrification. Shifting to renewable energy sources is not something that can be easily done
There is a story to Sumitomo Chemical’s strategy. I look forward to seeing you take the lead toward carbon neutrality in
the industrial sector as a whole.

by a single chemical company on its own in Japan, so I am sure that it will be an extremely difficult decision to first proceed with electrification, assuming that the electricity will be derived from renewable sources in the future. Iwata: If we do not presume a shift to electricity derived from renewable sources, achieving carbon neutrality in the manufacturing industry will be extremely difficult. At the same time, for the process-derived emissions, we will need to aim for zero emissions through the use of carbon negative technologies, such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).
Yoshitaka: The path you have laid out toward zero green- house gas emissions for your company is extremely easy to understand, and I think it will resonate with ESG investors.
Technology Unique to Sumitomo Chemical
Yoshitaka: The government has created the Climate Innovation Finance Strategy in order to promote invest- ment in companies that are working on innovation aimed at significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions or a steady transition in response to climate change. To take advantage of this opportunity, it is indispensable for a company to promote specific technologies that can catch the eyes of ESG investors and bring in funds. What sorts of technologies does Sumitomo Chemical have in this regard? Iwata: First, we have the products and technologies that have been designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions*, and among them there are several that contribute to mitigating or adapting to climate change. Some examples of products that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions include methionine, an animal feed additive that can reduce the amount of nitrogen in livestock waste, and separators for lithium-ion secondary batteries, which are used in electric vehicles. The number of the products and technologies designated as Sumika Sustainable Solutions has reached 57, and the total annual sales of these solutions now amount to around 500 billion yen. While we are making a contribution through these products and technologies, we

 are working on the development of a number of new tech- nologies. We are focusing on carbon cycle technologies by capitalizing on our expertise as a chemical company, and in particular, we place a high priority on chemical recycling, which is sometimes called the ultimate form of recycling. We are working together with a variety of companies, uni- versities, and public bodies to develop these technologies. For example, we are collaborating with SEKISUI CHEMICAL on technology to manufacture ethylene from municipal waste, with the Muroran Institute of Technology on tech- nology to manufacture olefins from plastic waste, and with Shimane University on technology to synthesize methanol from plastic waste and other sources.
Yoshitaka: In addition to climate change, ESG investors are particularly concerned about biodiversity. Chemical recycling enables us to recycle plastics and other waste in a closed loop and prevent them from being disposed of elsewhere, so it can reduce our impact on the natural world, and thereby contribute to biodiversity as well as climate change.
Iwata: Chemical recycling is an area where we can lever- age our technology. We would like to accelerate research and development in this field going forward. I touched on CCUS technology earlier, which consists of both technology to selectively capture CO2 and technology to convert CO2 into chemical products. In the first area, we are currently developing a low energy, high efficiency CO2 separation technology using functional membranes, and in the second area, we are working on the development of methanol syn- thesis technology with Shimane University as I mentioned earlier. We are also engaged in a joint project to develop technology that can replace the fuel for naphtha cracking with ammonia. Finally, direct air capture (DAC) has received a lot of attention as the ultimate carbon negative technology, but the massive energy and cost requirements are an issue. This is why we focus on plants, and we are currently developing EcoDAC, a set of technologies that utilize the ecosystem. As an example of EcoDAC, there is a technology that increases the amount of CO2 absorbed

by plants by applying a type of fungus to the soil to activate plants. If we could use this to increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by existing plants by 10%, we would be able to contribute to reducing CO2 by massive amounts, more efficiently than reforestation. This is an area where we can fully capitalize on insights from our crop protection prod- ucts and fertilizers. We are currently in the experimental phase with this technology, and scientific data collection is currently underway at an American university.
Yoshitaka: That’s very interesting. From the perspective of focusing on plants, the CDP also views forest-related infor- mation disclosure as an important issue, perhaps we could say even as important as biodiversity, so I absolutely hope you will work on this as a pioneering business. You have clear stories for all of the technologies I have heard about from you to this point, and they are also all connected to your value chain. One of the points ESG investors focus most on is whether top management can present a strate- gic narrative about their company. You have a clear story for your strategy, and I hope you present it in a way that makes its appeal easy to understand.
Expectations of Sumitomo Chemical
Yoshitaka: Hearing about Sumitomo Chemical’s response to climate change and your strategy for carbon neutrality has raised my expectations quite high. I have gotten the impression that achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is not just words, it is something that I can envision in reality. While there are some companies whose mindsets do not really change, I would hope that Sumitomo Chemical not only takes the lead in the chemical industry, but becomes a leading presence in the industrial sector as a whole. Iwata: Carbon neutrality is not something that will ever be achieved just by aiming for it. We will continue to show steady progress toward carbon neutrality by 2050, based on a strategy that is supported by science and is charac- teristic of Sumitomo Chemical. Thank you for speaking with me today.

Accelerate the Development of Next-generation Businesses
   Despite increasing uncertainty over the busi- ness environment surrounding Sumitomo Chemical, the chemical industry has a large role to play in addressing social issues including environment, energy, and food issues, and business opportunities for the Company are also expanding. The Corporate Business Plan started in fiscal 2019 set four priority areas: healthcare, reducing environ- mental impact, food, and ICT. We will work in these areas to resolve issues to create a sustainable society through our business. In these key areas, we will focus on accel- erating the development of next-generation businesses.
Focus Domains in the Four Priority Areas
 In order to ensure that R&D and business development in the four priority areas lead to the development of next-generation businesses, we are constructing an innovation ecosystem (a system that creates continuous innovation).
● Obtaining Technologies Available from Partners
We will obtain technologies we need to have through collaboration with startups and academia, and supplement gaps in our busi- ness competencies through partnerships with, or investments in, external companies and startups. We are contacting startups and academic institutions, and have expanded our activities by setting up three Corporate Venturing & Innovation offices to search for promising technologies: Cambridge, in the UK, and San Francisco and Boston in the U.S. We are also enhancing our ability to con- duct proofs of concept to evaluate the competitiveness of our com- petitors’ technologies by validating the effectiveness and feasibility of technologies Corporate Venturing & Innovation has found.
● Full Implementation of Stage-gate Management System In discussions of potential research topics, a stage-gate manage- ment system has been fully implemented from fiscal 2019 and has begun operation.

      Sumitomo Chemical vs the COVID-19 Pandemic
    We would like to express our sincere condolences for those who have passed away due to complications of COVID-19, and our heartfelt sympathies for those currently suffering from the disease. In addition, we would like to express our deep respect for all those who are working hard to stop the spread of the pandemic, particularly those in the medical field.
Impact on Our Business
In fiscal 2020, while our businesses in the Petrochemicals & Plastics sector and Energy & Functional Materials sector were affected by the spread of the COVID- 19 pandemic, particularly in products for automotive-related applications, the semiconductor and display-related businesses of the IT-related Chemicals sector grew on demand from stay-at-home and work-from-home needs. In addition, the performance of the Health & Crop Sciences sector and the Pharmaceuticals sector was largely unaffected by the pandemic. Thus, in these circumstances of extreme change due to COVID-19, we were able to employ the defensive strength of a diversified chemical company, conducting a diverse range of businesses. Despite the massive changes in the business environment, the five business sectors of our company support one another, with the core strength to continue to grow.

   Our Contribution to Society During the Pandemic
With our five business sectors, we were able to contribute to preventing the spread of the disease in multiple areas. In addition to supplying polyethylene film as a raw material for medical gowns, supplying acrylic sheets to prevent the spread of drop- lets, and supplying the precursors for remdesivir, a pharmaceutical, we have also taken action on a variety of other fronts, including participating in the COVID-19 Research Database consortium, which made a database of medical information available to researchers for free. Going forward, we will continue to utilize the chemical industry’s wide range of strengths to meet the various need of society, contributing to bringing this emergency situation to a close.
Now is the Time to Deploy Our Strength as a Diversified Chemical Company
Supplying Polyethylene Film for Agricultural Use as a Raw Material for Medical Gowns
In light of a shortage of disposable medical gowns worn by healthcare staff, from among the types of polyethylene film we provide for other applications, we provided priority emergency supplies of film suited for this application to companies that manufacture medical gowns from April through July of 2020. The amount supplied is equivalent to 2.3 million medical gowns. The plastic raw material for this film is produced at the Chiba Works, and the film itself is processed and produced by SanTerra, a Group company, using this plastic. It was very encouraging for employees to know that they were contributing to resolving a shortage of protective equipment on the medical front lines.

      PMI* Under COVID-19
Acquisition of South American Crop Protection Businesses
In 2020, Sumitomo Chemical acquired four South American subsidiaries (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Colombia) from Nufarm. Due to the global spread of COVID-19, which was not foreseen when plans were initially made, the integration process with our existing South American businesses proceeded under a variety of restrictions. * Post Merger Integration
What difficulties did you face due to the spread of COVID-19 in the area?
Just keeping the PMI proceeding steadily was already difficult, but an integration while facing problems with physical distancing under these sorts of circumstances was even more difficult. There were any number of issues, but our biggest issue was building relationships of trust with our new stakeholders. It is essential to be close with people, particularly in South America, but the relevant people were scattered across a variety of locations in South America, Japan, and the US, and our movements were also restricted, so we had to build relationships of trust while not being able to actually meet and speak to one another, so even more effort was required.
How did you build relationships of trust despite the restrictions on movement?
We put a high value on speaking directly with one another, creating opportunities for team members to gather together, even if only through online video. In addition, we also put effort into training for the leadership team, conveying the importance of Sumitomo Chemical’s culture of listening with respect to the views of our colleagues.
What do you think was the reason for your smooth progress with the PMI, despite COVID-19?
The high professionalism of our team and our commitment. It is because of COVID-19 that we worked so hard and did our best. For example, because there is a significant time difference between Japan and South America, we held any number of conversations at times that equate to early morning in Japan. For this reason, despite being separated by huge distances, everyone understood the situation at that time, and was able to fulfill their role, which meant we were able to keep over 650 PMI actions on track. In addition, I think the fact that both the former Nufarm and Sumitomo Chemical share an approach that puts the customer first is a major reason we were able to secure important customers even during this integration period between the companies.
What are your plans going forward?
The current PMI is already largely completed, and our crop protection business in South America is producing results in line with expectations. Going forward, we are working to launch INDIFLINTM, the new fungicide, locally, and to expand sales of biorationals. We have set a high sales growth target in our crop protection business in South America going forward. To achieve this, I would like our team to come together and work hard with a positive attitude, not giving in to COVID-19.

Arabia, we are manufacturing cost-competitive products, taking advantage of the low prices of raw materials and fuel in that region.
Basic Strategy
Currently, we are working to enhance our ability to offer solutions through high value-added products in Japan and Singapore and to achieve stable plant operations in Saudi Arabia. Initiatives in Fiscal 2020
The completion guarantee for the Rabigh Phase II Plant has been terminated. Moreover, in order to contribute to the creation of a post-carbon society and a circular economy, we are not only pushing forward with technology development relating to material recycling and chemical recycling, we are also advancing initiatives to have the results of that development deployed in society.
Issues in the Future
Continuing stable operations at the plant in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia, including in the phase II section, remains an important challenge for us. We are developing high value-added uses of poly- olefin in Japan and Singapore, and strengthening our license business. Furthermore, we are work- ing on R&D on carbon cycle chemistry, including chemical recycling, to create a sustainable society. Long-term Vision
Going forward, we will not only continue to enhance our strengths in these three locations, but will also aim to consistently achieve a return on assets in excess of our cost of capital by work- ing to streamline assets, including working capital.

 Q&A Environmental Strategy
Q Asthemovementtoreduceenvironmentalimpactexpands, what is the strategy of the Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector ?
A We are not only working to expand the scale of existing business, we are also focusing on initiatives such as shifting to higher value-added products and our licensing and catalyst business for technologies developed in-house. In addition, we are contributing to efforts to improve the environment, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by developing outstanding technology that reduces environmental impact. By commercializing these technologies, we aim to contribute to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of society as a whole, while also creating ongoing profits.
   License / Catalyst
● Propylene Oxide (PO)-only Process
The PO-only process, developed by Sumitomo Chemical, is the world’s first successfully commercialized cumene-based PO-only production process, based on utilizing cumene recirculation. The process produces no byproducts, and when combined with a proprietarily developed high-performance epoxidized catalyst, provides high yields, reduced energy costs, and high operational stability. This sort of technology license contributes to reducing environmental impact even outside of Sumitomo Chemical’s factories.
● Catalyst Business
Sumitomo Chemical conducts development and sales for high- performance catalysts that maximize the effects of licensed technologies and contribute to reducing environmental impact. Because these catalysts can be expected to secure stable returns in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we are focus- ing on expanding this business.
Technological Development / Catalyst
 ● Material Recycling and Chemical Recycling
We are working to develop and commercialize material recycling technology, which turns used plastics and other wastes back into resources that can then be used in new products, and chemical recycling technology, which chemically converts trash and used plastics into the raw materials used for new plastics.
● Effective Use of CO2
Within our petrochemical complex in Singapore, we are consid- ering combining propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, which produces propylene from propane, with a CO2 fixation tech- nology that synthesizes methanol very efficiently, using CO2 as a raw material, alongside the hydrogen produced as a byproduct of the PDH process. If this initiative succeeds, this could be a new breakthrough that can both reduce environmental impact, by reducing the amount of CO2 emitted from chemical plants and other facilities, and also improve economic performance by increasing the production of certain products.
 P66
    Status of Global Expansion
Global Expansion Using the Strengths of Each Location
The Petrochemicals & Plastics Sector has three major production locations: Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and Japan, and we are devel- oping our business by utilizing the strengths of each location.
● Singapore
We expanded its business to Singapore in the 1970s, producing and selling petrochemical products. Currently, PCS*1 produces products such as ethylene and propylene, TPC*2 produces products such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and Sumitomo Chemical Asia produces MMA. We have developed high value- added products and produced stable supplies of high-quality products in Singapore for many years, building extremely strong relationships of trust with customers, while creating high brand value in the Asian market.
● Saudi Arabia
Petro Rabigh, a joint venture with Saudi Aramco, produces all sorts of petrochemical products. The strength of the Rabigh project, as shown on the next page, is its cost advantage due to utilizing ethane. We are focusing on stable production in order to maximize this advantage.
● Japan
In addition to producing and selling products primarily aimed at customers in Japan, our facilities serve as centers for research and development, developing new technologies and high value- added products while also undertaking initiatives aimed at reduc- ing environmental impact. In addition, as the core of our licensing business, our facilities in Japan also handle not only technology development, but also production, sales, and other duties relating to catalysts.

 System for Providing Added Value
Competitive Advantages of Rabigh Project
Procuring ethane from Saudi Aramco as the main feedstock offers out- standing cost competitiveness, as raw material prices can be fixed at lower levels compared to competitors using naphtha as feedstock, and margins will expand as product prices increase, among other factors. In addition, it is the world’s largest integrated complex, which leads to competitive advantages due to lower unit costs.
Major Processes Generating Competitive Advantages
Petro Rabigh produces products such as PP, PE, and PO, using tech- nology licenses from Sumitomo Chemical, which boasts world-class technology. Moreover, the local staffs’ operational technique is improving by receiving training at overseas facilities, particularly in Singapore. Moreover, Sumitomo Chemical Asia, which handles sales, has facilities throughout Asia, shortening delivery times and reducing logistics costs.
Providing Customer Value
Because there are risks of obstructions to procurement in the Middle East region of Asia, where logistics can be unstable, customers have a strong desire for accurate and stable product delivery. By having inventory in locations close to customers, we can meet these needs by offering sales with more reliable and shorter delivery times than competitors, securing a high level of trust. In addition, while it has the flexibility to change a certain volume of sales and customers according to market conditions in each region, by focusing more on continued sales to core customers, the company further increases the reliability of its stable supply. Through these efforts, Sumitomo Chemical Asia is working to build long-term relationships with customers.
Cost Difference of Petrochemical Feedstocks
Petro Rabigh produces a variety of petroleum and petrochemical products using crude oil and cost-competitive ethane from Saudi Aramco as its primary feedstocks.

 Q&A Future Developments in Separators
Q Whatkindoffuturedevelopmentsareyouthinkingaboutfor the separator business?
A Because of the impact of stricter environmental regulations in countries, the scale of the market for electric vehicles is pro- jected to expand to sales of over 40 million vehicles in 2030, and demand for separators will expand accordingly.
There are two main issues to address for environmentally friendly vehicles to become widespread. The first is cruising distance, and lithium-ion secondary batteries are continuing to evolve, primarily with expanded capacity. At the same time, the requested characteristics of separators are being further raised, and there is an increasingly broad scope for leveraging the supe- riority of aramid coatings. The other major issue is cost, and there is a need to significantly reduce the price of lithium-ion secondary batteries, which account for over half a vehicle’s cost. There is also a strong demand to reduce the cost of separators, and com- petition is becoming more severe with the emergence of ceramic coating separators and Chinese manufacturers. Accordingly, we are rethinking the materials used and the manufacturing process in order to significantly reduce costs.
In addition to these initiatives, in order to meet a dramatic
expansion in future customer demand, we are quickly expanding our production capacity and promoting an expansion of our sep- arator business.

Consumers
  Sumitomo Chemical purchases raw materials, and manufactures substrates for separators and aramid resin. The company produces aramid separators by coating both substrates manufactured in-house and purchased substrates with aramid resin. Lithium-ion secondary batteries, which battery manufacturers make by combining various components and materials, are widely used in automobiles and energy storage systems.
 Sumitomo Chemical’s Competitive Advantages
The use of coated separators has become mainstream for lithium-ion secondary batteries. Among separator coat- ings, there are mainly ceramic coatings and aramid coatings, and almost all producers of separators are making ceramic coating separators. On the other hand, our aramid coating separators were used earlier in automobiles compared to other companies’ products, and they have a track record for many years as high-quality and high- performance separators. Compared to products from other companies, they have superior safety (heat resistance), and they have been made lighter, weighing just kilograms for each electric vehicle, delivering customers added value that is different from other companies. In order to further strengthen the superiority of our aramid separator, we are conducting research to enhance the strength of the separators and reduce their thickness.
Major Processes Generating Competitive Advantages
We are not only conducting research and development of separators but also working on improving productivity. We are capable of applying a uniform aramid coating with industry-leading speed, while maintaining high quality. Productivity at the plant of SSLM in South Korea has tripled since 2015 due to factors such as more advanced techniques, accumulated experience, and improvements in coating equipment. We expect further productivity improvement in the future.
Providing Customer Value
Customers and consumers need electric vehicles and other environmentally friendly vehicles with a long cruising range, and for that type of environmentally friendly vehicle, it is essential to have high-quality, high-performance batteries. Our direct customers, the battery manufacturers, seek to manufacture batteries that provide that per- formance at the lowest possible cost. For that reason, we provide high-safety (heat resistant) separators, and we are working to improve productivity to be able to provide products with superior cost competitiveness. We also periodically communicate with customers to hear what new needs they have, and then work to develop products that can meet those needs.
   Added Value Provided to Society
Contributing to Measures against Climate Change
through the Separator Business
With more rigorous environmental regulations being put in place all over the world, the shift to environmentally friendly vehicles like EV is accelerating. Environmentally friendly vehicles loaded with lithium-ion secondary batteries can reduce energy consumption as compared with gasoline cars. Separators are essential components in creating highly safe lithium-ion secondary batteries, and are indispensable for environmentally friendly vehicles to gain ground. Sumitomo Chemical contributes to measures against climate change through its separator business.

  Q&A Meeting the Demand for Semiconductors
Q WhatSpecificActionsareYouTakingtoReliablyCaptureDemandforSemiconductorMaterials?
A Background: In the semiconductor market, demand is expected to grow for cutting-edge semiconductors going forward, due to background factors such as the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the full-scale commercializa- tion of next-generation communication systems (5G). With the expectation that EUV lithographic exposure, a new type of light source, will become dominant in this field, there will be demand for photoresists suited for even greater miniaturization in pattern formation.
Our Strengths: We have established excellent product design and evaluation techniques based on the organic synthesis technologies cultivated in our various fine chemical businesses, and we have ever expanded our business by utilizing our ability to respond to our customers quickly, which was realized on the basis of the concentration of manufacturing, research, and sales functions, primarily in our Osaka Works. In particular, we have a high global market share in photoresists for immersion ArF lithographic exposure, which is mainly used in the formation processes of miniaturized circuit, due to our performance advan- tages and reliability in quality. In addition, we not only expect to increase shipments of photoresists for EUV lithographic exposure,
to align with the mass production schedule of major customers that have decided to adopt our products, we are also continuing development of new EUV photoresists to accommodate even greater miniaturization needs for securing future orders. Specific Actions: In fiscal 2019, we completed a new plant for cutting-edge photoresists, which began operations in fiscal 2020. In addition, in order to strengthen our semiconductor photoresist development and evaluation structures to handle cutting-edge processes, we decided to build a new facility at the Osaka Works and to deploy new evaluation equipments. We aim to complete these efforts by the first half of fiscal 2022. Moreover, we also decided to increase our production capacity for semiconductor photoresists aimed at cutting-edge processes, adding new production lines at the Osaka Works. These new production lines are planned to begin operations in the first half of fiscal 2022. Due to factors such as the ever increasing speed and volume of data transmission, the semiconductor market is expected to continue to grow going forward. Because we forecast that our production capacity will be strained by around 2025, we are considering further improving our business systems in view of long-term demand.
 Aiming for Dramatic Business Expansion
 Semiconductor Business Sales Revenue: 1.5x* by the Mid-2020s
(Including photoresists, processing chemicals for semiconductors, and compound semiconductors) * Compared to results for FY2020
Status of Global Expansion
  Building a Market Oriented Supply Chain
We have worked to build a market oriented global supply chain, building good relationships with customers by establishing our pro- duction facilities close to customer manufacturing facilities, compre- hending their needs and developing/supplying products as quickly as possible. Specifically, the Sumika Electronic Materials Group in China has about 10 facilities, which conduct their businesses in such a way as to respond to the needs of their respective customers. In recent years, we have strengthened local production capabilities, by taking measures such as converting XUYOU Electronic Materials (Wuxi) into a subsidiary in 2018, expanding production facilities for polarizing films, and expanding production capacity for processing chemicals for semiconductors in Xi’an and Changzhou. These achievements have become one of our company’s strengths. As a result of building a business network centered in East Asia, the global center of display and semiconductor production, our sector has ever increased its sales income from outside Japan year by year. Within Japan, in addition to manufacturing display materials mainly at the Ohe Works and semiconductor materials mainly at the Osaka Works, we have also worked to strengthen our businesses in these fields, which are expected to grow going forward, for example, by establishing SCIOCS after acquisition of Hitachi Metals’ compound semiconductor material business in 2015, or converting SANRITZ into a subsidiary in 2019, which has a competitive advantage in polarizing films for automobile use.

System for Providing Added Value
Sumitomo Chemical’s Competitive Advantages
Even as we are going head-to-head against multiple competitors of polarizing film in improving quality, our unique strength is in the liquid crystal material used in circularly polarizing film for OLED displays. Our circularly polarizing film which incorporates the optical film made from this liquid crystal material, developed in-house, offers outstanding functionality to display real blacks by limiting reflections of ambient lights such as sunlight or indoor lighting on displays and constant color no matter what angle they are viewed from. For this reason, they contribute to the creation of OLED displays with extremely high image quality.
Major Processes Generating Competitive Advantages
We are aggressively conducting research on liquid crystal materials which can be coated on films. In order to develop retardation and polarizing functions using liquid crystal materials, the liquid crystal molecules must be system- atically oriented in a specific direction. We are working to develop molecular designs that will achieve this sort of optical performance. Moreover, we are also manufacturing liquid crystal materials in-house, and optimizing optical designs for circularly polarizing film suitable for the various OLED displays of TVs and smartphones.
Providing Customer Value
Customers are designing next-generation displays in order to create entirely new devices. To reach the level of development requirements from our cus- tomers, we are proposing high-functionality materials, for flexible OLED dis- plays, multi-functional flexible materials that realize foldable and even rollable displays, for large-sized OLED displays, polymer light emitting materials that will lead to improved display quality and lower production costs, and even for ultra-small, ultra-fine next-generation displays applicable for AR/VR/MR glasses, color conversion materials that will enhance the optical characteristics of them through quantum dots or color photoresists technologies.
     Added Value Provided to Society
Creating More Abundant and Convenient Daily Lives for People
Displays are the interfaces between people and ICT, and will continue to evolve alongside changes in people’s lifestyles and the progress in com- munications technology, part of the infrastructure of society. In addition to displays that provide even better portability or even more realistic viewing experiences, new displays, which are indispensable for technologies such as mixed reality, are being developed actively and these technologies even might change the nature of peoples’ experiences. By developing and pro- ducing materials and components for OLED displays and next-generation displays, Sumitomo Chemical is contributing to the creation of new items that have never existed before, and thereby creating more abundant and more convenient daily lives for everyone.

 Q&A Ranking among the Leading Global Producers
Q Inrecentyears,themajorcropprotectioncompaniesoutsideJapanhave undergone a consolidation, and the gap between the scale of
Sumitomo Chemical’s crop protection business and that of
the major companies is widening, so how do you plan to compete going forward?
A With the mergers of Dow and DuPont in 2017 and Bayer and Monsanto in 2018, two major players were born. At the moment, however, we have no plans to emulate them and merge with another company. We will employ the following three strategies to secure a place among our global competitors.
Compete on Our Research and Development Capabilities
Living things will inevitably develop resistances to crop protection products over the course of time. For this reason, it is necessary to continually develop new crop protection products, and research and development capabilities are extremely important to achieve this. The number of patents we hold compares favorably with those of major crop pro- tection companies outside Japan, and we intend to compete going forward as a crop protection company based on our research and development capabilities.

Compete on Our Extensive Global Footprint
Up until a few years ago, our global footprint did not mea- sure up when compared with the major players, who have the ability to deliver products to all sorts of regions around the world. In recent years, however, in addition to our acquisition of Excel Crop Care in 2016, we also acquired the South American business of Nufarm in 2020, among other
initiatives, making steady progress in our efforts to strengthen our global footprint. In addition, we are not only selling the crop protection products we have developed using our own global footprint, we are also selling them as part of pest control systems offered by major crop protection companies outside Japan, enabling us to access an even broader range of regions.
Compete on the Twin Pillars of Biorationals and
Chemical Crop Protection Products
The mergers of the major players outside Japan seems to have been primarily aimed at strengthening their lineups of chem- ical crop protection products and genetically modified crops, but we have no intention of entering the field of genetically modified crops because the field requires large-scale invest- ment, and is the main battleground of major crop protection companies outside Japan. We will utilize our unique research and development capabilities in the fields of chemical crop protection and in the biorationals market, where we are the world leader, competing with a distinctive product lineup as our weapon. The growth of the market for biorationals is expected to accelerate going forward, and we foresee that the major crop protection companies outside Japan will also enter this market in full force, and competition will escalate. We are focusing on strengthening our business even further in this field, securing our position as the leading company.

 The global expansion of our crop protection business began in the early 1960s when we started exporting the pesticide Sumithion to North America. Since then, following on from the establishment of Valent U.S.A. in 1988, we have been building up research, production, and sales facilities around the globe. Because climate and crops vary widely depending on the region, we have built a system that enables us to develop products suited for a particular region, and to respond quickly to the needs of the region. We have been expanding our facilities in the world’s major crop protection markets, including the US and Europe, Asia, and South America, and of the countries with the six largest crop protection markets around the world, we are currently securing or strengthening our sales capabilities in five of them.

Q&A Towards the “Post-LATUDA” Era
Q Whatsortofprogresshaveyoumadeinpreparingforthepost-Latudaera?
A We launched relugolix and vibegron in the US this year, which we acquired through our strategic alliance with Roivant. Going forward, we are aiming to maximize the product value of the two drugs as soon as possible. Beyond that, we are also pushing ahead even faster with research and development into promising future blockbusters, raising new pillars to support the income of our segment after the loss of the exclusivity period for Latuda® in the US.
Development Status of Relugolix and Vibegron
The sales exclusivity period for Latuda®, the core of the income of the Pharmaceuticals segment, will end in February 2023 in the US, and we are filling that hole in revenue primarily with relugolix and vibegron. We aim to maximize product value as soon as pos- sible, and for relugolix, Myovant*1, which handles the product, is collaborating with Pfizer on development and commercialization. In addition, for vibegron, we have made Urovant, which handles the product, into a wholly-owned subsidiary, and we aim to maximize the value of the product through collaboration on logistics and pro- motion using the sales platform of Sunovion, a US-based subsidiary.
*1 Myovant Sciences Ltd. (“Myovant”) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Group holds approximately 53% of the outstanding shares of Myovant. This material contains information about Myovant, which is based on information disclosed by Myovant.
Aiming for Further Growth
We are also making further progress in the development of new treatments to support our long-term growth. We are focusing on setting up sales of KYNMOBI® (treatment for off episodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease), which was launched in the US in September 2020. In addition, SEP-363856, which is expected to serve as a next-generation antipsychotic therapy, has been designated as a breakthrough therapy*2 by the FDA, and we are making progress in development with a goal of launching the drug in the US in fiscal 2023, while also conducting trials to broaden its range of indications.

About 60% of the revenue in our Pharmaceuticals segment comes from outside Japan, and one of the features of our Pharmaceuticals segment is its global reach, centered in Japan, North America, and China. Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma had always aimed to expand to the US, beginning global development of Latuda® internally in 2007 while also building a foundation in the US with the acquisition of the former Sepracor (now Sunovion) in 2009, then successfully launching Latuda® in the US market in 2011. Since then, Latuda® has grown to be a blockbuster, and revenues from outside Japan increased significantly. Currently, we are focused on establishing a path to growth in view of the post-Latuda. In addition, growth in demand for pharmaceuticals throughout Asia has been significant, including China, which has the world’s second-highest level of demand, so it is a region where we expect sustained growth going forward. Currently we are building our sales structure to increase our presence in the market, enhancing the capabilities of our subsidiaries and strengthening collaboration with local partners. For other regions, we plan to maximize revenue by collaborating with partners.

 Sumitomo Chemical aims to take a range of multifaceted approaches unique to a diversified chemical company, in our initiatives to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 from the following four perspectives.
To minimize greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Group’s production activities through innovation, and provide and deploy new technologies across the world.
To drive innovations for greenhouse gas emissions reduction regarding materials used in society,
and provide products and solutions that contribute to carbon neutrality from a Life Cycle Assessment* perspective.
To actively engage in the development of technologies for recovery, separation, use and storage of greenhouse gasses emitted from other industries and from communities,
and help the process by becoming part of a system that implements such technologies in society.
To take on the long-term challenge of developing carbon negative technologies to reduce the absolute volume of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.
* Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): A method for quantitatively assessing the environmental impact of a certain product or service across its entire life cycle, from the procurement of raw materials to its use and disposal.

 Introduction to Management Strategy Creating Value Corporate Data 61 Sumitomo Chemical through Business
Technology Development Aimed at Generating Innovation
Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 will not only require the maximal use of the best available technology, such as fuel conversion and current energy-saving technologies, but also the generation of innovation going forward. Sumitomo Chemical
  aims to develop a wide range of technologies aimed at achieving carbon them in society.
We are developing chemical recycling technology that can convert garbage and plastic waste prod- ucts into basic raw materials for chemical products, such as methanol, ethanol, and olefins, and then use those materials to create new plastics.
Plastic Resource Circulation P66
One issue in the Society 5.0 concept is the increase in CO2 emissions from the electricity necessary for transmitting massive volumes of data. In light of this, our company is contributing to creating energy-saving power supplies by providing compound semiconductor materials for next-generation power semiconductors. In addition, in response to the spread of electric vehi- cles, which is expected to accelerate going forward, we are working to develop next-generation storage batteries, such as solid-state batteries.
We are developing manufacturing technology to create a method for generating hydrogen at low costs and without creating CO2 using methane as a raw material. In addition, we are also considering developing “turquoise” hydrogen* technology, which, despite using petroleum as a raw material, does not generate CO2.
* “Turquoise” hydrogen: hydrogen that falls in between “green” hydrogen and “blue” hydrogen “Green” hydrogen : Hydrogen manufactured from non-petroleum-based raw materials without
generating CO2
“Blue” hydrogen: Hydrogen manufactured from petroleum in a way that generates CO2, but
where the CO2 is captured and not released into the atmosphere
We are developing a technology whereby attaching certain types of fungi that exist in nature to the roots of plants and allowing them to coexist, we not only promote the absorption of CO2 by plants through photosynthesis, we also fix CO2 in the ground in the form of carbon compounds. This will enable ordinary fields, forests, and other natural spaces to absorb and fix even greater amounts of CO2, contributing a net negative amount of carbon to the atmosphere.

We utilize GHG emissions reduction targets as metrics for climate change risks. These targets were certified by the SBT initiative, the first such targets to be certified for any diversified chemical company in the world. To achieve these targets, we made Group-wide GHG emissions (Scope 1+2) a key performance indicator, and we are promoting measures such as switching to liquid natural gas as a fuel, deploying the latest high-efficiency devices, and thoroughly implementing energy-saving measures. In addition, to reduce GHG emissions for Scope 3, we began engaging with our major suppliers about setting goals for reducing GHG emissions in 2019.
In recent years, however, various countries, including Japan, have declared that they will achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and in view of the goal promoted by the Japanese government of reducing GHG emissions by 46% by fiscal 2030*, we are considering
    Science Based Targets (SBT)
setting challenging goals in line with this target, and having them once again certified by the SBT initiative.

Glass-fiber Reinforced Recycled Polypropylene Material
This material, made with our proprietary, advanced manufac- turing and quality control technologies, boasts properties high enough to replace virgin polypropylene, even though it contains over 60% by weight recycled polypropylene. This technology, meeting the EU’s End of Life Vehicles (ELV) Directive and circular economy policies, has been highly rated by automobile manufacturers for its quality, cost, stable procurement, and the stable physical properties of the product, and is contributing to the promotion of recycling and resource saving.
  We are engaged in the research and development of chemical recycling technology, processes that chemically convert municipal and plastic waste and use them as new raw materials for plastics. We are working on this extremely challenging endeavor by leveraging our catalyst design and chemical processing design technologies, while also collaborating with partners. With chemical recycling technology, we will help to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the amount of plastic waste, and GHG emissions produced in incinerating plastic waste, and thereby contribute to building a sustainable society.

Research and Development
The capabilities to develop innovative solutions by leveraging its technological expertise in diverse areas is one of Sumitomo Chemical’s strengths. This section introduces the activities of two researchers from among those working to promote technology, research, and development around the world, who are involved in the development of mycorrhizal fungal products and the creation of new businesses.
  Case 1
Aiming to Develop New Mycorrhizal Fungal Products that Contribute to Sustainable Agriculture
as Soon as Possible
I work on the Biorational Team at the Health & Crop Sciences Research Laboratory in Takarazuka, conducting research and development on products using mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi are a type of fungi that live in the soil and coexist with plants, receiving energy sources such as sugar, a product of photosynthesis, from plants, and in return supplying the plants with water and fertilizer components absorbed from the soil. This exchange promotes the growth of plants, and can be expected to contribute to greater stability in yields. By deploying products that utilize mycorrhizal fungi, it may become possible to secure sufficient yields even in soil that is lacking in nutrients or in regions where water is scarce, which can contribute to increased food supplies to meet the grow- ing global population. In addition, because these products can also reduce the impact of unusual weather conditions, such as droughts, on yields, they can also be expected to limit the risk of food supply shortages and the outbreak of conflicts over resources.
Because products that utilize mycorrhizal fungi are naturally derived biorational products, they are becoming increasingly important in responding to the need to reduce the burden on the environment, which has been increasing in recent years. Moreover, mycorrhizal fungi promote the efficient absorption of CO2 by plants, offering the hidden possibility of contributing to carbon neutrality as well.

  Cambridge Display Technology
For about 13 years, I have worked at Cambridge Display Technology (CDT), a Sumitomo Chemical Group company located near Cambridge in the UK. As one of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s research facilities in Europe, we seek novel functional materials, conduct research and development, and undertake related activities, such as technical surveys.
In 2020, I became a member of the newly formed Corporate Venturing and Innovation (CVI) team at CDT. The CVI team searches for technologies in startups and academia that will have synergies with Sumitomo Chemical’s businesses and research taking on the role of introducing new technologies, partners and creating new businesses for the Sumitomo Chemical Group.
The fields I have been involved with lately are materials related to 5G communication and decarbonization technologies. For materials relating to 5G communication, we are searching for startups that are researching substrate materials with low permittivity that will reduce signal loss within the substrate. Because the Sumitomo Chemical Group is already conducting multiple 5G-related research and development projects, in addition to our existing Super Engineering Plastics business, which is attracting attention as a sub- strate material suitable for 5G, we expect that by finding various outside technologies from startups and other sources that synergize with our existing technologies, we will be able to deliver even greater business expansion.
In terms of decarbonization technologies, we are focusing on searching for new tech- nologies that can extract and collect CO2 from the atmosphere and from exhaust gases, and convert it into high value-added materials. While there have been some commercial

  Basic Policy
Amid increasing uncertainty about the business environment surrounding Sumitomo Chemical, the role played by the chemical industry in solving societal issues, such as environmental, energy, and food issues, is enormous, and our business opportu- nities are expanding. Our research and development is based on the following basic policies: early market launch of development items; building the foundation of next-generation businesses; building and operating a system to continuously create innovation; and promoting R&D based on business (commercialization) strategies and intellectual property strategies.
 Multiple laboratories both inside and outside Japan are organically collaborating to push forward the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s research into developing new products. Alongside the Bioscience Research Laboratory and the Industrial Technology & Research Laboratory in Japan, both Valent Biosciences and Mycorrhizal Applications are also work- ing on this research, with the various laboratories combining their particular specialties with technology to maximize our pursuit of research results. Due to COVID-19, we have limited opportunities to meet face-to-face, but we are actively using tools such as online meetings to exchange information. Our ability to undertake research and development focused on the same goal under a global structure is one of the real strengths of the Sumitomo Chemical Group.
What the Biorational Team, which I am a part of, is focused on in this research and development process is taking on new challenges. We are boldly taking on the challenge of using new technologies and new experimental methods, broadening our experiences while continuing to hunger for new insights. One of the challenges my team is currently taking on is improving our productivity in research and development by deploying digital technology. By deploying technologies that automate tasks using cutting-edge digital technology, such as AI-based image recognition technology to distinguish types of fungus, for example, or isolating useful microbes that have not previously been utilized, we are able to quickly develop new products.
Going forward, I hope that we will not only further deepen the collaboration between laboratories in the Sumitomo Chemical Group, both inside and outside Japan, but also actively exchange views with research institutions outside the company, developing new mycorrhizal fungal products that contribute to sustainable agriculture as quickly as possible.

 demonstrations, novel developments in this field are still largely stuck at the laboratory level, and while there are many research projects which still face significant issues in devel- opment for commercial applications, we are actively searching for new technologies which will help accelerate the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s efforts to decarbonize.
The CVI team not only evaluates promising, relevant technologies from startups, aca- demia, and other sources by conducting proof of concept projects, we also research and evaluate the possibility of applying these technologies to new applications in the business areas that the Sumitomo Chemical Group is focusing on. In the process of conducting proof of concept studies, we engage in detailed discussions with experts, not just the researchers who have accumulated many years of experience at CDT, but also with experts in a variety of fields through our innovation network, particularly at University of Cambridge.
I am both pleased and honored that, through these efforts, we are able to acquire new core technologies and commercialize revolutionary products for the Sumitomo Chemical Group. Going forward, I hope to contribute to the process of research and development in society through my activities as part of the CVI team.

 Converting the Board of Directors to a Monitoring Board
Ikeda: I became an Outside Corporate Auditor for Sumitomo Chemical in 2011, and an Outside Director in 2015. Looking back on a decade as an outside executive, I feel that Sumitomo Chemical’s corporate governance has been steadily evolving. One major turning point was the fundamental changes made to the way the Board of Directors operates in October 2015. Previously, empha- sis had been placed on decision-making functions and voting on legal matters, but the scope of the Board’s deci- sion-making was narrowed down, and its monitoring and auditing functions were expanded. That was a period when moves to strengthen governance grew more active across the entire economic sphere, was it not?
Yoneda: In Japan, a new corporate governance code was established by the Financial Services Agency and the Tokyo Stock Exchange in June 2015. At the time, I was involved in the running of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the background to the formulation of this code was a recognition of the necessity of improving the ability of Japanese companies to generate profits in coordination with the government’s growth strategy, in order to boost the Japanese stock market out of the doldrums it had been in for the past quarter-century, and therefore the necessity
Koichi Ikeda
Outside Director
of enlivening boards of directors by incorporating diverse views from outside executives. There were also several scandals involving major companies at that time, and criticisms of the governance of Japanese companies from overseas investors was increasing.
I became an Outside Corporate Auditor in September of 2018, but I felt that, in light of the intent of the corpo- rate governance code and its own state as a company, Sumitomo Chemical has pursued a very grounded trans- formation. If the position of monitoring and auditing is too widely separated from the execution, then the Board of Directors will also not be able to fulfill its function as a monitoring board. Sumitomo Chemical has expanded the number of items that are reported (the amount of infor- mation provided) to outside executives, and as a result, meetings of the Board feature questions and insights from the diverse perspectives of the outside executives, resulting in extremely rich discussions.
Ikeda: Broadly speaking, the information gap with outside executives can often become an issue, but at Sumitomo Chemical, we have opportunities to get our hands on a lot of different information. Explanations relating to agenda items in advance of meetings of the Board are naturally provided, but Sumitomo Chemical also provides rotating reports* from not just business units, but also administrative units, cover- ing the broad range encompassed by diversified chemistry.
   Dialogue between Outside Executives
Sumitomo Chemical’s Governance Continues to Evolve
Koichi Ikeda, one of Sumitomo Chemical’s Outside Directors, and Michio Yoneda, one of the Company’s Outside Corporate Auditors, were asked to speak about their evaluation of the cur- rent state of Sumitomo Chemical’s governance initiatives and about issues going forward.

   Michio Yoneda
Outside Corporate Auditor
In addition, we have had opportunities to visit company facilities, including not only visits to plants in Japan twice a year, but also past visits to local Group companies in South Korea and Saudi Arabia. To be frank, I think that in the past, the boards of directors of many companies had become ceremonial, including Sumitomo Chemical. The number of Outside Directors at Sumitomo Chemical has now been expanded to four (including one woman), making for a highly effective Board of Directors with lively exchanges of views. The time required for meetings of the Board, which once could be finished in under thirty minutes, now often reaches as long as three hours.
* Rotating reports: Comprehensive, systematized reports with
a sizeable amount of time set aside for each sector.
Repeated Discussions to Ensure Healthy Risk-taking for Businesses
Yoneda: In order for outside executives to contribute to strengthening governance, it is extremely important for management to understand the role of outside executives. It is only when management and outside executives have a deeply rooted relationship of trust that they can have candid discussions. Each year, when assessing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors at Sumitomo Chemical, we do not simply listen to the report, we hold repeated discussions
about it. I think these discussions are extremely sincere, and the assessment of effectiveness has taken root as part of the company’s culture.
Ikeda: As you say, without understanding from manage- ment, the views of outside executives just become so much noise. Sumitomo Chemical has expanded our opportunities for communication with outside executives, but this is because there is already a relationship of trust with man- agement. For example, last year, at our request, space was created for outside executives to have small-scale informal meetings with the President and Chairman. Based on my own experience of being involved in management, I have proposed the creation of space for frank exchanges of views with management about issues of concern we have as outside executives, before bringing them up as topics of discussion in a board meeting. In recent years, Sumitomo Chemical had several large-scale projects, including major acquisitions and the Rabigh Phase II Project in Saudi Arabia. Outside executives have a monitoring and auditing function, but I think an important role for us is not just in criticism, but as cheerleaders for Sumitomo Chemical, boosting the Company’s business through repeated discussions of healthy risk-taking aimed at future growth, not bound by the chains of the past. The major acquisitions in the Health & Crop Sciences business and in the Pharmaceuticals business were important projects that could become central pillars of the Company’s business in the food supply and healthcare fields, important fields where the Company ought to focus its efforts in the medium and long term, and we discussed these projects thoroughly in meetings of the Board, including the financial side of things. The reason that outside executives with diverse expertise were able to fulfill their function in these projects was because Sumitomo Chemical has the character nec- essary to take in insights from the varied perspectives of outside executives, and reliably convey those insights to management and the employees on the ground.
Yoneda: As you have said, the true role of the Board of Directors is to create an environment where management can take appropriate risks with regard to important projects that will lead to the growth of the company. We are told that governance reform equals employing the monitoring and auditing function of boards of directors, but governance is not the goal, it is a method for management to advance business and thereby grow the company. At Sumitomo Chemical, we all participate in discussions, whether we are Directors or Corporate Auditors, but we Corporate Auditors in particular can speak to risk management, which pro- vides support for risk-taking.
   Michio Yoneda

80 Sumitomo Chemical Annual Report 2021 Dialogue between Outside Executives
The Goal of Governances is not Structure, but the Pursuit of Effectiveness
Ikeda: Sumitomo Chemical is a Company with a Board of Corporate Auditors, but outside Japan, it is more common to have an auditing committee, rather than a board of auditors, as is sometimes seen in Japanese companies with multiple designated committees, such as nominating committees, or companies with audit and supervisory committees. As an Outside Director, I have experience with both types of governance, but it is not necessarily the case that governance will go smoothly if you just switch to a nominating committee or an auditing committee. What is important is not the structure, but strengthening the substance of governance in accordance with a compa- ny’s characteristics. In the case of Sumitomo Chemical, which pursues synergies between multiple businesses as a diversified chemical manufacturer, by having executive officers who are intimately familiar with the business simul- taneously serve as members of the Board, the company is able to utilize its structure as a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors, where auditors can oversee manage- ment with significant authority, to strengthen governance in a substantive way. Personally, I feel that for companies like Sumitomo Chemical, which pursue business in an extremely diversified way, it is important for outside exec- utives to exercise their monitoring and auditing functions while getting close with management as a cheerleading team.
Yoneda: Major Japanese companies can choose between three different governance systems*, and I have experience with all of them. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. The choice should not be made based on which is best, but based on a consideration of the actual circumstances of the company’s management, and regardless of system, companies need to continue their efforts to strengthen governance. To put forward some benefits of a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors, from my own position as an auditor, I think two benefits are that the Board of Corporate Auditors is an independent institution from the Board of Directors, and that it ensures auditor’s ability to gather information because the various Corporate Auditors all have independent authority to audit the company. These are both indispensable elements in enabling the auditors to substantively exercise our functions as Corporate Auditors. In the case of Sumitomo Chemical, the Company is fully utilizing the benefits of being a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors, while at the same time creating a system that enables both the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors to fully function by strengthening the monitoring and oversight functions of the Board of Directors in light of the Corporate Governance Code. Because this system of companies with Boards of Corporate Auditors is unique to Japan, overseas investors have expressed the opinion that it is difficult to understand, but in that case it is possible to simply explain the system, so I do not think we need to simply align ourselves with the systems used in Europe and the US, but rather pursue the

   Governance is not the goal, it is a method for management to advance business and thereby grow the company.
 original goal of effective governance.
Yoneda: I think the importance of initiatives to address the SDGs has permeated society as a whole. Sumitomo Chemical is already undertaking a variety of initiatives to resolve issues in society, such as climate change, but for investors, there are still some parts that are difficult to see. Clearly explaining the details of these initiatives to the market and to stakeholders is also an important issue in governance. We need to improve governance not just with respect to the initiatives themselves, but also from the perspective of communicating about them.
Ikeda: In recent informal meetings with just the President, Chairman, and outside executives, I took the opportunity to once again point out the importance of taking healthy risks with regard to how our initiatives to create a sustainable society were being applied in our businesses, and not just treated as social contribution activities. I hope that as we as outside executives continue to share our views going for- ward, Sumitomo Chemical will examine and steadily expand its efforts to address the SDGs along multiple fronts. Yoneda: As the times and the business environment continue to change, we ourselves will also need to change in order for the company to continue to grow. I think, however, that our participation as outsiders in these dis- cussions may probably make it easier for the company to change, rather than debating things entirely internally. As an Outside Corporate Auditor, I hope to support those in management who actually implement these measures in taking appropriate risks from a risk management perspec- tive, promoting healthy changes and thereby supporting the growth of Sumitomo Chemical.
* Companies with a Board of Corporate Auditors, companies with an audit and supervisory committee, and companies with multiple designated committees (such as a nominating committee).
Ikeda: I agree. I think a lot of Japanese companies, not just Sumitomo Chemical, take the attitude that “as long as we are making a sincere effort, they will understand,” but in a sense, that just means that they are not very good at public or investor relations. When we try to expand our businesses globally, explaining things in a way that those outside the company can understand easily, including explaining about our governance systems, becomes an important part of our job.
The Future of
Sumitomo Chemical’s Governance
Ikeda: As a result of actively investing outside Japan, rev- enue from outside Japan now makes up more than 60% of our income. In light of this, we are putting more effort into the governance of Group companies outside Japan, and I think further strengthening these efforts will be one of the most important issues for Sumitomo Chemical going forward. At Sumitomo Chemical, we receive reports relating to Group companies from a variety of perspectives, but it is also the case that risks in Group companies outside Japan are relatively high. In order to strengthen our countermea- sures, I think it will be important to incorporate diverse per- spectives with respect to our governance somehow, rather than just managing things with Japanese ways of thinking.

Efforts to Substantively Strengthen Corporate Governance
n Changes in the Method of Operation of the Board of Directors
In FY2015, Sumitomo Chemical drastically reconsidered its various policies relating to the method of operation for the Board of Directors and corporate governance with the major aims of further strengthening the monitoring functions of the Board and further improving the transparency and objectivity of management, among other goals. At the time, a great deal of emphasis was placed on maximizing the use of the functions of Outside Directors and Auditors, so a variety of measures were considered to achieve this, centered on the thought that it would be essential to address the information asymmetry between internal executives and Outside Directors and Auditors. As a result of the numerous improvements made each year since then, meetings of the Board of Directors, as well as the operation of various related meetings before and afterwards, follow the procedures laid out in the table below.

 n Utilizing the Oversight and Advisory Functions of Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors
Outside Directors and Auditors have expressed the view that meetings of Sumitomo Chemical’s Board of Directors feature free, frank, constructive, and lively debates. In the meeting of Board of Directors as well as informal meetings of Outside Directors and Auditors relating to the assessing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, Outside Directors and Auditors pointed out a number of issues, and made recommendations on topics such as the method of operation for the Board of Directors, the support system for Outside Directors and Auditors, and a range of policies to improve corporate governance. Some specific examples are described below.
Case 1
Case 2
Case 3
Case 4
There are any number of other cases where the company’s efforts were advanced by explicit or implicit suggestions from Outside Directors and Auditors, and their monitoring and advisory functions has been a driving force for continually strengthening corporate governance at Sumitomo Chemical.
Example Initiatives Based on Recommendations from Outside Directors and Auditors
    Discussions in Informal Meetings
Once, when a particular project required important decisions to be made, Outside Directors and Auditors had expressed a desire to hear the honest views of management, so an informal meeting was set up. As a result of unreserved exchanges of views in this meeting, Outside Directors and Auditors were able to align their views with those of company executives with respect to the project, which also made discussions at the subsequent meeting of the Board even more lively, leading to appropriate management decisions. Since this project, opportunities have been created for discussions in informal meetings as necessary.
 Follow-up on Major Projects and Monitoring of Group Companies
When the Board of Directors received a report that an investment project that had been decided on by the Board was not proceeding according to plan, Outside Directors and Auditors pointed out the importance of more timely reporting and of discussing such issues. Since then, the company has adopted a stance of reporting negative information as soon as possible, strengthening efforts to follow-up on major projects and monitor Group companies.
 Improving
the Efficiency of Meetings of
the Board of Directors
Outside Directors and Auditors who also serve as executives for other companies provided members of the Board with information on efforts to enhance IT for the Boards of Directors of other companies, which led to a reconsideration of operational methods for the Board of Directors, resulting in the deployment of a paperless meeting system and the creation of an environment for remote attendance. This has not only improved the efficiency of tasks such as preparing for meetings of the Board, it has also made it possible to hold meetings more flexibly.
 Interaction with Employees
In light of a desire of Outside Directors and Auditors for dialogue with employees across a wide range of levels, the company has taken a variety of measures, including informal meetings with business units, and creating opportunities for presentations from young employees during visits to production sites. By listening to the unfiltered voices of employees, this not only has the effect of providing Outside Directors and Auditors with an even deeper understanding of the company, it also leads to increased motivation on the employee side, among other effects.

Assessing the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
The effectiveness of the Board of Directors is assessed in terms of its composition, operational status, deliberation/reports at its meetings, auditing status on its business execution, and the operations of the non-mandatory Nomination Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee. The company conducts surveys of each Director and Auditor about their assessing the effective- ness of the Board of Directors. Based on the results of these surveys, there is then a frank exchange of views in meetings of the Board of Corporate Auditors, in informal meetings with Outside Directors and Auditors, and in management meetings, after which the Board of Directors then conducts a review of its own effectiveness in one of its meetings based on the views expressed in the prior meetings.
   Improvements over Fiscal 2019 and Assessment of Fiscal 2020
In light of the results of the effectiveness evaluation for FY2019, discussions focused on improvements were held in meetings of the Board and in informal meetings, held in FY2020, with respect to the following major topics.
 Accelerating initiatives aimed at digital transformation and creating innovation
Creating structures for formulating carbon neutral strategy and for promoting the plastic recycling business
The current status of major investment projects, such as the Rabigh Project and the acquisition of crop protection businesses in South America, and future initiatives
The state of operations at listed subsidiaries, and a rethink- ing of diversity and ways of working
As a result of these initiatives, in the effectiveness evaluation for FY2020, the Board confirmed that it has realized steady improvements each year in each area and that their effective- ness was at a good level overall.
  Initiatives for the Future
 The Board of Directors is undertaking the following initiatives with the aim of further increasing its effectiveness going forward.
 Working to further invigorate discussions in meetings of the Board by allocating time to put greater weight on important topics and expanding both reporting and discussion with respect to progress updates for major investment projects
Aiming to further strengthen Group-wide governance through a variety of measures, including the use of digital technology and thorough reviews of such systems as inter- nal controls, compliance, and responsible care
Further expanding initiatives such as information disclosure and dialogue with shareholders and investors in order to ensure that the corporate value of Sumitomo Chemical is more accurately evaluated

  Introduction to Management Strategy Creating Value Sumitomo Chemical through Business
Remuneration* * Remunerations of Executive Officers are determined in the same manner.
1. Basic Policy for Remunerations of Directors, etc.
(1) The remunerations of senior management and directors (hereinafter “Directors, etc.”) shall consist of basic compensation and bonuses.
(2) Basic compensation is designed to serve as an incentive for the actions of Directors, etc. to contribute to the Company’s sustainable growth, rather than aiming for short-term or sub-optimal effects.
(3) The amount of bonuses shall largely reflect the Company’s consolidated financial results for a fiscal year in order to heighten incentives to achieve the annual targets of business plans.
(4) The remuneration shall be set at levels which are designed to be objectively competitive to attract and retain outstanding talent while taking into consideration such factors as the scale and content of the Company’s business. Based on surveys by a third-party organization and other materials, such levels shall be checked annually whether or not to be objectively appropriate.
2. Mechanisms of Each Remuneration Element
(1) Basic Compensation
The level of basic compensation shall be determined based on the policy described in section 1(4) above. While basic compensation for each year shall be fixed, the Company will adopt a mechanism where the Basic Compensation level would be changed in the event where the Company’s position has changed in terms of “the company’s size”, “earnings capacity”, and “outside evaluations” from a comprehensive and medium- to long-term perspective. As main indicators for determining the change in the Company position, the Company will apply the following: in terms of “the company’s size,” sales revenue, total assets and market capitalization, in terms of “earnings capacity,” net income (attributable to the parent company), ROE, ROI and D/E ratio, and in terms of “outside evaluations,” credit ratings and the ESG index selected by the GPIF (Government Pension Investment Fund). The amounts to be paid to each person will be determined in accordance with the base amount set by each position.
(2) Bonuses
Bonuses shall be paid on the condition that performance for that fiscal year exceeds a particular level and shall be determined based on the bonus calculation formula (performance indicator x coefficient). In order to reflect the current earnings capac- ity of the relevant business year (including financial activities) to the amount of bonuses, the Company will apply the combined value of consolidated core operating
profit and financial profit and loss to the performance indicator concerning the bonus calculation formula. In addition, the Company will set the coefficient of the calculation formula so that it will get larger as the position of a person gets higher. (3) Percentages of Fixed Remuneration (Basic Compensation) and
Performance-linked Remuneration (Bonuses)
The Company will design the bonus calculation formula so that the bonuses of Directors (excluding Outside Directors) accounts for roughly 30% of the remuner- ation when the consolidated performance goal (core operating profit) for the latest fiscal year of the mid-term management plan (fiscal years 2019 to 2021) is achieved.
3. Procedures for Determining Remuneration of Directors, etc.
The remuneration amount of Directors shall be set at a level not higher than the upper limit of a total remuneration prescribed by resolution of the 125th General Meeting of Shareholders, held on June 23, 2006 (i.e. 1 billion yen or less per year). The Board of Directors shall deliberate on and decide the method of determining remunerations of Directors, etc., based on the advice from the Remuneration Advisory Committee. Furthermore, the specific amount of remuneration for each Directors etc. shall be determined by the Director and Chairman, Masakazu Tokura, authorized by the Board of Directors, based on the standard advised from the Remuneration Advisory Committee, which is a consultative body of the Board of Directors. This is because the Company believes that determining the specific amount of remuneration for each Director, etc. does not fit into the discussions and deliberations of the Board of Directors, and it is more appropriate for Director and Chairman, who serves as the chairman of the Remuneration Advisory Committee and the chairman of the Board of Directors and is in a position to overview the entire Company, to make decisions based on the purpose of policies for determining compensation, etc. and deliberations and opinions of the Remuneration Advisory Committee. To ensure that the authority to determine the amount of remuneration for each Director, etc. is appropriately exercised by Director and Chairman, the Board of Directors’ policies provide that Director and Chairman shall determine the amount of individual remuneration for Directors based on the standard suggested by the Remuneration Advisory Committee as being consistent with the Company’s policy for determining remuneration, etc. As Director and Chairman determines the individual remuneration amount based on this standard, the Board of Directors has concluded that the content of the individual remuneration is in line with the determination policy.

Listed Company with Listed Subsidiaries
n Our Thinking Regarding Listed Companies with Listed Subsidiaries
For a publicly listed subsidiary, the advantages of being publicly listed include better employee morale, enhanced ability to recruit employees, greater trust from customers, and greater influence within the industry. In addition, the parent company can expect to benefit from synergies in collaboration and cooperation with its subsidiaries. Because of these benefits, in seeking to maximize the overall corporate value of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, we think that holding listed subsidiaries is one of the effective options on premise of preserving each subsidiary’s autonomy and respecting the rights of minority shareholders.
For the publicly listed subsidiaries in Japan of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, because they play an important role in our manage- ment strategy, we are not thinking of selling them at present. On the other hand, as for converting them into wholly owned subsidiaries, while we always keep it in mind as one option, it is not a high priority because, in addition to not being able to enjoy the benefits of having listed subsidiaries, the financial burden of buying out the holdings of minority shareholders would be significant. Accordingly, at the present time, we think that, from an overall perspective, keeping these subsidiaries as publicly listed subsidiaries is the optimal position. We are constantly monitoring our relationship with each listed subsidiary and, in accordance with the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s management strategy and changes in our operating environment, considering changes, including in our shareholdings.

History
Sumitomo Chemical’s pharmaceutical business began with the acquisition of the Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company in 1944. After being spun off as the subsidiary Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in 1984, it merged with Dainippon Pharmaceutical in 2005 to become Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.
Position in Group
Synergies
    The company’s core pharmaceuticals business is a pillar of Sumitomo Chemical’s life sciences business, along with the agricultural chemicals business, and is a source of innovation. In the current Corporate Business Plan, it has positioned “healthcare” as one of the priority areas in making efforts for acceleration the devel- opment of next-generation businesses, and further innovation is expected in this area in the future.
● Research at the Bioscience Research Laboratory, which consolidates and integrates parts of the research organi- zations of the company and Sumitomo Chemical
● Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization in regenerative medicine and cell therapies (combines the company’s expertise in regenerative medicine and cell therapy with Sumitomo Chemical’s expertise in the CMO business)
● Theranostics (combines the company’s antibody design technology with Sumitomo Chemical’s biological mech- anism analysis technology and the radioactive isotope technology of Nihon Medi-Physics)
● Having locations on Sumitomo Chemical’s premises enables close collaboration in such areas as quality and production management, reducing indirect expenses
   Sumitomo Chemical invested capital in 1951 for relationship-building because the company was Sumitomo Chemical’s largest customer for methanol. Thereafter, when the company ran into a financial crisis, the collaboration was strengthened in order to rebuild the company, including dispatching executives from Sumitomo Chemical.
Through production outsourcing in both directions for such items as catalysts and electronic materials based on the unique organic synthesis technologies of the company, the company has contributed to the expansion of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s business in the field of fine chemicals.
● Optimization of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s production of active pharmaceutical ingredient and inter- mediates through a new multi-purpose manufacturing equipment (multi-plants) approach
● Joint research from the earliest stage into such areas as battery materials and additive agents
● Having locations on Sumitomo Chemical’s Works enables close collaboration in such areas as quality and production management, reducing indirect expenses
   In 1955 Sumitomo Chemical invested capital in the company, a leader in the dye business, to strengthen its own dye business.
Through production outsourcing in both directions for such items as electronic mate- rials and pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates based on the various organic synthesis technologies and numerous multi- plants held by the company, the company has contributed to the expansion of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s business in the field of fine chemicals.
  Through integration of the technologies relating to precursors held by the com- pany and the findings related to cathode materials held by Sumitomo Chemical, the company accelerates joint development of new products and contributes to the full-scale market entry and expansion of the Sumitomo Chemical Group’s cathode materials business.
● Expanded contract manufacturing of pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates with numerous multi- plants of the company
 Sumitomo Chemical invested capital in the company in 2013 and began joint develop- ment of high-capacity cathode materials for automobiles. Afterwards, in light of the smooth progress in joint development work, and in light of expectations that, in line with the future growth of the environmentally friendly vehicles market, there would be significant medium- to long-term growth in the market for lithium-ion secondary batteries, the company was con- verted to a majority-owned subsidiary in 2016.
● Contribute to a drastic rationalization of the manu- facturing process and optimization of research and development through integration of the technologies of both companies.
● Sumitomo Chemical’s capital investment and guidance has improved the company’s management level in such areas as labor accidents and internal control

  When Sumitomo Chemical and its listed subsidiaries jointly work on maximizing group synergy, Sumitomo Chemical respects independent decision making by listed subsidiaries and, at the same time, makes its best efforts to establish an effective gover- nance system in order to avoid any conflicts of interests with minor shareholders.
With respect to the listed subsidiaries, we are taking the following measures to ensure appropriate supervision of such areas as transactions with the parent company and nomination of officers and remuneration of officers, from an indepen- dent and objective position.

We held a meeting to engage with the seven institutional investors listed above on the topic of listed companies with listed subsidiaries. Prior to that meeting, we met with outside directors and auditors to exchange views on this topic. We think this meeting was an important opportunity to deepen our understanding of our respective views on listed companies with listed subsidiaries. We will continue to fulfill our responsibility for accountability.
Cross-Shareholdings
We strategically hold shares in other companies only when judged necessary for ensuring smooth business operation or maintaining and enhancing mutual business relations, after such factors as medium- to long-term economic rationality and prospects of future business developments have been considered as a whole. Also, at the Board of Directors meeting, each year, we shall assess its shareholding policy for all listed shares it owns, in light of mid- to long-term economic rationality and significance to hold such shares for each individual issuer. According to such review, if it becomes less necessary to hold a share by reason of changes in the business environment, etc., we shall sell such shares, as appropriate, taking into consideration such factors as the share price and market trends.
In accordance with a rise in the Nikkei Stock Average*, the value of our cross-sharehold- ings rose, resulting in an increase in the balance of cross-shareholdings at the end of the fiscal year in comparison with the prior fiscal year, but as can be seen in the table on the right, continuing from the prior year, we sold a portion of these shareholdings in fiscal 2020. * The Nikkei Stock Average: 18,917 yen on March 31, 2020, versus 29,179 yen on March 31, 2021

Internal Control
n Status of the Development of the Internal Control System
Sumitomo Chemical established its Basic Policy for the Enhancement of the Internal Control System by a resolution of the Board of Directors, creating a system to ensure the appro- priateness of its operations as stipulated in the Companies Act.
As stated in the basic concept of this policy, we recognize that the development of an internal control system is a neces- sary process for maintaining a sound organization and should be actively utilized to achieve business objectives. To continu- ously enhance our internal control system, we have formed the Internal Control Committee, which is chaired by the President and consists of Executive Officers responsible for and in charge of each business sector and corporate department. Regular meetings of the committee are held three times a year.
At Sumitomo Chemical, the Internal Control Committee plays a central role in discussing various measures based on the basic policy described above. The committee also operates a PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle by monitoring the implementation status of those measures, and constantly inspects and strength- ens the Group’s internal control system in response to changes in the Group’s business and operating environment, so that the Group’s internal control system can function effectively.
The Standing Corporate Auditors attend the committee as observers, and the committee’s operations are conducted by the Internal Control & Audit Department, independent of other business activities. Summaries of the matters covered in the committee are reported to the Board of Corporate Auditors after each meeting. These summaries are then reported to the Board of Directors for deliberation.
n The Internal Structure regarding Timely Disclosure
The Corporate Communications Department is in charge of working in conjunction with other relevant departments to continually disclose necessary information in a timely manner. In addition to items requiring disclosure under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and under stock exchange regulations, we also actively disclose information that may be considered material to the decisions of investors. We endeavor to build stronger relationships of trust with society and capital markets by publishing documentation in accordance with the rules stipulated by the security exchanges in Japan, including reports on the company’s corporate governance philosophy and system, and notifications showing that Outside Directors and Corporate Auditors have no existing conflicts of interest with general shareholders. These documents are available on the website of Japan Exchange Group Inc.
Basic policy for Enhancement of the Internal Control System Our Website n Internal Audits
As part of its internal control monitoring activities, Sumitomo Chemical has established a dedicated organization within the company to conduct internal audits, in addition to audits by the Corporate Auditor and Financial Statement auditors. The Internal Control & Audit Department conducts internal audits for all matters related to the execution of operations by the com- pany and its Group companies, and dedicated audit teams for the Responsible Care Department conduct Responsible Care auditing from the perspective of safety, environment, and quality throughout the life cycle of chemical products. Internal audits and Responsible Care audits are coordinated with each other as needed. In case any serious matter relating to internal controls is found, the matter will be promptly reported to Executive Officers and Standing Corporate Auditors on the reporting line.

On the other hand, Management Meetings are held as appropriate to deliberate important topics relating to manage- ment (P32: Progress in Corporate Business Plan), particularly management strategy for the company and the Group, capital expenditure, and other investments, from the perspectives of both risks and opportunities. Furthermore, the Sustainability Promotion Committee makes necessary recommendations to various organizations in the Group so as to ensure that the vari- ous management activities of the Group contribute to achieving sustainability for the company and society (P26: Sustainability at Sumitomo Chemical), evaluating medium- to long-term environ- mental and societal issues from the perspectives of both risks
and opportunities.
Summaries of the matters covered in the Internal Control
Committee and important matters deliberated in the Management Meetings are reported to the Board of Directors.
n Cross-organizational Risks and Crisis Response
We established the Risk Crisis Management Committee to deliberate risks and crisis response policies that affect multiple business sites, departments, and Group companies, such as large-scale disasters (earthquakes, storms, floods, etc.), pan- demics, deterioration of security in Japan or overseas (terrorism, riots, wars, etc.), and other issues.
                   To achieve sustainable growth, Sumitomo Chemical makes an effort to detect, at an early stage, various risks that may hinder the achievement of its business objectives, and takes proper measures. We focus on building and expanding a system relat- ing to risk management so that we can promptly and properly address risks when they emerge.
n Systems for Promoting Risk Management
At Sumitomo Chemical, as part of its standard duties, each of the Group’s organizations is taking various measures to prop- erly manage risks associated with its business operations. In addition to this, a variety of committees coordinate to promote risk management from the perspective of the Group as a whole, aiming to thoroughly support the efforts of each organization within the Group.
The Internal Control Committee sets policies relating to risk management for the Group as a whole and monitors the efforts of each organization in accordance with those policies, collecting risk-related information and evaluating it, among other tasks. This committee creates a risk map for the Group as a whole each year, aiming not only to comprehensively capture the status of risks relating to management strategy and the foun- dation for business continuation, but also to coordinate with risk response coordination departments, promoting countermea- sures for important risks relating to the foundation for business continuation, such as earthquakes, workplace accidents, and

Compliance
n Basic Policy
The Sumitomo Chemical Group places compliance at the bed-
rock of its corporate management. As we engage in business in many parts of the world, all of the companies in the Sumitomo Chemical Group are devoting earnest efforts to stay in strict compliance with not only laws and regulations, but also ethi- cal principles in a business environment. Both the spirit and the letter of ensuring compliance in business activities have consistently been enshrined at Sumitomo Chemical ever since the company was founded. This unwavering resolve towards compliance is embodied succinctly in the “Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business Conduct,” which serves as the guideline of conduct for every employee to abide by and constitutes the backbone of our day-to-day compliance activities. In recent years, in particular, companies are expected to fulfill their soci- etal responsibilities more than ever before. Given the circum- stances, all companies in the Sumitomo Chemical Group are making concerted efforts to further compliance activities, under the strong leadership of top management, to further enhance compliance in the Group’s business activities on a global basis.
n Compliance System at the Sumitomo Chemical Group
(1) Compliance Committee
Sumitomo Chemical has established a Compliance Committee chaired by the President and holds a Compliance Committee meeting at least once a year (or more frequently as needed). Details discussed by the committee are reported to Board of Directors and Board of Corporate Auditors, and the committee then receives feedback from them. The committee establishes overarching principles of compliance from a global perspective, and then works with each business sector and Group company, both in Japan and abroad, to build and operate their compli- ance systems locally in the required manner, according to those global principles.
(2) Group Compliance Structure Focused on Effectiveness “Think globally, Manage regionally, Act locally”
As business globalizes, it becomes more important that the operation of a corporation’s compliance system be fine-tuned to situations specific to individual countries or companies. In light of this, we have established Regional Legal & Compliance Offices (RLCOs) in Sumitomo Chemical’s major business regions. The RLCOs, grasping the concrete needs and tasks of their respective Group companies, provide hands-on support and guidance to them, such as helping to set and implement necessary internal rules and procedures, building a company’s compliance system, and assisting in its operations.
(3) Introducing and Operating a Compliance System for the Company and its Group Companies
To ensure thorough compliance throughout the entire Sumitomo Chemical Group, it is important that Sumitomo Chemical and its Group companies establish and operate their own compliance systems. Sumitomo Chemical and its Group
For details of our efforts The “Compliance” page of our website
companies are engaged in the following activities.
Establishing and operating the Compliance Committee (including responding to internal reports and conducting compliance violation investigations)
Introducing and regularly reviewing the Code of Ethics
Introducing and operating the Internal Reporting System (the Speak-Up Reporting System)
Conducting compliance activities (education, training, etc.) based on a compliance risk assessment of each Group company
(4) Internal Reporting System (Speak-Up Reporting System)
In order to detect any compliance violations as early as possible, or prevent them before they occur, the Sumitomo Chemical Group has introduced an internal reporting system (the Speak-Up Reporting System), which allows the following persons to report a compliance violation or a suspected violation upon uncovering it directly to the Compliance Committee or to external lawyers, either by identifying oneself or anonymously: management executives and company employees (including contract employees), their family members, management executives or employees of Group companies, their family members, or those who retired from the Company or its Group companies and their trading partners, and all those who are involved in any of the Group’s businesses. The entire Sumitomo Chemical Group has been promoting the use of the Internal Reporting System. As a result, there were 135 reports filed throughout the Sumitomo Chemical Group in fiscal 2020. Reports and compliance violations are reported to the Board of Corporate Auditors on a regular basis.
Sumitomo Chemical has become a registered company under
Japan’s Whistleblowing Compliance Management System certification (“WCMS Certification”) regime, through the regime’s “self-declaration of conformity” process, effective as of December 11, 2020.

Responsible Care
n Occupational Safety and Health, Industrial Safety and Disaster Prevention
Initiatives to Ensure Safety at All Group Workplaces
The Sumitomo Chemical Group aims to achieve zero severe accidents across all workplaces, as per the basic principle of “Making safety our first priority.” To this end, we have ramped up our efforts to ensure safety by communicating thoroughly to make sure everyone observes the Safety Ground Rules, which are common to all Group employees, evaluating and improving the level of safety culture in workplaces, raising the level of safety management with the use of IoT technology, and reviewing and reinforcing natural disaster prevention measures. Through dialogues with residents in the region, we explain to neighboring residents our efforts to ensure safety, and work to deepen our mutual understanding.
n Environmental Protection
Environmental Protection Activities Rooted in
Local Communities
The Sumitomo Chemical Group has set common targets for environmental conservation and is working to reduce envi- ronmental impact throughout the Group. Specifically, we have set goals in each field, such as conservation of air and water environments, resource saving and waste reduction, appropriate management of chemical substances, preser- vation of biodiversity, and protection of the soil environment. We are working to enhance our efforts to achieve these goals at each business site. In the future, we will continue to focus on environmental conservation activities rooted in local communities and strive to secure the trust of society, which is a major prerequisite for continuing our business.
n Product Stewardship, Product Safety, and Quality Assurance
For the Safety and Peace of Mind of Our Customers
The Sumitomo Chemical Group estimates the degree of impact our chemical products have in terms of safety on people and the environment throughout their life cycle, and promotes activities to protect people’s health and the environment based on those risks. As part of its Eco-First Commitments, Sumitomo Chemical is currently carrying out risk assessments of the chemical substances that the company produces and offers for sale in annual quantities of 1 ton or more. The company is publishing the results of these assessments as safety summaries.* The company is reassessing whether the products it sells are of sufficient quality so that customers can use them safely, incorporating information from these assessments. Going forward, we will continue to thoroughly implement day-to-day management so that we can deliver products and services of such quality that customers around the world can use them with peace of mind.

Respect for Human Rights
n Our Position on Human Rights
Sumitomo Chemical regards respect for human rights as part of the foundation for its business continuation. We are continuing to make a Group-wide effort to address this as a critical management issue, and provide disclosures on our measures and progress. In 2019, we formulated the Sumitomo Chemical Group Human Rights Policy, based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and established the Human Rights Promotion Committee. Since then, under the ini- tiative of this committee, our Group has come together to undertake measures to respect human rights across the value chain.
Sumitomo Chemical Group Human Rights Policy Our Website
n Human Rights Due Diligence
In order to respect human rights in our business activities, the Sumitomo Chemical Group has built systems for human rights due diligence based on the guiding principles. If it is discovered through our human rights due diligence that any negative impacts on human rights are occurring because of our Group’s business activities, or have been fostered by the Group’s business activities, we will redress or resolve those incidents through the appropriate procedures, in collaboration with related stakeholders.
Approach to Our Human Rights Due Diligence Efforts
Under our approach to evaluating and reducing human rights risks, not only for Sumitomo Chemical itself and its supply chain, but also for Group companies inside and outside of Japan and their supply chains, we set priorities based on potential human rights risks, and implement our efforts in steps. With the collaboration and advice of outside experts, our Group’s human rights due diligence is conducted in the following sequence.
     STEP1
Set risk indicators
STEP2
Identify high-risk business models
STEP3
Outside expert review and recommendation
STEP4
Risk mapping and set priorities
STEP5
Conduct detailed investigation by outside experts (including on-site inspections)
STEP6
Implement remedies (if necessary)

 Detailed Investigations
in the Sumitomo Chemical Group
Detailed investigations were conducted for 30 Group companies that were identified to have relatively high human rights risks through the FY2019 human rights risk group assessment.
Document Inspection – Targets:
26 companies, in locations including China, India, Thailand, and Japan
Under the four categories: Society, the Environment, Health & Safety, and Governance, questionnaires were sent and answers were collected. The companies were asked whether they conducted any business activities with high human rights risks and about the implementation status of risk mitigation measures.
On-site Inspection – Targets: 4 companies total, in China, Thailand, and Tanzania
For the Group companies identified to have particularly high human rights risks, outside experts were appointed to conduct inspections including reviewing documents such as employment and wage reg- ulation documents, conducting interviews with local employees (including temporary employees), and inspecting the work environment.
As a result of these inspections, the following issues were discovered.
● Our requirements for suppliers with respect to human rights and labor conditions are not explicitly
included in our processes and standards when evaluating suppliers.
● There is once again a need to thoroughly inform all employees of our Group’s human rights policies, and to conduct training and other exercises to promote this understanding.
Investigations in fiscal 2020 did not find any incidents that had a major negative impact on human rights, but for other findings, additional investigations will take place looking into the facts and backgrounds of each cases with preventative and corrective measures. In addition, insights gained from the investigations will be shared throughout the Group, leading to a further reduction in risks. We will also continue to conduct awareness activities, particularly training, to further deepen each Group employee’s understanding of human rights.
 Efforts related to High-risk
Raw Materials
  In accordance with the Sumitomo Chemical Group Policy for Responsible Procurement of Minerals and Raw Materials, we began an investigation into the usage status of raw materials that have a high risk of creating negative impacts on human rights in their supply chains (high-risk raw materials) in the Sumitomo Chemical Group, in order to prioritize conducting due diligence of those suppliers.
  We will continue to first request reports in accordance with the standards of the Responsible Minerals Initiative from suppliers who handle high-risk raw materials, then proceed with our risk assessments.
 Inclusion of Human Rights Provisions in Contracts
 We have formulated contract provisions that request understanding of and cooperation with our efforts to respect human rights, and have begun including them in our contracts with our business partners, including raw material suppliers, logistics providers, and contract manufacturers.
 We will not only continue to sign contracts that include these human rights provisions, we will also respond in line with the procedures defined in these human rights provisions when negative impacts on human rights occur in our supply chain, or under the apprehension that such an impact has occurred.
 Sustainable Procurement Efforts
 In fiscal 2020 in order to have a coherent understanding of the ESG risks in raw material procure- ment processes throughout our supply chain, we confirmed the status of our initiatives by sharing the Sumitomo Chemical Group Sustainable Procurement Guidebook with our major business partners, and collected the checklist filled out by each company. The results showed that 86% were considered sustainable procurement. (the sustainable procurement ratio), (as of March 31, 2021).
 We will continue our efforts to ensure sustainable procurement, and continue to assiduously check the status of respect for human rights at our business partners, including whether or not they conduct any business activities with high human rights risks and the status of their implementation of risk mitigation measures.

  n Achievements
Due to the spread of COVID-19, there were significant changes to IR activities in fiscal 2020, which had previously been con- ducted largely face-to-face. In addition to losing the opportunity to visit institutional investors outside Japan in person, events that needed to be conducted on-site, such as tours of plants for institutional investors and analysts, were necessarily cancelled. At the same time, in our briefings and other meetings, we worked hard to ensure the quality of communication while tak- ing advantage of the benefits of remote meetings, conducting hybrid meetings that combined remote and in-person atten- dance while taking due care to prevent the spread of infection.
In these circumstances, in terms of briefings held by man- agement, we not only held a business strategy briefing led by the president, which is held every year, we also held both an IR Day and an ESG Meeting for the first time. At the IR day, in addition to a presentation on management strategy by the president, there were also business strategy presentations by the heads of the various business sectors, including the Pharmaceuticals sector. At the ESG Meeting, the president first gave a presentation on our company’s sustainability efforts, followed by presentations by the executives in charge of specific issues relating to the environment, society, and governance.
We have typically held a few small meetings each year where executives in charge of business sectors or headquarters depart- ments exchange views directly with investors and analysts, and by giving management an opportunity to hear the views of investors and analysts directly, these meetings have given rise to construc- tive conversations about the issues facing our company and our future goals, deepening mutual understanding year after year.
In addition, we have been holding online company briefings for individual investors, working to help these many private investors have a deeper understanding of our company.

Financial Review
1. Results of Operations
(1) Sales Revenue
Sales revenue faced a number of adverse impacts, including a decrease in shipments, particularly of products used in automotive-related applications, in the Petrochemicals & Plastics and Energy & Functional Materials segments, due to the fall in economic activity that accompanied the spread of COVID-19, and a fall in market prices in the Petrochemicals & Plastics segment accompanying a deterioration in market conditions. However, because shipments increased in the Health & Crop Sciences segment, the IT-related Chemicals segment, and the Pharmaceuticals segment, sales revenue rose by ¥61.2 billion, to ¥2,287.0 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from ¥2,225.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
(2) Core Operating Income/Operating Income
In addition to the decrease in shipments in the Petrochemicals & Plastics and Energy & Functional Materials segments, partic- ularly in products used in automotive-related applications, core operating income was also impacted by periodic maintenance at Petro Rabigh, our equity method investee, and by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and R&D
expenses in the Pharmaceuticals segment. On the other hand, as a result of increased shipments in the Pharmaceuticals, IT-related Chemicals, and Health & Crop Sciences segments, core operating income increased by ¥15.0 billion, to ¥147.6 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from ¥132.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
During the previous consolidated fiscal year, an impair- ment loss was recorded on intangible assets due to factors such as the decision to cancel a portion of trials for an anti-cancer drug in development in the Pharmaceuticals segment. At the same time, however, because there was a reversal of expenses due to a decrease in the fair value of a contingent consideration arrangement, operating results from non-recurring factors, which were deducted from operating income to calculate core operating income, were a profit of ¥4.9 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. For this consolidated fiscal year, an impairment loss was recorded on intangible assets due to factors such as the decision to cancel a trial of a treatment in development targeting colorectal can- cer. Alongside this, while there was a reversal of expenses due to a decrease in the fair value of a contingent consideration arrangement, in total the result was a loss of ¥10.5 billion. As a result of the above factors, operating income was ¥137.1

(3) Finance Income and Finance Expenses/ Income Before Taxes
Finance income and finance expenses improved by ¥7.7 billion, to gain of ¥0.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from loss of ¥7.0 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen toward the end of the current fiscal year and the record- ing of exchange gains. As a result, income before taxes increased by ¥7.3 billion, to ¥137.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, from ¥130.5 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
(4) Income Tax Expenses/Net Income Attributable to Owners of the Parent and Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests
Income tax expenses were ¥69.7 billion, while the ratio of income tax expenses to income before taxes after applying tax effect accounting was 50.6%.
As a result, net income was ¥68.1 billion for the fiscal

98 Sumitomo Chemical Annual Report 2021 Financial Review
market prices for raw materials, the prices of petrochemical products hovered at a low level. As a result, sales revenue declined by ¥67.6 billion from the previous year, to ¥589.3 billion. Core operating income suffered a loss of ¥12.0 billion, declined by ¥26.5 billion from the previous year, affected by lower shipment volumes and periodic shutdown maintenance at Petro Rabigh, our equity method investee.
(2) Energy & Functional Materials
Impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, shipments of materials for automotive applications (including separators for lithium-ion secondary batteries and synthetic rubber) decreased. As a result, sales revenue dropped by ¥9.8 billion from the previous year, to ¥245.2 billion; on the other hand, core operating income remained almost flat with the previous year at ¥20.3 billion due to improvements in profit margins because of a drop in market prices for raw materials.
IT-related Chemicals
Change in Core Operating Income: ’20/3 vs. ’21/3
(3) IT-related Chemicals
Shipments of processing materials for semiconductors (including high-purity chemicals and photoresists) increased, driven by growing demand for these items. Shipments of materials for display applications increased in the face of stay-at-home demand and demand for remote work products. As a result, sales revenue increased by ¥26.9 billion from the previous year, to ¥431.8 billion, and core operating income increased by ¥14.6 billion from the previous year, to ¥39.7 billion.
(4) Health & Crop Sciences
Sales of crop protection products increased year-over-year after the acquisition of four South American subsidiaries of Nufarm in April 2020. Shipments in India also performed well. Market prices for methionine (feed additives) increased from the previous year. As a result, sales revenue increased by ¥79.3 billion from the previous year, to ¥423.0 billion. Backed by the improved margins of methionine and increased global shipments of crop protection products, core operating income increased by ¥29.5 billion from the previous year, to ¥31.5 billion.

(5) Pharmaceuticals
In Japan, sales of Equa® and EquMet® (for type II diabetes mellitus), launched in the middle of previous fiscal year, increased since they were sold throughout this fiscal year. In North America, sales of Latuda® (atypical antipsychotic agent) increased, and revenues were recorded relating to relugolix. As a result, sales revenue increased by ¥30.6 billion from the previous year, to ¥546.5 billion. Despite the higher sales revenue, core operating income decreased by ¥3.6 billion from the previous year, to ¥71.7 billion, due to higher sales expenses, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) and research and development expenses resulting from the year-round coverage of expenses at Sumitovant Biopharma and its subsidiaries (which were acquired as part of the strategic alliance with Roivant Sciences Ltd., in the previous fiscal year).
(6) Others
In addition to the above five segments, the Sumitomo Chemical Group supplies electric power and steam, designs chemical plants and supervises the construction of those facilities, provides transportation and warehousing, and con- ducts physical property analysis and environmental analysis.
Sales revenue of these businesses increased by ¥1.7 billion from the previous year, to ¥51.1 billion, and core operating income increased by ¥4.0 billion from the previous year, to ¥12.8 billion.

billion (US$12,803 million), a 29.0% increase from ¥1,099.2 billion as of March 31, 2020. Other non-current liabilities increased due to factors such as an increase in unearned revenue relating to the conclusion of a development and commercialization agreement by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma.
Interest-bearing liabilities (short-term and long-term bank loans, corporate bonds, and commercial paper) as of March 31, 2021 amounted to ¥1,351.1 billion (US$12,204 million), compared with ¥1,304.7 billion as of March 31, 2020.
Total equity was ¥1,482.1 billion (US$13,387 million) as of March 31, 2021, a 6.4% increase from ¥1,392.6 billion as of March 31, 2020, due an increase in retained earnings and in other components of equity. The ratio of net worth to total assets stood at 25.5% as of March 31, 2021, compared with 25.3% as of March 31, 2020.
There were 1,634,986,941 shares issued and outstand- ing (excluding treasury shares) as of March 31, 2021. Retained earnings amounted to ¥854.5 billion (US$7,719 million), a 5.8% increase from ¥808.0 billion as of March 31, 2020.
4. Cash Flows
Net cash from operating activities in fiscal 2020 was a net inflow of ¥374.5 billion, an increase of ¥268.5 billion from the previous fiscal year, as Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma received an upfront payment from a partner upon entering into a development and commercialization agreement, and because of improvements in working capital. Net cash from investing activities was a net outflow of ¥177.4 billion, due to outflows relating to a loan to Petro Rabigh. Compared with the previous fiscal year, net outflows decreased by ¥322.3 billion, because of outflows in the previous fiscal year by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma for an investment relating to its strategic alliance with Roivant Sciences and to acquire sev- eral of its subsidiaries. This resulted in positive free cash flow of ¥197.1 billion for fiscal 2020, compared with negative free cash flow of ¥393.7 billion for fiscal 2019. Net cash outflows from financing activities were ¥40.0 billion. This represents a reduction in cash inflows from financing activities of ¥413.5 billion compared with the previous consolidated fiscal year, because in the previous fiscal year, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma had procured bridging loans relating to payments as part of the strategic alliance with Roivant Sciences, and Sumitomo Chemical issued corporate hybrid bonds (publicly offered subordinated corporate bonds). The balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2020 increased by ¥180.3 billion year on year, to ¥360.9 billion.

We consider shareholder return as one of our priority management issues and have made it a policy to maintain stable dividend payment, giving due consideration to our business performance and a dividend payout ratio for each fiscal period, the level of retained earnings necessary for future growth, and other relevant factors. We aim to maintain a dividend payout ratio of around 30% over the medium to long term.
The full-year dividend for fiscal 2020 was ¥15 per share, a decrease of ¥2 per share from the previous fiscal year.

   On the Publication of the Annual Report 2021
As an integrated report, the Annual Report aims to convey our company’s value creation story to a wide range of stakeholders, including our shareholders and investors, in a way that is easy to understand, and so it comprehensively aggregates information such as the strengths and strate- gies of our businesses, our financial results, our corporate governance system, and our efforts to address issues in the environment and society. The creation of this report was led by the IR team of the Corporate Communications Department, with the collaboration of relevant departments both inside and outside of Japan and the cooperation of relevant people outside the company.
The Annual Report 2021 includes both a dialogue between the President and an outside expert on the topic of climate change, and one between an Outside Director and an Outside Corporate Auditor on the topic of our company’s
governance, enhancing the report’s disclosures relating to sustainability. In addition, the report includes a special feature on COVID-19, covering both its impact on our com- pany’s business and our contributions to society’s efforts to address it. We hope that this report will serve as a bridge for communication with our stakeholders and will convey the approach of the Group as a whole to creating new value.

Explanation of the Cover
Chemistry, where all sorts of substances come together and react with one another to create entirely new things, is something that enriches our daily lives. This dynamism of chemistry is represented by countless shining particles forming the shape of the swell of a wave.
 The Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation, put forth by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, is a handbook that serves as a shared language connecting companies and investors, systematically and comprehensively laying out the information that companies ought to convey to investors in order to raise the quality of information disclosure and of dialogue with investors. This report primarily relies on this guidance in the value creation models for sector information.
  Forward-looking Statements
Statements made in this annual report with respect to plans, strategies, and future per- formance that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. Sumitomo Chemical cautions that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements including, but not limited to, general eco- nomic conditions in Sumitomo Chemical’s markets; demand for, and competitive pricing pressure on, Sumitomo Chemical’s products in the marketplace; Sumitomo Chemical’s ability to continue to win acceptance for its products in these highly competitive markets; and movements of currency exchange rates.
Financial Statements in This Document
Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Sumitomo Chemical Group is adopting international financial reporting standards (IFRS) in place of Japanese GAAP, which it previously used, and is therefore restating figures for the previous consolidated fiscal year using IFRS for comparative analysis. However, as the consolidated statement of financial position was not cal- culated for the sectors using IFRS at the beginning of fiscal 2016, the sectors’ ROA for fiscal 2016 were not calculated.

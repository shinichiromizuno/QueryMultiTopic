Creating More Abundant and Convenient Daily Lives for People
Displays are the interfaces between people and ICT, and will continue to evolve alongside changes in people’s lifestyles and the progress in com- munications technology, part of the infrastructure of society. In addition to displays that provide even better portability or even more realistic viewing experiences, new displays, which are indispensable for technologies such as mixed reality, are being developed actively and these technologies even might change the nature of peoples’ experiences. By developing and pro- ducing materials and components for OLED displays and next-generation displays, Sumitomo Chemical is contributing to the creation of new items that have never existed before, and thereby creating more abundant and more convenient daily lives for everyone.

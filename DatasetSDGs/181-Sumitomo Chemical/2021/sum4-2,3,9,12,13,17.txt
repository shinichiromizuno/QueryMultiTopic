Contributing to a Stable Food Supply by
Improving Food Productivity
Plant growth regulators, one of the products of our overseas crop protection business, act to enhance the fruit-bearing ability of fruits and vegetables, increase their size, and improve their quality. As they can adjust the flowering and maturity periods, plant growth regulators can help crop cultivation even in cold and dry regions, and contribute to increasing food production in various regions around the world. In the face of an increasing world population and a growing world economy, there has been an increasing demand for safe food. We are increasing food productivity by globally supplying unique materials, and we aim to contribute to a stable food supply.

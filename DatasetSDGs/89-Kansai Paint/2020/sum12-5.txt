We commenced women’s participation and advancement activities in FY2016. This year, we held a forum which helped employees see these issues in a new light. While we are already on the way to putting in place the kind of environment that enables women to enjoy a long career at Kansai Paint, we will now shift our focus to providing support for women’s career advancement. First and foremost, it is important for women to have a proper career vision and the resolve to grow.

We help employees to balance work with childcare. Systems designed to support employees with childcare responsibilities include childcare leave, and the reduction of working hours until children graduate from elementary school.

I was really grateful for the maternity leave
system, as I was raising my first child and
wanted to spend as much quality time with my child as possible. I was the first person in my current department to make use of this system, but everyone was so sympathetic and resolved all of my anxieties, allowing me to take time off work with peace of mind. I was also able to extend my period of leave due to circumstances surrounding my child’s admission to daycare, for which I was grateful. Since I have returned to work, I have benefited from a more flexible working style, such as shorter hours and teleworking, which has been extremely helpful to me and my family. I hope that more people will choose to use this system, and that it will become even more convenient.

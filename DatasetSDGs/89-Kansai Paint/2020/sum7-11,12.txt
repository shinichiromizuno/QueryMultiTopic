Starting in FY2019, we made systematic efforts to reduce waste volumes under the ALES ECO PLAN. As a result, the amount of waste generated decreased by 9.0% compared with FY2018.
In FY2019, we again achieved a waste recycling ratio of 99% or higher, which has continued since FY1999.
We will continue to make efforts to reduce waste volumes through waste recycling and other initiatives.

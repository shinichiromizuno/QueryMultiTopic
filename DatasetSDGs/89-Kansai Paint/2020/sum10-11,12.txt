Coatings become effective once they have been applied, when they turn into dry coating film.
The incorrect use of even a safe product can lead to an accident. Kansai Paint provides information on the hazardous properties of products and handling precautions in safety data sheets (SDS), container labels and other sources. We prepare SDS and labels that comply with applicable laws and regulations, JIS standards, and guidelines issued by the Japan Paint Manufacturers Association. We will appropriately add and provide to users information necessary for the safe use of products.

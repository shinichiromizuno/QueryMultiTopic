To provide products to customers, our company consumes fossil fuels, a nonrenewable energy source, in the process emitting carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming.
Therefore, we are taking steps to save energy on a daily basis and update our facilities to be more energy- efficient in the belief that it is our responsibility as a manufacturer to reduce our energy consumption and CO2 emissions at all stages of production.

As a result of energy conservation activities, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the Production Division decreased by 2.5%. However, CO2 emissions per unit of output were 118kg-CO2/ton, up 1.7% from the FY2018 level.

The amount of energy used by the Production Division decreased by 2.9% from the FY2018 level, resulting in an increase of 1.7% in energy consumption per production unit from the FY2018 level. We will continue working to make more efficient use of energy.

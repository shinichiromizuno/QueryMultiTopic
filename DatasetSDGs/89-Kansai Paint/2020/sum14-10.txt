Awareness-raising activities during human rights week
We respect the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During Human Rights Week, which runs from December 4 to 10 every year as set out in the declaration, we hold activities to promote awareness of human rights.
Initiatives aimed at tackling human rights issues from the perspective of a company
Through alliances with the Corporate Federation for Dowa and Human Rights Issues, Osaka; the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo; and other industrial committees for the promotion of human rights; we actively participate in the projects of human rights groups and training held by government.

Working hand-in-hand with and for the local community
Each year, we provide paint to elementary and junior high schools neighboring the R&D Center (Hiratsuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture), our group’s R&D hub. In addition, technical instructors from our Group, including former employees, help out with painting work, thus deepening ties with the local community.

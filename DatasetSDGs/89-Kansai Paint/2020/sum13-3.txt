Kansai Paint considers its employees to be treasured company assets, and has initiated a range of occupational safety and health activities enabling everyone to work in safety and good health. This includes environmental safety and health inspections by management, carried out by a central HSE manager (General Manager of the Production Division) and a team of experts.

Following on from the previous fiscal year, we aimed to achieve zero accidents requiring time off work (one day or more off), but unfortunately one such accident occurred in FY2019.

We will continue working to eradicate accidents from the group by making ongoing improvements to the content of our safety activities, and fostering the kind of workplace culture in which all employees are aware of the dangers and work carefully with their colleagues to avoid risks.

The Health and Hygiene Subcommittee was established within the Environment Safety and Health Committee as a dedicated organization that engages in health management for employees of Kansai Paint Group. It works to improve mental health care for employees, mainly through Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services, in accordance with the Mental Health Promotion Plan.

We have also instituted a system for following up on employees diagnosed with medical conditions after periodic health examinations and are striving to maintain and promote the health of employees.

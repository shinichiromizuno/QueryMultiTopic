In terms of our water usage in FY2019, the amount of underground water we pumped up decreased temporarily in FY2018 with the construction of a deep well at one of our plants. As such, water usage increased by 1.8% compared with FY2018. We will continue finding ways to use water more efficiently, such as by making improvements to equipment cleaning methods.

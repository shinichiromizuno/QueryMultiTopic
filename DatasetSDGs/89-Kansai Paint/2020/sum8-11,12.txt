At all stages of its business activities, from research and development and the procurement of materials to the production, distribution and sales of products, as well as the use and disposal of products, Kansai Paint carries out procurement activities which take into consideration the health and safety of all, including employees, local communities, and customers. In recent years, suppliers have been affected by natural disasters, which have caused many problems with the supply of materials. Given this, we carry out risk assessments on all suppliers, in which we examine such factors as their vulnerability to earthquakes, storm damage, volcanoes, etc.
We had suppliers that ranked within the top 50 in terms of level of risk complete a questionnaire survey on BCM (business continuity management).
We will hold talks with those suppliers taking an inadequate approach to BCM and request that they take steps to address the situation. In addition, we will further reinforce our own response to supply problems so as to promote the secure procurement of materials.

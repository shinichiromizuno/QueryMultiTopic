Chemical substances with a particularly high toxicity or substances which are discharged in large volumes from manufacturing plants pose a risk to paint users and manufacturers, as well as the environment. In order to reduce the impact as much as possible, we are focusing our efforts on setting a target for reduction of the volume and use of such substances alongside our Medium-term Management Plan.

Anticorrosive pigments that contain hexavalent chromium are mainly used for applications that require long-term durability, protecting steel materials from rust and maintaining the aesthetic qualities of coated materials. We are working to reduce hexavalent chromium by switching to less harmful alternatives. In FY2019, we achieved a reduction of 86% compared with FY2003.

Toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene have long been used in coatings due to outstanding properties such as excellent coating film finish and rapid drying time. As these three substances are emitted in large quantities into the atmosphere, even as components in coatings, we are controlling the amounts contained in the products we sell as a way of limiting emissions into the atmosphere. The amount in FY2019 fell below that of FY2015.

Polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether and polyoxyethylene nonphenyl ether have long been used as key materials in water-based coatings. However, since it came to light that these substances are harmful to aquatic environments, we have been working to go greener by reducing their use in new products, or by switching to less harmful alternatives. In the case of some water-based coatings, we were unable to secure alternatives with sufficient coating performance, and the switchover period is running behind schedule. As such, we were unable to achieve our ECO PLAN 2021 targets in FY2019.

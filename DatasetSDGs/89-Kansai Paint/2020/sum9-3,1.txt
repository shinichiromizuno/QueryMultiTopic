In November 2019, we undertook a project at Ebina Elementary School in Kanagawa Prefecture as part of our work to promote health and welfare at schools. On this occasion, we used anti-contact infection tape coated with ALES-SHIKKUI, our groupâ€™s functional lime plaster paint. As lime plaster paint possesses antibacterial and antiviral properties, this school decided to use it as a measure against influenza. This involved applying the product to sections of the building that people frequently touch and which therefore pose a risk of infection from contact, such as classroom doors and handrails. The students watched with interest as we applied the tape, which helped them understand the meaning and importance of taking anti-contact infection steps, and we received feedback from the school that our project had a secondary effect, in that it encouraged students to be more rigorous with washing their hands.

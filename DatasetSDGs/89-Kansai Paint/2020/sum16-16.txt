We have established a hotline for internal reporting as part of a system enabling employees to make reports directly to the Compliance Promotion Committee rather than going through regular routes within the organization. In addition, this hotline is run independently from management, with the stipulation that whistleblowers are granted anonymity and protected from disadvantageous treatment. In FY2019, we also established an external hotline, available for use by domestic group companies as well.

We distribute a corporate ethics handbook and continuously provide compliance education to improve employee awareness.

During training for new employees and managers, we continue to conduct a series of training sessions on overall compliance, as well as other training covering such things as competition laws and the prevention of corruption for members of the Business Division or those being posted overseas. In regard to insider trading in particular, we hold drives four times a year through our intranet to raise awareness and to deepen understanding.

Our standards for the prevention of corruption and bribery are set out in our Codes of Behavior, as follows.

This code of behavior prohibits acts of all kinds which conflict with the Anti-monopoly Law. It also states that we shall comply with not only this law in Japan but also the equivalent laws of other countries.

This code of behavior contains stipulations on how we conduct ourselves in line with commonly-accepted norms and social practices, declaring that we shall not engage in acts which are in conflict with laws and regulations on bribery, etc., such as refraining from giving gifts or entertaining staff from government offices or similar public organizations. It also states how we shall conduct ourselves in the same manner overseas, acting with an understanding of local customs, laws, regulations, etc.

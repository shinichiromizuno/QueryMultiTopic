Efforts to improve corporate governance
Kansai Paint continues working to improve its corporate governance while responding to amendments to laws and listing rules, as well as changes in social and economic environments. By doing so, we aim to help our group achieve sustainable growth and improve its mid- to long-term corporate values, as well as encourage coexistence and mutual prosperity between a range of stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, business partners, and local communities.

The Board of Directors is structured to ensure: an appropriate number of board members; a proper ratio of internal and outside directors; balance, among internal directors, of representation for production, sales, procurement, technology, and administration; and a broad scope of knowledge, experience, and expertise among outside directors. The Audit & Supervisory Board comprises internal members as well as independent, expert outside auditors.

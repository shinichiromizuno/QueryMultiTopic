Casio History
History of Value Creation at Casio
Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was founded by the four Kashio brothers Tadao, Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio. Applying their respective expertise, they founded Casio Computer in 1957 after successfully developing the world’s smallest electronic calculator. The second oldest brother Toshio, who was in charge of development, embraced the unique belief that invention is the mother of necessity. He believed not in developing the products based on user demand, but using the products we develop to create new demand among users. This became the development philosophy that advanced digital technology and helped provide society with new products and inventions, including calculators, timepieces, and electronic musical instruments. Today, this is the philosophy through which Casio continues to create new value.

Business Summary
Net sales decreased due to the impact of the withdrawal from the compact camera business in the fiscal year ended March 2018, and economic slowdown in China and Europe, as well as the impact of changes in the external environment such as currency depreciation in emerging economy nations. However, we implemented structural reforms to improve our profit structure. As a result, we recorded decreased net sales and increased profits for the full year, with net sales of 298,161 million yen and operating profit of 30,262 million yen. Profit attributable to owners of parent was 22,135 million yen with earnings per share (EPS) improving to 89.86 yen.

  Annual Results
Segment net sales were 257,354 million yen (down 4.3% YoY) due to our withdrawal from the compact camera business but the benefits of structural improvements resulted in segment profit of 38,232 million yen (up 9.1% YoY).
• Timepiece Business
Performance was favorable thanks to strong sales of metal products, including the full metal spec model GMW-B5000, the first in the original G-SHOCK 5000 series (G-SHOCK annual sales: 9.5 million units). We maintained a high level of profitability despite economic slowdown and other difficult changes in the external environment.
• Educational Computer Business
Sales of calculators remained favorable thanks to stable scientific calculator sales to student markets (scientific calculator annual sales: 23.6 million units). We also secured profitability for sales of electronic dictionaries, which have also been a strong seller to students. We also launched a web app business providing compatibility with the electronic testing and electronic textbook markets. This marks the start of a new pillar for the Educational Computer Business. In the musical instruments business, the Privia PX-S1000, compact digital piano, launched in February, has been well-received by the market.

  Annual Results
Thanks to the withdrawal from the printer business and other low-profitability businesses in FY2017, fiscal year ended March 2018 profitability improved significantly and resulted in recording an operating profit. However, in FY2019, due in part to the postponement of special orders for legally mandated cash registers in France, net sales were 33,821 million yen (down 11.7% YoY) and operating losses were 910 million yen (previous FY resulted in segment profit of 583 million yen).

This fiscal year saw the impact of US-China trade friction expand on a global level as well as the impact of geopolitical instability in emerging nations and declining optimism among Japanese manufacturers. However, Casio focused on utilizing the strengths of our business model grounded in products such as timepieces and scientific calculators to achieve continuous business growth.
Although net sales decreased due to the withdrawing from the compact camera business and the impact of the external environment, we were successful at improving our profit structure to record decreased revenues but increased profit. Net sales decreased by 5.3% YoY to 298.2 billion yen while operating profit increased by 2.3% to 30.3 billion yen and profit attributable to owners of parent increased by 13.1% to 22.1 billion yen.
During the fiscal year ending March 2020, we will promote growth strategies based on our new medium-term management plan to achieve net sales of 310.0 billion yen, operating profit of 31.5 billion yen, and profit attributable to owners of parent 22.5 billion yen.

 Start of New Medium-Term Management Plan
Total Optimization as One CASIO for True Growth Throughout our 60-year history, Casio has achieved growth by embracing the corporate creed of Creativity and Contribution and the development philosophy of "0 → 1" (create something from nothing). In recent years, we have experienced some regret in not being able to take advantage of our various assets, including the proprietary technology we have cultivated over the years and our passionate personnel.
Specifically, an over-emphasis on achieving goals set within each division has given way to business management focused on the short-term perspective of each product or department. This indicates we have not sufficiently analyzed our own strengths and weaknesses, and that we have not successfully engaged in the cycle of efficiently injected assets to create and sell products. This also indicates that the work policies adopted by our development, production, sales, and head office staff were not sufficient for adapting to changes in the global business environment.
Under our new medium-term management plan, we will break through this state and aim for true growth by advancing structural reforms to establish unified development and production structures, a unified sales structure, and a unified head office functions as One CASIO. We will organize our strengths and maximize the potential of Casio’s proprietary technology, strong business model, and superior brand recognition to achieve dramatic new growth.
Through One CASIO, we also will promote internal transparency. We will move away from the localized optimization that made it difficult to visualize processes outside one’s own department and establish a platform for the total optimization and visualization of assets throughout the Casio Group. We will share goals and values and adopt a common Group management perspective to create a strong organization that enables Casio to act and adapt to changes in our business environment.

Four Growth Strategies
Four Growth Strategies to Challenge Ourselves to Reform
Our new medium-term management plan aims to increase our medium- and long-term corporate value by implementing four growth strategies: Timepiece Business growth, Educational Computer Business growth, new business creation, and structural reforms to support growth strategies.
As a growth driver, in the Timepiece Business we will continue to engage in innovative manufacturing centered on the unparalleled G-SHOCK brand. We will continue to expand our product line of metal watches, which we launched in 2018 to great popularity. We also will utilize our strengths in the outdoor sector to secure a firm position in the smart watch market.
We see room for significant growth in the Educational Computer Business. We will continue to expand the GAKUHAN market, a unique business cultivated through our network of education ministries and teachers in target countries, to contribute to the academic performance of students around the world. We must continue developing web applications and pioneer new markets to respond to the expected global growth of electronic testing and the electronic textbook markets.
To create new businesses, we will engage in creating new markets based on Casio’s unique and creative technology. This is the highest priority mission for Casio. We are already engaging in development for new segments such as medicine, health care, beauty, and urban infrastructure. For example, we will apply the digital imaging technology cultivated through digital camera development towards image diagnosis support systems for illnesses such as skin cancer. Our Business Development Center will take a leading role in linking Casio technology with market needs.
• Use strengths of G-SHOCK brand to expand metal watch sales and establish position in smartwatch market
• Continuous sales growth in stable student market (GAKUHAN)
• Establish electronic education business to develop new domains
• Use strengths to create new markets
• Implement structural reforms to evolve into businesses capable of new growth

Numerical Financial Goals
As initiatives to improve profitability for Language Education, Musical Instruments, Projectors, and System Equipment, we will implement structural reforms based on selection and concentration. Under the concept of unified development and production structures, a unified sales structure, and a unified head office functions, we will achieve profitability by taking a business- centric approach to the efficient allocation and use of limited resources.
Through this strategy, in the fiscal year ending March 2022, the final year of our medium-term management plan, we will aim for net sales of 360.0 billion yen, operating profit of 42.0 billion yen, an operating margin of 11.7%, and an ROE of 13%.
We will focus on linking business activities to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our goal at Casio is to provide users with truly useful products and contribute to society. As we evaluate the domains in which we can contribute to stakeholders, the 17 goals of the SDGs will provide us with valuable hints. To revise the direction of our business from the perspective of the SDGs, we clarified the sustainability goals we will engage in for each business during 2019.
From Making Products to Providing New Experiences
Under the corporate creed of Creativity and Contribution, we will identify latent user needs before they materialize to create new markets by constantly creating optimal products and services. We believe this is our reason for existing in society. We want Casio products to be natural companions for

 people, something that people naturally use in their daily lives or realized it was a Casio product only after using it. In creating new markets, we will focus on creating products and services that become a familiar and important part of people’s lives. More than anything, it is critical that we strive to be an Only 1 company that exists as a familiar partner to our users.
To realize this goal, instead of focusing on creating products that will appeal to everyone, we must clarify our desire to provide specific experiences to specific people. I believe the core of our manufacturing is to create specialized products and services that truly benefit users and that boast the highest quality. What we must do is transcend the concepts of simple manufacturing to provide new experiences to new users.
Casio will establish this position by working with optimal partners to achieve co-creation. Throughout the long history of Casio, we have prided ourselves on proprietary technology and originality as drivers of digitalization. However, as times change and market diversification transcends the framework of digital versus analog, new breakthroughs are not possible as long as we focus solely on internal and proprietary achievements. Providing specific users with completely new experiences requires that we aggressively incorporate technology and knowhow that does not exist within the Casio Group. We will strive for mutual synergy by working with partners in win-win relationships to provide unique and original value.
In the sports segment, we already are collaborating with Asics on a new project to provide custom running experiences to individual runners and support health improvements. This co-creation project contributes to improved health for people and represents the new era of Creativity and Contribution at Casio.

Two Business Platforms
Two Business Platforms
To reform into a business platform to support our four growth strategies, we will create a business platform that improves our medium- to long-term corporate value. The first step in this initiative, fundamental organizational changes, has already been implemented. We will continue by creating seven business units and four management functions to clarify the allocation of responsibilities. This structure will enable us to engage in business management from a medium- and long-term perspective as we implement our medium-term management plan.
We will stimulate our organization and human resources by securing human resources with expertise in AI, IoT, digital marketing and e-commerce, as well as human resources experienced in global settings. To create an optimal environment for the next generation of manufacturing, we will further invest in our Hamura R&D Center, a key element in these initiatives.
We will promote engagement by our younger employees, the people who will carry Casio into the future, and promote manufacturing centered on our young engineers. We will work on workstyle reform and stimulating communication to ensure all Casio employees are highly motivated in their work.
Changing as a company requires that our workplaces share and work towards the common goal of continuing to benefit our users. As we seek to fuse top-down and bottom-up, the various division managers linking those functions must first achieve change to ensure they accurately convey the will of management to their teams while fostering the potential of young human resources. We will establish a framework for promoting change within the company in order to maximize our strengths and abilities.
Strengthen Corporate Governance
In June 2019, we transitioned from an Audit & Supervisory Board structure to an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure as part of an initiative to strengthen our corporate governance structure. Through this initiative, we will
• Reinforce business management centered on medium and long-term approach, business units, and management functions
• Reinforce supervision of medium-term management plan
• Create organization adapted to business environment changes (rejuvenation, hire younger generations, secure external human resources)
• Reforms to increase motivation and create next-generation development environment
  Create a business platform that improves our medium- to long-term corporate value
 Stimulate organization and human resources
     18 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

clarify the mission of each director and executive officer, and reinforce the supervisory functions of the Board of Directors. Under that supervision, we will speed up and optimize our execution of business operations.
To stimulate our Board of Directors, we reduced the number of directors and increased our ratio of outside directors from 29% to 38%. Each new member has vast business management experience and knowledge in various sectors, and we believe each member will fulfill the expectations of our stakeholders through their involvement with the Board of Directors, Compensation Committee, and the Nomination Committee.
Prioritize Growth Investments and
Improve Capital Efficiency
By placing our highest priority on investing in growth sectors while ensuring financial stability, we will achieve medium- to long-term growth and sustainable improvements to our ROE. We also will engage in business activities focused on capital costs to optimize capital efficiency and create free cash flow. In the fiscal year ending March 2022, the final year of our medium- term management plan, we will aim for an ROE of 13%, an equity ratio of 60%, and a DE ratio of 0.4 or lower.
For dividends, we focus on providing stable dividends that are balanced with our business performance. During the period of the current medium-term management plan, we are planning on maintaining a dividend payout ratio of 40% and a shareholders’ equity dividend ratio of 5%.
Casio will implement structural reforms under the concept of One CASIO in order to fully achieve the goals outlined in our medium-term management plan. In October 2019, we launched a management plan execution project in order to further clarify and ensure the efficacy of our medium-term management plan and to promote the aggressive implementation of plan strategies and policies. By resolving social issues through our business activities, we will continue to exist and grow as a company that is trusted by society.
We hope the Integrated Report 2019 will promote further understanding among our investors and stakeholders of the ideals and goals of the Casio Group.

Market Changes Driven by Rapid Expansion of Smartwatch Market
During the fiscal year ended March 2019, Timepiece Business net sales were largely unchanged year on year, increasing 1% to 171.8 billion yen. As its stable position as an unparalleled global brand, G-SHOCK continued to achieve stable growth and the fiscal year ended March 2019 was particularly firm on sales of new full metal products. As a result, net sales increased year on year to 89.5 billion yen.
On the other hand, we were also impacted by sales of analog quartz products, which faced the global contraction of the conventional analog wristwatch market. This is due to the growing global popularity of the smartwatch and technology innovation that has erased the line between smartwatches and conventional wristwatches.
The rapidly growing smartwatch market has already surpassed the period of excessive competition and the elimination of weak brands has seen major players solidify their position in the market. As functions and

applications become commodities, it has become more difficult for brands to distinguish themselves based on hardware differences. We are entering a stage in which companies use brand recognition to secure market position.
Mission of Our Medium-Term Management Plan
Since launching the Timepiece Business in 1974, Casio has changed how society views timepiece and created a new culture around timepiece. It is important that we respond to market changes today by using the brand recognition and knowledge we have cultivated over the years to disseminate a sound market presence.
During our medium-term management plan, we will use the brand recognition of the G-SHOCK product line, for which we have shipped over 100 million units worldwide, to expand the metal watch product line and develop smartwatch products. We also will accelerate expansion into emerging markets. By the fiscal year

  ending March 2022, we aim to increase total annual G-SHOCK sales to 12 million units and aim for metal G-SHOCK sales of 36.0 billion yen. We also aim to establish a position on the smartwatch market and are forecasting net sales of 10.0 billion yen for G-SHOCK smartwatch products.
Through the above initiatives, we will increase the ratio of sales for the highly profitable G-SHOCK to 60% and aim for Timepiece Business total net sales of 200.0 billion yen.
Business Growth Driven by
Innovative Metal Model
In the fiscal year ended March 2019, the newly launched full metal series drove sales of the G-SHOCK brand as a product that uses stainless steel and other metal materials for the outer body, which up to this point had been made from resin materials. Amid a lack of new themes to attract customers to the conventional wristwatch market, our metal models provided a new user experience by using an innovative design that allowed the tough G-SHOCK to be worn in everyday situations. Today, continuously sparking market change is a prerequisite to being chosen by users. During our medium-term management plan, we will continue to exceed market expectations by creating a vast variety of new designs for the metal series.
Technological innovation is key to creating new designs. For example, with metal materials, conventional colors such as silver and gold are common but Casio is currently challenging itself to creating a diverse range of color variations. By overcoming difficult
Plan by Genre
technical challenges such as adding color to metal, we will be able to create products with textures that are completely different compared to resin colors.
From the fiscal year ending March 2020, we will vastly expand on our line of metal products as we aim for further market growth. We forecast the ratio of G-SHOCK sales represented by metal watches will increase from 20% in the fiscal year ended March 2019 to 30% in the fiscal year ending March 2022.
Establishing Position in
the Smartwatch Market
Casio is the only watch manufacturer with experience engaging in the smartphone market. We will apply the strengths of the G-SHOCK brand to establish a firm position in the market. With certain players having already established themselves in the market, the challenge for Casio will be to promote the robustness of the G-SHOCK to capture a position as the de facto standard in the active and outdoor market. We will combine the fashion sense unique to the G-SHOCK brand with GPS and other user-friendly features to provide new experiences. By adding smart features to increase user value for conventional G-SHOCK users who demand robustness in their work and outdoor watches, we will generate demand for new and replacement purchases.
Ahead of a new sales launch in FY 2021, we are making technology investments towards making our devices more compact, faster, and requiring less power consumption. We also are enhancing software development for apps. Smart functions are the key to

  global market expansion. In the future, we will aim to capture new users in markets for everyday use created by our metal products.
Enhancing Sales Structure for
Untapped Areas
In the Timepiece Business, areas tagged as core markets are untapped areas in emerging economies such as China, ASEAN, and India. In addition to advancing sales strategies customized to the level of market development in each country, we will strengthen relations with partner dealers to aim for business expansion. We also will strengthen head office support for local offices by establishing a Market Development Department and create multiple sales channels by engaging in both e-commerce and digital marketing as we establish a strategic sales structure.
For promotions, we will focus on establishing the G-SHOCK global brand feel in storefront presentations. We will use storefront displays that fully feature metal products to convey to consumers that G-SHOCK has changed and create new topics. We will take successful case studies from China, a market that continues to record annual growth, and other markets and apply them towards other core markets.
We recently signed global partnership contracts with pro basketball player Rui Hachimura, who will serve as a G-SHOCK ambassador. Moving forward, Hachimura will use social media and other formats to disseminate information to young audiences as part of our initiative to strengthen the G-SHOCK brand.
Plan by Area
Contributing to Environmental Load Reductions and Improved Health
We believe that the ideal final form for a timepiece is to be something that continues to display the time properly in any environment and without the need for user interaction and that can be used forever. Put another way, this means having no need for recharging, battery replacement, or any maintenance, as well as not producing any waste products. With this ultimate form in mind, throughout all our business activities we take an environmentally friendly approach to our pursuit of low-energy, low- resource products. As part of this initiative, we are focusing on the growing problem of plastic waste in our oceans by working to reduce the use of plastic in packaging materials.
In the current smartwatches we are developing, we are using the characteristics of wearable devices to increase user value through walking and running to contribute to increasing sports opportunities. By providing smartwatches and applications used on a regular basis by consumers, we will increase the fun and joy of exercise and contribute to health improvements.

Forecasting Stable Conventional Markets and Growth in Untapped Markets
In the Educational Computer Business, sales of scientific calculators to schools continue to record stable growth on a global scale. During the fiscal year ended March 2019, sales of scientific calculators totaled 23.6 million units across over 100 countries and posted a high profit margin of 16%. In Asia, Africa, South America and other untapped markets, we expect to achieve future market growth by rapidly responding to the ongoing issue of delays in promotional activities.
In the education market, Europe and America in particular are beginning the transition from paper to electronic media. With the move towards digital textbooks and the use of computers for the creation and scoring of tests, the current markets for e-textbooks and e-testing in North America alone are 1.4 billion dollars and 5.3 billion dollars, respectively. These markets represent new keys to business growth.
Contributing to Education in Over 100 Countries Worldwide
Strengths of the Casio Original Business Model GAKUHAN
GAKUHAN is at the core of our Educational Computer Business. GAKUHAN is a proprietary business model established by Casio to help realize better education by supporting schools and teachers. Casio scientific calculators boast a majority share of the global market. After product sales, we continue contributing to improving student academic potential by providing teachers with continued training as well as by proposing mathematics classes and developing teaching materials.
For over 30 years, we have engaged in GAKUHAN activities in various countries and regions around the world. Through this powerful network of educational institutions, we have created a flow in the countries we operate through which new first-year students purchase and learn using Casio products. By engaging in customized activities to suit the needs of each education environment, we are providing high added value to our users.

Identify 13 Core Countries and Enhance GAKUHAN Activities
During our medium-term management plan, we will further accelerate the overseas scientific calculator business to achieve stable growth for the GAKUHAN business model. For untapped markets, we have identified 13 core countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and aim for market growth by introducing products that are compatible with the educational needs of each country. We will engage in a bidirectional approach to GAKUHAN activities: top-down engagement involving lobbying local education ministries on education reform and a bottom-up approach that involves having school students and teachers use scientific calculators and providing guidance on more efficient learning methods.
From the fiscal year ending March 2020, we will establish a dedicated market development team in the head office and strengthen our structure by enhancing human resources. To effectively promote products in regions where Casio does not have a sales office, we strengthened dealer responses in each region. We also are planning annual line enhancements at our Thai production base and will engage in aggressive investments to increase production capacity.
We also will focus on strengthening our anti- counterfeiting measures. We will adopt a two-way approach involving both technical and legal measures, including developing new products that are difficult to counterfeit, registering trademarks and concepts, and adopting a web-based authentication system. Eliminating counterfeit products protects users from harm and is vital to increasing Casio brand reputation and market share in each region.
Through these initiatives, during the period of the medium-term management plan, we will aim for general and scientific calculator sales of 53.0 billion yen.
Creating Business Model in the E-Testing and E-Textbook Markets
We believe that, right now, responding to the accelerating shift from analog to digital in global education markets is extremely important. With the e-testing and e-textbook markets expected to see significant growth, we will accelerate our response, which will center on software development.
Specifically, we will use the knowledge cultivated through GAKUHAN to focus on web app development, including test
modules, math learning tools, and automatic scoring tools. For example, if we can popularize the electronic textbooks that enable problem solving and graph plotting on a browser, we can significantly contribute to improving the quality and convenience of mathematics education. Using North America and Europe as a launching point, we will partner with the test management companies and textbook publishers of each country to promote joint development that incorporates Casio computer technology. In the current medium-term management plan, we have allocated a software development budget of 600 million yen as we establish the platform for Casio’s first software business.
In the fiscal year ending March 2022, the final year of our current medium-term management plan, we will aim for net sales of 2.0 billion yen from new segments. Through the medium- and long-term global development of new business models established in those segments, we will respond to changing educational workplace needs and contribute to the development of global e-learning systems.
Mission to Support Learning Potential for Students Around the World
At Casio, our unwavering social mission is to contribute to the development of global education through our Educational Computer Business and to support student learning potential.
Today, Casio develops and provides products suited to the educational needs of each country in hopes of achieving better mathematics education across the world. By promoting our proprietary GAKUHAN business model, we will provide training using scientific calculators to more teachers and contribute to improving educational levels around the world.
At the same time, as we accelerate our global expansion, we will work aggressively to reduce the use of resources and reduce the impact our business activities have on the environment. For example, annual sales of 23.6 million scientific calculators means a massive amount of paper is used for the included user manuals. However, we can avoid using those resources by shifting to web-based versions. Protecting the trees used as raw material for paper pulp will contribute to sustainable forests.

TOPICS
 Concluded Partnership Agreement With
the Indonesia Ministry of Education and Culture
In September 2018, Casio concluded a partnership agreement with the Indonesia Ministry of Education and Culture. This partnership aims to develop teacher and student potential in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
Since 2016, Casio has engaged in GAKUHAN activities in Indonesia. By providing training to mathematics teachers and by holding mathematics contests, Casio aims to promote the educational benefits of education focused on using scientific calculators to simplify the process of mathematics calculations, which will in turn lead to increased problem-solving skills.
Through this partnership agreement, Casio will provide training for teachers with mathematics classes using scientific calculators and hold trial classes as pilot schools across the country. The results gained from these trials will be applied towards developing class teaching methods and class materials. Through our partnership with the Indonesian government, we will apply the knowledge cultivated through the scientific calculator business to contribute to increasing STEM education levels in Indonesia.

Focusing on Four Business Themes
The Business & Technology Development Center oversees the development of new businesses. Our mission is to create new markets that take advantage of Casio’s strengths.
In FYE 3/2019, we initiated a broad-based inventory analysis of the various assets of the Casio Group, including our technology, brand, offices, and distribution channels. At the same time, we worked to analyze long-term trends from the perspective of identifying markets that are highly demanded by society and that have potential for significant growth. We spent the year outlining what Casio can do and what Casio should be doing when we combine Casio’s technology with market trends. What we discovered was four themes: health and sports tech, beauty tech, image- based diagnosis support, and imaging modules. In each of these latent markets, Casio will create new businesses by working with co-creator partners capable of providing added value.
New Business Model for Co-Creation With Asics
We have partnered with major sports equipment manufacturer Asics on health and sports tech to commercialize services for individual runners.
Today, more than 140 million people worldwide engage in running activities. Of those people, some 75% have reported struggling with some form of injury. We will develop a service to act as a personal running coach throughout the running season for individuals seeking to develop a running form that allows them to run faster without injury. By combining Casio G-SHOCK, sensor and

Digitalization
AI technologies with the Asics running knowledge grounded in sports science and big data gathered from the Asics customer base of 46 million professional athletes and amateur runners, we will create a completely new service that provides total customized proposals for everything from form coaching to selecting the optimal shoes.
Starting gradually from 2020, Casio and Asics are planning to develop omni-channels encompassing their respective flagship stores and retail shops. We will develop this partnership into a major business that may even entail establishing a joint venture in the future.
Continuous Development of New Businesses
We are advancing this type of initiative, which turns a page on the conventional one-off sales business approach, into three other segments. In beauty tech, we have started on a business using Casio proprietary printing technology in a business alliance with Kose. A dermocamera was developed through a collaboration with Chiba University and Shinshu University, which developed PC software to manage photo images. The imaging module, which uses image processing technology and mathematical algorithms, involved collaborations with multiple co-creation partners and has potential as a new business.
This new business creation will accelerate Casio towards the next stage of growth. In the fiscal year ending March 2022, the final year of our medium-term management plan, we will aim for net sales of 20.0 billion yen. Furthermore, we will look ahead to future growth by developing new markets from a medium- and long-term perspective.

activities
Implement Structural Reforms
Language Education devices, musical instruments, projectors, and systems equipment have had business structure issues that have made it difficult to generate profits based on current sales volume. As such, in addition to implementing an early retirement scheme, we also optimized sales expenses by reviewing sales structures and reducing expenses companywide by assessing cost performance. Through structural reforms to development, production, sales, and head office functions under the concept of One CASIO, we will disengage from an unprofitable structure to establish a stable profit platform.

Apply Business Strengths to Restore Businesses to Growth Trajectories
We will apply the strengths of each business to create new genres and new products to establish and expand markets and restore businesses to trajectories for growth. In the Language Education Business, we will take advantage of Casio proprietary technology, brand recognition, and business models. For the Musical Instruments Business, we will focus on obvious markets. In the Projector and Systems Equipment Businesses, we will maximize potential by expanding sales in untapped areas.
Examples of Initiatives for
the Electronic Musical Instruments Business
The Musical Instruments Business was the first business unit to engage in such initiatives. The markets for musical instruments are stable and this business unit has secured sales by maintaining a certain share of the markets for digital pianos and electronic keyboards. However, problems related to product manufacturing methods and sales methods have resulted in losses. We have implemented various initiatives to address this situation, including revamping the previous business model that involved offering 60 different keyboard models. We reduced our product line for keyboards in half, reinforced centralized procurement for raw materials, strengthened our internal production structure, and developed channels through specialty shops. Through these initiatives, we have created a structure that can secure stable profits from the fiscal year ending March 2020 onward.
Major Reform Initiatives
 Production optimization
• Optimized keyboard product line Reduced models from 60 to 30 models
• Developed new sound sources (featuring Aix sound source)
• Strengthened internal production structure (transferred from EMS)
• Reduced costs by optimizing supply chain
• Promoted automation
Optimization of Distribution
• Restructured distribution (selection of retail stores)
• Dependency on mass retail > Developing specialty shop channels

Medium-Term Management Plan: Building Business Platform for Medium- to Long-Term Corporate Value Improvement
Business management thus far has been a collection of separate units that were partially optimized by product or area based on a short-term perspective. Under our new management structure, we will aim for business management that maximizes Casio’s strengths from a medium- to long-term perspective. The new executive structure is comprised of seven business units, each supervised by a business unit manager, and four functions. Through this structure, we will clarify responsibilities and shift from partial optimization to total optimization as One CASIO to promote market development and medium- to long- term improvements to our corporate value.

Strategies for Sustainable Growth
Medium-Term Management Plan: Stimulating Our Organization and Human Resources
The Casio Group positions the start of this medium-term management plan as the second founding of Casio as a company. As part of our growth strategy, we are working to stimulate our organization and our people by engaging in a two-pillar initiative aimed at achieving fundamental reforms to our human resource structure and creating a next-generation development environment.
To achieve fundamental reforms to our human resource structure, we will establish a new phase in our management platform that promotes the cultivation of a corporate culture capable of creating innovation. To create a next-generation development environment, we will focus on three key concepts: 1) Reducing work time and travel time, 2) Increasing time devoted to manufacturing, creation, and skills improvement, and 3) Creating a pleasant workplace and motivating work environment. By implementing these concepts, we will create the optimal workplace environment.
Creating an Innovative and
Invigorated Workplace
To increase employee motivation and productivity, we have implemented the following policies.
• Work hours reform
• Workplace reform
• Fundamental optimization of workflows
We are prioritizing employee-company engagement and view our goal as being the mutual growth and development of both employees and the company.
Promoting the Desire to Take on Challenges and Reform Activities
To reward and foster the development of employees who are motivated and act to contribute to Casio’s growth and development, we are conducting a fundamental review of our wages and benefits and evaluation structure.
• Wage structure linked to role and expectations • Goal management system that fairly evaluates
achievement levels relative to role and expectations • Process evaluation system that promotes the
development of core personnel
Through the above systems, we will promote the creation of an innovative culture at Casio and work to increase our energy as a company.
Fostering the Development of Energetic Personnel Who Like to Be Challenged Self-driven career formation
We are increasing training opportunities, providing career planning, and implementing job rotation to encourage employees to actively form their own career paths.
For management training, we provide coaching and are adopting new frameworks that enable improvements to workplace management skills.
Career support structure
We have adopted a career support structure that provides support to employees at the ages of 30, 40, and 49, pivotal turning points in an employee’s career, to help employees with self-assessments and help them evaluate future workstyles. We provide insight into potential career paths, both inside and outside the company, with the hope that employees will actively form their own careers based on their own interests and preferred workstyle.
Part of this structure is the Job Challenge System. This is a framework that enables spontaneous changes in an employee’s job rotation. Expanding the scope of one’s duties will enable employees to improve their skills. Also, the active personnel changes promoted through this system help stimulate the organization and help employees find their ideal positions within the company.
Promoting women and younger workers
Initiatives related to diversity are extremely important to stimulating our organization and human resources.
We have established KPI related to workplace stimulation as it relates to young employees, senior employees, and female employees. We are strengthening initiatives related to further promoting diversity.
To promote the advancement of young employees in particular, we strictly enforce our age-based mandatory retirement system to enable the aggressive hiring of talented young personnel.
Stimulating senior employees
We conducted a fundamental review of our rehiring structure to create a system that provides opportunities for energetic and motivated senior employees.
We clarify roles and expectations and have adopted a dynamic wage structure. We also engage in initiatives such as our Job Challenge System to help stimulate senior employees.
Design of Human Resource Structural Reforms
In these reforms to our human resource structure, we are conducting a total package review that includes wages and evaluations, training systems, workstyles, and work environment for everyone at Casio, regardless of gender, age, or position from management to regular employees, new hires and upcoming retirees, both senior and young employees. We are designing a simple and easy-to- understand HR structure that will enable all members of the Casio family to share in the direction Casio is heading and the priorities we uphold.

     Physical Environment
To create a next-generation development environment that improves development productivity and promotes innovation, we are conducting a fundamental rebuild of the Hamura R&D Center that will serve as the core of our development activities. We also are planning to establish satellite offices to enable workstyles that promote free thinking not bound by place, space, or time.
Headquarters to promote innovation
The Hamura R&D Center (Hamura, Tokyo) has a 45,000m2 lot that can be used to construct a building almost identical in size to the building currently in use. We are planning the construction of a building that will serve as a new headquarters. The new building will be designed to enable a pleasant environment that promotes diversity and adaptability while boasting environmental performance, earthquake and disaster resistance, and sustainability. In every sense the building will feature the latest functionality and serve as the main headquarters for the divisions that are key to product development (Product Planning, Quality, Emerging Business, Production Headquarters, etc.). At the same time, we also planning on creating offices for internal support divisions such as Information Technology & Engineering, General Affairs, and Intellectual Property while also securing space for collaboration with external co-creators and partners. We are aiming for completion of construction in three years.
Satellite spaces that promote free thinking
While the Hamura facility will be known as a main base featuring the latest functions, we also are planning the
establishment of satellite offices that will promote free- thinking environments that do not restrict employees by location. We currently are solidifying this concept and selecting candidate sites. We are looking to achieve spaces for co-creation based on the concept of a stimulating space. These satellite offices will increase opportunities for Casio employees to interact with people from unfamiliar career segments to promote new views and perspectives, and to help broaden the perspectives of Casio employees. We hope these sites will help create innovation.
Virtual Infrastructure Environment
To operate the new Hamura facility, satellite offices, and the Hatsudai main office as One CASIO, we must establish an environment that allows employees to achieve the same or better work performance as their main office, regardless of their physical location. To achieve this, we have already decided on the companywide integration of cutting-edge technology and equipment solutions for communications and IoT.
Workstyle Reforms
A workstyle that allows employees freedom in terms of location, space, and time is a critical element that will be key to achieving next-generation development. The purpose of both physical and virtual infrastructure development is to increase the time Casio employees are able to spend growing, building, increasing their productivity, and being creative. However, the key to supporting such diverse and dynamic workstyles will be flexible management and accurate evaluations. As such, simultaneous to physical infrastructure developments, we also will be conducting companywide training for management personnel.

Platform for Growth
Corporate Governance
To promote sustainable growth and medium- to long-term improvements to our corporate value, we posi- tion swift decision-making, the proper performance of duties, and strengthening our management over- sight functions as core issues for the company. To ensure appropriate responses to these issues, we are strengthening Board of Directors oversight functions. To accelerate and optimize business execution based on appropriate supervision by the Board of Directors, with a resolution passed on June 27, 2019 at the Regular General Meeting of Shareholders, we switched from a company with an Audit and Supervisory Board to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee Structure.
Strengthening Corporate Governance
With the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee Structure, in June 2018 we abolished the three- member Audit & Supervisory Board and increased the num- ber of directors from seven to eight. As a result, the total number of board members decreased by two to eight and the ratio of outside directors increased from 28.6% to 37.5%.
We also are reevaluating nomination standards for outside directors as we shift towards increasing the number of board members with corporate management experience and invigorate the Board of Directors.
Board of Directors and Directors
The Board of Director is chaired by the President and CEO, and is comprised of the eight members including three outside directors.

Methods for Calculating Director Compensation Amounts
To ensure the sustainable growth of the company, our basic policy for Director compensation is to offer incentives that ensure competitive compensation levels while promoting a healthy entrepreneurial spirit. In principle, compensation is comprised of 60% fixed salary (monthly) and 40% perfor- mance-linked compensation (bonuses and stock options).
Of the abovementioned performance-linked compensa- tion, bonus levels are set based on performance relative to net sales and operating profit goals and actual sales figures. Business conditions and other qualitative factors are re- flected in bonus amounts. For stock-related compensation, on June 27, 2019 the General Meeting of Shareholders voted to adopt a system for stock compensation with transfer restrictions. Compensation for outside directors is com- prised solely of a fixed monthly compensation amount.
Director’s Training
Based on the belief that directors must continue to advance their skills and knowledge if they are to sufficiently fulfill their roles, we actively promote self-improvement by direc- tors. The Company continuously offers the support, includ- ing the provision of information, opportunities, and cost reimbursements, necessary for self-improvement. We continuously offer information to promote a better under- standing of our business operations. This includes planning and providing opportunities for outside directors, both at the time of appointment and throughout the term of their appointment, to participate in important internal meetings, tour domestic and overseas plants and offices, and attend
internal research seminars. Directors who are members of the Supervisory and Authority Committee are provided opportunities for skills improvement necessary for their roles and responsibilities through information provision by the Japan Audit & Supervisory Board Members Association and participation in seminars.
Internal Auditing
The Internal Audit Department consists of four auditors who audit the status of organizational management based on common group standards and work to strengthen internal controls. Dedicated staff have been allocated to directors who are members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee (including outside director) to assist them in their work and they exchange information on a daily basis and they hold regular quarterly meetings. They also plan internal audits, provide a summary report based on the items audited after internal audits have been conducted, and work together to improve the efficiency and effective- ness of the audit function. The results of internal audits are reported to directors (excluding directors who are mem- bers of the Audit & Supervisory Committee).
TOB Defense Measures
We do not implement TOB defense measures.
Analysis and Evaluation of Board of Directors Effectiveness
With an awareness of the changes in the roles expected of the Board of Directors, we evaluate the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors and conduct reviews aimed at strength- ening organizational and operational governance.

38 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

In FY2019, we conducted interviews of directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members regarding points of improve- ment related to the role, function, and implementation of the Board of Directors’ meetings. From these interviews, we received opinions such as the need to review standards for meeting agendas, and enhance meeting materials. We are applying these evaluation results towards increasing meet- ing efficacy and making continuous improvements.
Dialogues With Shareholders
We view proactive dialogues to promote building long-term, trust-based relationships with our shareholders and inves- tors as critical to elevating our corporate value. Under the direction of our President & CEO, our executive officer responsible for IR oversees corporate IR activities.
Our internal structure promotes a common awareness of the importance of dialogue with shareholders. We collabo- rate on IR activities by gathering and accumulating neces- sary information from the networks linking relevant depart- ments. Directors or executive officers directly engage in IR activities as necessary depending on theme and content. In addition to sharing opinions received through shareholder interactions with the Board of Directors, we also share information at executive officer meetings as necessary to reflect those opinions in measures aimed at increasing corporate value.
To ensure the management of insider information during IR activities, we have outlined rules concerning the han- dling of important undisclosed information and work to ensure strict implementation of those rules. Part of our response measures includes requiring that meetings are attended by multiple people.
In addition to communication through individual meet- ings, other measures for IR management include holding quarterly earnings conferences for institutional investors and securities analysts where the President or executive officer responsible for IR provides a summary of financial results, introduces earnings forecasts, and explains opera- tions. To promote further understanding of our company, we are enhancing external communications by listing various IR information on our website and have established a help desk for receiving inquiries from shareholders.

Platform for Growth
Compliance
Casio reinforces compliance to support healthy corporate management.
Compliance Risk Management
At Casio, we have identified 70 laws related to our business operations and conducted assessments to confirm the status of our response to each law. After assigning priority to initiatives based on the possibility of risk occurrence and the potential impact on business, we organized a structure for proposing and implementing individual countermeasures as well as a general management structure. The lead department associated with each risk conducts the orga- nized planning of risk avoidance and reduction measures and the secretariat applies the PDCA cycle to implement comprehensive management. The Internal Audit Depart- ment conducts audits of this entire framework. We currently are transitioning to a framework that includes conducting regular checks of new laws and legal revisions to identify major issues as topics to be addressed. Under this frame- work, the committee secretariat conducts risk audits as necessary to regularly monitor the status of countermea- sures implemented thus far and to confirm the appropriate- ness of implementation. To address the intent of the Compa- nies Act revisions enacted in May 2015, we are shifting our risk management focus on overseas compliance.
Whistleblower Hotline
To ensure compliance that protects human rights, Casio has established a Whistleblower Hotline. In addition to support in Japan, we also are focused on promoting understanding among our global Group employees by creating a framework that supports English and Chinese language. We also have established an external Whistleblower Hotline specifically for consultations from our business partners.
Risk Management Structure
Export Control
Casio designates export control managers within our de- partments involved in export management to ensure strict compliance with export management. We are addressing the enactment of the Exporter Compliance Standards by en- hancing educational activities for Group companies in Japan in order to respond to relevant legal revisions and reinforce legal compliance. At the same time, we conduct annual self-audits to ensure we are properly maintaining and managing our structure.
In addition to Japanese laws, we also have established a management structure to address US Export Administration Regulations to enhance our global export management.

Casio is enhancing our compliance structure related to the Antitrust Law and the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations. We have established an Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representa- tions Compliance Committee, which is comprised of mem- bers from all related departments, outlined voluntary management rules, and implemented education and other measures via our company intranet to promote awareness. Casio also provides guidance through a response help desk, shares customer opinions and feedback, and shares case studies from self-audits and improvements implemented in relevant departments.
The Sales Department distributes Sales Compliance Cards to employees and requires that they carry these cards with them at all times as a way to promote understanding and awareness of fair competition and transactions.

Risk Management
Casio appropriately responds to our operating environment to ensure business continuity and improve our corporate value.
Basic Policy
At Casio, we work to ensure business stability and security by responding appropriately to the various risks that impact our operating environment. Under the supervision of the director responsible for risk management, our basic policy is to predict risks, implement preventative measures to mini- mize potential losses and, if losses are incurred, implement effective follow-up measures to ensure business continuity and improve our corporate value.
Risk Management Structure
1. We have established an appropriate risk management structure through these risk management activities led by relevant departments, which act in accordance with Risk Management Rules, and activities are overseen by the CSR Committee.
2. We have created a Risk Management Manual to ensure our ability to respond to unpredictable incidents. The Risk Management Manual outlines our response as a corpo- rate organization and focuses on securing the safety of directors and employees and their families, and on pre- serving corporate assets.
3. In accordance with the Fundamental Policies on Product Safety, we draft and implement voluntary action plans related to product safety. We strive to make constant improvements and through quality visualization, quality information sharing, and meetings on quality policy and measures, we conduct quality assurance activities that span all business departments.
4. We have established a secretariat for supervising all quality activities, managing progress, and conducting evaluations. Furthermore, we have established an Audit Department for monitoring the appropriateness of our risk management activities.
Creating a Structure for the Future
With the companywide organizational reforms implemented in June 2018, we are creating the following three structures to be overseen by the new Corporate Governance Division.
i. Basic Structure
We will redevelop the education, training, and procedural manuals that serve as the foundation of company-wide risk management to prevent losses and minimize the impact on company operations in the event of an incident.
ii. Liaison Structure
We will improve a structure that ensures business continuity and our ability to meet the needs of stakeholders by en- abling smooth and rapid status assessments, and by ensur- ing that information is conveyed rapidly to management and relevant departments.
iii. Response Implementation Structure
We will conceive and create a total structure that ensures stable business continuity by enabling effective initial re- sponse and appropriate decision-making in the event of an incident that results in losses.
Business Continuity Initiatives
We also are working to enhance our business continuity plan (BCP). A BCP outlines procedures to promote rapid safety confirmation for directors and employees, rapid assess- ments of damage, rapid business recovery and overall business continuity in the event a future situation, such as a large-scale earthquake directly underneath the Tokyo Metropolitan area, forces a suspension of operations. This structure is centered on the global supply chain and aims to minimize losses and reassure our business partners and customers. In the event our main office is damaged in a disaster, we will establish a response headquarters to direct limited resources in the continued provision of products and services around the world based on a pre-assigned order of priority for major plants and offices.
Disaster Countermeasures for Information Systems
As a countermeasure against the possibility of earthquake damage to our information systems, we have established redundancy between our internal data center and a rein- forced external data center that is located in a quake-ab- sorbing structure and is equipped with an internal power generator. We have finished migrating core workflow servers and other important servers to external data centers to establish an environment that is capable of continuous operation. We also have migrated our email systems to external services.

(to the present)
Casio Computer Co., Ltd. Outside Director (to the present)
 My background is in operations and management at a commodities manufacturer. I also have served as an outside director at multiple global Japanese companies.
Amid the diversification of consumer values, businesses today must carefully ascertain market changes and respond based on a medium- and long-term global perspective.
I will use my cumulative experience to contribute towards improving Casio’s corporate value and strengthening corporate governance.
Casio is embarking on a new start towards achieving true growth.
I expect Casio management to think beyond existing concepts and strive for innovation as it strives to adapt to changes in the business environment.
I also expect each member of the Board of Directors to apply their individual expertise towards active deliberations to further stimulate Board of Directors’ meetings.
Further improving corporate value will require that Casio improve both its economic value and social value.
To strengthen governance, we must establish organizational management as a unified global company to increase transparency and monitor business execution. I will embrace this goal as I strive to fulfill my duties as an outside director.

 Outside Director
Michiko Chiba
Born June 27, 1961
I believe a critical role of an outside director is to offer an outside perspective on deliberations by the Board of Directors, which exists within a corporate culture cultivated over a long period of time. I will apply my experience at an audit firm as an auditor responsible for accounting audits and monitoring corporate operations. I hope to appropriately engage in matters that can be difficult to judge and evaluate based solely on an internal perspective.
Casio recently shifted to an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure. The number of companies adopting an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure now represents nearly 30% of all listed companies. Amid growing expectations for improved third-party management supervision, this change demonstrates Casio’s commitment to governance. I look forward to the Board of Directors further engaging in deliberations related to the company’s medium and long- term business strategy and supervisory functions. To ensure the success of Casio’s medium-term management plan, I will support the creation of a culture that encourages a challenging spirit and a framework for implementing the plan, as well as engage in monitoring the implementation of the plan.
In my interactions with company employees, I am always impressed by their passionate explanations of company technology and products. I truly sense their pride as a Casio employee and their commitment to the Casio spirit. Casio’s unique innovation and advanced technology has created numerous products and services. For Casio to sustain this ability to create value, the company must be evaluated for its agility in responding to and ethical position on social issues.
I believe the role of an outside director is to apply an objective perspective towards checking corporate governance and voicing impartial opinions. As a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, I will respect executive management policies while focusing on corporate audits and supervision. I will apply my many years of experience related to legal affairs, compliance, and governance support to contribute to strengthening the management platform. Furthermore, I want to apply my nearly 20 years of experience working overseas to contribute to the further development of Casio global operations.
The transition to an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure further strengthens Casio corporate governance. From June, the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee were established as an advisory body supervised by the outside directors to create an operating structure with an even higher degree of transparency. I will work to maintain and support corporate governance that enables balanced decision-making and supervisory functions.
Casio has applied proprietary digital technology to create new culture. Casio is a company with employees who embrace the founding spirit of the Four Kashio Brothers, men who passionately faced problems head-on. Moving forward, I expect Casio will take a leading role in technological innovation in the fields of healthcare and education.

Financial Review
Operating Results
The current year under review saw an acceleration of the economic downturn in China due to concerns about US-China trade friction and Europe, which is highly dependent on China, trended towards economic slowdown. Certain emerging economies were impacted by currency depreciation and geopolitical instability and Japan showed signs of economic downturn in manufacturing sectors. Overall, the global environment transitioned with a lack of transparency about the future economy. Amid such a lack of transparency and a global environment subject to dramatic changes in business markets, we have implemented companywide structural reforms to ensure our ability to respond rapidly to change.
In highly profitable businesses such as the Timepiece Business and Scientific Calculators, we have aimed for sustainable business growth based on our existing proven business model. For businesses facing issues such as Musical Instruments and Projectors Businesses, we engaged in structural reforms to stabilize business while also aggressively promoting the creation of new genres and businesses that will serve as revenue pillars and contribute to profits.
Although net sales decreased owing to the impact of the withdrawal from the Compact Camera Business last fiscal year and external factors such as economic slowdown in China and Europe, and currency depreciation in emerging markets, we implemented structural reforms to improve our revenue structure.
Net Sales
Net sales for FYE 3/2019 were 298.1 billion yen (down 5.3% YoY).
Consumer Segment
Segment net sales were 257.3 billion yen (down 4.3% YoY) due to the withdrawal from the Compact Camera Business.
Net sales for the Timepieces Business were favorable thanks mainly to sales of the GMW-B5000, the first full metal model for the original 5000 series G-SHOCK. Sales also benefitted from G-SHOCK events held in Japan and China.
System Equipment Segment
System Equipment segment sales were 33.8 billion yen, down 11.7% year on year on poor sales of projectors in North America due to increasing competition and reduced revenues due to the impact of the postponement of special orders for mandated electronic cash registers in France. Others Segment
Segment net sales were 6.9 billion yen (down 7.9% YoY). This segment includes formed parts, molds, and other Group company proprietary businesses.
Operating Profit
Operating profit was 30.2 billion yen (up 2.3% YoY), and the operating margin increased by 0.7 points year on year to 10.1%.
Consumer Segment
The segment operating profit increased to 38.2 billion yen, up 9.1% year on year. The Timepiece Business was profitable on favorable sales of highly profitable products and the Calculators Business secured profitability thanks to a stable student market for scientific calculators.
System Equipment Segment
The segment recorded operating loss of 0.9 billion yen due to poor projector sales.
Others Segment
The segment operating profit was 0.3 billion yen, down 41.1%.
Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent
Profit before income taxes was 29.3 billion yen (up 19.3% YoY). Profit attributable to owners of parent was 22.1 billion yen (up 13.1% YoY), and basic earnings per share was 89.86 yen (up 10.44 yen YoY).

Financial Position
Assets
Total assets at the end of FYE 3/2019 decreased by 6.6 billion yen to 357.5 billion yen year on year. Current assets increased by 1.1 billion yen to 238.6 billion yen on increased inventory assets, etc. Non-current assets decreased by 7.7 billion yen year on year to 118.9 billion yen on decreased marketable securities.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities decreased by 13.8 billion yen year on year to 20.7 billion yen. Major factors included profit before income taxes of 29.3 billion yen (previous FY was 24.6 billion yen), depreciation of 9.6 billion yen (previous FY was 9.3 billion yen), gain on sales of investment securities of 4.8 billion yen (previous FY was 0.5 billion yen), increase in operating capital (notes and accounts receivable-trade, inventory, notes and accounts payable-trade) of 6.8 billion yen (previous FY decrease was 5.2 billion yen), and 5.4 billion yen in income taxes paid (previous FY was 3.5 billion yen). Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities resulted in expenditures of 6.2 billion yen, down by 2.0 billion yen year on year. Major factors included expenditures of 12.7 billion yen for the purchase of property, plant and equipment (previous FY was 10.4 billion yen) and net proceeds of 6.5 billion yen from the proceeds from sales and redemption of investment securities (previous FY net proceeds were 1.5 billion yen).
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities resulted in expenditures of 16.9 billion yen, a 6.3 billion yen increase in expenditures compared to the previous fiscal year. Major factors included net expenditures of 3.9 billion yen due to the execution and repayment of short and long-term loans (previous FY was net income of 50 million yen) and cash dividends paid of 12.3 billion yen (previous FY was 9.8 billion yen).
Capital Funding and Capital Liquidity
Our Group’s most significant capital demands are related to manufacturing expenses, including materials procurement for product manufacturing, operating capital related to SG&A and other operating expenses, and capital for capital expenditures. Furthermore, significant operating expenses include personnel expenses, R&D expenses, advertising and marketing expenses, and sales promotion expenses.
To strengthen our financial structure, our Group is working to reduce interest-bearing debt. This fiscal year, we conducted capital procurement of 12.4 billion yen while also repaying 16.5 billion yen. As a result, the interest-bearing debt balance as of the end of FYE 3/2019 decreased 3.9 billion yen year on year to 69.2 billion yen. Furthermore, our Group concluded agreements with our main financial institutions for specified lines of credit. As of the end of FYE 3/2019, the unused balance for these agreements is 56.8 billion yen.
    Segment-specific assets are as follows:

      Total liabilities at the end of FYE 3/2019 decreased by 11.5 billion yen year on year to 145.9 billion yen. Current liabilities decreased 10.9 billion yen year on year to 82.7 billion yen on reductions in the current portion of long-term loans payable and converting bonds with share acquisition rights to bonds with share acquisition rights redeemable within one year. Non-current liabilities decreased by 0.6 billion yen to 63.1 billion yen year on year on the conversation of bonds with share acquisition rights to bonds with share acquisition rights redeemable within one year and increased long-term loans payable.
Net Assets
Total net assets at the end of FYE 3/2019 increased by 4.9 billion yen year on year to 211.5 billion yen due to increased retained earnings.
Our Group engages in growth sector investments while securing our financial position to achieve medium- to long-term growth and sustainable ROE improvement. We will continue improving our corporate value by conducting business activities with due consideration to the cost of capital, and by working to optimize capital efficiency and generate free cash flow. As a result, ROE was 10.6%, up by 0.9 points year on year.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents at end of FYE 3/2019 were 132.2 billion yen, down 2.3 billion yen year on year. This represents sufficient capital liquidity. Free cash flows decreased by 11.7 billion yen year on year to 14.5 billion yen.

Research & Development
The Casio Group (Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and consolidated subsidiaries) embraces the corporate philosophy of Creativity for Contribution. We engage aggressively in R&D activities with the goal of contributing to society through the development of creative products.
During FYE 3/2019, we established the Business Strategy Headquarters to consolidate product planning and marketing functions. To achieve the strategy established by the Business Strategy Headquarters, we also established the Product Development Headquarters to promote efficient manufacturing. Furthermore, we established the Business & Technology Development Center to promote and advance new business development. Under this structure for promoting groupwide technology fusion that transcends individual business sectors, we will expand existing business and establish new businesses.
Our R&D structure is comprised of our Business & Technology Development Center, which is responsible for fundamental research and elemental technology development that are used to support new businesses and long-term growth, and the Product Development Headquarters, which oversee commercial development related to existing businesses.
A breakdown of R&D expenses for FYE 3/2019 is as follows:
Business Risks
Of matters related to the status of operations and accounting indicated on the marketable securities report, matters with the potential to have a serious impact on investor decisions include the following.
Furthermore, forward-looking matters indicated in this document are judgments made by this Group as of the end of FYE 3/2019.
(1) Status of Japanese and global economies
Casio Group products are sold in Japan and countries around the world, and product demand is influenced by the economic conditions of each country. As the majority of Casio Group products are geared towards consumer markets, the personal spending trends of each country have a significant impact on Group business.
(2) Price fluctuations
Industries associated with the Casio Group continue to see severe competition for domestic and foreign market share among numerous companies. There is a possibility that dramatic price fluctuations in a short period of time could have a negative impact on Group performance.
(3) New products
In a situation where the Casio Group is unable to sell new popular products quickly and with regularity, or in a case where a competitor launches a product similar to a Casio Group new product based on similar timing to a Casio Group product launch, there is a possibility that the Casio Group may see a decline in the market superiority that comes with being a market pioneer or an industry-leading organization.
(4) Transactions with major clients
A change in the strategies or product specifications of a major Casio Group client, order cancellations, or schedule changes could have a negative impact on Group performance.
(5) Outsourcing
To improve production efficiency and profit margin, the Casio Group outsources certain manufacturing and assembly processes to external suppliers. As such, there is the possibility that thorough quality management may become difficult. Furthermore, problems such as violations of relevant laws or third-party intellectual property rights infringement by said suppliers could have a negative impact on Group consolidated performance and the reputation of our products.

     52 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

(6) Technology development and changes in technology
Rapid or dramatic changes in the technology or market needs of the business fields in which we operate could lead to Casio Group product obsolescence that is faster than expected and cause a dramatic decline in sales.
(7) Risks related to international activities and overseas market engagement
The majority of Casio Group production and product sales takes place outside of Japan. As such, the financial position, earnings, and future outlook for the Casio Group are, to a significant degree, impacted by overseas political, economic, and legal environments. In particular, it is difficult to project unexpected regulatory changes or application of laws, and thus there is a possibility of a negative impact on Group performance.
(8) Intellectual property
In general, the Casio Group uses proprietary technology developed in-house, and we protect our technology through a combination of patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. However, our Group does face the following types of risks.
• Proprietary development of similar technology by
competitors
• Rejection of a pending patent application filed by the Casio
Group
• Measures taken to prevent the misuse/infringement of Casio
Group intellectual property are not sufficiently effective
• Laws and regulations related to intellectual property are
insufficient for protecting Casio Group intellectual property
• A future Casio Group product or technology is deemed to be
an infringement of a third party’s intellectual property
(9) Product defects/litigation problems
As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, the Casio Group conducts strict product quality management. At no point since our founding has the Casio Group been subject to a serious claim or bad reputation. However, this is no guarantee that Casio Group products will not be the subject of a product liability or safety-related claim at some point in the future.
(10) Information management risks
The Casio Group retains vast amounts of personal information and confidential information related to our business activities and development. We reinforce enhanced information management by outlining internal
regulations and through employee education but this is no guarantee against an information leak. A leak of such information could have a negative impact on Casio Group business, financial position, and performance.
(11) Partnerships, joint ventures, strategic investments
The Casio Group engages in partnerships, joint ventures, and strategic investments in Japan and various countries around the world for the purpose of promoting and developing business and to increase operational efficiency. There is the possibility that changes in the operating conditions, management policies, or business environment of a transaction partner could have a negative impact on Casio Group business, financial position, and performance.
(12) Foreign currency risks and interest risks
The Casio Group conducts business all over the world and, as such, we are subject to the influences of currency rate fluctuations. Casio Group income could be negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates between the Japanese yen and other currencies. The Casio Group is also subject to interest fluctuation risks. These risks have the potential to impact overall operating expenses, procurement costs, and financial assets and liabilities (particularly long-term loans).
(13) Other risks
In addition to the above, the following factors could possibly have a future impact on Group business and performance. • Cyclicality of the IT industry
• The ability to procure instruments, raw materials,
equipment, electricity, etc., when necessary at adequate
costs
• Decline in value of marketable securities retained by the
Casio Group
• Revisions to laws or systems, or a dramatic change in
operating environment relevant to defined benefit
accounting
• Fire, earthquake, or other natural disaster, operational
accident, etc.
• Social unrest due to war, terrorism, infectious disease, etc.

Financial Section
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries
1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of CASIO COMPUTER CO., LTD. (“the Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements from Interna- tional Financial Reporting Standards.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English (with certain expanded disclosure) from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2019, which was ¥111 to U.S.$1. The convenience translation should not be construed as a representation that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and significant subsidiaries (together with the Company, “the Group”) which the Company controls through majority voting rights or existence of certain conditions. Shares of associates of which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method.
In the elimination of investments in subsidiaries, the portion of assets and liabilities of a subsidiary attributable to the subsidiary’s shares acquired by the Company are recorded based on the fair value as of the respective dates when such shares are acquired. The amounts of assets and liabilities attributable to non–controlling interests of the subsidiary are determined using the financial statements of the subsidiary.
Material intercompany balances, transactions and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.
The difference between the cost and underlying fair value of the net assets of investments in subsidiaries at acquisition is included in other assets and is amortized on a straight–line basis over five years.
Cash flow statements
In preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash on hand, readily available deposits and short–term highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign currency translation
All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and the translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income (loss).
Assets and liabilities of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are translated into yen at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date while their revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Differences arising from such translation are included in net assets as foreign currency translation adjustment.
Securities and investment securities
Debt securities designated as held–to–maturity are carried at amortized cost using the straight–line method. Available–for– sale securities for which fair value is readily determinable, are stated at fair value as of the end of the period with unrealized
  60 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

gains and losses, net of applicable deferred tax assets or liabilities, not reflected in earnings but directly reported as a sepa- rate component under net assets. The cost of such securities sold is determined primarily by the moving–average method. Available–for–sale securities for which fair value is not readily determinable are stated primarily at moving–average cost.
Derivatives and hedge accounting
The accounting standards for financial instruments require companies to state derivative financial instruments at fair value and to recognize changes in the fair value as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Group defers recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments until the related losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized.
Also, if interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swaps is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps as derivative financial instruments primarily for the purpose of mitigating future risks of fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates with respect to foreign currency assets and liabilities and of interest rate changes with respect to cash management.
Forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps are subject to risks of foreign currency exchange rate changes and interest rate changes, respectively.
The derivative transactions are executed and managed by the Company’s Finance Department in accordance with the established policies and within the specified limits on the amounts of derivative transactions allowed.
Allowance for doubtful accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided at an amount sufficient to cover probable losses on the collection of receivables.
The amount of the allowance is determined by an estimated amount of probable bad debt that is based on past write–off experience and a review of the collectability of individual receivables.
Inventories
Inventories are stated primarily at the lower of cost (first–in, first–out) or net realizable values at year–end.
Property, plant and equipment, except leased assets
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. For the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan, depreciation is principally determined by the declining–balance method at rates based on estimated useful lives except for the following items. Buildings, excluding facilities attached to buildings, acquired on or after April 1, 1998, the building and structures of the head office of the Company, and facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016, are depreciated using the straight–line method. For overseas subsidiaries, depreciation is principally determined by the straight– line method. The depreciation period ranges from 2 years to 50 years for buildings and structures, from 2 years to 17 years for machinery, equipment and vehicles, and from 1 year to 20 years for tools, furniture and fixtures.
Software, except leased assets
Software is categorized by the following purposes and amortized using the following two methods.
Software for market sales: The production costs for the master product are capitalized and amortized over no more than 3
years on a projected revenue basis.
Software for internal use: The acquisition costs of software for internal use are amortized over 5 years using the straight–
line method.
CASIO Integrated Report 2019 61

The amount of software costs capitalized is included in Other under Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Leased assets
(Finance leases which do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee)
Leased assets are divided into the two principal categories of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets included
in Other under Investments and other assets. The former consists primarily of facilities (machinery and equipment, tools, furniture and fixtures) while the latter consists of software. The assets are depreciated on a straight–line basis on the assumption that the lease term is the useful life and the residual value is zero.
Retirement benefits
Under the terms of the employees’ severance and retirement plan, eligible employees are entitled under most circumstances, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to severance payments based on compensation at the time of severance and years of service.
For employees’ severance and retirement benefits, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan provide a defined benefit plan and have established and are participating in the Casio corporate pension fund, which is a system with multiple business proprietors.
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan received permission from the Minister of Health, Labour and Wel- fare, for release from the obligation of paying benefits for employees’ prior services relating to the substitutional portion of the Welfare Pension Insurance Scheme. Afterwards, the welfare pension insurance plan was changed to the defined benefit plan.
The Company and a part of its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan also provide a defined contribution plan. On April 1, 2012, the Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries transferred part of the defined benefit plan to the defined contribution plan. In addition, the Company has established an employee retirement benefit trust.
The liabilities and expenses for retirement benefits are determined based on the amounts actuarially calculated using certain assumptions. The liability and expenses for the retirement benefit plan subject to some of the consolidated subsidiar- ies are calculated by a simplified method.
Income taxes
Taxes on income consist of corporation, inhabitants’ and enterprise taxes.
The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries in Japan apply the consolidated tax payment system.
The Group recognizes tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and
amounts for tax purposes. The provision for income taxes is computed based on the profit before income taxes included in the statements of income of each company of the Group. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences.
Appropriations of retained earnings
Appropriations of retained earnings are accounted for and reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements when approved by the shareholders.
Amounts per share of common shares
Earnings per share of common shares is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each fiscal year (less the treasury shares).
Cash dividends per share represent the actual amount applicable to the respective years.

(Changes in presentation method)
(Changes due to adoption of “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting”)
Upon application of “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Statement No. 28, February 16, 2018 (hereinafter, “Statement No. 28”)) from the beginning of the current fiscal year, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries changed the presentation and related notes of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, such that deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as part of ‘investments and other assets’ and ‘non-current liabilities’, respectively.
CASIO Integrated Report 2019 63

As a result, ¥6,293 million ($56,694 thousand) of deferred tax assets classified as “current assets” and ¥195 million ($1,757 thousand) of deferred tax liabilities classified as “non-current liabilities” have been included in deferred tax assets (¥8,914 million ($80,306 thousand)) in “investments and other assets”, and deferred tax liabilities classified as non-current liabilities have been restated to ¥1,349 million ($12,153 thousand) in the balance sheet as of the end of the previous fiscal year.
The notes related to tax effect accounting additionally included those described in notes 8 (excluding total amount of valuation reserves) and 9 of “Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting”, which are required in paragraphs 3 to 5 of Statement No.28. However, this additional information corresponding to the previous fiscal year is not disclosed, in accor- dance with the transitional treatments prescribed in paragraph 7 of Statement No. 28.

         The Group invests surplus funds in highly secure financial assets, and funds required for working capital and capital invest- ments are raised through the issuance of bonds or loans from financial institutions such as banks. Derivatives are used to avoid the risks described hereinafter and no speculative transactions are entered into.
64 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

2) Details of financial instruments used and risks involved, and how they are managed
Notes and accounts receivable–trade are exposed to customers’ credit risk. To minimize that risk, the Group periodically monitors the due date and the balance of the accounts.
Securities and investment securities are primarily highly secure and highly rated debt securities and shares of companies with which the Group has business relations, and are exposed to market price fluctuation risk. The Group periodically moni- tors the market price and reviews the status of these holdings.
Operating payables comprising notes and accounts payable–trade, accounts payable–other and income taxes payable have a due date of within one year.
Operating payables, loans payable, and bonds with share acquisition rights are subject to liquidity risk (the risk of an inability to pay by the due date). However, the Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining short–term liquidity in excess of a certain level of consolidated sales or by other means.
The Group uses derivative transactions of forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency fluctuation risks arising from debts and credits denominated in foreign currencies, as well as interest rate swap contracts to fix the cash flows associ- ated with loans payable. The Group utilizes and manages derivative transactions following the internal regulations for them, which stipulate policy, objective, scope, organization, procedures and financial institutions to deal with, and has an implemen- tation and reporting system for derivative transactions reflecting proper internal control functions.
3) Supplemental information on fair values
The fair value of financial instruments is calculated based on quoted market price or, in the case where there is no market price, by making a reasonable estimation. Because the preconditions applied include a floating element, estimation of fair value may vary. The contract amounts, as presented in Note 7 “Derivative Transactions,” do not reflect market risk.
(2) Fair values of financial instruments
The following table summarizes book value and fair value of the financial instruments, and the difference between them as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Items for which fair value is difficult to estimate are not included in the following table (see Note 2 on P.47).

66 CASIO Integrated Report 2019

(Note) 1: Method for calculating the fair value of financial instruments and matters related to securities and investment securities and derivative transactions
Assets
[1] Cash and deposits, [2] Notes and accounts receivable-trade
Since these items are short-term and the fair value approximates the book value, the book value is used as fair value.
[3] Securities and investment securities
The fair value of equity securities is the market price, while the fair value of debt securities is the market price or the price quoted by the correspondent financial institution. Since certificates of deposit are short-term, and the fair value approximates the book value, the book value is used as fair value.
See Note 6 “Securities and Investment Securities” for information on securities categorized by holding purpose.
Liabilities
[1] Notes and accounts payable-trade, [2] Accounts payable-other, [3] Income taxes payable
Since these items are short-term, and the fair value approximates the book value, the book value is used as fair value.
[4] Bonds with share acquisition rights
The fair value of bonds with share acquisition rights is the price quoted by the correspondent financial institution. Bonds with share acquisition rights include current portion of bonds with share acquisition rights.
[5] Long-term loans payable
The fair value of long-term loans payable with fixed interest rates is the sum of the principal and total interest discounted by the rate that is applied if a new loan is made.
Since long-term loans payable with floating interest rates reflect market interest rates over the short term, and the fair value approximates the book value, the book value is used as fair value. However, those that are subject to special treatment interest rate swaps are measured by taking the sum of the principal and total interest associated with the interest rate swaps and discounting it by the rate that is reasonably estimated and applied if a new loan is made (see Note 7 “Derivative Transactions”).
Long-term loans payable include current portion of long-term loans payable.
Derivative transactions
See Note 7 “Derivative Transactions.”

11. Net Assets
Under the Japanese Corporation Law (“the Law”) and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as capital stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the board of directors, designate an amount not exceeding one-half of the price of the new shares as legal capital surplus, which is included in capital surplus.
In cases where dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of capital stock over the total of legal capital surplus and legal retained earnings must be set aside as legal capital surplus or legal retained earnings. Legal retained earnings are included in retained earnings in the accompany- ing consolidated balance sheets.
Legal capital surplus and legal retained earnings may not be distributed as dividends. However, all legal capital surplus and all legal retained earnings may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends.
The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the nonconsolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Law.
12. Lease Transactions
(1) Finance lease transactions which do not transfer the ownership of the leased property to the lessee, and that were concluded prior to the year that began on April 1, 2008 for which the new accounting standards were applied

            (Notes) 1. In calculating assumed depreciation cost, the leased assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis on the assumption that the lease term is the useful life and residual value is zero.
2. In calculating the assumed interest cost, the difference between the total lease amount and the assumed acquisition cost is taken as the assumed interest cost. The method of distribution over each period depends on the interest method.

13. Segment Information
(1) Overview of reportable segments
     The Group’s reportable segments consist of the Group’s constituent units for which separate financial information is available and which are subject to periodic examination in order for the board of directors to determine the allocation of management resources and evaluate financial results.
The Group has designated three areas of segment reporting, which are the “Consumer,” “System Equipment,” and “Others” segments, based on the type of products and services, and the market and consumer categories.
The categories of the main products and services belonging to each reportable segment are as follows:
Consumer ................................Watches, Clocks, Electronic dictionaries, Electronic calculators, Label printers, Electronic musical instruments, Digital cameras, etc.
System Equipment ..................Handheld terminals, Electronic cash registers, Management support systems, Data projectors, etc.
Others ......................................Formed parts, Molds, etc.
(2) Basis of measurement for net sales, income or loss, assets and others for each reportable segment
The accounting method for the reportable segments is largely in line with the descriptions in Notes 1-2 on p.40-44 Interseg- ment profits are based on the market price.

2) Outline of Reduction
i) Amount reduced
The capital reserve of ¥64,565,597,149 ($581,672 thousand) was reduced by ¥50,000,000,000 ($450,450 thousand), leav- ing ¥14,565,597,149 ($131,222 thousand).

1) Purpose of Treasury Acquisition
To enhance shareholder returns and capital efficiency.

iii) Total value of acquisition: Up to ¥5,000 million ($45,045 thousand)

1) Purpose of Introducing the Plan
One aim is to motivate eligible directors (outside directors and directors who serve on the Audit & Supervisory Board are not eligible) to run the Company with a view to improving earnings and corporate value sustainably. Another aim is to more closely align the interests of eligible directors with those of shareholders.
2) Outline of the Restricted Stock Awards
The eligible directors will make an in-kind contribution of the entirety of the monetary receivables the Company pays them under the plan. The Company will then issue shares of common stock to the eligible directors, either by issuing new shares or by disposing of treasury shares.
CASIO Integrated Report 2019 85

i) Cap on total monetary receivables paid under the plan, cap shares to be issued
The total monetary receivables to be paid to eligible directors under the plan is capped at ¥100 million ($901 thousand) per year (this does not include the portion paid for services as an employee). The total shares of common stock that the Company may issue (either by issuing new shares or by disposing of treasury shares) is capped at 80,000 per year. The Company may reasonably adjust the total amount of common shares that it newly issues or disposes from treasury shares for the purpose of restricted stock awards if, after the date the shareholders approve the plan, it undertakes a stock split (or allocation of shares without contribution) or reverse stock split, or if there is some other compelling reason.
ii) Timing of payout, allotment
The Board of Directors will decide when the Company will issue the shares to the eligible directors. The board will also decide how much eligible directors contribute per restricted share. This amount will be at a level that gives no particu- lar advantage to the eligible directors. It will be based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the business day preceding the day on which the board resolves for the Company to issue new shares or dispose of treasury shares (or, if there is no trading on that day, the day preceding that).
iii) Other
Before issuing new shares or disposing of treasury shares under the plan, the Company will sign an agreement with each eligible director providing for the allotment of the restricted shares as follows:
-The eligible director must not transfer, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the allotted shares for a fixed period. -Under certain circumstances, the Company may acquire the shares from the eligible director for no consideration. The Company will keep the shares in a trust for the transfer-restriction period to ensure that the eligible directors
do not transfer, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of the shares during that time. The trust will be managed by SMBC Nikko Securities.
3) How the Plan Applies to Executive officers
The plan equally applies to executive officers who do not serve on the Board of Directors.

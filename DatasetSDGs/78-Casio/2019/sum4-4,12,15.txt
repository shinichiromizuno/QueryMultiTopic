Implement Structural Reforms
Language Education devices, musical instruments, projectors, and systems equipment have had business structure issues that have made it difficult to generate profits based on current sales volume. As such, in addition to implementing an early retirement scheme, we also optimized sales expenses by reviewing sales structures and reducing expenses companywide by assessing cost performance. Through structural reforms to development, production, sales, and head office functions under the concept of One CASIO, we will disengage from an unprofitable structure to establish a stable profit platform.

Apply Business Strengths to Restore Businesses to Growth Trajectories
We will apply the strengths of each business to create new genres and new products to establish and expand markets and restore businesses to trajectories for growth. In the Language Education Business, we will take advantage of Casio proprietary technology, brand recognition, and business models. For the Musical Instruments Business, we will focus on obvious markets. In the Projector and Systems Equipment Businesses, we will maximize potential by expanding sales in untapped areas.
Examples of Initiatives for
the Electronic Musical Instruments Business
The Musical Instruments Business was the first business unit to engage in such initiatives. The markets for musical instruments are stable and this business unit has secured sales by maintaining a certain share of the markets for digital pianos and electronic keyboards. However, problems related to product manufacturing methods and sales methods have resulted in losses. We have implemented various initiatives to address this situation, including revamping the previous business model that involved offering 60 different keyboard models. We reduced our product line for keyboards in half, reinforced centralized procurement for raw materials, strengthened our internal production structure, and developed channels through specialty shops. Through these initiatives, we have created a structure that can secure stable profits from the fiscal year ending March 2020 onward.
Major Reform InitiativesProduction optimization
• Optimized keyboard product line Reduced models from 60 to 30 models
• Developed new sound sources (featuring Aix sound source)
• Strengthened internal production structure (transferred from EMS)
• Reduced costs by optimizing supply chain
• Promoted automation
Optimization of Distribution
• Restructured distribution (selection of retail stores)
• Dependency on mass retail > Developing specialty shop channels

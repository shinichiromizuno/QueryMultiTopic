Epson’s force sensors endow robots with the ability to“feel”extremely subtle forces. This ability allows them to assemble fit parts, plug in flexible flat cables (FFC), insert capacitors, and perform other tasks that demand high accuracy and have traditionally relied on human sensory perception.
  By providing solutions that make automation easy, we are helping manufacturers use robots to perform tasks that used to be done by humans. Looking ahead, we will contribute to the development of different industries by increasing the value of automation and manufacturing efficiency.

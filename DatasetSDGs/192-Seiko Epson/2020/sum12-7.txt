We have increased the power efficiency, accuracy, and precision of our real-time clock (RTC) modules by combining the quartz and power-saving semiconductor technologies Epson began developing for watches. By providing products that consume even less current for IoT terminals and other systems that need to be small and energy efficient, we will help customers create eco-conscious finished products that operate for longer on smaller batteries.

Supply Chain
    Procurement Guidelines/Epson Supplier Code of Conduct
In addition to the basic transaction concerns of quality, cost, and delivery, CSR at Epson addresses those things that the international community looks for, such as international trade control and ensuring security in the supply chain. Epson also established CSR requirements for such areas as labor, health and safety, environment, and ethics based on the RBA Code of Conduct. Both Epson and its suppliers carry out our businesses while meeting the requirements.

Epson seeks to build trusting relationships with our business partners around the world based on fairness, coexistence, transparency, and mutual prosperity. Epson furthermore joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a global coalition dedicated to CSR in global supply chains, as a regular member in April 2019. To fulfill our social responsibility, we hold our suppliers to the same high standards of ethical conduct we uphold and make the following six action items our top priority. COVID-19 has exposed shortcomings in the effectiveness of business continuity plans in our supply chain. We will address these issues with medium- to long-term corrective actions.

Epson procures 39% of its goods and services from Japanese suppliers, and 61% from overseas suppliers, in monetary terms. Direct materials (e.g., raw materials, parts, and processing services) account for 63% of the goods and services we procure. The remaining 37% are indirect materials (e.g., consumables for production sites, machinery, advertising, logistics, outsourcing, and staffing services).

Monitoring Suppliers’ Performance
We monitor the performance of our suppliers in two ways. First, we analyze data provided by credit reference agencies. Second, we ask suppliers to complete four kinds of self-assessment surveys: (1) a periodic survey that evaluates quality, cost, delivery, environment, and management; (2) a CSR survey that evaluates the supplier’s compliance with the Epson Supplier Code of Conduct (the RBA Code of Conduct); (3) a survey that evaluates the supplier’s capacity to deal with emergencies; (4) a survey that evaluates the supplier’s risk management efforts.
Responsible Mineral Sourcing
We recognize the risks associated with cobalt and the 3TGs (the minerals for tin, tantalum, tungsten, as well as gold ore) mined in conflict-affected or high-risk areas such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. Revenue from these minerals often ends up financing armed rebel groups or other militants. For this reason, sourcing such minerals would potentially encourage conflict, human rights abuses, and environmental destruction. Such actions are unacceptable and run counter to our core values. As a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we ask our suppliers to ensure conflict-free sourcing and to cooperate in surveys.

If an incident disrupts business operations at any of our production sites, we will first act to safeguard the workers. We will then work to preserve business continuity to avoid inconveniencing our customers. To improve resilience to such incidents across the supply chain, we have created Supply Chain BCM Guidelines. The guidelines provide measures for improving resilience in terms of suppliers, procurement, production, logistics, and sales.

Supply Chain Continuity
 To monitor supplier resilience, we conduct two self-assessment surveys. The first survey evaluates the supplier’s ability to maintain or resume supply following an incident. The second evaluates its efforts in managing safety (e.g., electrical safety, handling of hazardous materials). We will then provide feedback and help the supplier address any issues.

Classrooms are one place where we can demonstrate the value of large projected images that are clearly visible even to students in the back. We are thus focusing our efforts on providing products and services for education. In 2006, we developed the worldâ€™s first*2 dust-proof projectors, for use in dusty and sandy regions. Epson is using ICT to enhance learning and improve the quality of education, and in so doing has earned a strong reputation in the education field by providing affordable projectors and models equipped with electronic blackboard functions.

Production is changing. There are labor and skilled worker shortages, a diversifi- cation of needs, and heightened environ- mental awareness. We are transforming the production floor by raising productiv- ity and lowering environmental impacts.

POINT
1 Provide compact robots that can
There is a serious manufacturing labor
shortage largely due to rising income levels in
emerging economies and aging populations
in advanced economies. Production is 2 increasingly being automated with robots, but
Provide force sensors that give robots human-like touchspace can be an issue, as can the difficulty of automating some processes, so most manufacturers still must rely on human intervention. Automation is also impeded by a scarcity of skilled installers.
Value Proposition
Offer easy installation in existing production lines

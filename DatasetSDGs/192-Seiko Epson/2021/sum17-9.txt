Epsonâ€™s inkjet printers, which do not use heat to eject ink, are often used in hospitals and schools in developing countries where power is unreliable, because this heat-free technology consumes very little electricity and enables the printers to run even on an emergency power supply. They are also often used by those learning from home for printing homework and teaching materials for deeper, paper-based learning. High-capacity ink tanks also use significantly fewer resources than ink cartridges.

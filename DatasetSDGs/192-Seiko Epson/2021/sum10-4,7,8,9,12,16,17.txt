 Visual innovations that deliver amazing visual experiences and easy, satisfying visual communication play an important role in enriching lives.
COVID-19 has upended the world, forcing us to limit large gatherings and to decentralize where we learn, work, and even live. The pandemic has also accelerated the digitalization of countless aspects of society, giving people the opportunity to free themselves from the shackles of place and time.
Epson wants to help realize new work arrangements and lifestyles that connect people by delivering immersive visual experiences and stress-free visual communication even in remote environments. And when people are able once again to gather in crowds, we want to maximize the value of time and place with powerful, high-quality, big-screen visual experiences.
● Education
Building an equal, high-quality learning environment
● Office & business
Supporting higher productivity and creativity
● Home
Supporting lifestyle and work arrangement diversification
● Lighting, signage, art
Delivering amazing experiences with digital art and captivating lighting and video displays
We want to connect people, things, information, and services by advancing projector connectedness and smart features, expanding our business footprint and opportunities for users to co-create value. I believe that Epson can contribute particularly to the field of education, and we will promote the development and expansion of educational infrastructure in developing countries through partnerships in order to realize the Sustainable Development Goal of leaving no child behind.
On the other hand, the projector market environment is still extremely challenging, and the outlook is uncertain. We will restructure the business to maximize development and production efficiency and will achieve our vision by providing products that help to solve customer and societal issues.

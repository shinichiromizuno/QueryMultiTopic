The future of mobility is being shaped by CASE innovations in networking (Connected), autonomous driving (Autonomous), flexible use (Shared & Services), and electric drive systems (Electric). It is hoped that by increasing the automation and efficiency of all manner of vehicles, from passenger cars, buses and trucks to farm tractors and factory conveyors, environmental issues (climate change) can be solved via greater energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions.
Epson will contribute by providing the timing devices and sensors that are essential for accurate positioning and orientation, high-speed, high-capacity communications, and safe, efficient battery management.

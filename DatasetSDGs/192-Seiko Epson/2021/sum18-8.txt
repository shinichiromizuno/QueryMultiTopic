Automating production requires more than just installing robots. Production processes must also be designed and built by people who have manufacturing experience and expertise. Epson utilizes the automation expertise it has acquired in its own precision assembly processes to support customers building production systems. One example of this is the automation of a flow rate calibration process and valve adjustments in the manufacture of semiconductor fabrication equipment.
The customer wanted to automate the process in preparation for robust demand for semiconductor equipment, but it involved connecting pliable tubes, a task that is easy for humans but hard for robots. Epson listened to what was happening on the manufacturing floor and what they needed, demonstrated that the problem could be solved by combining a force sensor and a six-axis robot, and proposed a system element for them. Epson will help advance industry by analyzing customersâ€™needs and expectations and contributing to the construction of systems that increase productivity and reduce the burden on workers.

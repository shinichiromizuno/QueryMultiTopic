Much of Japanâ€™s civil infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and tunnels, was built during the post-war economic boom that began in the mid-1950s. This infrastructure is reaching functional obsolescence.
Inspecting and maintaining nation-wide infrastructure is a huge and often dangerous job. The infrastructure on which we depend must be preserved by managing it efficiently, effectively, and, most of all, safely.

High-precision sensors detect abnormal vibration in real-time, discover problems, and monitor aging. POINT Compact, low-power sensors that can be installed almost anywhere enable efficient inspection.

Ensure the safety of transportation infrastructure and contribute to personal safety and reassurance.
Enable maintenance in more places with effective, efficient maintenance inspections.
Avoid dangerous work and realize a safe working environment.

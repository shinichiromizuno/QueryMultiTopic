To demonstrate how our sensing technology can improve skills and promote health, we piloted it among young footballers affiliated with Matsumoto Yamaga FC, a Japanese football club in the J2 League. Whenever the kids kicked the ball, gyro sensors worn on their legs would detect the path, speed, and impact of the kick. From this data, our algorithm derives insights about kicking, including foot placement and angle. The coach uses this information to give clear guidance for improving kicking skills. Aside from sport, the algorithm uses a separate analytical method that monitors whether the user is walking correctly and thereby enhances the personâ€™s health and wellbeing. As these examples illustrate, the algorithm has wide-ranging applications, including in sports (not only football) and video games involving physical activity.

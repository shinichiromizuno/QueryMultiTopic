Create in-store displays with projected images and descriptions instead of physical products. Using projection mapping to project images onto plain 3D objects allows stores to display nearly life-like virtual products. Stores can use projected images to virtually expand their limited space, decorate the shopping floor, and provide information on many more designs and products.
Furthermore, by managing the projected content over a network or with application software, stores can freely remodel according to the season with minimal environmental impact.
Projectors thus enable stores to remodel their
sales floors in a way that combines practicality with elements of design and an event-like atmosphere while also minimizing product inventory and decorations for in-store displays, resulting in far less waste.

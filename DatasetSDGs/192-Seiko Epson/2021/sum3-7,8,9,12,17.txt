Most injection molded plastic parts, even small ones, are manufactured using large machines. Producing parts with large machines wastes plastic materials and consumes a large amount of electric power. Manufacturing innovations are thus
needed to create more compact production systems that reduce 3 environmental impacts while ensuring economic feasibility.

Compact parts production systems integrate everything from injection molding to inspection and tray loading.
Compact injection molders minimize material waste and energy consumption.
High quality control is achieved through 100% visual inspection.
Trays are transferred by compact 4 robots that operate with superior
accuracy and precision.

Increase personal and space efficiency with an integrated production system for small parts.
Reduce environmental impacts by conserving energy and resources during parts production.
Produce high-precision parts and stabilize quality with automated inspection processes.
All-in-one molding process and direct connection to assembly processes for simplified production lines.

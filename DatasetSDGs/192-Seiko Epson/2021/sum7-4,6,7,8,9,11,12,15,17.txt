Fact Data                 Goal
 The office and home segments of the printer business have been heavily impacted by the changes that swept the world due to COVID-19. The number of Epson printers in homes rose sharply, as did print volume, because of the sudden increase in the number of people around the world who are working and learning from home.
Remote work is likely here to stay. The decentralization of the workforce is expected to accelerate the trend toward distributed printing, where more prints will be made at homes and in small remote offices. Epson’s inkjet printers are compact, energy efficient, have a simple structure and low downtime. Moreover, the high-capacity ink tank models offer a low cost per print. These characteristics are all big advantages in meeting the needs of decentralization, and we will capitalize on these to meet the needs of the new normal and deliver customer value.
In 2020, sales of office shared inkjet printers, a growth area, increased as we continued to push users to switch from laser printers to inkjet printers. Our channel partners and end-users are beginning to understand the advantages of inkjet printers, not only their superior environmental performance but also their ease of maintenance and the infrequent need to replace consumables. However, I think we still need to further raise awareness of these benefits.
We have rolled out a new print subscription service called ReadyPrint in Europe. Customers choose from among a variety of monthly plans that depend on the number of pages they print per month and that keep initial costs down. We want to deliver an even better customer experience through services like this that connect us more closely with our customers. Therefore, we aim to create solutions by actively partnering with outside developers and collaborators that utilize our service platform.

Fiscal 2020 Summary
Home print demand expanded because people began working and studying from home due to COVID-19. Sales of high-capacity ink tank printers and consumables sharply increased despite factory shutdowns, logistics disruptions, and other disturbances on the supply side.
Office print demand was particularly weak in the first quarter due to lockdowns and other factors but recovered in the second half. Sales of high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction machines to schools and other institutions that print in high volume increased.

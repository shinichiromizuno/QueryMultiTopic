           Key CSR Themes (Materiality Matrix)
 Key CSR Themes and SDGs for Addressing Social Issues
It is important for us to identify priority issues as a company and to address them through our business activities in order to reach the goals stated in our Management Philosophy and to become an indispensable company. We comprehensively iden- tified social responsibility topics by referencing ISO 26000 and other sources for guidance. We evaluated the topics from both a company perspective and a social perspective. Those found to have the highest priority were mapped in a materiality matrix “( Key CSR Theme Matrix”). In the 2017 fiscal year, we analyzed these topics against the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to select SDGs that are aligned with our strategies.
  See P47-48 for details
       Identifying the Key Themes
To identify key social responsibility topics, we analyzed research on long-term social trends and looked at the company’s strategic direction based on the company’s 2025 stra- tegic vision (the Epson 25 Corporate Vision) and on our code of conduct (Principles of Corporate Behavior) for realizing the Management Philos- ophy. We listed up 466 challenges as potential key topics and then mapped them to the seven core subjects of ISO 26000.
Epson’s CSR Executive Council and CSR Management Committee evalu- ated and prioritized the topics to narrow down the list to 29 challeng- es. Epson’s materiality matrix “( Key CSR Themes”) was established after Epson’s outside directors and CSR consultant evaluated the importance of the topics from a social perspec- tive.
Commitment to the SDGs
Epson is using its original efficient, compact, and precision technologies and initiatives as vehicles to drive innovations that will enrich the world and make it a better place. Our goals are the same as those of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations.
Epson is creating new value by looking hard at solutions to social issues, understanding the expectations that society has of us, and then pro- viding products and services that far exceed those expectations. We at Epson are committed to the development of sustainable societies through the four areas of innovation identified in the Epson 25 Corporate Vision.

Aims of Changes to the Management Philosophy
Making Epson an Indispensable Company by Helping to Realize a Better World
In 2017, we revised the Epson Group’s Management Philosophy, adding the phrase“indispensable company”to declare our commitment to use our technology to provide new customer value in order to play a central role in realizing a better world.
Our reason for being is to enrich lives and make society happier. As a company, we have to make a profit, but that profit has to be the result of earning the trust of our customers. The revised Management Philosophy articulates our goal of sustaining growth and being indispensable to our customers, business partners, employees, and society by earning a profit as a sign that we have earned trust.
A company will fail to recognize its true mission and make itself indispensable if it becomes absorbed in rival’s moves or in market competition. Our primary emphasis should be on tackling the needs of customers and society, and on exceeding their expectations. At Epson, we seek to create value that exceeds customer expectations by encouraging our people to draw on their strengths and take the initiative to identify and deliver products and services that will enrich lives and bring our customers delight, happiness, and greater convenience.

            To Our Stakeholders
Corporate Vision for Achieving the Management Philosophy
Providing Our Efficient, Compact and Precision Technologies to Drive Innovation in Four Areas
Vertically Integrated Business Model
Perfecting Core Technologies and Core Devices to Maximize Customer Value
  The Epson 25 Corporate Vision maps out Epson’s course for the 10-year period from FY2016 to FY2025. The vision statement reads: “Creating a new connected age of people, things and information with efficient, compact and precision technologies."
Epson draws its strength from the efficient, compact, and precision technologies in its DNA. We have a history of improving product energy efficiency, reducing the size of parts and products without sacrificing performance, and achieving ever greater precision. Our efficient, compact, and precision technologies yield value in the form of smart technologies, the environment, and performance. Environmental impact mitigation and smart technologies are among the megatrends that will characterize the next decade. Both will be supported by advances in information and communications technology (ICT). Advances in ICT will lead to data of all kinds being uploaded to and available on the Internet, fueling the expansion of cyberspace. As a result, people in the real world will become directly involved with the cyber world, and products at the junction of these two worlds will become important for customers. As the ultimate real-world manufacturer, Epson will provide products and services whose value has been maximized using the
ultimate in efficient, compact, and precision technologies. We will also collaborate with the IT companies that underpin cyberspace to connect people, things, and information, and thereby create even greater value.
As declared in Epson 25, we seek to drive inkjet innovation, visual innovation, wearables innovation, and robotics innovation. Microdevices, primarily crystal devices and semiconductors, will support innovation in these four areas.
We will fully tap into all of Epson’s strengths and take advantage of Epson’s position to drive innovation in these four areas and usher in a new age.
The Four Areas of Innovation Under Epson 25
Epson’s creativity in product development and manufacturing is a byproduct of vertical integration. The core devices that determine the functions of our finished products are developed internally by drawing on the ideas and skills of our people.
We own and are thus able to wring the maximum benefit from all the core technologies and devices in our products. For printers, this is printheads. For projectors, it is microdisplays. For watches, it is precision processing technology. For robotics, it is sensors. All of these devices and technologies have been developed and refined over time by dedicated Epson engineers. As a finished product manufacturer, we understand better than anyone what type of value customers need. Listening carefully to our customers and developing products for them give us the opportunity to refine the core technologies and devices that are essential to finished product performance.
In inkjet printers, for example, we have been able to expand the applications for finished products by improving the core technology. Inkjet systems, which use far less power than laser systems, meet the needs of customers who want to
Epson’s Vertically Integrated Business Model
shrink their environmental footprint. We have broadly expanded the potential applications of inkjet systems by advancing our proprietary Micro Piezo inkjet technology, achieving superb durability, wide ink compatibility, terrific image quality and blazing print speeds. We now have inkjet printers not only for consumer use but for office, commercial and industrial applications. We have been able to accomplish this largely thanks to vertical integration, a business model that allows us to squeeze the maximum benefit from Epson’s outstanding technology and finite resources.
We are driving innovation in four areas where we can draw on Epson’s strengths and create unrivaled customer value. These are areas that we discovered when doing business in both devices and finished products. They are also areas where we can exploit the competitive edge that vertical integration affords. Of course, vertical integration is not necessarily the most effective approach in every field. We will also actively collaborate with other companies that enable us to even better leverage our own strengths as we seek to drive innovation by the most effective means possible and become an indispensable company.

            To Our Stakeholders
  Progress of the Phase 1 Mid-Range Business Plan
Major Steps Toward Achieving Epson 25
ESG Initiatives
Striving for Sustainability
Epson has long contributed to solutions to social challenges through the products and services we provide. I believe that helping to realize a better world is our mission and that every action we take to achieve the Management Philosophy fulfills our responsibility to society as a corporation. This approach is also aligned with the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.
In 2017, we identified challenges that we need to address to reach our stated goal of becoming an indispensable company. The highest priority issues and challenges were mapped onto a materiality matrix (‵‵Key CSR Themes"). We also examined our initiatives against the 169 targets of the 17 SDGs. We identified 13 SDGs that intersect with Epson’s initiatives and have declared our intention of addressing them.
In 2018, we amended“Environmental Vision 2050,”a long-term environmental action policy established a decade ago, to more sharply delineate our goal of providing products and services that reduce environmental impacts.
In addition, in 2016, Epson strengthened board of director oversight by mandating that outside directors comprise at least 40% of the board in order to ensure decision-making transparency and fairness.
We will continue to aspire to be an indispensable company that plays a central role in realizing a better world. We will strive to create new value by advancing our technologies and driving innovation to make the world a happier and easier place to live for all.
Epson aims to achieve 13 SDGs (as of March 2018)
 We have finished the second year of the Phase 1 Mid-Range Business Plan (FY2016-2018) under Epson 25, and although progress is not where we had hoped it would be in all areas, we are convinced that we are headed in the right strategic direction.
In our core printer business, we launched high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers that deliver brilliant output at blazing speeds while saving energy. We are looking to displace laser printers in offices. Yet, while office users understand inkjet value, there were certain business roadblocks that slowed sales in the immediate term. However, the biggest takeaway from the past year was the sense that the world believes in us. We were clearly reminded that markets will not be receptive to products that offer less than superior environmental performance. The response we received signaled that people believe in the Epson 25 vision and that its realization is becoming a reality.
In projectors, we expanded our lineup of laser models and provided the value of bright, high-quality laser images for spatial lighting, decor, staging, and performances to more customers. In wearable products, we announced the new Trume brand of analog watches and created new value by using our technology to deliver distinctive
products. In robotics, we released unique force sensors, autonomous dual-arm robots, and other products that perform menial jobs and enable people to switch to jobs in which they can exercise greater creativity.
Going forward, we will further accelerate solution selling in order to expand our customer contact points from B2C to B2B. Since new sales networks can’t be grown overnight, employees and dealers are visiting customers together to inform them about our products and the value they provide. We also have to build stronger relationships with business partners and engage in various collaborative efforts. Additional growth also hinges on our ability to foresee and flexibly adapt to social changes. This is another reason why communication with stakeholders must not be neglected.
Now that we are through the second year of the Epson 25 Phase 1 plan, I am convinced that stakeholders are beginning to understand that the future we envision for Epson is not just a pipe dream but is something we can actually achieve. We will continue to nurture developments that promise to create new value and build a solid foundation for growth in order to meet our 2025 fiscal year targets of ¥1,700 billion in revenue, a 12% ROS, and a 15% ROE.

Financial Strategies for Achieving Epson 25
  In 2016, we established the Epson 25 Corporate Vision. This plan, which is based on an analysis of megatrends and changes in the business environment, articulates how we want Epson to be by 2025. The actions we are pursuing are designed to enable us to reach the financial targets of Epson 25: ¥1,700 billion in revenue, ¥200 billion in business profit, a 12% ROS, and a 15% ROE.
Approach to Achieving the ROE Targets
Epson’s top priority is on strategic investment in growth, but we also seek to provide returns to shareholders and build a financial structure that is capable of withstanding change.

FY2017 Financial Results
In FY2017, Epson recorded ¥1,102.1 billion in revenue (7.5% year-on-year growth) and ¥74.7 billion in business profit*1 (13.6% year-on-year growth). This growth in revenue and business profit were driven largely by strong sales of high-capacity ink tank printers, which meet the needs of customers who want to print without worrying unduly about cost. We also continued to expand our projector market share and sales of models in a stronger high-brightness lineup. Our financial performance also benefited from the weak yen and positive foreign exchange effects.
On the other hand, profit for the period declined by 13.8% year-on-year, to ¥41.7 billion. This decline was due primarily to foreign exchange losses and an increase in tax expenses associated with U.S. tax reform.

Our fundamental approach to achieving Epson 25 is to expand management and regenerate resources through a cycle comprised of four perspectives: (1) business investment; (2) financial performance and investment
management; (3) capital distribution and allocation; and (4) financing and capital structure. Through this approach, we will achieve our Epson 25 financial targets, sustain growth, and increase corporate value.

15% (target)
        On the whole, we have made steady strategic progress under the first 3-year phase of the Epson 25 Corporate Vision, a period designated for building infrastructure and preparing products. For example, we have launched strategic products, such as high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers and high-brightness projectors, and have reinforced business infrastructure by building new factories. We also face some issues. We have not moved fast enough in some new areas and have not been able to adequately convince office users of the value of replacing their laser systems with inkjets. Nevertheless, we believe in the rightness of our strategic direction and, in FY2018, are bent on pursuing planned mid-term actions that better position Epson to generate earnings.

Phase 1 Mid-Range Business Plan Financial Strategies
3 Capital Distribution and Allocation
Epson strives to achieve sustained business growth through
the creation of customer value and to generate stable cash flow by improving profitability and using management resources efficiently. While our top priority is on strategic investment in growth, we also follow a parallel policy of actively returning profits and building a robust financial structure that is capable of withstanding changes in the business environment.
 For the first phase under Epson 25 (FY2016-2018) we are focusing most heavily on the business investment perspective, investing in product development and production equipment and facilities that will provide a robust business foundation.
In the second phase (2019-2021), we are leaning toward curtailing investment somewhat compared to the first
1 Business Investment
The first three years of Epson 25 were designated as a period for laying a solid foundation for future growth. We have been investing between ¥70 billion and ¥80 billion per year in strategic growth (mainly to increase our production capacity, strengthen our information and communications technology, and improve manufacturing efficiency). At the same time, we have continued to invest in R&D and our sales organization.
In FY2017, we focused on strengthening our production and sales infrastructure. We built a new factory in the Philippines, at the site of our current printer and projector production operations, to put us in a position to respond to projected growth in global demand. In Japan, meanwhile, we built a new manufacturing factory for PrecisionCore printheads, the core devices powering office, commercial, and industrial inkjets. We are also strengthening our office printer and emerging markets sales organizations.
In FY2018, construction work began on a new factory. The new factory will have facilities for the trial manufacture and
Financial Performance and Investment Management
Day-to-day management of financial performance and investment supports our growth strategy by allowing us to rapidly respond to budgetary issues with a PDCA cycle based on dependable operations that ensure accurate financial and accounting operations in every company and corner of the Epson Group.
Our ROE target under the Phase 1 plan is 10% or better. In FY2017, however, we recorded an ROE of 8.3%, down year on year, due to a shortfall in business profit. I believe that to maintain a suitable ROE and generate stable cash flow we need real-time financial and inventory data, and so we are exploring a new management system. We will stably expand earnings by addressing issues such as these.
phase. We will stay focused on the target ROE while driving higher profit and additional growth as a result of investments made to date.
Investment in growth is our top priority for the cash generated through the management resource expansion cycle, but we will also use this cash to strengthen our financial structure and shareholder returns.
mass-production of large commercial and industrial printing systems. It will also have a test lab for digital textile printing. These investments will enable us to accelerate initiatives in high-margin office, commercial, and industrial markets, increase our ability to generate cash, and build a stable financial structure.
In FY2017, we recorded year-on-year growth in business profit, so we increased the annual dividend to ¥62 per share, up ¥2 per share from the previous year.

Rapid, decisive business decision-making is essential for carrying out the foregoing initiatives smoothly and for executing the cycle for expanding management resources. This is another reason why we are exploring a new system that will enable us to manage the financial situation in real-time. We are currently at the preparatory stage, standardizing and gaining additional visibility into our business processes, but in addition to overhauling our global enterprise system, we are also exploring a comprehensive system that may incorporate robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence. In addition to contributing to rapid and
decisive decision-making, these systems should increase employee work efficiency and accelerate a shift toward high added value operations.
In addition to being Seiko Epson’s Chief Financial Officer, I am also the Chief Compliance Office (CCO), with responsibility for enhancing and strengthening corporate governance. I expect the new system to also yield benefits in the containment of fraud risk and other areas of governance. Through these initiatives, we will work to further increase corporate value so as to meet the expectations of our shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders.

       2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 (Fiscal year) Revenue dipped in FY2016 due to negative

Free Cash Flows
2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 (Fiscal year) In FY2015 and FY2016 profit decreased as
the yen rose. In FY2017, however, we recorded profit growth due to a combination of revenue growth, the effects of a weaker yen, and improved profitability from an increase in high added value products.
2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 (Fiscal year) GHG emissions increased in FY2017 due to
the startup of new factories for inkjet printers and metal powder products, but we met our CO2 emissions-per-revenue target.

With built-in PrecisionCore lineheads, the WF-C20590 is a high-speed multi-function inkjet capable of print speeds up to 100 ppm (pages per minute). That’s double the output of the typical office laser printer. Enabled by Epson’s inkjet technologies, high-speed linehead multi-function printers (MFPs) take the combination of print performance and energy efficiency to the next level.

    User Comment
        Businesses are more sensitive than ever to environmental issues. Many try to save energy by adjusting their thermostat settings or adopting LED lighting. What they may overlook is that printers and MFPs account for about 10% of total power consumed in a typical office.
We see an opportunity to help them further cut their energy use and costs. Epson inkjet printers draw very little power when printing because ink droplets are ejected by the action of piezoelectric elements that contract under only a tiny applied voltage. In contrast, laser printers require heat-and a lot of electricity-to fuse toner to paper.

for the Office
We at Plan International, a children’s aid organization that is active in over 70 countries, have replaced most of our laser printers with Epson inkjet printers. We use Epson’s high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers for high-volume print jobs in order to maximize speed, quality, and efficiency. Lower energy costs are an added benefit, as are a cooler office environment and better indoor air quality, since inkjets do not heat up a room. We are extremely satisfied with the excellent output and superior printing performance of Epson’s printers, as well as their environmental performance, as sustainability is crucial in environmentally conscious Germany.

SDGs it helps achieve
Toshiyuki Oguchi
Mayor of Shiojiri, Japan
The city government of Shiojiri decided to install a PaperLab after examining the potential environmental, security, and job creation benefits. We saw that we could promote environmental conservation through local recycling of used paper without stressing water resources. We saw that we could strengthen security by destroying sensitive information on-site. And we saw that we could develop employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. I personally feel that the biggest benefit is that the PaperLab can inspire children. For a resource-poor country like Japan, the development of high-productivity industries is important for the national identity. So, I think it is critical to instill in children a sense of awe and excitement about technology and learning.
A tangible benefit of installing PaperLab is its productivity: We are producing, on average, 18,000 new sheets of paper per month from locally recovered paper and use them to make application forms, etc. This has enabled us to reduce the amount of waste paper transported off-site for disposal by 20%.
                                       Dry-process office papermaking system
The PaperLab A-8000, the world’s first dry-process office papermaking system*2, makes new paper from old right on site. Epson’s unique dry fiber technology represents a breakthrough in paper recycling. It enables scrap paper to be reused not only in new paper production but also in the production of a variety of other pulp-based products.

Internal Case Study
Epson uses the A-8000 extensively to recycle and reproduce paper used on its own sites. In 2018, this recycled paper was used to produce all orientation training materials for new employees. It is being used for calendars and employee business cards. This paper is also used for notebooks and memo pads, and we plan to further expand uses in the near future. The production of paper and paper-based goods has expanded the range of job opportunities for the staff of Epson Mizube Corp., a special subsidiary that supports the employment of persons with disabilities and is involved in these activities.
Epson also uses a machine that employs dry fiber technology to upcycle recovered paper into waste-ink pads for inkjet printers and sound absorbing materials for the A-8000.

        Preservation of Water Resources
An ordinary paper recycling process uses about a cup of water to produce a single A4 sized sheet of paper. In contrast, the A-8000 uses only a small fraction of this to maintain humidity within the system, thus helping to conserve precious water resources.
Effective Use of Forest Resources
Paper is produced from wood taken from the forests, and while efforts have been made to conserve this resource by producing cardboard from recycled paper, the A-8000 produces new copy paper from used documents right in the office. Also, any paper produced by the A-8000 may be marked with the
Awareness-Raising
The A-8000 reproduces paper on the spot ̶a fresh surprise that can raise the environmental awareness of your staff and spawn further environmental action. Children who have had the opportunity to see paper recycled come away with insights and greater concern for the environment, as well as a desire to solve environmental issues with science.

help printers transition from analog to digital systems by offering clean, space-efficient, environmentally considerate digital inkjet printing systems that, in addition to being ideally suited for short-run print jobs and short turnaround times, save water and reduce material wastes and emissions while delivering the desired output without relying on highly skilled labor.
We will also provide new value by building sustainable office printing ecosystems with the PaperLab A-8000, a dry-process office papermaking system that produces new paper from used paper.
Strategic Progress
In FY2017 we began selling high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers. These are core strategic products for driving the replacement of laser printers with inkjets in the office. Unlike laser printing systems, inkjet systems do not use heat in the printing process, which means they consume far less energy. Inkjets also have the advantage of having fewer replacement parts and being easier to maintain. We have also been building our sales network as we roll out our high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers by strengthening ties with customers and cooperation with dealers who have sales experience and expertise. High-capacity ink tank printer sales have continued to grow. We have expanded and upgraded our product lineup in developed markets like Japan and the U.S., as well as in emerging markets. I believe that the unit sales growth we are seeing is the result of having won over customers by genuinely addressing the needs of those who want to print

as much as they need, whenever they need, without guilt or hesitation. The importance of high-capacity ink tank models will continue to grow for Epson, so we will be more active in educating potential customers about their value in Japan, North America, Western Europe, and other markets where recognition of these models has been low.
In the commercial and industrial sectors, we made strategic progress in the signage, textile, and label markets. In addition, we installed the PaperLab A-8000 at the facilities of premium partners, who are collaborating with us to increase product value. As we move forward, we will evolve our business operations by developing technologies that customer needs in all product categories and that offer the long-term value that customers expect.

         The Long-Term Business Environment
Offices and consumers are said to be going paperless as information and communications technology (ICT) advances, but that does not mean that total global print volume is declining. It is true that cost and environmental concerns curb the appetite for prints and that there are more opportunities today to share and view information on-screen. However, the volume of digital information is growing rapidly, so the final print volume has not significantly changed. The value of paper as a convenient medium for presenting more information at a glance is not likely to change. That is why I believe it is our responsibility as a printer manufacturer to provide customers with innovative products and services that reduce their printing costs and environmental impacts.
In the commercial and industrial sector, we expect print demand in the signage, textile, and label printing markets to grow. Growth will be driven by surging demand for items such as printed clothing, packaging, and advertisements as emerging markets expand and populations swell. At the same time, commercial and industrial printing companies
will move away from unwieldly analog systems, which require the production of press plates, and toward digital systems, which print images directly onto media while reducing environmental impacts, easily accommodating short-run print jobs, and providing shorter turnaround times. As the spread of digital technology continues to alter the printing market landscape, our focus will be on solving emerging challenges and meeting changing needs rather than on competing against others on price or specifications.
Strategic Direction
We are looking to capitalize on our inkjet technology to expand business in the office, commercial, and industrial printing segments. To do so, I think it will be increasingly important to respond to issues that customers face, such as the need to increase productivity via fast, stable printing and the desire for better environmental performance.
In the office market we will drive a technology shift from laser printers to inkjet printers, which consume far less power and produce far lower consumables emissions. We will also reduce users’printing costs so they can print without hesitation. In the commercial and industrial markets, we will

Product Strategies for Achieving Growth
Office Inkjet Printers
The Office Printer Market
Global printer demand has been moving sideways, but inkjet printers exhibited annual unit growth in FY2017 on the strength of high-capacity ink tank printers.
Sales of Epson’s high-capacity ink tank printers have been steadily expanding in every region. Competitors have launched conceptually similar products that have helped to further raise the market profile of this product category. As the pioneer in this category, however, Epson has built a robust brand, a broad product lineup, and strong sales channels, and our cumulative sales in this category as of June 2018 topped 30 million units. In tandem with our high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers, which we have begun to roll out globally, our high-capacity ink tank printers have uncovered needs and are offering value not available with laser systems, thus triggering the start of a broad technology shift.
Epson’s Market Potential
The global printer market, including consumables, is a roughly US$162 billion market (based on user purchases). Within this market, office laser printers and consumables occupy a space that is estimated to be about 3.5 times larger than that of inkjet printers. This space represents a huge, largely untapped market for Epson’s inkjet printers, which offer productivity and quality rivalling that of laser printers while also offering unique value in areas such as environmental performance.
The Inkjet Advantage
The laser printing process is complicated, comprising charging, exposure, development, transfer, and fusing steps. In the transfer and fusing steps, powdered toner is transferred to a sheet of paper through contact and fused with a combination of heat and pressure.
In contrast, Epson’s inkjet printers are simple, non-contact systems that deposit ink droplets on media without heating the ink, so they are durable, require only infrequent parts replacement, and produce little waste. The fact that they do not use heat also means that they consume little energy. These characteristics translate into a lower environmental impact and a lower total cost of ownership (TCO).
Epson’s inkjet systems differ from other inkjets in that Epson systems employ proprietary Micro Piezo technology, a common platform of technology for all Epson inkjet printers, whether for the home or business.

PrecisionCore Lineheads for Blazing Speeds and Superb Image Quality
  In the 30 ppm or less zone, where inkjet printers have gradually 1 begun to replace laser printers, Epson will further strengthen its lineup of high-capacity ink tank and high-capacity ink pack printers
to capture high print volume customers.
 2 In the 45+ ppm A3 printer zone we will launch high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers.
 PrecisionCore lineheads have 36 print chips arranged diagonally on a 43-mm-wide head, giving these compact lineheads approximately 33,500 effective nozzles.
Most inkjet printers use serial printheads, which print while rapidly shuttling back and forth over a page as the page is incrementally inched forward. In contrast, PrecisionCore lineheads are stationary and extend across the width of the paper, so sheets can be transported without stopping during the printing process. This allows Epson printers to reach speeds of up to 100 pages per minute*1 while the high nozzle density achieves laser-like output.
We plan to grow our business by providing printers that increase productivity by delivering peerless print

 iT-DnS Pte Ltd, a security systems provider that sets up video surveillance systems at large-scale events, prints out hundreds of pages of reports, training materials, and other documents each month. However, since the per-page cost of color prints was high and the print quality low, we, as a small company for which printing costs are a significant issue, used to print out most of these documents in black-and-white and then highlight important details with highlighters to avoid the high cost per page of color prints. Epson’s high-capacity ink tank printers, which produce prints at an even lower cost per page than laser printers, significantly reduced our expenses while improving our efficiency. We can print several hundred pages without any noticeable drop in ink levels and no refills. And we can print everything in color without worrying about costs, so we can print documents rather than read them on a PC screen.

Expanding Production Infrastructure
    Epson and the Commercial and Industrial Printing Markets
Epson formed a commercial large-format inkjet printer business in 1999 and has led the digitization of commercial printing ever since by capitalizing on photo-quality inkjet output for large-format photos and color matching proofs. Now the signage, textile, and label markets are ripe for growth thanks to ample room for digitization and business expansion. In the commercial and industrial printing markets, increased design diversity and short-run production demand are behind a finer segmentation of social needs and pursuit of differentiation. Tougher environmental and cost requirements are also likely to drive additional digital printing market expansion.
Commercial and Industrial Printing Market Size
The Value of Inkjet Technology
Digital printing has the advantage of being able to produce complex designs in short production runs. Epson is developing printing systems that exploit its Micro Piezo inkjet technology to deliver stable output of higher quality at blazing speeds.
Our efficient, compact, and precision technologies enable us to engineer small, easy-to-use inkjet systems that use space efficiently, reduce operation and maintenance labor, and lower overall production costs. Low water use and low waste emissions also give digital printing production processes a huge advantage over conventional analog printing processes. Our PrecisionCore printheads boast excellent ink compatibility and durability while delivering exceptional output at blazing speeds. Because we develop and mass-produce our own core devices, we can rapidly incorporate even the most exacting customer needs into our product plans and designs to deliver products that exceed their expectations.
Our digital inkjet printing solutions are helping our commercial and industrial customers raise their productivity even as they shrink their environmental footprints.
Value Provided to Commercial & Industrial Customers
In addition to high image quality, productivity, stable operation, and a low TCO, Epson printers offer the value below.
Reinforcing Core Device Development and Production Sites
We have been investing in long-term growth of the printing solutions business. One of the investments was in a new factory at the Hirooka Office, in Japan. Construction on the factory was completed in July 2018, and production lines are now being readied for operations. The new factory will produce PrecisionCore print chips, the core components in PrecisionCore printheads.
The Hirooka factory, which will also have an R&D function, is expected to approximately triple Epson’s PrecisionCore print chip production capacity from the 2017 level. This capacity will enable us to meet growing demand for high-speed business inkjet printers in the office market. It will also allow us to meet inkjet printhead demand, which we see rising as digitization takes hold in the commercial and industrial sectors.
Another new building (the B Wing of the Innovation Center) under construction at the Hirooka Office will house a trial production and mass production facility for large commercial and industrial printing systems, as well as a test lab for textile printing. In addition to strengthening our R&D capabilities and production technology, the new building will consolidate key departments under the same roof to increase work efficiency. The advanced production technology and expertise developed here will be rolled out to our overseas production sites to improve the Epson Group’s overall manufacturing capabilities.
Strengthening Production Capacity Overseas
Epson has major production sites for inkjet printers and projectors in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and we continue to expand production in line with our long-term business strategy.
In July 2017, we expanded our global inkjet printer and projector production capacity with the completion of construction on a new factory at Epson Precision (Philippines), Inc. (EPPI).
We expect inkjet printer demand to continue to increase. Not only are sales of Epson’s core high-capacity ink tank printers growing rapidly in emerging nations, but we are also seeing steady growth in sales of high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers and other office inkjets. We will thus continue to reinforce production capacity and improve efficiency.
We have also taken care to boost the environmental performance of the new factory at EPPI by installing on a rooftop mega-solar power system that is capable of generating up to 3,000 kW of output.

      The Long-Term Business Environment
We cannot count on substantial growth in the existing projector market, but the total display device market is still growing, with traction provided by flat panel displays and cheap micro-projectors. I think we are going to see much more growth in visual communications applications that use visual imagery and other information to effectively appeal to an audience. Globalization is also bringing with it more opportunities for people in remote locations to communicate just as if they were in the same location. We will respond to social changes such as these by accurately assessing what
customers need and developing products to serve those needs. In the smart glasses market, the value proposition is crucial. In the computer game market, closed headsets are receiving a lot of attention, with each manufacturer guarding its own territory. Epson’s smart glasses have see-through lenses. This is an advantage in commercial and industrial markets where users need to be able to see their surroundings. Epson will advertise this as value to be delivered. Going forward, we will advance product development and advertise the value to be delivered.
Strategic Direction
Epson’s strength in projectors derives from technology, of course, but also from customer care. By making technology and customer care the centerpieces of our business strategy, we have developed products that satisfy the most challenging customer needs and requirements. I firmly believe that it is our unwavering dedication to quality that is the reason for our ongoing success.
We will continue to develop projectors that provide new value and that expand the potential for future visual communications. Challenges include, for example, the development of projectors that deliver bright images in any environment, projectors that throw images not only on static screens but on three-dimensional or moving objects, and lighting projectors for staging and decor.

We maximize the potential of analog watches by wielding a combination of state-of-the-art technology and artisan skills. In addition to telling time, the first models boast advanced sensing functions for taking measurements of the wearer and of the wearer’s surroundings. The results of measurements are naturally and beautifully displayed using analog hands. The models in the second collection are designed to be more “watch-like” and offer a new style, with ageing and replaceable bands.

Chief Operating Officer, Wearable Products Operations Division
The Long-Term Business Environment
The watch market is expected to continue to steadily grow as the global population increases and as people in emerging nations become more affluent.
At the same time, wearers are all looking for something different in a watch, and that is why the market is crowded with countless styles and brands of watches.
Now the market is heading toward a period of transition, in which consumers will seek new value such as that provided by smartwatches with computer functions.
We see the watch market growing stably over the longer term because of the diverse needs that exist in the market.
Strategic Direction
Efficient, compact, and precision technologies have been in our DNA from the beginning. And the relentless pursuit of improvements to accuracy, our low-power semiconductor fabrication technology and parts micromachining technology have led us to a single conviction: There are watches that hold fresh promise and that only Epson can produce. We will provide unique products that only Epson can produce by combining the precision processing
technology we have developed over the years with our sensors and other core technologies.
We are looking to operate efficiently and grow sales without heavy additional investment by taking advantage of Epson’s current technology development, production, and sales capabilities.
Strategic Progress
Until recently, Epson had three original watch brands: the Orient Star/Orient brand of fine yet practical mechanical watches; the WristableGPS/ProSense brand of running monitors with advanced sensing capabilities, and the Smart Canvas brand of watches that use finely rendered graphics to represent the passage of time.
In 2017 we created Trume, a new brand for analog watches that feature the ultimate in advanced technology. We later added a new collection that offers new ways to enjoy watches.
We will build Trume into an indispensable brand by delivering unique value that only Epson can achieve.
  2
We are combining Orient’s tradition and Epson’s watch technology to provide even more elegant, accurate, and high-quality mechanical watches. Orient Star Mechanical Moon Phase watches combine a moon phase function and semi-skeleton features for a genuine mechanical watch experience. They are both practical and exquisite, with features such as finely embossed dials, ornaments, and a dual curved sapphire glass.
   3
WristableGPS sports watches (“ProSense” in some markets) are ideal for activities like running and hiking. In addition to outstanding positioning accuracy and long battery life, the models announced in 2017 capture a GPS signal in a shorter amount of time. They also have an Easy View Display for improved visibility and enhanced activity tracking, providing full support every day, including race day.
   4
 Smart Canvas watches hold a peculiar charm that neither earlier watches nor fashion accessories do. Some models feature popular characters while others have original content and swappable bands so that you can tailor the watch to your likes.

expectations. With sales companies and manufacturing sites around the world, as well as an Epson network that provides local sales and service, we will quickly identify customer needs and rapidly respond to even the most detailed requirements. Our goal is to make our strengths even stronger and to be a leader in the compact precision robot market, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of 8% for the next decade.
Strategic Progress
The market for compact precision robots is expanding, and we are seeing growth in revenue and profit from our current SCARA and 6-axis robots, particularly from expansion in China, Taiwan, Europe and the Americas. Epson’s SCARA robots have maintained the top share of the global market for seven consecutive years*1.
In November 2017, we released WorkSense autonomous dual-arm robots. These robots recognize objects much like humans do, and they adjust the amount of force the arms apply to objects. They can be moved to where they are needed and quickly set up to perform, unattended, assembly and other tasks, thus helping to expand the areas of production that can be automated.
The number of new entrants in the robot market is growing,
especially in China, where local vendors have emerged, and
price competition is intensifying. But what customers want are
not only the robots themselves but total package solutions that
include peripheral equipment. Epson recommends solutions
*1 Epson was No. 1 in terms of both unit shipments and revenue from 2011 to 2017. (Source: Fuji Keizai “2012-2018 Worldwide Robot Market and Future Outlook".)
based on knowledge of customer needs and requirements, insights gained by having Epson sales and production personnel observe customer operations on-site. We will further solidify these strengths to increase our market presence.
There is currently a shortage of people who can do the necessary programming to implement robots in this growing market. The market thus requires robots that people without advanced programming skills can easily teach. Epson has responded to this need by developing a simple programming function that is scheduled for an FY2018 market release. This function allows users to arrange the necessary commands in a sequence on-screen and then manually move the robot arm to set a given move.
In addition, we will produce safe collaborative robots “( cobots”) that work alongside people. These robots will be equipped with sensor-based safety features that cause the arm to slow down when a human approaches, and to stop on contact.

     The Long-Term Business Environment
Robot use is set to expand. Not only will robots be used in place of people to perform repetitive manufacturing tasks in factories, they will also be used to perform tasks in the back offices, as well as to provide personal assistance in the home. The need for robots is expected to grow across society as more people, including people in emerging countries, want to be freed from menial labor and have time to themselves.
To expand these uses of robots, we must enable robots to recognize and react to their surroundings so that they do not collide with people or other objects or, if they do, to do so safely. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and precision sensing are essential for achieving this.
As global manufacturing wages rise and as competition for workers intensifies, manufacturers are rapidly turning to robots for relief and the market has entered a growth phase. The opportunity for growth has attracted new entrants from other industries that have their own technology, so there is no doubt that the market is going to undergo major change.
Strategic Direction
The efficient, compact, and precision technologies that grew out of our watch manufacturing operations are the source of
Epson’s strength. By complementing these with processing technologies, sensing technologies, and a host of other technologies and devices developed in our other businesses, we can provide compact, slim, lightweight robotic solutions of unrivaled speed and accuracy. Where we can take advantage of this strength is in the compact precision robot segment. Ordinarily, a robot arm moving at high speed will vibrate and deviate from the intended position. To accurately position small parts at high speed, the robot needs a system to control vibration and positional deviation. Epson is helping customers reach their productivity goals by equipping robots with sensor-based control technology that enables fast, accurate robots to stop on a dime. In addition, equipping 6-axis robots with Epson’s force sensors enables the robots to detect forces as small as 0.1 Newtons at the end-effector. This level of sensitivity allows our robots to automate tasks that previously relied on a human sense of touch, such as delicate assembly, polishing, and insertion tasks.
Epson, which has been developing, selling, and using its own robots in Epson factories for many years, is accumulating knowledge through real-world testing of automated solutions. Epson will draw on this knowledge to understand the needs on customers’ manufacturing lines and the potential for future automation, and to provide solutions that exceed

Epson was founded in 1942 in a natural setting, in Suwa, Japan. Harmonious co-existence is our cornerstone. Even as we expanded globally, our culture of respect for the environment never wavered. In 1988 Epson became the world’s first enterprise to announce it would eliminate ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from its operations. Past and present, Epson has always set high goals for its environmental initiatives. We revised Environmental Vision 2050 in 2018 in line with our aim of making Epson an indispensable company that is committed to sustainability, as stated in the Management Philosophy. We remain engaged with the problems faced by our customers and communities as we work for a sustainable society, starting with meeting the SDGs by 2030. Through our business, we will keep creating uniquely Epson environmental value.

  Epson's SDGs from an environmental perspective
(as of September 2018)
  In 2008, Epson established Environmental Vision 2050, a statement of our 2050 environmental goals. Ten years later, the business landscape is very different.
Externally, the Paris Agreement of 2015 established a long-term global target of keeping the increase in average temperature worldwide to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
An international initiative known as Science Based Targets (SBT) recognizes
Junichi Watanabe
Managing Executive Officer General Administrative Manager, Production Planning Division
businesses that set medium/long term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets consistent with the 2°C goal. This is a new world standard. And since climate change is not the only environmental problem, we face greater demands to circulate resources. An example is the EU Circular Economy Action Plan. Enterprises have to step up their efforts.
Internally, Epson has changed our business structure to better reflect our strengths. We transferred our small- and medium-sized LCD business and optical business. We are speeding up the shift in our business focus from consumers to office, commercial, and industrial customers. In light of these internal and external changes, we revised Environmental Vision 2050 in 2018. Under our new vision, we are taking environmental initiatives as an indispensable company striving to achieve a sustainable society.

Epson took the startup of Building 9 as a chance to use more renewable energy (green electricity) in time for 2025 as we seek medium- to long-term growth in the office, commercial, and industrial sectors per the Epson 25 Corporate Vision and try to meet our long-term GHG
LEDs for All Lighting
LED lighting is one effective way to save energy in the factory. Aside from energy savings, LEDs provide another significant advantage: less frequent replacement means higher productivity. Semiconductor factories use yellow light with a wavelength of 500 nm or greater, since this does not affect the exposure process. LEDs are increasingly common in homes and offices, but it is only in the last few years that yellow LED products have come out. The cleanroom at Building 9 uses this new LED lighting, and the entire building is lit by LED lamps.

reduction targets. The amount of renewable energy we plan to purchase in FY2018 would cover more than 10% of the scope 2 emissions for the entire Group. That amount of renewable energy would be enough to power Building 9 completely.
High-Efficiency Air Cleaning System
Epson uses a task and ambient air cleaning system*5 to manufacture PrecisionCore products. This efficient local air cleaning technology provides the required level of cleanliness (Class 1000 or better) with energy savings.
The air cleaning system also eliminates the need to circulate clean air to the ceiling, etc., as in conventional cleanrooms. Less building material is needed and floors can be built to a lower height, using space more effectively.

Solution
We eliminated the protective seal and replaced it with an airtight bottle cap and a slotted valve near the tip of the nozzle to prevent ink from dripping.
Sales Initiatives
Solution
Ink bottles and printer ink filling holes were redesigned to enable easy filling. Users simply have to insert a bottle nozzle into an ink tank and wait about 40 seconds for the tank to fill. Filling automatically stops when a tank is full.
Solution
The ink bottles have a tip that is uniquely shaped for each color and can only be inserted in a tank of the same color.
Ink bottles act like a key that fits only the correct ink tank

Quality Assurance Program Organization
The president of Seiko Epson Corporation heads up our quality assurance program. A Quality Assurance Council, committees, and project teams solve shared issues and serious problems. In addition, we manage our quality assurance programs by periodically assessing and reviewing the state of quality and the progress of actions, reporting the results to the president, and formulating and implementing policies for further improvement.
Collaboration, instructions & reports
In case of accident in a product owned by a customer, the local sales company in Japan or abroad and the affected business’s market response team file a flash report on the Quality Crisis Management (QCM) system.*1
Affected departments, including the QA department of the operations division or Group company, promptly analyze the cause and study solutions. Top management and affected departments share information and make appropriate disclosures and responses, putting the customer first. We also report to outside organizations as legally required, as in the Consumer Product Safety Act in Japan.

Maximizing the Capacities of Our Diverse Personnel
Respecting Human Rights
Epson is serious about keeping all forms of discrimination and unfair practices out of its operations around the world. This stance is reflected in our participation in the United Nations Global Compact. Also, the Group’s policies regarding human rights and labor standards articulate Epson’s strong convictions in areas including respect for human rights, elimination of harassment, eradication of all forms of discrimination, respect for local culture and customs, prohibition of child and forced labor, and maintenance of positive labor-management relations. These attitudes are widely disseminated and practiced throughout the Group.

Better Workplace Environments for Employees
In 2018, METI and Nippon Kenko Kaigi recognized Seiko Epson under the White 500 program, large enterprise category. A safe and healthy work environment and physical and mental wellness are the foundation of a healthy company. We strive to ensure that all our employees and partners can enjoy working as a team, knowing they are safe and secure.
In Japan, every five years we institute a mid-range plan on health. The current plan, Health Action 2020, proclaims emphasizing safety and improving the working environment while fostering employee and workplace independence
and autonomy as our basic stance. Initiatives address health in three focus areas: workplace, physical, and mental.
Health Action 2020: Three Key Areas and Actions
Promoting Diversity
Epson’s true customers are end-users the world over. To enrich their lives, we have to understand them and meet their needs. To achieve this, our own diversity is important. We believe that only with a diverse workforce of people who have respect for one another and who know and practice what is important can we create customer value. To deliver results that surprise and delight our customers, Epson promotes female managerial staff and foreign nationals, fostering a corporate culture that enables diverse personnel to display their abilities to the full.
     Group Human Resources Development Policy
Epson develops its human resources in line with the Epson Group Human Resources Development Policy established in 1996, which designates talented people as a precious management resource and asserts that it is people that connect, support, and nurture the Epson Group. We assist employees so that they can achieve their dreams of self-fulfillment.
We provide training so that our people understand their roles and what is expected of them as members of the Epson team. Training enables them to work and communicate effectively, solve problems and achieve goals, and experience personal and professional growth.

Epson specifies its work goals and work culture. Our goal is for all employees to maintain and improve their physical and mental health while working efficiently in a vital, rewarding work environment, without excessive labor demands. In this way, the company will develop in perpetuity, raising its corporate value and ensuring a win-win relationship with its employees.

Supply Chain
Socially Responsible Procurement Program
Epson’s socially responsible procurement program helps suppliers enhance CSR. At supplier briefings, we ask them to practice socially responsible procurement and complete a Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) on their observance of the Epson Supplier Code of Conduct. We verify their answers on-site and conduct audits, after which we share issues and work for improvement.
Employee Training
During on-site verification of suppliers by Epson employees, we review documents, tour the site, and interview workers to ascertain labor and human rights conditions. Aimed at developing the skills to identify worker concerns and dissatisfaction, we invite instructors from outside organizations to train Epson procurement staff who do on-site verifications in how to interview workers.
This is required training for employees who perform on-site verifications so they can do so with greater accuracy.
Dealing with Conflict Minerals
Epson prohibits and works to eliminate the use of conflict minerals that fund armed groups tied to human rights abuses and environmental destruction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.
Conflict Minerals Survey Implementation Status
    Our procurement seeks to build trusting relationships with our business partners around the world based on fairness, coexistence, transparency, and co-prosperity.
As a global enterprise, Epson does business with about 1,500 suppliers around the world. Component quality, delivery, and procurement cost are important, but we look for more than just those factors that affect product quality and our business activities. The public cares about CSR issues like the environment and human rights, so we hold our suppliers to high ethical standards to ensure we contribute to society and fulfill our social responsibility.

   Supply Chain Strategy
In keeping with our Management Philosophy and other values statements, our procurement emphasizes six points as the highest priority for the entire supply chain.
1. Provide products and services that create customer value
2. Work proactively for environmental conservation
3. Comply with laws and social norms and take actions based on high ethical standards
4. Respect human rights
5. Ensure safe, healthy, and fair working environments
6. Establish business continuity management (BCM)
Since FY2016, we have held socially responsible procurement briefings for suppliers to share information on Epson’s socially responsible procurement programs with suppliers. In FY2017, we held a total of eleven briefings in Japan, China, and Indonesia. Briefings were attended by 613 people from 453 suppliers, who learned about Epson’s efforts.
Briefing (Indonesia)
Learning Supplier Status, Sharing Information, Improving
Suppliers take the SAQ to assess how well they are following the Epson Supplier Code of Conduct. If the results reveal risks at a supplier, we perform on-site verifications and audits and share information on any problems we find. We also share plans for any needed improvements and work together to implement them.
FY2015 FY2016
FY2017
     The Epson Group Procurement Guidelines and Supplier Code of Conduct, based on the RBA Code of Conduct, set requirements in the areas of labor, health and safety, environmental conservation, management, and ethics, as well as seven additional requirements that Epson considers important, such as export control and security in the supply chain. We are thereby asking our suppliers to comply with a more concrete protocol.

     Our Supply Chain Works Together for a Sustainable Society
Epson seeks to create customer value as guided by our Management Philosophy in order to win and maintain the trust of our stakeholders into the future and to contribute in an ongoing way to the development of society. We will fulfill our corporate social responsibility through actions designed to achieve our Management Philosophy. When suppliers take the same approach as Epson to human rights, labor conditions, the environment, compliance, ethics, quality, and information security, we can solve society’s challenges together and contribute to the making of a sustainable society.

Supplier Business Continuity Plans (BCP)
Epson aims to establish systems to get the supply of products flowing again as soon as possible if a supply chain disaster or accident disrupts it.
In FY2017, a fire at a supplier’s facility disrupted our business activities. We began doing more to teach and raise awareness among suppliers as a result. The following initiatives are being taken:
● We ask our 1,353 suppliers to self-assess their BCP control level and make improvements.
● Epson disaster and safety management staff inspect sites of 399 key suppliers for fire risk. They suggest improvements and follow up on implementation.

The board of directors as a whole was found to be functioning effectively, as was the case in fiscal 2016. The board is of an appropriate size and diversity, the members engage in constructive debate and exchange of ideas under the fair and efficient operation of the chairman of the board, and authority is delegated appropriately by the board to the management team.
At the same time, it was noted that there are opportunities to further enhance board effectiveness by, for example, strengthening policies and systems for better mirroring the opinions expressed in constructive dialog with shareholders and by reinforcing the risk management in respect of the business strategy.
We will strive to further improve the effectiveness of the board by addressing these opportunities going forward.
The board ensured its effectiveness by providing strategic direction on selected issues, appointing owners to address those issues, and monitoring progress. It also input results to further increase the quality of next year’s board effectiveness evaluation.

Seiko Epson has elected five outside directors as required by the Compa- ny’s Corporate Gover- nance Policy and Criteria for Independence of Out- side Directors.
*1 The rate of attendance was calculated using the number of board meetings held in FY2017 as the denominator.
Present at 12 out of 13 board meetings (92.3 %)*1
Main contributions to the board
Mr. Omiya has extensive experience and insight as an executive and engineer. He actively speaks out and makes recommendations over a broad range of matters as an executive with expertise in global heavy industry management.
Using Scientific Management to Contribute to Growth
The world has entered an era of rapid geopolitical and technological change. The Epson 25 Corporate Vision serves as a guide to riding out the tumult, pioneer- ing a new future by connecting people, things, and information with efficient, compact and precision technologies, and achieving further growth. I want to use the technical insights I have gained as a heavy equipment engineer and business executive, as well as my scientific man- agement experience, to help Epson rapidly reach the right decisions.

Main contributions to the board
Ms. Matsunaga, who has a track record of creating new business models and considerable insight and experience as an outside director, expresses opinions on outside collabora- tion and human resources strategy.
Diversity for Faster,
More Dynamic Operations
A company that wishes to increase the dynamism and speed of its operations must have internal innovation programs but must also harness the energy produced by using and combining external knowledge and technologies. Epson has developed its own corporate culture and vertically integrated business model. To increase corporate value, Epson must maintain these strengths while also promoting diversity in areas such as values and work arrangements. As an outside director, I will use my own experi- ence to continue to help foster dynamism.
Michihiro Nara
Present at 13 out of 13 board meetings (100%)
Main contributions to the board
Mr. Nara has legal expertise as an attorney and extensive experience and insight as an outside director at multiple companies. He actively speaks out on issues and makes recommendations particularly from a legal perspective.
Further Enhancing Internal Control and Compliance
I will monitor internal control and compliance. One focus will be on overseas operations. Attention to compliance needs to be uniform across global operations, and overseas person- nel need to be reminded of the importance of compliance to improve compliance systems. The second focus will be on aligning the level of compliance awareness between the differ- ent manufacturing and sales organizations. Although appropriate education and training are being provided to achieve this, I feel that a stronger effort will be needed particularly to instill awareness in organization leaders.
Chikami Tsubaki
Present at 13 out of 13 board meetings (100%)
Main contributions to the board
Ms. Tsubaki has finance and accounting expertise as a C.P.A. and extensive experience and insight as an outside director. She actively speaks out on issues and makes recommenda- tions particularly from financial and accounting perspective.
Drawing Attention to Strengths That Cannot Be Expressed by Financial Figures
To increase corporate value, you need to draw the attention of customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders to strengths that do not show up in the financial figures. One way to do this is by developing KPI that visually illustrate strengths in areas such as technology. Publicizing initiatives to develop human capital and strengthen the compliance framework at overseas sites are also effective ways to increase corporate value. As an outside director, I will help Epson earn recognition as an indispensable compa- ny through its high aspirations and passion.
Yoshio Shirai
Present at 13 out of 13 board meetings (100%)
Main contributions to the board
Mr. Shirai has extensive experience and insight as an executive and engineer. He actively speaks out on issues and makes recommendations based on his expertise in global automotive industry and trading company management.
Giving Back and Minimization of Wastes
I will use my experience in manufacturing company and trading company management to help make Epson a genuinely indispensable company by supporting management’s efforts to protect the interests of shareholders and to reduce wastes. To protect the interests of shareholders, a company must be operational- ly sound and give back to its employees, business partners, and community. To reduce wastes, which all manufacturers generate in many forms, I will focus on waste in areas such as investment, quality, and inventory to maximize earnings and efficiency.

           Actions to Ensure Management Transparency
Epson has established a Director Nomination Committee and a Director Compensation Com- mittee as advisory bodies to the board of directors. The purpose of these committees is to ensure the transparency and objectivity of selections for director, executive officer, and special audit & supervisory officer, as well as their compensation. Outside directors com- prise the majority of both committees, which also include the representative director/presi- dent and the director in charge of human resources. Directors who are full-time members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee can attend either meeting as observers.

On September 5, 2018, Seiko Epson announced that it had amended its Corporate Governance Policy and submitted a Corporate Governance Report after verifying compliance with the spirit and content of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, which was revised effective June 1, 2018.
Seiko Epson endorses the Code and implements all its principles.
Key Amendments to the Corporate Governance Policy
Compliance
Basic Principles
At Epson, our Management Philosophy forms the foundation for how we run our business. Our mission is to build stakeholder trust as we grow and prosper with communities and to help create a better world. We seek to do this through business activities that comply with the law, adhere to the highest standards of business ethics, and create value that exceeds customer expectations.
Organization
Seiko Epson transitioned to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. The move was approved by shareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting in June 2016. The composition of the Compliance Committee and the role of the chief compliance officer (CCO) were revised in conjunction with this change.
Under the current system, the Compliance Committee acts as an advisory body to the board of directors. It hears and discusses important matters concerning the company’s compliance program to supervise whether the compliance program is being properly implemented along the executive line, and it reports its findings and offers its opinions to the board of directors. The CCO supervises the execution of all compliance operations and periodically reports the state of compliance affairs to the Compliance Committee. The department that supervises compliance control coordinates and monitors general compliance efforts and takes corrective action where needed.
Instilling Compliance Globally
Epson has established a system of Group-wide beliefs, starting with the Management Philosophy, that serves as a guide to proper conduct. Epson Group companies conduct a variety of group-wide unified activities during Compliance Month, in October.
In addition, we have appointed regional chief compliance officers (R-CCOs) in the Americas, Europe, China, and the Asia-Pacific region. The R-CCOs encourage and assist affiliates in their territories with compliance activities, and put in place compliance systems that are regionally tailored.
Reporting Systems
Epson is committed to maintaining effective reporting systems and has installed internal and external compliance hotlines and other advisory and support services to facilitate the reporting of potential compliance issues. We have also provided reporting channels for use by our business partners, to quickly catch any potential compliance problems that could go undetected internally. The identity of whistleblowers is rigorously protected and reprisals of any type are strictly forbidden.
Counseling and Support Services in Japan
● Epson Helplines
● Harassment counseling
● Counseling related to overwork and long working hours ● Counseling for persons with disabilities
● Insider trading advisory service
● Antitrust (antimonopoly) advisory service
● Corruption (bribery) regulations advisory service ● Employee counseling

Whistleblowing systems have been installed in all Epson Group companies worldwide. The use of these systems is monitored, and usage data are reported to a corporate management body and to Group companies in an effort to increase system effectiveness.

List of Main Risks
Note: The content of the list was excerpted from“Risks related to Epson’s business operations”in Epson’s Annual Report. Please see the Annual Report for additional details.
 Seiko Epson’s board of directors has approved an internal control system policy pursuant to the Companies Act.

1 President
Corporate Strategy Council
General Description of Risk
● A supplier parts shortage or quality problem with supplier parts could interfere with Epson’s manufacturing and selling activities.
● An objection might be raised to, or an application to invalidate might be filed with respect to, an intellectual property right of Epson, and as a result, that right might be recognized as invalid.
● A third party to whom we originally had not granted a license could come to possess a license as a result of a merger with or acquisition by another party, potentially causing us to lose the competitive advantage conferred by that intellectual property.
● New restrictions could be imposed on an Epson business as a result of a buyout or a merger with a third party, and we could be forced to spend money to find a solution to those restrictions.
Main Countermeasures
● Procure parts and materials from multiple suppliers whenever possible.
● Work with suppliers to maintain or improve quality and reduce costs to ensure stable and efficient procurement.
● Independently develop technologies we need; acquire patent, trademark, and other IP rights for them; and license the rights for products and technologies.
● Strengthen our intellectual property portfolio by placing personnel in key positions to manage our IP.
● Take environmental action in line with a mid- range action plan and “Environmental Vision 2050,”a statement of our long-term goals for reducing our environmental impacts. Drive programs to develop and manufacture low-impact products, reduce energy use, recover and recycle end-of-life products, ensure compliance with international substance regulations, and improve environmental management systems.
● Secure talent by providing role-based compensation and actively promoting good people internationally.
● Conduct disaster drills, prepare earthquake disaster management and response plans, and establish business continuity plans to mitigate the effects of disasters to the extent possible.
● Insure against losses arising from earthquakes. (However, the scope of indemnification is limited.)
● Ensure compliance by building a robust compliance framework in each country and business and through internal awareness campaigns.
● Treat compliance as a high management priority, and develop measures to prevent and control potential issues as appropriate.

Actions to Control Serious Risks
Epson treats serious risks that could have serious consequences on the company as follows:

on Epson Group management. These serious Group-wide risks are owned by the appropriate departments in the Seiko Epson Head Office. These departments draft and execute a control plan, monitor the progress of the plan, and evaluate the effectiveness of the control activities.
(2) We identify risks that could have serious adverse effects on business operations. These serious business risks are owned by the chief operating officer of the relevant business. Personnel draft and execute a control plan, monitor the progress of the plan, and evaluate the effectiveness of the control activities under the supervision of the COO.
Crisis Management
Epson has a standing Crisis Management Committee. The committee is chaired by the president. The general administrative manager in charge of risk management serves as vice-chair. The rest of the committee is made up of the
4 The Seiko Epson risk management department monitors overall risk management in the Epson Group, makes corrections and adjustments thereto, and ensures the efficacy of risk management programs.
(3) The handling of serious Group-wide risks and serious business risks is reported to and discussed by the Corporate Strategy Council on a quarterly and half-yearly basis, and we strive to ensure the effectiveness of control plans by revising them as needed. The president of Seiko Epson reports important risk management affairs to the board of directors every quarter.

An environmental problem could arise that would require us to pay damages and/or fines, bear costs for cleanup, or halt production.
New regulations could be enacted that would require major expenditures.
We may be unable to hire and retain talented personnel to develop advanced new technologies and manufacture advanced new products.
Our operating results could be adversely affected by any number of unpredictable events, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics involving new strains of influenza virus, infection by computer viruses, leaks or theft of customer data, reputational damage on social media, failures of mission-critical internal IT systems, cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions, and acts of terrorism or war.
Epson conducts business worldwide and could incur reputational damage, higher costs, or other negative consequences such as large civil fines and constraints on its activities if it were to violate international law, be investigated by authorities, or be subjected to stricter laws or regulations.

We engage in environmentally considerate business activities and strive to reduce the environmental impact of products when used by customers.

As a company developing its operations globally, Sysmex recognizes increasingly serious environmental issues
as a topmost priority. Accordingly, we have formulated long-term environmental objectives in the Sysmex Group Environmental Action Plan (Sysmex Eco-Vision 2020).
For instance, we have established the Vigilance Division to cultivate the sharing of information with the aim of augmenting product quality and safety. This division investigates and analyzes such information from customers, and feeds their analysis results to relevant customers while also sharing them with design, manufacturing and other related functions, so that these findings may be applied to quality improvement and product development.
As part of our environmental consideration related to products and services, we are transitioning from air to marine transport for overseas exports and optimizing package sizes in order to increase container loading efficiency. These efforts have substantially reduced CO2 emissions from distribution. By providing environmentally considerate products, we are helping to reduce the environmental impact of products when used by customers. For our fully automated analyzers of formed elements in urine, launched in 2015, we switched to more environment friendly and safer reagents that eliminate the need for processing waste liquid with neutralizing agents.
We are also mounting global initiatives to reduce environmental impact at business offices, including measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the recycling rate.

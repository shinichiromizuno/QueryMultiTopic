ISEKI Group contributes to the sustainable development of Japanese agriculture through the dissemination and promotion of smart agricul- ture that uses smart agricultural machinery and data. In addition, while on the one hand, Asia accounts for approximately 90% of global rice production, urbanization in Asia is leading to the problem of farm labor shortages. Leveraging the rice-growing technologies developed in Japan, we are contributing to the improvement of productivity through the mechanization of agriculture in Asia by providing agricultural machinery to suit individual countries and regions.

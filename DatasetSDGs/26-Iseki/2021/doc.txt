 Management Philosophy
  <Spirit of ISEKI – Passion of founder –>
“I want to free farmers from exhausting labor”
Agriculture was hard work, done by hand and with the help of animal power. To change this, Kunisaburo Iseki, the founder, realized laborsaving through mechanization and endeavored to further develop agriculture. “We produce good machinery,” Kunisaburo Iseki, the founder, used to say. He devoted himself to providing products that made customers happy. The founder’s passion has been inherited in an unbroken line to this day as “ISEKI’s spirit.”

Invention creation and rights acquisition
Given the significance of patent acquisition to achieve a competitive advantage, the Group engages in intellectual property activities that bring about innovation. Such activities include the creation of core technologies and strategic acquisition of rights to, and use of, inventions and creations, which are intellectual outputs derived from the creation of core technologies.
ISEKI Group is driving forward invention proposal activities based on invention themes considering promising technologies and market trends and needs. We also bring together engineers in charge of various products and carry out invention creation activity by systematically grasping agriculture as a whole to improve the quality and quantity of inventions through horizontal deployment of technology. Taking into account future social environment, technological trends, and feasibility of the business, we examine the invention, and then acquire the property rights only for the highly viable ones to protect our proprietary technology and enhance the competitiveness of product development.
In preparation for the 100th anniversary in 2025, we have set the invention proposals related to advanced technologies such as electrification and smart agriculture (ICT, robots, etc.) as a priority issue. We will increase the ratio of advanced technologies relating proposals to more than 60% of all invention proposals, building a solid intellectual property portfolio of advanced technologies.

  Case Development of “PRJ series,” riding rice transplanter
2.
installed with turning assisting function
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Sanae, a flagship rice transplanter, we have launched PR series and PRJ series of riding rice transplanters. These series are innovative riding rice transplanters equipped with advanced technologies while inheriting the high-level basic performance of the existing models.
In addition to the conventional straight travel function, the new addition of a turning assisting function (Operesta Turn®) enables the rice transplanter to assist not only straight-travel operation while planting but also steering operation while making a turn. This makes it possible for even inexperienced workers to plant with ease and precision, alleviating labor shortages, reducing fatigue from long hours of work, and improving efficiency.
To protect such proprietary inventions, the development, sales, and intellectual property departments work together to strategically acquire intellectual property rights.

As a result, we commercialized “PD6C,” the first plant growth diagnosis device in the industry in 2015.
We will continue to strengthen our collaboration with Ehime University. Through the cutting-edge cultivation technology that integrates information and communication technology (ICT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotization technology, we will dramatically increase the productivity of crops, including safe and secure food, while contributing to promotion of smart agriculture and revitalizing local communities.

strategic partners
AGCO
We collaborate with a global major company, AGCO Corporation, to supply our OEM products to countries around the world. Especially in North America, the compact tractor market is expanding due to stay-at-home special demands and changing lifestyle during the pandemic. We further expand sales of our products in North America by using AGCO’s sales channel.
TAFE
Leveraging the partnership with Tractors and Farm Equipment Limited (TAFE), the second largest agricultural machinery manufacturer in India, we expand the sales network of our products and to form a technological alliance. The rice transplanters launched in India since 2019 have been highly acclaimed, resulting in an increase in the sales in 2020 by approximately ten times from the previous year.
We are working to strengthen the partnership by providing guidance on the machinery maintenance and technical service training to TAFE. Moreover, by provid- ing training on not only machinery but also raising seeding, ISEKI Group spreads farm business and cultivation technologies and knowhow that it has accumulated in Japan to promote synergies with mechanization of agriculture and improve laborsaving and productivity.

In March 2021, ISEKI and Kisarazu City signed the “Partnership Agreement Regard- ing Promotion of Agriculture Utilizing Advanced Technology and Organic Agricul- ture”, to start practical application and verification of smart agriculture and organic agriculture.
Organic farming requires weeding without using pesticides. Therefore, by utilizing smart organic technologies including “water management technology” to remotely control the growth of weeds and “weeding technology” to remove weeds when they occur, we aim to achieve sustainable agricultural development based on ad- vanced production technology, cost reduction and establishment of cultivation method for high-quality crops.

 ISEKI Group helps farm producers to obtain GAP certification as an initiative to provide comprehensive support of farm manage- ment.
 Comments from farm producers

Miyazaki Prefecture is home to a variety of agricultural products such as green peppers and cucumbers. How- ever, in recent years, abandoned and wasteland areas have been increasing due to a lack of farmers. I formed an agricultural corporation in September 2019 by using
abandoned land and local employment. To maintain sta- ble agricultural management and establish safe agricul- tural production system, we started initiatives to obtain JGAP certification with the aid of a JGAP instructor from Iseki Kyushu Co., LTD.
To obtain JGAP certification, we need to manualize the agricultural production process including preparing a production plan and setting a standard for safer crops, while keeping the operation under control to ensure
the work safety of employees. Creating an easy-to-un- derstand manual was difficult, as the employees did
not usually pay attention to how to wash their hands and machines or how to harvest cabbages. However,
by solving each issue toward obtaining certification, we were able to "visualize" the farm management—where and how the crops were produced—, realizing that it enhanced the safety of crops.
Going forward, thorough familiarity with the manual among the employee is encouraged so that they can further improve their work efficiency and use it to plan next year's crops. In addition to providing safe and delicious agricultural products, we are committed to community-based sustainable farm management.

female farmers
About 40% of agricultural workers are women and they play important roles in farming and community activities. To provide further support to the female farmers’ activities, ISEKI Group has participated in NOGYOJOSHI (female farmers) project by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF). We held agricultural machinery handling seminars throughout Japan, created clear manuals for safety use, and worked with female farmers to develop “easy-to-handle” agricultural machinery for everyone.
In 2020, given the difficulty in conducting face-to-face initiatives due to the spread of COVID-19, we began to hold online roundtable discussions on useful topics for agricultural management including GAP, sixth industrialization and soil cultivation.

 About GAP
GAP stands for "Good Agricultural Practice," a method of farm management used by producers to achieve sustainable agriculture. JGAP is a Japanese version of agricultural production process management certified by Japan GAP Foundation. The certification is
granted upon the assessment by a third-party organization, whether the agricultural operation including the management of fertilizers and pesticides or labor safety at the site meets the criteria.
Implementing JGAP is expected to help curb food and agricultural accidents, protect the environment, develop human resources, and improve work efficiency, as well as secure the trust of consumers.

“Toward the next 100 years...”
Shiro Tomiyasu
Representative Director, President & Executive Officer ISEKI & CO., LTD.
To realize its vision “To establish a firm position both in do- mestic and world market” as an integrated manufacturer specializing in agricultural machinery for 2025, the 100th anniversary of its foundation, ISEKI Group in 2016 for- mulated the Mid-term Management Plan as it positioned the first five years as an important step and implemented activities.
However, both the Japan and overseas markets saw dra- matic changes in the business environment from what had originally been envisaged at the beginning of the plan. In Japan’s domestic market, the rush of demand prior to the increase in the consumption tax and the consequent fall afterward, along with natural disasters and other factors, impacted on demand for agricultural machinery. Overseas, growth in the ASEAN and Chinese markets, which we
had positioned as growth engines, continued to plateau. Added to these factors was the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in our business performance in 2020, the final year of the previous Mid-term Manage- ment Plan, falling far short of the plan’s numerical targets.
[ Results during previous Mid-term Management Plan ] Sales trends
The global COVID-19 pandemic was something that could not have been predicted. However, such unpredictability
is always a possibility. ISEKI Group must respond to such situations flexibly and grow in a sustainable manner. To this end, we need to transform into a lean and stream- lined business structure that can constantly generate profit without being affected by the fluctuation in sales. The improvement of profitability through fixed cost reductions and other methods is essential.
On the other hand, initiatives undertaken in line with our basic strategies have achieved a certain level of results. They include increases in maintenance revenue from re- pairs, parts, and the like at our Japanese sales subsidiaries, improvements to the profitability of products that target overseas markets, and the enhancement of the ability of PT. ISEKI INDONESIA to turn a profit. We have now for- mulated a new Mid-term Management Plan, covering the five years from 2021 to 2025, that, as well as continuing to grow the outcomes of the previous Plan, will aim to solve remaining issues.

Continuing to support essential agriculture and landscaping businesses
I would like to extend my sincerest condolences to
the families of all those who have passed away due to COVID-19 and my prayers for the recovery of everyone who has contracted the disease or otherwise suffered as a result of the pandemic. I would also like to pay my profound respects to the healthcare workers and others who have been working strenuously on the frontlines during this crisis.
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on economic activities both in Japan and overseas. In ISE- KI Group’s business environment as well, sales of agricul- tural machinery products in Japan declined as businesses exercised restraint in sales and marketing activities such as trade fairs. Overseas, while there was some special demand for compact tractors from consumers staying at home due to the pandemic in North America, shipments were down in Europe due to the impact of lockdowns and in Thailand due to falls in farming income caused by the COVID-19 situation. Although COVID-19 still remains
in Japan and overseas, the environment surrounding ISEKI Group in 2021 is gradually starting to settle down due to vaccine roll-outs, and we have assumed a moder- ate recovery of social and economic activities in FY2021. Under those circumstances, we will promote “new normal” business styles, which will include innovative sales and marketing activities such as web-based virtu- al demonstrations and small-scale, long-run sales talk events, and new ways of working such as work-from- home and spreading workers out among multiple sites.
There are also growing concerns about food, includ- ing the stable supply of foods and the improvement of food self-sufficiency rates during the pandemic. The importance of agriculture that supports food supply and the landscaping business that supports people’s daily lives is being recognized anew as essential businesses that must not be stopped. In supporting such business- es, ISEKI Group must continue to change and demon- strate its presence into the future.

The aims of ISEKI Group
ISEKI Group has set as its long-term vision for 2030 to be a “solution provider for agriculture and landscape— supporting the farming full of dreams and beautiful land- scapes, creating the sustainable future of agriculture and landscape.”
Farming safeguards food and land and realizes prosper- ity for people and society. It is us, ISEKI Group, that sup- port such farming and farmers, and this long-term vision
is imbued with our intention to continue to be a company that solves issues related to them.
Amid significant changes in the business environment, ISEKI Group will solve social issues, with the knowledge and experience we have cultivated over the years as an in- tegrated manufacturer specializing in agricultural machin- ery at our core. We will drive forward with our Henkaku (Change), in our aim to be a solution provider that creates new value, with our seven promises in our hearts.
Business environment and issues
In the business environment surrounding ISEKI Group, the Japanese agriculture industry is witnessing signif- icant structural changes, such as the decline in the number of farms, the increase in large-scale farming, crop diversification, and transition to smart farming. Overseas, the environment differs from region to region, but the business environment is always changing, with diverse needs and intensifying competition.
There is also a wide range of factors that are common to both Japan and overseas markets, including the impact of COVID-19, global food issues, and climate change risks.
It is with an awareness of this environment that we recognize (1) responses to changing demand and needs, (2) the improvement of financial structure and expansion of profits, (3) strengthening of ESG initiatives, and (4) the realization of technological innovations as business issues, and we will promote a variety of measures that aim to make our long-term vision a reality.

Basic strategies
To help us realize our long-term vision, ISEK Group will follow two basic strategies to solve business issues.
Provision of the best solutions
To respond to changing demand and needs and to technological innovations, we will first analyze growth, needs, and other market factors for each of our major models and, setting medium-term product development themes based on that analysis, put the provision of innovative products and higher quality of services to the customers into practice through the united efforts of development, manufacturing, and sales.
In Japan, we will undertake product development and pursue sales strategies that are in line with the structur- al changes in agriculture, including the accelerating pace of the introduction of large-scale farming and smart agriculture and the conversion to crops other than rice. In particular, the large-scale farming trend is forecast
to progress more and more in coming years, so we will dedicate development and sales resources to this area.
On the service front, we will continue to step up
our ongoing initiatives in the expansion of large-scale servicing locations and education that responds to the needs of large-scale farmers. In addition, we will extend the concept of service to include information. We are now witnessing the beginning of a new style of farming that incorporates digital technologies. It is ISEKI Group’s
role to expand that style of farming. We will evolve our business model through total ICT solutions, such as the development of new sales services and product devel- opment that leverages the data obtained from smart agricultural machinery.
Overseas, we will strengthen our cooperative relation- ships with our strategic partners in each region, partic- ularly North America, Europe, and Asia, and expand our business domains. In North America, we are witnessing a shift from temporary demand prompted by consumers staying at home to changes in lifestyles, and we believe that this market will be stable over the medium to long term. As well as strengthening our relationships with our OEM partner, we will also work to expand our prod- uct range and increase sales. In Europe, where our busi- ness focuses on the landscaping market, ISEKI Group has a long history, and recognition of the ISEKI brand is high. We will continue to pursue product development to meet the market needs, while also seeking to elevate our position in the landscaping market through research and development of electric products. Asia, where rice farming is farmers’ main focus, is the region with the most potential for expansion of the agriculture market. In ASEAN in particular, we will strive to expand sales by rolling out the technology and expertise we have devel- oped in Japan, centered on IST Farm Machinery, which became a consolidated subsidiary at the end of the previous fiscal year.
Enhancement of corporate value by strengthening profits and reinforcing corporate governance
In the area of profitability, one of ISEKI Group’s major challenges, we will strive to make improvements through structural reforms and management efficiency improve- ments. In structural reforms, our basic approaches will be the reorganization of our production system and the selection and concentration of businesses, products,
and resources. In particular, our priority measure will be the construction of optimal production system at our Japanese manufacturing locations. Through this, we will strive to revitalize the Group’s human resources and equipment and enhance productivity. In management efficiency improvements, in addition to the operational aspects we have worked on to date, we will strive for “business-creating Henkaku (Change)” that fundamen- tally re-examines the way we do things at each stage
of design, production, sales, and service. This includes sales that makes use of digital tools, the improvement of investment efficiency through shared design and few-
er models, and making full use of personnel across the entire Group. Through these initiatives, we will achieve our transformation to a lean and streamlined business
[ Basic strategies and directions of initiatives ]
structure that can constantly generate profit without being affected by the fluctuation in sales.
To strengthen governance, ISEKI Group in 2018 estab- lished the Nomination Advisory Committee with Inde- pendent Outside Directors as its main members to make the appointment process of Director candidates trans- parent. In 2020, this committee was reorganized into the Nomination and Compensation Committee to include a function to deliberate and report on Directors’ remuner- ation. Other initiatives we have pursued include imple- menting evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors to further improve its functions. Going forward, we will make efforts toward the further strengthening of our systems in light of the 2021 revision of the Corporate Governance Code. Further, in terms of ESG initiatives,
we have reviewed our materiality (priority issues) in line with the formulation of the new Mid-term Management Plan. We will endeavor to fulfill our social responsibilities through initiatives that embody the essence of ISEKI.
By steadily implementing these basic strategies, we will aim for an operating margin of 5% in 2025 and strive to enhance our corporate value.

Conclusion
This year is the first year of our new Mid-term Manage- ment Plan that will take us up to the 100th anniversary of our foundation. Even as we move toward that mile- stone, we will continue to hold fast to the founding spirit of “freeing farmers from exhausting labor” and our DNA as the front-runner in agricultural machinery. On the other hand, the business environment is chang- ing greatly. To safeguard those things that must not be changed, it is imperative that we undertake Henkaku (Change) that goes above and beyond that ever-chang- ing business environment. In that respect, it is important
that the entire Group unites as one to engage in the new Mid-term Management Plan. We will conduct mea- sures to raise awareness of the Plan, including seminars for employees and training for managers, to ensure that all employees are conscious of Henkaku (Change) as they give certainty to the new Mid-term Management Plan.
ISEKI Group will further advance Henkaku (Change) so as to continue demonstrating its presence in its 100th anniversary in 2025 and beyond and increase its corpo- rate value.

We will firmly identify the risks and opportunities in the external environment and aim for the “provision of the best solutions” and “enhancement of corporate value by strengthening profits and reinforcing corporate governance,” which are the basic strategies of the new Mid-term Management Plan.
ISEKI Group’s SDG objectives
ISEKI Group will contribute to solutions to social issues, including the SDGs, through its business activities as a solution provider for agriculture and landscape.
ISEKI Group contributes to the sustainable development of Japanese agriculture through the dissemination and promotion of smart agricul- ture that uses smart agricultural machinery and data. In addition, while on the one hand, Asia accounts for approximately 90% of global rice production, urbanization in Asia is leading to the problem of farm labor shortages. Leveraging the rice-growing technologies developed in Japan, we are contributing to the improvement of productivity through the mechanization of agriculture in Asia by providing agricultural machinery to suit individual countries and regions.
ISEKI’s landscaping machinery is utilized in landscape improvement, particularly in Europe, such as the development of parks and sports fields, road cleaning, snow clearing, and other ways. We are contributing to the development of pleasant communities by safeguarding Europe’s beautiful landscapes and environments.
Our aim is to realize a recycling-oriented society through business activities that take the environment into consideration. We are pursuing the development and provision of environmentally-friendly design and eco-products with the aim of reducing the environmental burden of our products in each of the stages of development, manufacture, use by customers, and disposal.

 On the production front, when infections started to increase in China’s Wuhan City in late January 2020, the plant of our local affiliated company, Dongfeng Iseki Agricultural Machinery Co., Ltd. was forced to suspend operations, but operations had returned almost to normal by around mid-March.
At our manufacturing sites in Japan, production was affected by temporary delays in the supply of important components, but operations had almost completely recovered to normal levels by around July.
Amid restrictions on movement both in Japan and internationally, our global production base, PT. ISEKI INDONESIA had to rely on remote technical guidance from Japan when launching new products but was able to start production on schedule.
 Remote technical guidance under way
Initiatives on production front
On the sales and service fronts, in Japan, we were forced to refrain from sales and marketing activities, including trade exhibitions. Overseas, while in North America, changing lifestyles prompted by a growing preference for the suburbs contributed to an in- crease in demand for compact tractors, the effect of lockdowns in Europe had a major impact on ISEKI’s business results.
Under these circumstances, ISEKI Group promoted the use of IT to communicate product information and to ensure after-sales support could be provided even with restrictions on face-to-face communica- tion. Initiatives included posting videos and other media on the internet, strengthening communication capabilities on social media and corporate websites, and holding online seminars. We are also working to improve the efficiency of sales and marketing activi- ties, including rolling out new sales support software.
 Initiatives on sales and service fronts
Establishment of a virtual demonstration event website
In addition to holding regular COVID-19 Response Meetings to share the latest information and countermeasures, we have worked on business continuity, including in the supply chain.
Initiatives aimed at ensuring safety
Even now, our efforts to prevent the
spread of COVID-19 both in the company and
beyond continue, placing top priority on ensuring
the safety of our customers, supplies, employees, and their families, and preventing infections. To prevent transmission of the virus, in addition to thorough sanitary measures, we have developed work systems that allow for flexible work styles, including imple- menting work-from-home and staggered attendance and temporarily abolishing core hours in the flextime system. Other initiatives include reducing density in the workplace by spreading operational spaces out, postponing or cancelling group training or switching to online training, and no longer accepting visitors for factory tours.
We will continue to strive for a balance between ensuring safety and security, including through work styles suited to the new normal, and business continu- ity.
Contributions to society
In China’s Hubei Province, disinfection work was under-
taken in all cities in response to the spread of COVID-19 infec-
tions. Around 200 high-clearance multipurpose vehicles manufactured
at Changzhou Factory of Dongfeng Iseki Agricultural Machinery Co., Ltd. were used
in the citywide disinfection of five cities in the province, including Wuhan and Xiangyang, contribut- ing to the prevention of transmission.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought a renewed recognition of the essential nature of agriculture that underpins food supply and landscape improvement that safe- guards people’s lifestyles, and they have become more important
than ever. As a com-
pany that supports
agriculture and land-
scape, ISEKI Group
will aim to realize a
prosperous, sustain-
able society.

 ISEKI Group’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic
As COVID-19 spread all over the world, it dealt a massive blow to society and the economy. In ISEKI Group as well, in addition to sales and production, work styles and other aspects have
also been greatly impacted. Since March 2020, we have held regular COVID-19 Response Meetings, and we have pursued flexible responses to minimize the impact on our business activities, while maintaining the safety of our customers and employees and the prevention of infections as our top priorities. With the sense of uncertainty about the future expected to continue, instead of temporary fixes to this massive social transformation, we will unite as a Group to transform into a corporate structure that will remain flexible and resilient even after the COVID-19 situation has abated.
Business model transformation through the promotion of DX
ISEKI Group will strive for the transformation of its business from “products” to “services” by concentrating efforts on the provision of the best solutions that take advantage not only of products but also information, know-how, and other digital technologies.
Currently, agricultural businesses using data in their farming operations account for only about 20% of the total*1. ISEKI Group is working to solve issues in the agricultural industry through the provision of smart agricultural machinery that leverages ICT and robotics technologies. Going forward, it will also strive for further labor-saving and productivity improvements in agriculture by placing efforts into new services that take advantage of the data obtained from such smart agricultural machinery, as well as the farm business technologies and know-how that we have cultivat- ed over many years.
Specifically, we will roll out the provision of data collected by smart agricultural machinery, based on customers’ needs, includ- ing through open APIs*2. On the sales and services front, “i-Maga- zine,” an IT tool that aids the visibility of information related to sales and marketing activities, including searches for information
such as product inventories, preparation of quotations, viewing of video content, instruction manuals, parts lists, and sales diaries will be introduced at sales subsidiaries all over Japan. This will enable us to provide people on the ground with information that meets customers’ true needs in farm management in real time. It will also lead to work style reform through more efficient sales and mar- keting activities. The tool will also be used in product develop- ment, design, and production. By contributing to the agricultural value chain, which includes a variety of activities and services related to agriculture and food, this will lead to Henkaku (Change) in agriculture and society.

Toward the realization of a decarbonized society
 ISEKI Group practices environmental management based on the positioning of environmental preservation as a business priority for the creation of a sustainable society.
We have long been actively engaged in environmentally-friendly design, including eco-products, and in reducing CO2 emissions in our production activities. On May 1, 2021, we established a new Green Innovation Promotion Office with the aim of accelerating research and development related to the electrification of our products. In the European landscaping market, where there is a high degree of environmental awareness, we plan to launch limited sales of a small- sized electric tractor mower in 2022, with a view to mass production
by 2024. Further, we are currently also considering the use of hydrogen. In February 2021, we joined Japan Hydrogen Association, which promotes the formation of global partnerships and a hydro- gen supply chain in the hydrogen sector. In addition, through solutions that combine our smart agricultural machinery and the farm business technologies and know-how that we have cultivated over many years, we are making sales proposals and providing support for environmentally sound agriculture, including organic agriculture, for the reduction of CO2 emissions in the agricultural industry overall.

To realize a farming industry full of dreams, we will provide the best solutions and create a sustainable future for farming in Japan.
Product strategies
As the structure of the farming industry continues to change, we have rolled out products that meet a variety of needs, from smart agricultural machinery to low-priced models.
Agricultural machinery tailored to large-scale farming
As the scale of farm management continues to grow, ISEKI Group has a product lineup covering from the most advanced models to simple, low-priced models suitable for different crop cultivation methods and farm business scales.
In recent years, demand has been growing for smart con- trolled agricultural machines equipped with automatic steering functions. ISEKI is promoting the commercialization of various types of advanced agricultural machinery, including tractors and rice transplanters.
In rice planting operations in particular, which are being increasingly contracted out, there are great expectations for efficient eight-row rice transplanters and growing require- ments for automatic steering. To meet this need, in 2020, ISEKI launched rice transplanters
Service strategies
In addition to providing agricultural machinery, we will roll out services to solve farm owners’ problems and support challeng- es toward new types of agriculture.

Director & Managing Corporate Officer,
In Japanese farming, support for the agricultural industry is urgently needed to address its many different issues, including the decline in farmers due to aging and shortages of labor to accommodate the growing scale of farms. Efforts toward smart agriculture are also accelerating, prompted by labor shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under these circumstances, ISEKI Group has declared the “provision of best solutions” tailored to our customers’ farm business styles as a basic strategy. Striving to promote and strengthen DX through smart agricultural machinery and data connections, we aim to build a new agricultural value chain, which will include the improvement of yields and quality and the reduction of costs and labor burdens, and make attractive proposals for “Japanese farming equals profitable farming.” We will also work actively toward innovations aimed at expanding environmentally-conscious products for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the farming sector and the expansion of the area of land used for organic agriculture.
On the service front, in our shift from “products” to “services,” from fiscal 2021, we will roll out “i-Magazine,” a digital support tool that allows quick access to the information that customers want, including product inventory and owned machinery searches, i-Next video content, farm business information, and instruction manual and parts list searches. In the same timeframe, we will also roll out “Amoni,” an agricultural platform that will enable co-creation and coordination between large-scale agricultural creators and farming-related manufacturers and start-up companies to address a variety of issues. In such ways, we will strive for the further expansion of solutions.
As it heads toward the next stage, ISEKI will create a sustainable future for Japanese farming together with farmers.
equipped with straight travel/turning assist functions, which allow inexperienced operators
to operate the machine in straight lines and turns as well as a skilled operator. Already, over 60% of our eight-row class models have straight travel/turning assist functions installed.
farming increases, the need for efficiency improvements and laborsaving in agriculture has become greater than ever, and the information that farm owners require has grown increasingly diverse and complex. By sharing
the actual situation on the ground on farms with videos, demonstration reports, and other means via Amoni, we will solve the problems that beset large-scale farming together and support the establishment of a new kind of agricultural management tailored to the changing environment.

Products for vegetable farming market
Despite the recent expansion of Japan’s vegetable farming market, many of Japan’s vegetable production systems still rely on manual labor. Needs exist for the commercialization of integrated systems for automating vegetable farming to make the work easier and promote laborsaving.
In the area of vegetable harvesting, where mechanization
has been particularly slow, ISEKI has commercialized harvesting equipment for many different vegetables, starting with the VHC18 carrot harvester in 1998. Our line-up now includes harvesters for ginger, cabbage, and Japanese
radish.
By continuing to develop a full product range to meet the diverse needs of vegetable farming, we
will support expansion of scale and improvement of efficiency in the vegetable market, where demand is expected to grow.

As a “solution provider for agriculture and landscape,” we will strive to further expand our overseas business, to help solve global issues.
North America strategy
In North America, ISEKI supplies major global company, AGCO, with compact tractors of PTO horsepower less than 40 and utility tractors of horsepower less than 100 under an OEM contract. These products are being used by a wide range of users.
In the North American market, as people have been spend- ing more time at their homes in the suburbs during the COVID-19 pandemic, changes are also being seen in their lifestyles. With this trend, demand for compact tractors target- ing private users has increased, and there is growing demand for lower prices and greater ease of use. ISEKI helps consumers to enrich their lives with the kind of quality only we can offer, including human-friendly design based on ergonomics, and we have increased sales of compact tractors in particular.
Going forward, we will further deepen our partnership with AGCO to launch onto the
market in a timely manner

Asia strategy
In the ASEAN region, the ratio of capital contribution in IST Farm Ma- chinery, the company established in Thailand in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation in 2013, was changed at the end of 2020, and IST became a consolidated subsidiary of ISEKI. In addition, through streamlining and function integration efforts with ISEKI (Thailand) Co., Ltd., our controlling base for parts and service in the region, we will aim to expand our sales and service into countries neighboring ASEAN, with IST playing a central role. The conditions under which farming machinery is used in this region are very harsh, requiring products that are highly durable and low-cost. ISEKI has launched tractors that are low in cost due to production in Indonesia and that also offer improved durability and workability, through which we are supporting mechanization in the region. In India, we have collaborat- ed with our strategic partner, TAFE, to sell rice transplanters, which are proving popular locally.
Like Japan, the East Asia is beset with social issues such as a short- age of farm workers and aging of the farming population, leading to increased needs for advanced technologies and large-scale agricultur- al machinery. ISEKI has introduced the kind of large-sized, high-per- formance rice-farming equipment that is in active use in Japan mainly into the Taiwan, South Korea, and China markets, contributing to labor-saving and higher efficiency in farming operations.
     Kazuya Tani
Director & Corporate Officer General Division Manager, Overseas Business Division
As the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our living environments in direct or indirect ways, the activities of ISEKI Group continue to contribute strongly in the various regions to the creation of a sustainable society as an essential business.
The North American small-sized tractor market expanded to its greatest size ever due to demand prompted by the stay-at-home trend during the pandemic. We believe that there will continue to be more opportunities for ISEKI’s products to help people to improve their quality of life through the land, such as enjoying gardening and hobby farming at their homes in the suburbs.
In the European market, the high quality of ISEKI products and our strong track record have made ISEKI a widely known brand. In the individual European countries, which are more advanced in their environmental responses, a green recovery, that is economic recovery through the creation of environment-related businesses, is being considered. Going forward, we will contribute further to environment-related businesses, including with the electrifica- tion of our products. Further, amid the various changes in the environment, mechanization of agriculture to secure food supplies remains a challenge in many countries. In Asia, in particu- lar, there are many regions where rice farming is the predominant crop, and demand for agricultural machinery, which has evolved in Japan, is rising sharply. ISEKI integrated its Thai locations last year and now aims to expand our business further.
In the new Mid-term Management Plan, ISEKI declared itself a “solution provider for agriculture and landscape.” We will further expand our overseas business beyond our past status as a well-loved Japanese agricultural machinery manufacturer to a corporate group that provides solutions needed in various parts of the world.

In Europe, ISEKI offers tractors, riding mowers, and other ma- chinery for landscaping, such as mowing lawns in parks, road cleaning, and snow clearing. Our products are contributing to the preservation of the beautiful landscape in Europe and to the prevention of epidemics. In Europe, where environmental awareness is higher than anywhere else in the world, exhaust regulations (EU Stage V) that are even stricter than the current regulations will come into full force from 2022. With ISEKI’s SF5 series of riding mowers, we have realized a reduction of environmental burden through the installation of EU Stage V-compliant engines, and we have also taken low-noise oper- ations and ease of use into consideration. These features have made the series popular among professional customers such as landscape developers.
In Europe, the European Green Deal, which aims to achieve
a balance between decarbonization and economic growth by 2050, is being heralded, and the need for more environmental- ly-friendly products is predicted to expand. Many countries have also declared that they will prohibit the sale of new gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2030, and it is possible that agricul- tural machinery that travels on public roads will also be subject to the same level of restrictions. To meet these daily changing needs, ISEKI is currently progressing research and development of small-sized electric tractor mowers with the aim of mass pro- duction by 2024.
In addition to the strengthening of service and sales capabil- ities by rebuilding our existing sales networks, we will continue to provide products that meet customers’ expectations. In this way, we will raise the profile of the ISEKI brand in the landscap- ing market.

Even as the market environment seems to be changing by the minute, we continue to carry on our founder’s passion of “freeing farmers from exhausting labor.” Our development and production divisions are working as one to develop products that respond to social changes. We are further strengthening our line-up of smart agricultural machinery that address problems in the agricultural industry, including the shortage of farmers caused by the shrinking and aging of the farming population in Japan and the consequent expansion of scale of farming, contributing to ultra-laborsaving, high-profit agriculture, as well as low- priced products for small-scale farms, and products that meet the needs of field crops and vegetable farming markets. Overseas, we will aim to strengthen our competitiveness and expand our brand through the development of products that meet the respective needs of the North American, European, and Asian regions.
In our production systems, we will pursue structural reforms through the construction of optimal production systems that make effective use of the management resources of our Japanese and overseas production bases. We will also review in-house/external production categories, in our efforts to further strengthen our business structure for the enhancement of profitability and quality. Viewing the changes in the environment surrounding society as opportunities, we will continue to place efforts into farm work safety measures, with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We will also actively engage, from both development and production angles, in initiatives such as the development of high-end automated and robotic products, the roll-out of global strategic machines that meet the diverse needs of individual regions, electrification of products aimed at the realization of a decarbonized society, which has become a pressing issue, and the deliberation of use of new energies.

Financial and capital strategies
 Reflections on previous Mid-term Management Plan
The targets in the previous Mid-term Management Plan were 190 billion yen in net sales, 9 billion yen in operating income, and ROE of 8% or more in FY2020. However, in addition to significant changes in the business environment compared with our initial assumptions, impairment losses in non-current assets were recorded due to a decline in profitability of our manufacturing subsidiaries, resulting in us falling far short of those targets.
On the financial front, despite the progression of inventory reductions due to production adjustments made in 2020 and contraction of property, plant and equipment accompanying the recording of impairment losses in non-current assets, the cash conversion cycle (CCC) and D/E ratio have remained at high levels, and we believe that improvement of the financial structure is needed.
Financial strategy directions in the new Mid-term Management Plan
In the new Mid-term Management Plan, whose target year is 2025, the 100th anniversary of ISEKI’s foundation, we will adopt a financial strategy that emphasizes improvement of the financial structure. In addition to our basic strategy of improvement of profitability through structural reforms and management efficiency improvements, we will aim to create operating cash flow of 60 billion yen cumulative over the next five years by improving asset efficiency. We will also strive to trim down our property, plant and equipment and reduce interest-bearing liabilities, with the aim of achieving ROE of 8% by 2025, the final year of the new Mid-term Management Plan.
Initiatives aimed at improvement of financial structure
Creation of operating cash flow
To implement measures aimed at the realization of our long-term vision for 2030, we believe it is necessary to secure capital for re-investment through initiatives to improve the financial structure that underpins our business and maximize operating cash flow.
For the maximization of operating cash flow, we will work on inventory reduction that will lead to the shortening of the CCC. In addition to raising inventory operational efficiency through improvements to the distribution system for products manufactured in Japan, we will pursue inventory reductions by optimizing domestic production systems, to enhance our capacity to make production responses to sales situations that change on a daily basis, and by optimizing the balance between sales and production.
Selection and concentration in capital investment, improvement of equipment efficiency
In the new Mid-term Management Plan, in addition to investments in sales bases and production equipment, we have planned investments, including into IT, that will lead to greater management efficiency. However, improvement of the financial structure will require trimming down property, plant and equipment, and the total amount of capital investment has been set to within the range of depreciation. As well as concentrating on investments in priority domains with decisions that based thoroughly on capital cost perspectives, we will make effective use of production equipment within the Group through the optimization of domestic production systems, and trim down property, plant and equipment.
Contraction of interest-bearing liabilities
From 2016 to 2020, the period of the previous Mid-term Management Plan, interest-bearing liabilities trended around 70 billion yen, with a D/E ratio of around 1.0. In the new Mid-term Management Plan, we will pursue the contraction of interest- bearing liabilities with the aim of improving the financial structure.
Free cash flow (FCF) created from the maximization of operating cash flow and the contraction of property, plant and equipment will be used to fund the reduction of consolidated interest-bearing liabilities, and we have set a goal of lowering the D/E ratio to 0.8 in 2025.
To enable the company to respond flexibly to future uncertainties in the environment, including the COVID-19 pandemic, ISEKI has concluded commitment line contracts totaling 20 billion yen with our major banks of account, thus ensuring ample fluidity and stability of the funds needed for the operation of our business.
Strengthening of business administration systems
To achieve our management goals while responding to a management environment that is changing on a daily basis, we believe that the strengthening of our business administration systems is needed. We had introduced an in-house company system which will evaluate businesses such as tractors, combine harvesters, and rice transplanters by the three functions of development and manufacturing, domestic business, and overseas business. Through this approach, we will pursue the further visualization of our consolidated business management. Further, we will work to strengthen our business administration systems by speeding up business management with the revamping of the financial accounting system, which is currently in progress, and the introduction of a new administrative accounting system.
Shareholder return policy
ISEKI considers stable dividend payments to shareholders to be a key policy of the company. As a premise of ongoing business activities, we have adopted a basic policy of continuing stable dividend payments, after taking into comprehensive consideration factors such as the profit foundations, future business developments, and changes in the management environment, while aiming to maintain and improve financial soundness.
Regarding dividends for FY2020, in light of the major impact of impairment losses on business performance and the recording of a net loss for the fiscal year, we considered the strengthening of the financial structure to be our top priority. As such, we sincerely regretted to advise that a year-end dividend was not issued for FY2020. The entire company will engage in the structural reforms and management efficiency improvements that will enable us to resume stable shareholder returns at an early stage.
Conclusion
To contribute to the realization of a prosperous and sustainable society by providing innovative products and higher quality of services to the customers, which is our corporate philosophy, we will improve the financial structure, build firm financial foundations, and support sustainable growth and the enhancement of corporate value.

Sustainability in ISEKI Group
Basic Policy Fundamental concept
● ISEKI Group believes that, in order to achieve sustained growth and improve corporate value over the medium to long term, solving social issues through business activities unique to ISEKI and making its presence felt would result in development of the relationships of trust with its stakeholders and lead to mitigation and prevention of risks.
● The Group identifies and promotes priority issues so as to respond to requests and expectations of the society and fulfill its corporate social responsibility (CSR) to contribute to development of sustainable society.
System for promotion of sustainability
ISEKI Group promotes sustainability activities with the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee put in place for discussing CSR-related matters. The committee is chaired by the director in charge of the Corporate Planning Department, which promotes CSR activities, and is comprised of the members of the Directors’ Operation Committee for deliberation and the department heads of CSR-promotion departments for promotion, and the committee meets twice a year.
The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee deliberates matters including the vision and strategy regarding sustainable management, review of priority issues addressed by ISEKI Group, and initiatives to promote CSR and manages the progress of these matters, while practicing management activities based on the PDCA cycle. Upon deliberation, the committee submits important matters to the Directors’ Operation Committee and the Board of Directors for their decision. Departments in charge manage implementation and progress of CSR activities, report them to the management at relevant meetings, and evaluate them.

 To spread sustainability
To penetrate sustainability throughout ISEKI Group, the senior managements continue to send messages to employees while awareness activities through internal newsletters and study sessions are conducted. We focus on sharing the Group’s vision and philosophy with especially the young and middle-career employees. We will also strengthen the penetration of the concept to employees at sales and manufacturing departments so that each employee will be aware of sustainability in their daily work and get to their actions.
We held on-line SDGs study sessions and workshops for the wide range of employees including the young and mid-career employees as well as some managers, to deepen their understanding
of how the businesses of ISEKI Group and SDGs are
related to. In addition to learning about the global
landscape and social issues, the participants engaged in active discussions on "what ISEKI Group can do to achieve the SDGs" in the group work activities. According to the survey conducted after the sessions, 90% of participants answered that they had a "good understanding or understanding" of the nature and concept of the SDGs, and the average level of understanding of the SDGs (on
a 10-point scale) increased by 3 points compared to the prior study session.

I want to be more aware of the impact of my actions, choices, and work on society and the SDGs. The backcasting approach made me realize how important it is to spend my days to achieve the goals.
I want to enrich our society and people’s lives through the products and services of ISEKI, and then extend the affluence through the future.

Stakeholder engagement
Basic Policy Fundamental concept
  ● ISEKI Group strives to build strong relationships of trust with stakeholders by engaging in responsible dialogue with them including direct interaction by the company’s executives.
● In terms of information disclosure, we are committed to “disclose information properly to fulfill social accountability” and “promptly disclose accurate information required from inside or outside of the Group in recognition of the importance of social accountability and thereby endeavor to become a company with transparency.”
● To win fair evaluation from all our stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, customers, suppliers, local communities, and employees, and to ensure management transparency, we strive for fair, equitable, timely, and appropriate disclosure of management-related information keeping with the purpose and meaning of fair disclosure rules.

In order to improve the dialogue, the person in charge of IR collaborates with the department in charge of the specific theme and works on preparation of disclosure materials, sharing of information, etc. on a company-wide scale, in addition to collaborating and sharing information with the various departments at the Public Relations Liaison Committee held once every month. ISEKI Group has also set up pages dedicated to shareholders and investors on its website and provides disclosure information such as its management policy and performance in an easy-to-understand manner. The opinions, etc. obtained through the dialogue are fed back to the Directors, management executives, and related departments by way of reporting to meeting bodies, etc. for the purpose of information sharing.

ISEKI Group has built an environment where it is made easier for shareholders to attend general shareholders’ meetings and conducts the meeting in a shareholder-focused manner.
The convocation notice for the general shareholders’ meetings are sent by mail three weeks prior to the meeting date and the details are posted on the website before the convocation notices are sent. Moreover, in order to improve the convenience for voting, electronic exercise of voting rights over the Internet is made available in addition to voting by mail.
Further, the Group visualizes its business reports, posts topics, and introduces its initiatives with the aim of deepening the understanding of ISEKI as much as possible. In addition, by putting shareholders safety first during the spread of COVID-19, the 97th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders was streamed via video.

Akio Kikuchi
Representative Director, Chairman & Executive Officer
To further improve standards of corporate governance, we have launched various initiatives based on our Corporate Governance Code. Regarding nomination and compensation of officers, we have enforced transparency and objectivity through the establishment of the Nomination and Compensation Committee chiefly comprising of Independent Outside Directors. In March this year, we also increased the number of Outside Directors to three to make the Board of Directors be filled with a keener sense of tension. We will further review the composition of the Board of Directors including the promotion of diversity.
With the belief that the role of the Chairperson is to lead discussion for effective and efficient operation of the Board of Directors, I have taken measures for well-balanced proceedings, such as allocating time for discussion of each proposal in advance, and prompting comments of participants as necessary. Also, I have worked on circulating a list which summarizes the content of discussion at the Directors’ Operation Committee meetings to participants of the Board of Directors meetings. This enables the discussion process at the execution side to be smoothly shared with the supervision side.
The new Mid-term Management Plan is a foothold for the next centennial, and the achievement of the plan by any means is the
issue toward our sustainable growth. I believe that transformation to a lean and streamlined business structure which can constantly
generate profit without being affected by the fluctuation in sales is most important. The attitude to candidly address any challenges is our strength, we could not fully manage changes in market environment and deliver results in the previous Mid-term Management Plan. We will once again promote Henkaku (Change) in the entire Group.
My role is to promote sustainable growth and improve corporate value over
the medium to long term.
Atsushi Iwasaki
Independent Outside Director
ISEKI has implemented evaluation by a third party organization on the efficiency of the Board of Directors, and I have the same view as the result of the evaluation which appreciates improvement initiatives such as discussion on the new Mid-term Management Plan. However, from the standpoint of an Outside Director, I recognize lots of areas for improvement regarding the operation of the Board of Directors and the way it should be. I will continue to express my opinion on these matters at the Board of Directors meetings and other occasions.
The Nomination and Compensation Committee was established in March 2020 as an independent consultative body chiefly comprising of Independent Outside Directors. In order to fulfil the responsibility required as a listed company in our Corporate Governance Code, I believe that the role of the Chairperson is to work on issues with a sense of speed, such as revision of Directors’ compensation system, formulation of succession planning, and promotion of active participation of female employees.
I believe that the most important issue for our sustainable
growth is to establish Henkaku (Change), the keyword of
the new Mid-term Management Plan in the organization.
The environment surrounding the company is drastically changing, and we cannot materialize sustainable growth without breaking through the conventional ways of thinking. Fundamental change in corporate culture is essential to celebrate the 100th anniversary in 2025 and lay the groundwork toward the next centennial.

The Risk Management Control Committee under the Directors’ Operation Committee periodically identifies and evaluates risks, reevaluates magnitude of damage and frequency of occurrence, and examines countermeasures, in accordance with the risk management regulations to minimize the risk of causing damage or disadvantage to ISEKI Group under the supervision of Corporate Planning Department.

Compliance
Basic Policy Fundamental concept
In order to raise compliance-focused management to a higher level, ISEKI Group works to make the importance of compliance thor- oughly understood and enforced by each and every employee with the aim of raising compliance awareness.
ESG
   Compliance system
To prevent misconduct and scandals from occurring by ensuring thorough compliance and raising awareness among each of the Group members, the Group has built a compliance team struc- ture organized cross-functionally under the leadership of the Director in charge of compliance. The Personnel Department handles overall management of compliance activities across
the whole ISEKI Group, and the supervising unit of individual departments handles overall management of compliance edu- cation and awareness activities at the departments.
The progress is reported to all Directors and Corporate
Auditors at the Management Supervisory Committee meetings held every month. Internal Audit Department audits the state of compliance and reports the results to the Management Supervisory Committee for discussion. Any material incident occurred or discovered is reported to the Management Super- visory Committee and Corporate Auditors without delay. To im- prove the independence of internal audits, the Internal Control & Audit Department was reorganized into the Internal Audit Department in September 2020, and the Internal Audit Depart- ment performs internal audits thereafter.
Examples of initiatives undertaken
ISEKI Group is implementing various group-wide education and awareness-raising activities to ensure compliance.
ISEKI Group provides compliance training to all newly-hired employees across the Group every year. Although some training sessions were provided on a remote basis due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020, we are working on awareness-building among employees that compliance means not only compliance with laws and regulations but also behaving in compliance with ISEKI Group’s management philosophy.
In response to the enforcement of the so-called Anti-Power Harassment Law in June 2020, we provided harassment training to all officers and managers across ISEKI Group in June the same year. The Group has also set up a harassment help desk at each group company to put in place a system to provide consultation across the Group.

 Establishment of whistle-blower system (Ethical Hotline)
ISEKI Group has set up a group-wide whistle-blower system (Ethical Hotline) for the use of all employees, retirees and suppliers. The aim is to establish an open corporate culture and enable pre-emptive detection of problems within the company. In the system, telephones, e-mail, and other communication methods may be used for report or consultation in the event of detection of conduct in violation of laws and regulations, the company’s Code of Ethical Behavior or the company regulations on employment, or other rules. To protect the human rights of whistle-blowers and keep them anonymous, as well as to make the system readily accessible, the Group has set up contact desks both internally and outside the company.
In FY2020, the system handled six cases of consultation and whistle-blower reports.
Initiatives for fair trade
ISEKI Group formulated the “Code of Ethical Behavior” as a basic policy to prevent any form of corruption, such as bribery, and is ensuring group-wide compliance with the code. In light of experience of receiving a cease and desist order under the Anti-Monopoly Act in relation to facility construction, the Group formulated conduct guidelines and compliance manual focused on the Anti-Monopoly Act in 2015 to inculcate the awareness of compliance across the Group. In addition to the conventional whistle-blower system, we have set up a help desk for consultation on the Anti-Monopoly Act to enhance the prevention of legal violation.
Initiatives undertaken by overseas group companies
With the expansion and diversification of its overseas business, ISEKI Group has been working to build and improve compliance systems at overseas group companies. Further, we will strive to strengthen internal controls of overseas group companies.

Activities for enlightenment
<Activities for penetration and education on compliance>
Ensuring of thorough understanding of the “ISEKI Group Code of Ethical Behavior”
The company has distributed the “ISEKI Group Code of Ethical Behavior” to all employees of the Group and works to ensure a thorough understanding of this pamphlet, so as to ensure that business activities meet corporate ethical requirements.
Awareness-raising by issuing “Compliance News”
As a means to provide information regarding compliance, the company issues the quarterly “Compliance News” bulletin to raise compliance awareness among employees. With a focus on priority compliance initiatives, it contains information such as messages from the management team and examples of practi- cal measures undertaken by employees.
<Training activities>
The company carries out a wide range of education and training programs concerning compliance themes in the day-to-day conduct of business affairs, especially on points warranting special attention.
Incorporation into company-wide events and educational training programs
• Sales subsidiary president meetings • manager meetings
• executive training
• newly-appointed manager training • newly-hired employee training
Individual training programs
• Sales subsidiary employee meetings of sales departments
• facility personnel training of facility departments
• specialized employee training of development departments
The Personal Information Handling Regulations is formulated and internal systems concerning the management of personal information are maintained. ISEKI Group works to appropriately protect personal information by carrying out activities for even further awareness and education on such protection for employees. Further, we will work to strengthen protection of personal information both in Japan and abroad.
Information security
ISEKI Group has striven for the maintenance and management of information security by establishing regulations for the handling of electronic information and setting up the “Electronic Information Security Management Committee” led by an officer in charge of the information system division.

Improvement of customer satisfaction and quality assurance
Basic Policy
ISEKI Group provides products and services that satisfy customers through activities to improve customer satisfaction.
ESG
Product quality assurance
Basic Policy
ISEKI Group works to provide consistent product quality assurance from product planning to sales and after-sales service while reflecting the opinions from the market in product development and improvement so as to offer products developed from the customers’ perspective in a timely manner.
The Group takes all possible measures for quality control and makes prompt responses in good faith should any quality related issues arise.
Product development and consistent quality assur-
ance system that reflect the voice of customers
ISEKI Group carries out consistent quality assurance activities by reviewing the design in every step from product planning and development design to manufacturing, sales, and services with the aim of providing products that are safe and respond to the trust placed by the customers.
In product development, ISEKI Group grasps the requirement details based on the voice of customers (opinions, requests, and emerging needs) and utilizes that in “planning quality” and elaborates on functions in “design quality,” ultimately reflect- ing that in “product quality.” In each step, the Group carries out evaluation and verification of quality optimization from various aspects, including planning, development and manu- facturing. ISEKI Group also gathers customer opinions through service activities to provide instructions on test operations upon delivery and inquire on the conditions of the delivered products and has built a mechanism that feeds back those opinions for development and improvement, reflecting those in developing safe, high-quality products.
Responses to quality defects
When an issue occurs in products requiring improvement mea- sures, ISEKI promptly performs inspections and repairs of the products giving the utmost priority to customers’ safety.
When we launch a recall, we notify and report to the con- cerned authorities*1 and disclose the information on the web- site of ISEKI & CO., LTD. to draw attention of customers and provide them information.
We share information on quality deficiencies internally in order to prevent the recurrence of the same deficiency.
Responses to and utilization of inquiries from cus-
tomers
Inquiries, opinions, comments and complaints from customers, such as on products, are accepted by phone and on the web- site, and the department in charge strives to respond to them promptly in a sincere manner (target of within one day). The valuable opinions from customers are fed back to the compa- ny’s executives and concerned departments and are actively used for better product development, sales, and service activi- ties to increase customer satisfaction.
Further, for matters that receive a large number of inquiries, ISEKI Group works to disclose sufficient information on its web- site so that customers can solve the issues on their own.
Strengthening of quality control
As part of “Monozukuri (making of things) Innovation” set
out in the Mid-term Management Plan to increase the Group’s competitiveness, ISEKI Group repositioned the “Quality Control Department,” which controls overall product quality, above the “Development & Production Division” to strengthen the quality control system in January 2021. The Group holds a CS Enhance- ment Committee meeting, participated by officers in charge
of product development and sales activities, once a month to ensure security and safety in product development.
Feedback of voices of customers (opinions, requests, and emerging needs)
To ensure customers’ safety in farm work, ISEKI works to devel- op products with enhanced security and safety features. One of the challenges faced to ensure the safety of farm work using tractors is to prevent accidents caused by erroneous operations due to single-sided braking. To address this challenge, ISEKI released a “single-sided braking alarm device” for small-sized tractors* in June 2020. In order to prevent accidents and ensure secure and safe use, the device sets off a sound alarm to warn
the driver that the brake pedals are not locked together when he/she operates the accelerator pedal without interlocking the right and left brake pedals. We also ran a campaign to promote the installation of the alarm device so as to build awareness among more customers.
*Models equipped with the alarm device: TQ13/15/17, TM150/170, 16/18, 165/185, TC11/13
Product development in consideration of the needs of customers and society
  Strong relationship building with customers through sales and services
 We believe that increasing the brand value of ISEKI Group and building trust with customers are keys for us to continue to
be chosen by customers. In selling and service activities, ISEKI Group is striving to build stronger relationships with customers
Awareness-raising activities for safer use
through sales activities for the sake of customers, such as by implementing the “Sales Administrative Rules,” which set out rules for adequate provision of information on and fair transac- tions of products and services, at its sales companies in Japan.

To ensure secure and safe use of purchased products, ISEKI Group provides a pre-delivery inspection using a checklist and usage instructions on test operations. The Group is also working to provide after-sales support to ensure safe and efficient farm work through efforts, such as calling on users to check the operations and per- form pre- and post-season inspections. Further, ISEKI Group holds seminars on how to handle agricultural machinery for female farmers as part of the “NOGYOJOSHI (female farmer) Project” sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fish- eries, in addition to providing safety training at sales companies throughout Japan. The Group is also focusing its efforts on human resource development of service staff both in Japan and abroad in order to provide high-quality and prompt services.

However, to execute our business strategies, we will strive to optimize the allocation of human resources across the Group beyond the boundaries of companies going forward. Further, the Group will also direct its efforts toward the securement and development of human resources to exe- cute its business strategies, such as cutting edge technologies and global talent.
In order to drive forward with these initiatives, the Group has decided to introduce the talent management system to effec- tively assess and manage experience, competence and skills of employees.
Employment of people with disabilities
Irrespective of having or not having disabilities, ISEKI aims to create a workplace where different kinds of people can fulfill their potential. The ratio of employees with disabilities in FY2019 was lower than the statutory employment rate. We are determined to work towards creation of job opportunities for them.
Employment of foreign nationals
ISEKI Group works on continuous employment of foreign nationals, which is indispensable for its global business expansion. Employees from various nationalities are working in a wide range of fields including development, production, and sales.
Employment of senior citizens
ISEKI actively promotes participation by senior citizens. It has introduced a reemployment system for all employees as a rule who wish to continue working after their retirement age of 60 till 65 years old in anticipation that it would enable handing over of their experiences, skills, and knowledge.
The Group is also looking into securing employment opportunities for employees after age 65, which is required by the Amended Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons.
Mid-career employment
In order for ISEKI Group to grow, it is necessary to have ideas and innovations generated by having expertise in various fields and diverse senses of value.

Creation of employee-friendly workplaces
ISEKI Group is striving to create employee-friendly workplaces through various efforts.
To realize diverse work styles, the Group introduced the geographically confined employment system in 2020, in addition to implementing the flextime system, no overtime day and other such measures. The Group set up the Operational Efficiency Improvement Project headed by the Chairman of the company in 2018 to realize the work style reform, and is working to improve productivity and reduce working hours by improving operational efficiency. In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the Group has actively been utilizing remote meetings more than ever, and adopting new work styles, including working from home and split ship at some offices. On this occasion, we will look into institutionalizing such ways of working taking into account their effectiveness.
The Group is also working on promoting enhancement of employees’ work-life balance so that they can spend fulfilling days not only at work but also in their private lives. As part of the effort, the Group is strengthening the systems for balanc- ing work and child rearing and promoting utilization of annual paid leaves through a planned leave system. In order to encour- age male employees to take child care leave, ISEKI attaches a document encouraging the employee to take child care leave when it gives congratulatory money upon child birth. In 2020, six male employees took child care leave.
Utilization of paid leaves
Along with promoting improvement in operational efficiency, ISEKI Group is encouraging employees to utilize annual paid leave. As a result, the number of days of paid leave taken by employees is increasing in recent years.

Toward our “Henkaku (Change)”
To realize ISEKI Group’s vision “To be Solution Provide for ‘Agriculture and Landscape’,” it is essential
for each and every employee to demonstrate his/her strength to maximize the Group’s capabilities. To this end, ISEKI Group is working on various initiatives to instill and share common value and
ideals that translate into the mindset and behavior of employees.
When announcing the new Mid-term Management Plan in February 2021, the President gave employees an online briefing on the concept of the Mid-term Management Plan and strategies. Each and every employee is required to understand the message implied in the keyword “Henkaku (Change) - Toward the next 100 years...” and figure out what they need to change by themselves by interpreting “...” as “their Henkaku (Change),” thereby working on it on their own initiatives.

ESG Message from the officer in charge of the environment
Mid- to long-term environmental targets
ISEKI Group has set mid- to long-term environmental targets to promote environmental management. In order to realize a carbon-free society, the Group is looking into setting higher targets.
We strive to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.
ISEKI Group has designated environmental protection that would enable the creation of a sustainable society as one of the business priorities, and practices environmental manage- ment by setting the Environmental Policy.
To practice environmental management across the Group, we have introduced the envi- ronmental management system (EMS) at our manufacturing bases and non-manufacturing bases, such as sales companies, both in Japan and abroad and built a structure to promote it, headed by the Directors’ Operation Committee chaired by the President.
ISEKI Group has set mid- to long-term targets to practice activities to reduce environmen- tal burdens and environmental risks of the entire business activities, such as optimizing the use of resources and energy.
Further, the Group is working on product development that contributes to environmental protection from various different approaches, such as energy saving, exhaust gas purifica- tion feature, and technique to optimize the amount of fertilizer using a cutting edge tech- nology, by promoting environmentally-friendly design and operating the eco-product certification system.
In order to realize a carbon-free society, we will further energize the initiatives aimed at achieving the mid- to long-term environmental targets and aim to create a sustainable society.

  Response to climate change E Climate change governance
ISEKI Group has designated responses to climate change as one of its priority issues, and works on environmental management. Corporate Social Responsibility Committee supervises and manages climate change-related risks and opportunities. The committee is comprised of the members of the Directors’ Oper- ation Committee for deliberation and discusses and evaluates
S G
issues. Meanwhile, important matters are deliberated and decided by the Board of Directors and the Directors’ Operation Committee. CSR Corporate Social Responsibility Committee meets twice a year and makes reports to the Board of Directors to ensure proper supervision by the Board of Directors
(see p. 35 for details of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee).
Initiatives for environmentally-friendly design E S G
ISEKI Group promotes environmentally-friendly design in the entire product development process with the aim of reducing the environmental burden in each of the stages of development, manufacture, use by customers, and disposal, and strives to offer environmentally-friendly products.
 Eco-product certification system
Eco-product certification system is an in-house system that certifies products with high environmental conformance that meet ISEKI-original evaluation criteria. Certified products are granted environmental labels, which are conveyed to customers through product catalogs and user manuals in an easily noticeable format. Further, the environmental label conforms to Type II stipulated under ISO14021 (self-declared type that does not need third-party certification).
Eco-product certification trend
Example of environmental label
  Major risks and opportunities brought by climate change
 In order to realize a carbon-free society, ISEKI Group is working to offer environmentally-conscious products and solutions, while striving to reduce CO2 emissions from business activities so as to reduce environmental burdens. Meeting bodies that discuss future directions of product planning, development themes and other issues, such as the Product Development Strategy Committee and the Advanced Technology Strategic Committee, identify and evaluate opportunities for climate
change-related products and solutions and incorporate their results in development planning with the approvals of the Directors’ Operation Committee and the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Control Committee is responsible for, among other things, identification, assessment and progress management of risks. We will work on scenario analysis going forward
(see p. 43 for details of the Risk Management Control Committee).

Indicators and targets
ISEKI Group consistently manages and discloses the achievement of greenhouse gas emissions by Scope as a climate-related indicator. For Scopes 1 and 2, the Group has set reduction targets of 26% to be achieved by 2030 based on the results in 2013, and manages the progress. Meanwhile, for Scope 3, emissions from customer use of products sold by Category 11 account for 60% or more. In addition to offering eco-products that meet ISEKI-original evaluation criteria, the Group will work to upgrade products such as by promoting electrification and hydrogen utilization so as to contribute to realizing a carbon-free society.
*Scopes 1 and 2: Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from production activities within the Group
*Scope 3: Greenhouse gas emissions resulting indirectly from supplier/customer use in relation to business activities
*Category 11 includes future emissions based on the assumptions of useful lives of products
FRONTIER FIGHTER HFR475 and 5075 (four- and five-row reaping), certified as eco-products, are equipped with an engine that meets exhaust gas regulations as well as an IQ threshing control feature that automatically controls the engine rotation within the range of working rotation speed (green zone) according to engine load, vehicle speed and layer thickness of rocking shelf during operations.
They reduce threshing losses by optimizing the air volume of winnower during low-speed operations, such as turning and rice plant lodging. During operations, the workload level of thresher is displayed on the monitor located at the center of the operation seat so that the operator can carry out reaping with the optimal setting.

Financial highlights (FY2020)
Net sales came to 149.3 billion yen, down 0.5 billion yen year on
year. In Japan, overall sales fell due to the impact of the increase in the consumption tax rate, and the impact of voluntary suspension of operating activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overseas sales increased due to unification of accounting period of a consoli- dated subsidiary in France (accounting period of 15 months), in addition to the increase in shipments of products for China, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Operating income came to 2.0 billion yen, down 0.6 billion yen year on year due to temporary factors such as loss on valuation of parts inventory and retirement benefit expenses as a result of the merger of sales companies, despite the offsetting of a decrease in gross profit caused by revenue falls by reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses.

    In the cash flows from operating activities, proceeds decreased by 0.8 billion yen year on year due to the reduction in net sales, while the inventory reduction was realized. In the cash flows from invest- ing activities, purchase decreased by 1.9 billion yen year on year due to the reduction in capital investment. As a result, in the free cash flows, proceeds increased by 1.1 billion yen year on year.
Interest-bearing liabilities came to 69.3 billion yen, the same amount as that of the end of the previous fiscal year. While the interest-bear- ing liabilities were reduced in sales companies in Japan, it increased due to the new consolidation of local sales company in Thailand. D/E ratio, which shows the soundness of finance, was at 1.11 times due to the decrease in net assets.

Environmental management
ESG Message from the officer in charge of the environment
Mid- to long-term environmental targets
ISEKI Group has set mid- to long-term environmental targets to promote environmental management. In order to realize a carbon-free society, the Group is looking into setting higher targets.
We strive to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.
ISEKI Group has designated environmental protection that would enable the creation of a sustainable society as one of the business priorities, and practices environmental manage- ment by setting the Environmental Policy.
To practice environmental management across the Group, we have introduced the envi- ronmental management system (EMS) at our manufacturing bases and non-manufacturing bases, such as sales companies, both in Japan and abroad and built a structure to promote it, headed by the Directors’ Operation Committee chaired by the President.
ISEKI Group has set mid- to long-term targets to practice activities to reduce environmen- tal burdens and environmental risks of the entire business activities, such as optimizing the use of resources and energy.
Further, the Group is working on product development that contributes to environmental protection from various different approaches, such as energy saving, exhaust gas purifica- tion feature, and technique to optimize the amount of fertilizer using a cutting edge tech- nology, by promoting environmentally-friendly design and operating the eco-product certification system.
In order to realize a carbon-free society, we will further energize the initiatives aimed at achieving the mid- to long-term environmental targets and aim to create a sustainable society.

  Response to climate change E Climate change governance
ISEKI Group has designated responses to climate change as one of its priority issues, and works on environmental management. Corporate Social Responsibility Committee supervises and manages climate change-related risks and opportunities. The committee is comprised of the members of the Directors’ Oper- ation Committee for deliberation and discusses and evaluates

issues. Meanwhile, important matters are deliberated and decided by the Board of Directors and the Directors’ Operation Committee. CSR Corporate Social Responsibility Committee meets twice a year and makes reports to the Board of Directors to ensure proper supervision by the Board of Directors
(see p. 35 for details of the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee).
Initiatives for environmentally-friendly design E S G
ISEKI Group promotes environmentally-friendly design in the entire product development process with the aim of reducing the environmental burden in each of the stages of development, manufacture, use by customers, and disposal, and strives to offer environmentally-friendly products.
 Eco-product certification system
Eco-product certification system is an in-house system that certifies products with high environmental conformance that meet ISEKI-original evaluation criteria. Certified products are granted environmental labels, which are conveyed to customers through product catalogs and user manuals in an easily noticeable format. Further, the environmental label conforms to Type II stipulated under ISO14021 (self-declared type that does not need third-party certification).
Eco-product certification trend
Example of environmental label
  Major risks and opportunities brought by climate change
 In order to realize a carbon-free society, ISEKI Group is working to offer environmentally-conscious products and solutions, while striving to reduce CO2 emissions from business activities so as to reduce environmental burdens. Meeting bodies that discuss future directions of product planning, development themes and other issues, such as the Product Development Strategy Committee and the Advanced Technology Strategic Committee, identify and evaluate opportunities for climate
change-related products and solutions and incorporate their results in development planning with the approvals of the Directors’ Operation Committee and the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Control Committee is responsible for, among other things, identification, assessment and progress management of risks. We will work on scenario analysis going forward
(see p. 43 for details of the Risk Management Control Committee).

 Risk management
The Risk Management Control Committee identifies and assesses risks of climate change impacts on business activities based on two axes, severity of damage and frequency of occur- rence, and selects risks that require focused follow-up based on degree of importance and priority of initiatives. The committee confirms the existence of emerging risks arising from environ-
Indicators and targets
ISEKI Group consistently manages and discloses the achievement of greenhouse gas emissions by Scope as a climate-related indicator. For Scopes 1 and 2, the Group has set reduction targets of 26% to be achieved by 2030 based on the results in 2013, and manages the progress. Meanwhile, for Scope 3, emissions from customer use of products sold by Category 11 account for 60% or more. In addition to offering eco-products that meet ISEKI-original evaluation criteria, the Group will work to upgrade products such as by promoting electrification and hydrogen utilization so as to contribute to realizing a carbon-free society.
*Scopes 1 and 2: Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from production activities within the Group
*Scope 3: Greenhouse gas emissions resulting indirectly from supplier/customer use in relation to business activities
*Category 11 includes future emissions based on the assumptions of useful lives of products
FRONTIER FIGHTER HFR475 and 5075 (four- and five-row reaping), certified as eco-products, are equipped with an engine that meets exhaust gas regulations as well as an IQ threshing control feature that automatically controls the engine rotation within the range of working rotation speed (green zone) according to engine load, vehicle speed and layer thickness of rocking shelf during operations.
They reduce threshing losses by optimizing the air volume of winnower during low-speed operations, such as turning and rice plant lodging. During operations, the workload level of thresher is displayed on the monitor located at the center of the operation seat so that the operator can carry out reaping with the optimal setting.

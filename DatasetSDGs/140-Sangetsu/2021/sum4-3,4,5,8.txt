Human Rights and Diverse Work Styles
The Sangetsu Group Human Rights Policy
The Sangetsu Group Human Rights Policy outlines the Sangetsu Group’s stance toward respect for human rights and our commitment to accountability regarding this matter. Other documents setting out our measures in regard to human rights protection, such as the Sangetsu Group Corporate Ethics Charter and Sangetsu Group Compliance Code of Conduct, are drawn up in accordance with this policy. Our main goals include strengthening safety, hygiene and employee health in the workplace, prohibition of discrimi- nation and harassment, improvement of diversity, appropriate management of employee salaries and working hours, work- life balance maintenance, and ensuring proper handling of personal information.
Efforts to encourage diversity
As expressed in the Sangetsu Group Basic Policy on Diversity, we respect the individuality of each employee and we believe that the promotion of diversity, which enhances the growth of the Group and our employees, is an important management strategy for the creation of new value.
Support for women’s participation and advancement
As part of the strategic reform of our personnel system, we are implementing a voluntary action plan based on Japan’s Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. We are putting in place the organizational structure and supporting systems needed to enable female employees to effectively utilize their strengths and capabilities, appointed a Diversity Promotion Officer within our Personnel Department, and are implementing various measures to realize our goals accordingly. Our objec- tive is to ensure that our organization can fully utilize the know- how, experience, and specialist expertise of all employees regardless of gender.
LGBTQ initiatives
We are undertaking efforts both internally and externally to raise awareness of our efforts to cultivate a corporate ethos that effectively leverages the diversity of our workforce, embodied by the unique personalities of each employee regardless of their age, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. We encourage employees to continue to challenge themselves and take the initiative while also expanding the scope of related measures in line with the Sangetsu Group Human Rights Policy and the Sangetsu Group Basic Policy on Diversity. In this context, we have established a helpline to proactively support LGBTQ*1 individuals and support their self-expression through statements including the use of the ally sticker*2.
Efforts in health and productivity management
Sangetsu established its health and productivity management policy “for employees to work enthusiastically” to enable employees to enjoy working. Efforts to achieve this include the establishment of organizations for health and productivity management such as the Sangetsu health insurance society and special units, as well as continuing to hold a variety of events. In recognition of these efforts, we were selected by the 2021 Certified Health & Productivity Management Organizations Recognition Program (large enterprise cat- egory) for the second consecutive year. We were also given a promotion of cancer prevention
partner award in recognition of our Advanced Cancer Treatment Reimbursement System and our continued advocacy, including seminars to help people work during cancer treatment.
Sangetsu respects the diversity, character, and individuality of employees; ensures sound operations to enable each employee to perform at his or her full potential while playing a meaningful role in the Company’s operations; and provides a safe and com- fortable working environment.

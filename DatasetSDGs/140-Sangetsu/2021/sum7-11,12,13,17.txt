Safeguarding the Global Environment
GHG emissions
We are taking steps to reduce GHG emissions to curb cli- mate change. GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in our busi- ness activities stood at 6,233 t-CO2 in fiscal 2020, down 23.2% from fiscal 2018.
To reduce GHG emissions, we are saving energy with our internal equipment, creating energy through solar power generation, and procuring electric power with a low emission factor.
Additionally, in consideration of the Japanese govern- ment’s declaration of its intent for Japan to be carbon neutral by 2050, we aim to effectively materialize zero emissions, or become carbon neutral, by fiscal 2030 for a further reduction of GHG emissions.
 Sangetsu’s business operations are closely linked to the global environment, and accordingly, our company as a matter of course has a corporate responsibility with respect to protecting the environment. Besides working to reduce the environmental foot- print of our own business activities, we are also striving to build a better and more environmentally friendly living environment.

Environmental footprint surrounding Sangetsu
An environmental footprint occurs in diverse places and situations as part of business activities, encompassing suppliers, business partners, and after-use situations as well as various internal processes. Understanding the environmental footprint in various scopes, we are making efforts to reduce our impact on the environment.
Reduction of GHG Emissions and Energy Consumption
Energy saving and creation at equipment and facilities
We are switching all company cars (mainly, hybrid vehicles) to green/fuel-efficient cars. During fiscal 2020, we changed 296 vehicles, accounting for about 63% of our fleet. The replace- ment will be completed during fiscal 2022.
We installed solar panels covering an area of 2,170 m2 on the rooftop of the Chubu Logistics Center I in Inazawa City, Aichi, in 2014 to make effective use of natural energy. In fiscal 2020, we reduced our environmental footprint by generating 508,251 kWh corresponding to the annual electricity con- sumption of 166 general households, and sold the generated electricity to a power company through a feed-in tariff scheme.
Change of power company
The use of electricity accounts for about 70% of GHG emis- sions for Scope 1 and 2. We believe that purchasing electric- ity with lower GHG emissions is one means to reduce GHG emissions, in addition to reducing electricity consumption.
Starting January 2016, we have changed our power company to one with a lower CO2 emission factor at hubs that consume more electric power. We will continue to switch our power source to one with less emissions, such as renew- able energy.
Ratios of hybrid vehicles
Reduction by 30% in fiscal 2022 (compared with fiscal 2018), realization of carbon neutral by fiscal 2030
Reduction by 4% in fiscal 2022 (compared with fiscal 2018) Reduction by 4% in fiscal 2022 (compared with fiscal 2018) 83% in fiscal 2022

Efforts in promoting social contribution activities by employees
The Sangetsu Matching Gift Program is implemented with the goal of promoting social contribution activities. Under this program, Sangetsu gives employees “S-mile” points in recognition of their social contribution activities. “S-mile” points are converted into money and donated to NPOs and other entities that Sangetsu supports. The activities to which the program applies include not only Sangetsu Volunteer Club activities, in which the company plays a leading role, but also individual employees’ activities in relation to support for external social welfare facilities, support for people affected by natural disasters, international exchange activities, com- munity activities, educational activities for young people, and NPO support activities. We are supporting these activities so that employees throughout Japan can proactively participate in such activities regardless of location.
Supporting the next generation through food aid
Food donations to support children via employee cafeteria
Sangetsu is participating in the Table For Two program in which part of the payment for cafeteria meals is donated to help pay for school meals for children in Africa and Asia. If you skip a small side dish to reduce your calorie intake when eating at the employee cafeteria, you will be able to donate ¥20, which provides a school meal for
activities, having contributed donations for 21,803 meals in total by fiscal 2020.
In addition, all employees joined the Onigiri Action as in the previous year. The employees posted photos of onigiri (rice balls) on social media and a dedicated site. The number of posted photos
reached 1,765,
thereby realizing
donations of 8,825
school meals.

Mid-term Plan
Strengthening response to electrification and autonomous driving
• Deepening of low-torque technology, which is our strength, develop- ment of a super light weight hub unit bearing specifically for EV and development of technologies to support the needs of higher speed, lighter weight, better electrolytic corrosion resistance and improved quietness.
• Contributing to autonomous driving through vehicle integrated control technology utilizing the hub unit's sensing function (Fig. X).
Strengthening response to industrial machine field
• Development of solution proposal-type business. • Offer value/service throughout product lifecycle.
Sophistication of creation
• Promotion of operator reduction/automation in production processes through the utilization of machine tool-related IoE also (Fig. Y).
• Promote sophistication of working styles, a shift to "small-numbers/ex- ceptional talent", and sophistication of plants.
Strengthening of business structure
• Reorganization of global production bases and further strengthening of production capabilities (Japan, China, ASEAN, Europe, North America) .
• Strengthening of global development system in Japan, America and Europe.
Progress in FY2017
Released new products and technologies
• Released the high-speed rotation deep groove ball bearing, machine tools, revolving seat bearing for tunnel boring machines and a bearing for special environments
Promoted operator reduction/full automation
• Expanded operator-reduced/fully-automated lines (automation of appearance inspections/conveyance/packaging and utilization of IoE)
Strengthened production/development systems
• As part of strengthening global production/development systems for the needle roller bearing, the new Kiyohara plant was built at Utsunomiya Kiki (commenced operations June 2018)

Our bearing products are used in rotating parts for all industries, from cars to industrial machinery, and are supporting society from behind-the-scenes.
In FY2017, we strengthened our business with a focus on the further enhancement of production and development foundations. In FY2018 we will continue to maintain these business foundations as well as concentrate on the development of revolutionary, new products.
In the automotive field, we will respond to electrification and autonomous driving trends while in the industrial machinery field we will develop solution proposal-type business and offer value and service throughout the lifecycle of products.
Through these activities, we will contribute to the realization of a better society from the perspective of energy-saving and social infrastructure.

Business environment analysis
(Automotive bearing) Advancement of electrification and autonomous driving
• Acceleration of product development/product release considering needs surrounding changes to cars.
(Industrial machine bearings) Further diversification of the environments in which bearings are used
• Timely development and market release of products, technologies and services responding to further sophistication of robots and automation.
Development of high-speed rotation deep groove ball bearing
Utsunomiya Kiki, new Kiyohara plant (Kiyohara, Utsunomiya city, Tochigi pref.)
   • Overwhelming low-torque technology represented by the LFT (Low Friction Torque) series.
Broad product lineup
• Responding to a wide-variety of industrial machine applications.
Technique for evaluation and analysis
• Enables evaluation and analysis in an environment closely resem- bling actual cars at the Iga Proving Ground or actual machines at the Large Size Bearing Engineering Development Center.
JTEKT Group strengths
• The ability to execute comprehensive development projects from our customers' perspectives due to having both an auto parts business and machine tool business within the JTEKT Group.
Solutions for social issues (from the perspective of SDGs)
• Contributing to reduced energy loss in all fields by better low-torque technology and supporting electrification
• Offering products on a broad basis including tunnel boring machines, railway, planes, robots, farming/construction machinery and medical devices
• Supporting industrial advancement and helping to maintain/improve abundant life environ- ments for people by making proposals to the global market that foresee needs

A Message from the President
SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
  Taking a long view toward continuous and steady growth for the company that we want to be in 2030 amid
a transformation that occurs only once in a century
Looking back on fiscal 2018
Last year was the final year of the five-year medium-term business plan (covering fiscal 2014–2018), which was the first one formulated since I became president of JTEKT in 2013. Looking at the plan’s targets for fiscal 2018, set in fiscal 2013, compared with our actual performance, we achieved consolidated net sales of ¥1,431.3 billion, significantly exceeding our ¥1,340.0 billion target, calculated on the exchange rates we use for management reporting. Meanwhile,
operating income amounted to ¥54.7 billion, and fell considerably short of our target of ¥100.0 billion.
I attribute the shortfall in profit to changes in the external environment, namely increasing competition in our core electric power steering (EPS) business, compounded by such internal factors as exceeding our targets for cost of goods sold during the ramp-up of a new line for rack assist-type EPS*1 and our targets for improvements to productivity.

 A Message from the President
SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
Responding flexibly to change and aiming to generate the innovation that leads to resolving social issues
compact to accommodate shorter camshafts and crankshafts. We are working hard to manufacture and sell such products.
Regarding the assertion“there will be more batteries,”JTEKT’s machine tool business makes equipment to manufacture batteries. Given the rise in demand for batteries for EVs, I believe we have a big business opportunity in battery manufacturing equipment as well as high-precision grinders used to polish rolls*4 used in the battery manufacturing process.
And as for the assertion “there will be more motors,” our strategy is to boost the value-added in our single ball bearings*5 (SBBs) used in automotive motors. In general, SBBs have been commoditized, but we aim to develop and market high-value- added SBBs that can handle the high revolutions of automotive motors.
Furthermore, it goes without saying that electrification and EPS go hand in hand, and we are enjoying a tailwind as the No. 1 supplier of EPS. In addition, as electrification progresses, “electricity economy” (analogous to fuel economy), or the extent electricity consumption can be curtailed will be valued. We have therefore positioned high-value-added EPS as a strategic product that can contribute to electricity economy.
4. A machine that grinds the surface of a workpiece with a rotating grindstone
5. A type of rolling bearing that separates moving parts of bearings using a single
row of balls
    Ceasing to invest aggressively in the future leads to an end to growth
We recognize that increase in fixed costs is a factor that impacts earnings, but we have increased our R&D spending by more than ¥20 billion on a single-year basis compared with five years ago. We are increasing this investment intentionally to ensure we remain successful in an era of great change.
Adaptability to CASE is the key to the future
In April 2019, we established J-QuAD DYNAMICS Inc., a joint venture developing integrated control software*3 for autonomous driving and vehicle motion control in collaboration with Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., ADVICS Co., Ltd., and DENSO CORPORATION. Four companies with a shared strong sense of urgency and desire to compete with rival mega- suppliers in Europe and other regions have come together in this venture.
Furthermore, in May 2019 we took an equity stake in Advanced Smart Mobility Co., Ltd., a collaboration between industry and academia in the field of autonomous driving. Advanced Smart Mobility engages in R&D in autonomous driving technology, particularly for buses, and has been commissioned by the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) to conduct feasibility testing on self- driving buses as part of its “autonomous driving system” initiative.

             The automotive industry is said to be undergoing a transformation that occurs only once in a century. We must respond fully to the trend embodied by the acronym CASE*2, in particular to autonomous driving (the “A” in CASE). We currently hold the top share globally in power steering, but if we are slow in our response to autonomous driving, we will find ourselves left behind as simply a manufacturer of steering hardware.
As I mentioned previously, the competitive environment in EPS is intensifying. Column assist-type EPS in particular has been commoditized, and it is increasingly difficult to generate meaningful margins in this product. We are at a critical juncture in our survival in our efforts to maintain our position as a Tier 1 supplier of steering systems that incorporate control software. We will continue to make the necessary investments with this sense of urgency.
Feasibility testing of next-generation urban transportation
JTEKT is participating in R&D that has been promoted by Advanced Smart Mobility and is aiming to drive the kind of innovation that leads to resolving social issues, such as autonomous transportation systems using buses and vehicle platooning using self-driving trucks.
Addressing electrification with JTEKT’s core technologies
JTEKT is focusing on electric (the “E” in CASE) in areas not limited to autonomous driving. When we speak of the electrification of cars, many people have the perception that there will only be pure electric vehicles (EVs) running on the roads in the future. However, some observers believe that when viewed holistically from “well to wheel,” a world made up of only pure EVs is not sustainable. I project that in the future EVs will account for at most about 25% of all cars. If the majority of the EV market comprises hybrids or plug-in hybrids, internal combustion systems will remain. I believe we can say with certainty about the world of cars in the future that 1) engines will be smaller, 2) there will be more batteries, and 3) there will be more motors.
On the first assertion that “engines will be smaller,” JTEKT is only one of four makers globally and two in Japan of specialty grinders used to polish camshafts and crankshafts. JTEKT’s technology will therefore be in demand in order to create smaller engines. Going forward, grinders*4 will have to be more

 A Message from the President
SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
   Management forms a long view for continuous growth
The sharing economy (the “S” in CASE) is the area in which we, as an automotive components manufacturer, have no way to address at the moment. Going forward, growth in car ownership particularly in developed nations is expected to slump and automotive manufacturers and auto parts suppliers alike are bound for challenging times.
Yet it is exactly because tough times are projected ahead that I believe we should set challenging targets. In February 2019, we clarified our vision of the company that we want to be in 2030 and set annual sales growth of 4% as one of our key performance indicators (KPIs).
Looking back on when we set our targets for 2030, at first our secretariat proposed a target of 2.6% since the automotive industry as a whole was expected to grow at about 2%. However, I was told at the time that global GDP growth was projected to be 3.6%. If our expected growth rate was below that of global GDP, it meant our relative position in society would decline and we would not be able to boost the motivation and morale of our people under such conditions. I therefore decided to set a more ambitious sales growth target of 4%.
Meanwhile, there are companies out there that aim for growth of 7%, or even 10%. I think such targets would be very hard to achieve without very robust management systems. There is a Japanese expression that says folding screens and shops collapse if you spread them out too far. JTEKT was formed through the merger of companies in four businesses and therefore its management structure is relatively complex. We will solidify our management systems and develop our talent while taking the long view toward continuous growth. This is the image of the company that we aim to become.
Looking for business opportunities in what the world cannot do without
We are targeting 4% growth in an era when growth in the automotive industry is expected to decelerate. We believe we can close the gap by looking for business opportunities in the things that the world cannot do without.
When we discussed within JTEKT, “what are the things the world cannot do without?” The answers included people’s lives and health, food, energy, and mineral resources and other natural resources. It may not be apparent to people living in Japan, but from a global perspective, fresh water is also a natural resource we cannot do without. As for Japan, the decline in the working population has already become a social issue, highlighting labor, as another thing the world cannot do without.
The seeds of growth we have in such areas are control technologies gained through the development of steering systems, tribology*6 and measurement technologies gained through our bearings businesses, IoT-related*7 technologies gained through our machine tools and mechatronics businesses, and so on. There are business opportunities at the intersection of what the world cannot do without and the seeds that JTEKT possesses. In other words, we intend to use our seeds to help resolve social issues by responding to needs in areas different from our four core businesses.
Our Power Assist Suit is one example of a success story in this regard. Applying bearing tribology and power steering control technologies, this device lightens the load on the worker’s lower body when performing tasks like lifting and lowering heavy objects.
Furthermore, our “Factory agent” matching service for manufacturers that debuted in 2019 is a platform that connects factories that would like to order processing with factories that are seeking to accept such orders. In this business, we are able to capitalize on the many relationships with manufacturers that we have established as a machine tool maker. The main goal of this business is to have customers take advantage of and be satisfied with this service, but at the same time we are able to
use data on the type of processing our customers want in our marketing efforts. Through this business, we expect to create win–win relationships that are highly satisfying for both our customers and JTEKT alike.
We are fostering the sprouts of many new businesses besides those I have introduced here. Going forward, we will strive to create new value beyond the framework of our four core businesses and thus contribute to a sustainable society that is on even a higher dimension.

 A Message from the President
SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
“Catch ground balls that are hit between the shortstop and third base” Making “Ownership” our corporate culture and entrenching it throughout the JTEKT Group
Focusing on development of the next generation of executives
Continually revitalizing our managers is a key theme in our human resource development. Every year, JTEKT selects managers globally to participate in a six-month training program conducted in English. Through this program, we are developing professionals with broad-ranging knowledge necessary for business.
Even if an employee is currently a technician, for example, that person could one day become a managing officer of JTEKT or an executive at one of our Group companies. We have them learn the basics of business from a broad perspective, by participating in functional areas they had not been exposed to until now, such as marketing, design, and feasibility studies*10. Their graduation project is to propose a new business, and through this process we have generated and accumulated new business ideas with a high potential for commercialization. From this stock of ideas, the New Business Promotion Department reporting directly to me looks for the seeds of new businesses and incubates them. Some of the “sprouts of new business” I mentioned previously come from here.
10. Investigates the potential and profitability of new businesses and other projects
Instilling the JTEKT WAY and aiming to be the company that we envision in 2030
In 2016, the JTEKT Group announced the JTEKT WAY as an expression of its shared values and ambitions as embodied in five keywords: “Customer first,”“Ownership,”“Continuous kaizen (improvement),”“Teamwork and self-discipline,” and “Aspiration for innovation and for technique.” Of these keywords, the last two were inherited, respectively, from Koyo Seiko and Toyoda Machine Works, the two companies that merged to form JTEKT. Staff in the Corporate Planning Division who travelled around
Customer first
• We are committed to look at things from customer’s viewpoint, and sincerely respond to customer’s requests.
• We are committed to create values that are new to the world, to deliver products and services that exceed customer’s expectation.
Ownership
• We are committed to take everything as our own business.
• We are committed to grasp the essence of things and take prompt action.
Teamwork and self-discipline
• We are committed to be self-disciplined, and perform any task with a sense of urgency.
• We are committed to actively communicate to unite the power of each other.
the world to hold discussions created the other three. Three years have passed since the announcement, and I feel confident that understanding and penetration of the JTEKT WAY has progressed. That said, I get the sense we have work to do in instilling “Ownership” fully throughout the organization.
I often say, “catch the ground balls that are hit between the shortstop and third base.” I use this as an analogy for taking initiative and responsibility in situations where some may intentionally shy from it. For example, when an issue with quality arises, if everyone shies from responsibility or tries to place it on others, the issue grows increasingly worse. In the case of automobiles, they are manufactured at a pace of about one car per minute, so delays might put many lives at risk. No matter where the root cause of the issue lies, when they arise we must first visit our customers and immediately take corrective action.
Those without a sense of ownership quickly try to push responsibility onto others. No matter how much talent a person has, if they do not have a mind-set of taking responsibility, they will never improve. We must entrench “Ownership” in all our employees and sublimate it such that it becomes an integral part of our corporate culture.
Our competitors are working hard to survive within the transformation in the automotive industry that happens once in a century that is occurring right now. We will not survive if we have the tepid attitude that something was not a problem yesterday so it will be the same tomorrow or that someone else will take care of the problem so we do not have to get our hands dirty.
I believe it is only when all our employees have a customer- first mind-set and work toward continuous kaizen with a sense of ownership that we can become the company that we are aiming to be in 2030. I would like to make this a reality with the JTEKT Group working as one.
Continuous kaizen
• We are committed to go and see for ourselves to thoroughly understand
the situation, and identify root causes.
• We are committed to, with enthusiasm for imaginativeness and
inventiveness, diligently continue kaizen challenges.
Aspiration for innovation and for technique
• We are committed to limitlessly heighten our technology and skills to become a front runner in innovation.
• We are committed to foster a culture to keep each of us humble in
learning things and developing each other. 18
    The changing role of workers brought on by automation
In Japan, it has become difficult to secure staff as a declining birthrate has made hiring extremely difficult, and this is further exacerbated by the sharp decline in the working population approaching in 2025 as many employees reach retirement age. As such, automation and boosting productivity by completing work with fewer workers is a pressing matter.
I frequently tell our employees, “do not take technical skills lightly.” For example, just tightening a bolt with an electric screwdriver requires a high degree of technical skill. We have some employees who are so passionate about their work that they bring nuts and bolts home with them to practice tightening them over and over while watching television or conversing with family members.
and technique of a master produce results that are worlds apart from those that are not. The same can be said about robots on the manufacturing floor.
Automation spreads from an inability to hire people as well as a declining population. When this happens, those who worked as welders up to now will take on new jobs in teaching and maintenance. In other words, the role itself of a person working on the manufacturing floor will change. As this happens, it will lead to people working in areas with higher value-added and should lead to a dramatic improvement in the total productivity of capital and labor.
We operate JTEKT Academy, which aims to develop the skills of high-school graduates entering the company. Currently, half of the high-school graduates we hire enter JTEKT Academy and learn technical skills while the other half are assigned directly to the manufacturing floor and learn such skills on the job. In the future, however, we are thinking to end direct assignments to the manufacturing floor and have all such new hires learn technical skills at the Academy. We are also working to change the Academy’s curriculum. Basic techniques such as plating and polishing are important, but the new joiners will also learn how to use sequencers*8, programming, maintenance, and other skills. There is no question in my mind that we not only need to adopt recurrent education*9 but also change our employee education from the ground up.
The same thinking applies to indirect divisions. Training our people is exceptionally important to improving our productivity amid a declining birthrate and an aging population. This entails improving IT literacy to raise the quality of work styles, changing our training systems including the adoption of recurrent education, and aggressively implementing staff rotations.

  Class scene of JTEKT Academy
To promote automation, the jobs that today require the skills of experienced workers will need to be handed over to robots. Teaching is an important element of this process. Allow me to share a story I heard from a friend. He explained to me that a robot trained in Japanese calligraphy would draw characters of vastly different quality depending on if it had been taught by a master or by an ordinary person. Robots taught the intuition

SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
CASE
At present, the automotive industry is facing a so-called once-in-a-century drastic changes, with CASE, which stands for Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric, said to be the future trend and growth market within the industry.
JTEKT is promoting specific and advanced initiatives in this area, focusing mainly on autonomous driving and vehicle electrification.
Basic Concept and Aim of CASE
JTEKT is expanding its technologies and products supporting new innovations, mainly related to autonomous driving and vehicle electrification, such as integrated control systems for autonomous driving and E-AWD, while at the same engaging in the creation of new businesses in preparation for fewer vehicles due to sharing and other factors.

For high-speed rotation usage, a quietness- improved ball bearing
The advance of vehicle electrification requires the development of traditional 4WD engine drivelines as well as a variety of AWD systems. To this end, we are drawing on our strengths to promote the development of driveline products for vehicle electrification. Examples of these include the development of an electric oil pump (EOP) for motor cooling that utilizes hydraulic control technology and the development of a high-efficiency constant velocity joint (CVJ) that is both quiet and environmentally friendly. In addition, we are aiming for the practical application of an E-AWD system utilizing a technology for 4WD front / rear right / left torque distribution. Going forward, we will continue to create products that are environmentally friendly and contribute to safe car performance.

SHAPING A BETTER FUTURE
New Businesses
In anticipation of social trends and environmental changes, we are formulating new business strategies that will be the pillars of JTEKT’s future and the Group’s sustainable growth as we collaborate with relevant departments within and outside the company in an effort to create new businesses.
In April 2017, we launched the New Business Planning Department as an organization under the direct control of the president in order to respond to global social issues and needs, including the SDGs*1, by taking on the challenge of developing new products and businesses and creating new value.
Basic Concept and Aim of New Businesses
At present, with importance placed on responses to numerous social issues, we are approaching an era of disruptive innovation (AI, IoT, digitization) and development process innovation (open innovation*2, lean startups*3, agility*4) with new players entering the market, all of which necessitate a forward-looking response. As such, we are engaged in business diversification and new product development to further strengthen management, including future business portfolio strategies, and have repeatedly discussed the direction of existing and new businesses. Among these, in terms of new businesses, we will not be limited to simply aiming for additions to our business portfolio. Rather, we want to play a role in terms of existing processes, value chain reforms, human resource development, corporate culture innovation, and the creation of a new brand image.
JTEKT’s basic concept regarding new businesses involves resolving social issues and meeting needs, and when necessary, collaborate with ideas from outside the company as we dive deeper into core technologies derived internally to differentiate ourselves from other companies.
In terms of engaging in new businesses, it is crucial to have the mind-set and motivation to take on challenges in a highly uncertain, unconnected, and unknown industry while utilizing the strength of a small group structure as we develop human resources that have broad and lofty perspectives by engaging in businesses that lay outside the normal framework. Additionally, while creating a structure or an organization for continuously generating business themes, we will amass numerous new business ideas from affiliated companies and Group departments in Japan and overseas, training curriculum, and other sources, narrow these down to the most optimal, and then quickly attempt to expand business.

  A Panel Discussion with Managing Officers 1
 Building JTEKT’s new value
We spoke with five managing officers in charge of technology development, new businesses, and other areas on the theme of “Building JTEKT’s new value.”
 Changes in the business environment
Moderator: What are your views on the advent of CASE*1 and the kind of transformation in the automotive industry that is said to happen only once in a century?
Miyazaki: As someone who has spent many years in the automotive industry, the major changes in the operating environment precipitated by CASE and MaaS*2 are close to home for me. Evolving its technologies to adapt to changes is a pressing issue for JTEKT. It is therefore critical to always gather the latest information and quickly implement the cycle from the formulation of new strategies to their execution. We therefore view the transformation in the automotive industry to be an opportunity to advance our business rather than a risk.
Segawa: JTEKT has the leading share globally in electric power steering (EPS), so the shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) is a tailwind for the EPS business. In addition, we were involved from an early stage in steer by wire*3, so I think this will bear fruit going forward in the era of autonomous driving vehicles.
We do not have any concrete strategy as yet for how we will approach business in the connected and sharing economy. But we will view this risk as an opportunity and continue to consider our approach going forward.
Makino: In the area of autonomous driving, we have partnered with DENSO CORPORATION, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd., and ADVICS Co., Ltd. to establish J-QuAD DYNAMICS Inc., a new company that develops integrated vehicle motion control software*4. We will clarify our roles within our external alliances and work toward approaches that join together players involved in products and those involved in services.
Hayashida: This type of open innovation*5 is becoming more important, and it is clear that the trend away from go-it-alone strategies will accelerate even further. We need to tie-up and collaborate with industry players, academia, and government bodies, including universities and research institutions, in the pursuit of advanced technologies that we cannot build out only with our own resources. As an example of open innovation with a public-sector organization, in April 2019 we announced the establishment of the JTEKT-AIST (National institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) smart factory collaboration
research laboratory. We have been collaborating with third-party research organizations in the area of materials and components. But our efforts in such fields as IoT*6 and data analytics*7 have room to develop, and I believe we should be promoting tie-ups particularly in these areas going forward.
Miyazaki: Up to now, we basically focused on uncovering new technologies in-house while collaborating with universities on an individual basis. But with the pace of technological change in the world today, we are entering alliances not individually but comprehensively and strategically, as research for example in AI*8 requires tie-ups with universities and public-sector organizations both in Japan and abroad.

8. Artificial reproduction of some “intellectual behaviors” performed by humans using

Use of AI, IoT, and other digital technologies
Moderator: Please explain how AI, IoT, and other digital technologies will be utilized.
Hayashida: JTEKT is using AI, IoT, and other digital technologies both in its manufacturing processes and in its products. As an example of using AI in the manufacturing process, we have deployed automated inspection equipment that uses image- processing technology to replace the human eye. Meanwhile, as examples of using AI in the machine tool field, we are developing a PLC*9 that incorporates edge computing*10 as well as an autonomous grinder. We think this will lead to unprecedented improvements in productivity and service levels in both fields. Segawa: To be part of the commercialization of autonomous driving vehicles, we have begun R&D on deploying AI in steering
system controls. We believe this will be a new way of providing value to our clients. We are also thinking about measuring direct load as part of input sensing that sends road condition data to EPS by affixing sensors on the hubs*11 that are attached to tires. Makino: We view the aging of the population under way globally as an opportunity to create new businesses. Specifically, we have developed such products as Power Assist Suit and Electric Assist & Training “Walker,” which support human movement. These products are the result of advanced research into resolving issues in the welfare and long-term care fields. I think leveraging AI in these types of products will also be effective.
Segawa: Power Assist Suits are products that support human movement like muscles do. Yet each person has a different timing when they move and when they exert force. So, if AI technology can be used to create control tailored to each individual, movement will become smoother and users will be able to perform tasks more naturally and comfortably.

On JTEKT’s strengths
Moderator: What strengths do you feel JTEKT should develop further going forward, given the rapid advancement of digital technologies and the dramatic transformation under way in the social environment?
Segawa: JTEKT’s strengths are in materials, tribology*12, precision processing, control, and measurement technologies. Commanding these five core technologies makes developing new products based on them possible. In addition, control technology in EPS has become a new strength, and it is very significant that we are able to leverage this technology to enter the autonomous driving market. Further, our ability to expand this technology laterally in other fields is a major strength. Up to now, we have used our core technologies to develop a range of products, but going forward I believe our control technologies will be particularly valuable within the five core technologies as vehicle electrification progresses.
Miyazaki: Autonomous driving, in particular, requires the use of various controllers, and this has placed our control technologies firmly in the spotlight. I think this is our biggest strength when you consider it can be used in new business fields, such as Power Assist Suits.
Our involvement in a wide range of businesses is another of our strengths. In addition to our four main business lines, we have companies in the JTEKT Group involved in the development of electronic components and the manufacture of hydraulic dampers, among other businesses. Led by our No. 1 market share in steering, each of our businesses interacts with a broad range of customers, which allows us to collect a massive amount of know-how and information. This in turn becomes the basis for thinking about how to address the future needs of our customers and is the wellspring of ideas for growth. JTEKT thus has the elements to consider what technologies and products based on our existing technologies should be provided at what time to create significant value. Moreover, our largest strength is the wealth of experience held by the JTEKT Group as a whole, including its Group companies. Ootomo: Our global manufacturing network is another one of our strengths. We have established manufacturing bases around the world and are thus able to supply our customers in a timely manner. In addition, since we are deploying the manufacturing lines developed in Japan at overseas manufacturing bases, we can conduct monozukuri (building excellent products) under the same standards and quality globally. I would like to also note that this manufacturing system has won high praise from our customers.

  A Panel Discussion with Managing Officers 1
  Contributing to resolving the issues faced by society
Moderator: In the era ahead, I believe companies will be expected to contribute to resolving the environmental issues and other issues faced by society.
Miyazaki: There are two perspectives to responding to environmental protection. The first is how much we can contribute through our products. While a number of our products contribute to environmental protection, the most significant contribution is made by EPS, which greatly improves a vehicle’s energy efficiency and lowers the load on the environmental burden. Another of our strengths is the ability to develop and provide bearings that offer low torque*13 and are gentle on the environment. These bearings reduce friction, which translates directly into reduced CO2 emissions. The second perspective is saving energy and lowering the environmental impact not in products themselves but in their manufacturing processes.
Ootomo: JTEKT manufactures machine tools and other manufacturing equipment and thus can also contribute to reducing the burden on the environment in the manufacturing field. One of JTEKT’s strengths is having Group companies that make machine tools and thermal processing equipment, which are tested in the manufacture of JTEKT’s own products. By providing products to customers that have undergone repeated testing and improvements, we are able to contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and waste liquids and oil, not only at our own plants but also on the manufacturing floor of our customers.
In the era ahead, we must consider how we can contribute to achievement of the SDGs*14. As a manufacturer, we must think beyond just making products and consider how we can contribute more broadly to resolving the important issues facing society. First of all, dealing with the declining birthrate and the shift to an aging population is a pressing issue in Japan. JTEKT is working toward more highly productive monozukuri and leveraging IoT. From a global perspective, in contrast to Japan, the population is growing and causing shortages of food and water. Going forward, as a global company, I believe it will become critical to view issues on a global scale and prepare for the necessary development from a broad perspective.
Makino: JTEKT has formulated the “Beyond Medium-term Business Plan,” which looks beyond the current medium-term business plan. Through this plan, we are creating a concrete vision for what value JTEKT can provide toward addressing social issues and building a framework for product development through backcasting. I believe building such frameworks will become one of our
strengths.
Segawa: In formulating the “Beyond Medium-term Business Plan,” we held discussions at executive workshops regarding the JTEKT ideal in 2030 and policies related to business development. The technologies necessary to bring this to fruition are deliberated at Technology Management Meetings. The twin engines of company policy and technology are necessary for the company to move forward with new businesses, and I have the impression both meetings are functioning well toward that end.
Hayashida: We are a monozukuri company, but going forward we need to change our approach to business.
As a new business, in April 2019 we launched a matching service called “Factory agent”*15. New business models like this that help to resolve social issues will become more vital in the future. I would like to point out the AI is just one method. In my opinion, we need to consider what to use in combination with AI in our R&D in order to create new value.

Vision for JTEKT in 2050
Moderator: Looking further beyond the image of 2030 set forth in the “Beyond Medium-term Business Plan,” what do you envision the world will look like and what kind of company will JTEKT be in 2050?
Makino: It is very difficult to imagine society in 2050. That said, only companies that are always looking to the future, comprehending the issues of that era and finding solutions for them, will survive. JTEKT must become that kind of company. Miyazaki: I think it is important to gauge carefully how society will evolve from a global perspective and how to respond to those changes by collecting information from a variety of perspectives and news sources not limited to Japan.
Ootomo: On that point, the JTEKT Group has bases worldwide that can serve as sensors and antennae to capture trends and changes in each region. I believe it is necessary for us to anticipate trends and changes in each region by compiling this information in Japan, considering and deciding on our response, and then taking action. Segawa: It is said AI will surpass human intelligence in 2045, and beyond that in 2050 we do not know if the automobile itself will still exist.
That said, even if such an age were to come, we must apply the know-how we have accumulated to develop products that society needs. In addition, no matter how much society transforms, people will still need air and water, food, energy, and other essentials to
continue living. Therefore, I would like to see JTEKT remain a company needed by society through its involvement in such areas. Miyazaki: I think talent development is critical. We will continue with development, manufacturing, and sales that utilize our strengths. In development, in particular, we will need to strengthen our ties with external parties, such as our alliances with partners from industry, government, and academia. At the same time, we will need to develop diverse talent that can adapt flexibly to changes in society. I believe it is critical that we develop people under alliances that go beyond organizational frameworks both in Japan and abroad.
Segawa: We are currently strengthening our talent base in data analytics and AI. Meanwhile, we have a robust training system for technology with a vast array of seminars targeted at the company as a whole. Within this technology training, we have educational curricula designed to improve the quality of our development, and as a result, we have expanded the number of experts and higher- grade staff in each part of our organization. In addition, the Human Resources Department provides training on problem-solving methodologies, which provides a base to support the company. Miyazaki: “No. 1 & Only One” is the vision for the JTEKT Group. Going forward, there will be shift from monozukuri to kotozukuri (value creation). Yet even if this transition does occur, I think it is important that we continue to have pride as a manufacturer and preserve the attitude of developing and providing “No. 1 & Only One” products.

  A Panel Discussion with Managing Officers 2
 Laying the foundation for building JTEKT’s value
We spoke with four managing officers in charge of sales, manufacturing, purchasing, and human resources about changes in the business environment, the issues JTEKT is facing right now, and the image the company should aim for according to the theme of “laying the foundation for building JTEKT’s value.”
  Changes in JTEKT’s business environment
Moderator: The business environment surrounding the JTEKT Group is changing dramatically. How do each of you view this transformation and what responses do you feel are required to adapt?
Kaijima: The magnitude and speed of change in our competitors’ products arising from technological innovation are the biggest issues facing our sales force. Products that used to sell up to now suddenly become obsolete and no longer sell. We have never before experienced a change like this. Even the world’s major automakers have been confounded by the transformation in the business environment, so it is difficult for us to see what we should be focusing on. I have never worked in an environment with this degree of uncertainty.
Furthermore, as a monozukuri (building excellent products) company, we have focused on trends in developed countries up to now, but it is clear that it is the Asian nations that will experience growth from here on. As such, I feel it is important to deepen our understanding of these countries going forward.
Okamatsu: As for issues facing our purchasing in Japan, labor shortages and a lack of successors owing to a declining birthrate have become apparent at small and medium-sized enterprises. This situation has made it necessary for us to coordinate with our suppliers and secure robust pipelines and thus build a pipeline for the future that considers what materials and technologies our products will require in the years to come.
In overseas markets, it will become difficult to continue our business in implementing global projects unless we can find suppliers who are able to offer the same price worldwide. In this regard, I would like to focus on developing new suppliers and building a framework for quickly collecting a large volume of information from suppliers.
Sano: Reducing CO2 emissions is the biggest issue with regard to manufacturing activities and the environment. With the Toyota Group introducing total CO2 volume restrictions, we will aim to reduce our total CO2 emission volume in Japan by 35% in fiscal 2030 compared with our output in fiscal 2013. This is a challenging target as it means we must reduce our CO2 production at a rate that exceeds our targeted growth rate over the same period.
When thinking about reducing CO2 emissions, it is also important to consider the impact on the manufacturing floor of recent global warming and climate change. As temperatures rise, we are forced to use more energy for air conditioning in order to maintain the working environment on the manufacturing floor. As a consequence, JTEKT has set reduction targets for CO2 emissions that incorporate such changes and has begun working to achieve them.
In addition, a shortage of water has become an issue in recent years. JTEKT has started to introduce water circulation systems to address its need to reduce the amount of water it uses going forward. These are some of the ways that meeting society’s expectations with respect to the environment has become a priority for us.
Mogi: These days, institutional investors are looking not only at a company’s earnings but are also making investment decisions based on its approaches to ESG*1 and the SDGs*2. I feel there is a need to convey with accuracy and detail to investors and other external stakeholders how JTEKT is contributing to society and the various initiatives being implemented with the company.
On the human resources front, we must take steps in Japan from now to counteract the decline in the working population associated with the so-called “Year 2025 Problem”*3. As one measure, we are taking the passage of the Workstyle Reform Act as an opportunity to create a
work environment that is more accommodating, a framework for employees to be active in a variety of ways, and an environment for employees to learn on their own initiative.

Strengths that underpin JTEKT’s growth
Moderator: Amid the need to respond to changes in the environment, what are the strengths the company will take advantage of in the future?
Kaijima: JTEKT handles a wide range of products, including automotive parts, bearings, and machine tools. This means there are differing senses of value and thinking within the company. I believe that intentionally combining these diverse values and ways of thinking can create new approaches and ideas.
In addition, the JTEKT Group conducts its business on a global scale, and in terms of headcount, Japanese nationals are in the minority. I believe we need to stop treating non-Japanese as the second line of employees and aggressively promote talented people regardless of nationality and the like to leadership positions. This to me will open the way to survive in these times of great change.
Mogi: As for mixing diverse talent together, I would add that we are focused on building a systematic structure for staff rotations as part of our human resource strategy. We are also compiling talent management information into a database and considering using this data to match talent with the optimal business unit and role for them. Furthermore, in recent years we have prioritized creating an environment where employees are highly motivated and enthusiastic about their work. By connecting the talent
management information database I mentioned with a training system, we are able to create interactive learning tailored to each employee. We intend to promote the use of this data pool going forward.
Sano: To ensure that everyone in the manufacturing divisions is heading toward the same targets globally, I believe it is important to have lateral coordination by sharing information and exchanging talent among plants. In concrete terms, we are holding global conferences, bringing overseas employees to Japan to participate in training and actually work on site in Japan. Such employees will take the knowledge, skill, and human networks they gain through such experiences back to their home countries and expand on them. I get the sense that such personnel movement and exchanges have become more prevalent. Okamatsu: Sustaining competitiveness is one key to a company’s survival. We are fortunate that JTEKT has many proprietary technologies and can boost its competitiveness by working hard to improve its own technologies while its suppliers apply themselves toward improving theirs.
In addition, we have placed purchasing professionals in each of our key overseas markets, and this enables regions that possess a certain technology to support those regions that do not. We are thus able to perform the same activities anywhere in the world. I aim to strengthen this structure for the global management of purchasing and thus respond to the demands of the new era.

   Issues facing JTEKT and its response
Moderator: As JTEKT leverages and improves upon its unique strengths, I believe there are some areas in which it can improve. Please share your thoughts in this regard.
Sano: At present, investment outflows have been rising due to an increase in various projects under way and are having an impact on our profitability. Under such conditions, it is critical for us to consistently achieve the targets for each project. As such, the entire company is working under the leadership of President Agata to build manufacturing lines that produce the maximum impact on earnings from the moment that mass production begins.
Additionally, we have made considerable progress raising productivity through automation and by reducing the number of staff working on the manufacturing floor.
Okamatsu: While the number of global projects has risen in recent years, we must offer an advantage over our competitors in attributes other than just price. Costs are the most difficult aspect of purchasing, but this is the same for all companies. In my opinion, cutting lead times until product delivery to the greatest degree possible will be important to capturing business opportunities going forward.
Kaijima: I believe speediness is what is lacking most in Japanese companies today, including ours. Japanese are not keen to “buy speed” in business. Our overseas competitors buy time by acquiring what they need through M&A and seek out talented individuals through headhunting. I think it is critical that we do not adhere to a go-it-alone mentality.
Mogi: With respect to shedding a go-it-alone mentality, we recently have been actively participating in university-sponsored symposia and alliances among industry, government, and academia while encouraging open innovation. Among other examples, we are contributing to regional revitalization by working with local government organizations and research institutions. Going forward, I would like to further expand our ties with external parties.
Management model
The ideal form for each business unit
Moderator: From the discussion thus far, we are able to understand what JTEKT is focusing on as a global company and the initiatives under way in the areas under your direction. Let us turn now to the future. Please describe your thinking as to the ideal form for your business area.
Kaijima: In these highly uncertain times, I think leadership is particularly expected of the sales force at the front lines in feeding back what has been learned from customers and thinking of ways to address the customers’ requirements with internal parties. Toward this end, everyone needs to become more attuned to what is happening outside the company. It is important to aggressively seek out information and learn and internalize it independently. The company also needs to provide its people with learning opportunities.
Mogi: I think we should be aiming for a workplace where employees work enthusiastically and are contributing to society. We must embrace diversity to make this happen. In the area of human resources, I feel we must strive to address each employee individually with as much attention to detail as we can since each employee has different fields where they can express their skills and workplaces where they are able to thrive.
Sano: I believe we need adaptability to change. Our basic strength in monozukuri is the foundation of acquiring adaptability, and we will therefore continue working to fortify this basic strength as the foundation for flexibility in manufacturing. We also need to shrink lead times, as shortened lead times result in a perception of speed and increases our adaptability to various changes.
Okamatsu: In the purchasing division, we set the “JTEKT WAY in Purchasing” as our policy five years ago and follow this together with purchasing staff at all local subsidiaries. The core concept of this policy is to “create a structure for supplying the best quality at the lowest price in a timely fashion,” and so I do not expect this to change in the future.
Going forward, we may add “information” to this policy. For example, we plan to use IoT*5 to acquire information on parts from the suppliers of our supply chain before they are delivered. We can create even better products by using such information to set up the next step in the workflow or fine-tune processing in advance. By setting up such linkages I believe we can all but eliminate defects within our processes, which in turn will heighten our competitiveness. This may seem like a fantasy, but I have a vision that our structure will be enhanced in such a way in the future.
The company that JTEKT should become in the future
Moderator: To conclude today’s discussion, please comment from a long-term view on the company that JTEKT is aiming to become in the future, and what is important in making this a reality. Kaijima: Our customers also seem to lack confidence as there is no clear outlook for the future. This is exactly why we would like to be the company our customers consult with first saying, “if we are going to consult someone, it will be JTEKT.” Toward this end, I would like to build a corporate image as a company “that is a good listener,”“is able to respond from a broad perspective,”“offers good insights and proposals,” and “has extensive capabilities and makes products with care.”
Mogi: President Agata often says “catch ground balls hit between the shortstop and third base” as a metaphor when speaking. In other words, it is important to continually take the initiative to resolve issues and have a mind-set that is always focused on self- improvement. If our people have such a mind-set, I believe we will be able to adapt to any change in society or the world at large. Sano: Recently, President Agata has been saying, “catch all the ground balls,” not just the ones hit between the shortstop and third base (laughs). After all, I think within the JTEKT WAY it is important to have a strong sense of ownership. I believe JTEKT will grow stronger if we have more talented people who can think and act on their own.
 How to become a unified global organization
Moderator: Where do you think JTEKT should focus, including addressing the issues you spoke about, as it works to become a unified global organization?
Kaijima: The medium-term business plan has the signposts to guide us toward reaching our targets. I emphasize the PDCA*4 cycle the most when performing tasks in implementing the plan. I work toward ensuring a thorough understanding worldwide and at all affiliated companies of how JTEKT does business, including the JTEKT WAY.
Sano: JTEKT has set the same key performance indicators (KPIs) for its global business and presented them in a way that is readily understandable. We aim for a common understanding of our issues and conduct benchmarking to learn from the strategies and initiatives of leading companies. We strive to develop our talent by incorporating the best practices of other companies in our PDCA cycle and continually improving our activities.
Mogi: I believe JTEKT’s strength is the importance placed on genchi genbutsu (go and see for yourself) to promote shared values and recognition of issues. I feel it is important to continue to preserve this corporate culture.
Kaijima: In the sales divisions, we are implementing “multi- perspective sales” as a combination of both communication and genchi genbutsu. We aim to have multiple points of contact with our customers. For example, connecting our functions to those of the customer: the customer’s purchasing division and our sales division, the customer’s development division and our engineering division, the customer’s manufacturing division with our quality division, and so forth. We do this fairly intentionally, since increasing the points of contact we have with our customers leads to broader business opportunities.

Stakeholder expectations

  An Interview with Overseas Managing Officers
 Building value globally
We interviewed two managing officers from overseas subsidiaries for their views regarding what initiatives should be implemented to ensure the JTEKT Group continues to create value on a global basis.
   Views on contributing to society and environmental issues
Davidson: In my region, North America, the world is changing at an unprecedented pace owing to technological advances that were unthinkable under past paradigms and a succession of net entrants into the automotive industry from other fields. To respond to such changes, we at JTEKT must leverage our experience and know-how gained up to now to the fullest. Furthermore, we also need to consider how we can contribute to society through our product design and manufacturing.
Fortin: The situation is the same in Europe. Social interest in environmental issues in particular has been growing year by year, and more stringent regulations are exerting a major impact on the automotive industry. As a result, it is critical to gain a firm understanding of our customers’ trends and to be positioned to respond to their movements in a timely fashion. Stricter regulations are making customers’ requirements more complex and sophisticated. There are also an increasing number of global projects that require complying with multiple regulations that cross national borders. We need to speed up everything we do to keep pace with this changing environment.
Davidson: Against this backdrop, we need to create the environment both globally and locally in which we can hire the necessary talent, respond as needed, and generate the right output whenever it is needed. I think it is fair to say that JTEKT has made more progress in becoming a diverse organization than its peers because it has a broad product lineup and manufacturing plants around the world. I would like JTEKT to fully apply this diversity as a strength to comply with regulations, contribute to society, and tackle environmental issues in a timely fashion. In North America, we have set internal targets for addressing environmental issues and each business location is working together to achieve them. As some examples, we are working toward reducing the amount of waste that goes to landfills to zero, optimally managing compressed air used in plants, cutting wastewater volumes, and improving the way we manage the time lighting is used. These are some of the ways that when the entire organization—the company and its plants—is involved that we can continue to create working environments in which each employee can focus on the environment while they perform their daily activities.
Fortin: We are proactively introducing renewable energy as part of our response to environmental protection issues in Europe. Furthermore, we are sorting our plant waste and continually working to reduce the amount of waste we produce. At the same time, we are uncovering and supporting new suppliers and working to reduce CO2 generated during transportation by producing our products in closer proximity to our customers.
The kind of talent needed
Fortin: First of all, we need professionals who are highly adaptable to changes in our business and markets. Next, for issues that require us to respond globally, we need staff with the ability to compile information in their region and share that information with global members in a timely manner without hesitation. It may sound like a fairly simple matter, but a high degree of sensitivity and skill is needed to determine what information is needed by when in what region. Since developing talent with such high sensitivity and skill requires promoting personnel exchanges that cross business units and with other regions, we are now building a global framework to make this happen. Moreover, I am confident that we can make “Global One JTEKT” a reality if we have more members that have gained such experiences.
Davidson: I believe talented personnel who possess both a sense of ownership and self-motivation will lead JTEKT to success as a global company. In addition, people with the ability to look at regional requirements and have the skills to optimize by identifying domains that should be standardized and those that should be deliberately not standardized. Such skills will produce a competitive strength that gives due consideration to regional markets and cultures. For JTEKT to make a major advance from regional to global markets, we need to not only resolve the issues that may emerge from diversity but also have leaders with the skills to overcome such issues.
Issues facing regional management
Davidson: I believe raising the pace of our technological development is the most important issue we face when we consider the rapidly changing competitive environment of recent years. Our customers in the automotive industry are looking for the “next” technology, so they are shifting their resources to address the changes that lie ahead. This shift in resources means that even if we invest in and expand sales in our existing portfolio, our customers may not require such products in their next model or generation. Therefore, we must move quickly to start development of new technologies and transition to a business model in which we grow sales in both established and new product lines. Furthermore, what customers are thinking about “next” varies by region, so we must be diligent in sharing information on regional needs within the Group.
Fortin: When looking at JTEKT from a global perspective, it is clear that there are some overlapping organizations and functions. We need to visualize and optimize these while efficiently utilizing the technological and manufacturing capabilities JTEKT has as a whole. We at JTEKT have much to learn from one another in each region. I believe we need to continue to discuss what we should do and where we should do it in order to optimize the organization and its functions.
Governance
Davidson: Given the advances in globalization in our business environment recently, it is clear that to be global ourselves we need to build governance structures in each of our regions. This means observing strict compliance with laws and regulations in each country and managing it with the proper decision-making process. Toward this end, executives and directors must have a strong mind-set and act with a focus on governance and control. Fortin: I think an appropriate level of regional delegation is necessary in regional governance. This is because given the complex cultural environments and our ever-diversifying customer base, the people on the ground locally are best positioned to deal with any issues that arise. I believe the “One JTEKT” we are striving to achieve can be attained by augmenting each other’s strengths and establishing strong and stable regional governance that works in harmony in the region regardless of country, language, religion, or culture. Therefore, each region needs to strengthen its governance structure and its capabilities in monozukuri (building excellent products).
Hopes for the future
Fortin: To adapt agilely to changes and advances in our business, I would like to build a true JTEKT organization with a JTEKT mind-set in Europe as a company that lives and breathes monozukuri and can respond with the best technologies and resources. I will strive to create an organization and culture that stimulates the motivation of our employees and leads to “value building.” Davidson: I am confident that the “value” in “value building” can be defined by our clients, employees, and shareholders as well as the people living in our communities. I aim to create an organization that can deliver the value expected of us under that definition in an efficient and sustainable way.

With regard to the analysis and evaluation of the efficacy of the Board of Directors, the Members of Audit & Supervisory Board monitor the “efficacy of important meetings, including the Board of Directors” and the Board of Directors Secretariat implements a “survey on the efficacy of the Board of Directors” (once per year) targeting members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board and conducts quantitative evaluations with regard to the “roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors”
Analysis and Evaluation Process
• Audit of “efficacy of important meetings, including the Board of Directors” by the Members of Audit & Supervisory Board
Improvements to the management meeting are reported.
• Implementation of “survey on the efficacy of the Board of Directors” by the Board and Directors Secretariat (once per year)
If any improvements are necessary, review the meeting structure and management as appropriate.
and the “systems and operations that support the efficacy of the Board of Directors.”
In fiscal 2018, in an effort to improve efficacy, JTEKT added management themes other than those cases introduced at Board of Directors’ meetings and shared this information with the aim of enhancing the function of the Liaison Meeting for Outside Directors and Members of the Audit & Supervisory Board, leading to livelier discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings. In terms of Board of Directors’ meeting operations, while we are cognizant of the need for certain improvements, overall the meetings are generally functioning properly and we have determined that the efficacy of the Board of Directors overall is maintained.

(Appointed in June 2019)
     Remuneration for directors consists of monthly amounts and bonuses, and is conducted through a remuneration system that reflects work responsibilities and performance, and is linked to company performance. Bonuses are composed of STI*1 and LTI*2 and evaluated based on single-year consolidated operating income, sales growth rate, and profitability ratio according to the Medium-term Business Plan. Individual bonuses are examined at the Executive Remuneration Meeting, consisting of representative directors and independent outside directors, and determined through a resolution by the Board of Directors.
Remuneration for members of the Audit & Supervisory Board consists of monthly payments, and does not include bonus payments. This system for remuneration is not greatly influenced
by company performance and is therefore ensured independence from management.
Monthly amounts of remuneration for directors and other remuneration are set within the upper limit for total remunerations based on the decision of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2012. Monthly amounts of remuneration for each director are decided by the Board of Directors, and monthly amounts of remuneration for each member of the Audit & Supervisory Board are decided through consultation with the members.
1. Short-term incentive: Remuneration system that rewards single-year performance and achievements
2. Long-term incentive: Remuneration system that rewards performance and achievements over the medium to long term

In addition, we clarify systems and roles of relevant departments to subsidiary management, guiding and cultivating
subsidiaries from both business and function perspectives.
With regard to major subsidiaries, the Board of Directors formulates basic policies on internal control system maintenance and is instructed to periodically confirm the operating status of
these systems.
Overview of Evaluation Results
In fiscal 2018, although it was recognized that there was a need for improvement regarding the pre-distribution timing and simplification of mate- rials, the overall function was generally appropri- ate and the Board of Directors was evaluated as being effective overall.

Risk management
Basic Approach Enhancing corporate value and meeting the expectations of society
To maintain and strengthen fundamentals (corporate foundation) while responding quickly to changes in the management environment and sustainably enhancing corporate value, we are working to improve our risk management promotion system that ascertains, evaluates, and appropriately promotes measures with respect to critical risks faced by the entire JTEKT Group.
Compliance
Basic Approach All employees exhibit correct judgment and conduct in line with corporate ethics.
JTEKT positions compliance as the premise and foundation of corporate value, therefore it is essential to realizing our corporate philosophy. Believing that compliance is not merely about observing laws but also fulfilling our social responsibility in accordance

Promotion system
The companywide Council for Enhancement of Corporate Value regularly reviews risks, including those in the external environment, having the potential to affect business activities, society, and the environment. In October 2017, we established a new system in which the Compliance Officer (CO) was transitioned into the Risk Management Officer (RO) in order to strengthen our risk prevention efforts. In addition to deploying risk management in each department and Group company, risk management will be integrated into activities related to corporate governance and compliance to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of activities aimed at controlling risks globally.
Clarification of risk appraisals and response
At JTEKT, we allocate risk management departments for each risk item. The Risk Management Department promotes the formulation of response plans and polices to prevent and reduce the manifestation of risks through the Risk Management Working Group, which is an organization directly under the supervision of the Council for Enhancement of Corporate Value.
with corporate ethics, JTEKT has established the Ethics Code for
Training and awareness activities
JTEKT conducts ongoing training and awareness-raising activities targeting its directors, employees, and all Group companies regarding how compliance is deeply intertwined with its operations. We conduct annual workshops targeting our key corporate compliance officers (directors, auditors, managing officers, etc.). The theme for our fiscal 2018 workshop was the prevention of systematic fraud such as the falsification of quality data. We provided participants with the opportunity to refresh their awareness on these issues through a lecture by outside lawyers and other experts. Moreover, every July is declared “Risk Management Strengthening Month,” during which the president sends out a message to all JTEKT employees, including those at JTEKT Group companies, and compliance training materials are distributed for e-learning and workplace reference in an effort to support compliance activities in each workplace. Even within internal training planned by our HR Department, we address compliance issues so that each employee can take the necessary precautions suitable to their rank and job type.
Antimonopoly law, corruption prevention
In light of global trends placing importance on fairness in trading and the current situation in terms of stricter regulations and enforcement, JTEKT places particular importance on compliance with antimonopoly laws, competition laws in each country, and laws relating to corruption and bribery with JTEKT and its Group companies, products, and business transactions.
Compliance inspections
At JTEKT, we conduct regular inspections targeting all internal departments and JTEKT Group companies to assess the management status regarding compliance affecting our operations.
Directors and Officers, the Compliance Rules, and other guidelines.
Internal reporting consultation desks
To enable a fine-tuned response to each consultation case, JTEKT has established the Corporate Ethics Consultation Desk and several other consultation desks aimed at the prevention, early detection, and recurrence prevention of scandals. Consultation desks have been individually established in JTEKT Group companies.
Role of the Internal Reporting Consultation Desks
  Person reporting
    Corporate Ethics Consultation Desk
    Thorough adherence to immediate reporting
From fiscal 2015, we broadened the scope of our immediate reporting system, which requires prompt reporting after identifying compliance issues and even with regard to non- compliance risks, and ensure that operational rules are in place to quickly issue initial reports after risks are uncovered.
Strengthening risk perspectives in each division
For each division to autonomously handle risks, the annual execution plan formulated on a division level incorporates response to potential risks that may inhibit the fulfillment of the said plan and this promotes prevention of risk manifestation and remedial measures by each division independently.

  An Interview with Outside Directors
 Toward JTEKT’s sustained growth
We interviewed two outside directors for their views regarding what initiatives should be implemented to ensure the JTEKT Group achieves sustainable improvement of its corporate value on a global basis.
   JTEKT’s governance is genchi genbutsu (go and see for yourself).
Miyatani: Recently in particular I get the impression that President Agata is displaying strong leadership. What stands out to me is his speaking directly to employees through his visits to inspect plants and meet with affiliated companies as well as the repeated messages he has made to all staff via the company newsletter and other channels. Furthermore, I think it is excellent to see that not only a medium-term business plan has been formulated but also the Beyond Medium-term Business Plan, which focuses on the company that JTEKT wants to be in 2030.
Okamoto: In recent years, we have seen a succession of renowned Japanese companies involved in misconduct. Looking at the press coverage of these incidents, a lack of free and open discussion and communication is often cited as a cause. At JTEKT, in contrast, at the management level and within plants and business units, there is active communication and I get the impression that there is a very positive atmosphere. In addition, clarifying its philosophy and vision and having these permeate through the company are also what I consider to be the admirable and strong points of JTEKT.
The other day I visited a plant as part of an inspection team. Young team leaders at the plant confidently gave presentations on improvement activities and on new businesses. Even here, the staff displayed a clear recognition of their mission within the vision that JTEKT is aiming for. I saw that company policies were being cascaded through the organization and it gave me the impression that this was the foundation of sound governance at JTEKT. Miyatani: The concept of genchi genbutsu has been instilled from long ago at Toyota Group companies. While it seems obvious to discuss an issue while witnessing it firsthand, but as a company grows in size it becomes more difficult for senior management to fully understand the situation at the front lines. If you go and see for yourself, it is simple to spot excess inventories, defects, and the like, so I would like the company to continue to place value on such activities going forward. In addition, staff at the front lines should escalate even uncomfortable issues to senior management and not keep them to themselves or attempt to hide them. Companies that are able to do this are strong ones.
President Agata receives direct feedback from young leaders on current conditions and kaizen (continuous improvement) initiatives
related to safety, quality, waste, CO2 emissions, and the like during these plant inspections. He himself has sharp insights, asks questions, and encourages commendable initiatives be implemented at other plants in the Group. I think this is a highly valuable activity for a manufacturer to be doing.
Leveraging core technologies and expressing JTEKT’s strengths
Okamoto: JTEKT’s strengths are its diverse range of core technologies, spanning bearings to machine tools, controllers, and electronics. That said, it is important to properly pass down these core technologies, particularly as we are on the cusp of a generational change. In addition, I believe JTEKT should take up the challenge of developing new technologies and business models for the future since we are now facing a transformation in the automotive industry that occurs only once in a century. Miyatani: Today, innovation using IoT, big data, AI, robotics, and the like is occurring at tremendous speed around the world. For JTEKT to continue growing briskly both in its domestic and global markets, I believe it is extremely important for it to create a business to provide its customers with new solutions by skillfully combining its proprietary technologies for making things efficiently with such leading-edge technologies as IoT and AI.
Furthermore, I also feel JTEKT should not try to do everything on its own when conducting new businesses, but strengthen its capabilities in open innovation and partner with specialists in various fields to create value. Amid change in the market structure, I believe it is necessary to invest dynamically in new areas that promise growth and develop these businesses with a sense of urgency.
Issues facing JTEKT as a global company
Okamoto: I believe JTEKT is at the stage now where it can continue to grow its business in the world’s major markets as a global player. It is therefore more important than before to have finely tuned antennae to capture trends and sudden changes in each of the markets it serves. In this regard, I believe the talent pool across the company needs to be strengthened with professionals in each market who are adept at doing business together with local people who have their own unique history, culture, and customs.
In addition, I look forward to the proactive assignment of personnel such that staff with deep roots in each field can play a more important role in JTEKT. By doing so I expect the JTEKT family around the world will work as one and give full expression to its strengths.
Miyatani: Recently, there has been active personnel exchanges within JTEKT, such as giving managers experience as the presidents of overseas affiliates and then bringing them back to Japan to lead as plant managers. I consider this to be an incredibly effective way to develop talent.
Okamoto: Many of JTEKT’s executives have experience working abroad. I see them being at ease in conversing with local staff and thinking about issues together. That said, I think more can be done in this area, and continuing to strengthen the pool of talent working around the world remains an important issue.
Mission as an outside director
Miyatani: There are many companies both in Japan and worldwide that display exemplary management. I consider it my mission to provide stimulus to JTEKT’s management team by talking to its executives about what I have learned about such companies through reading books and adding in my own experience as an executive.
Okamoto: Free trade has been the basic driver of the global economy up to now. However, the environment bears watching closely for the time being as there may be a change that incorporates geopolitical elements. I will work closely with the executive team at JTEKT and relevant parties to exchange views on the global economy and its attendant risks while making use of the experience I have gained over the course of my career. I would like to continue contributing to the growth of the JTEKT Group, primarily in the areas of governance and risk management.

This year, besides making some requests concerning the strengthening of CSR and thorough implementation of safety measures, we also explained the key implementation items for the current year, and awards were presented in various categories, including the newly established VE / VA solutions category. The JTEKT Cooperation Council Workshop included a quality management meeting, training session, lectures, and a new disaster mitigation study meeting. The aim of the workshop was to build relationships of mutual trust among council members and to strengthen enterprise fundamentals.
Holding meetings with suppliers about their problems
JTEKT began holding meetings with suppliers about their problems in fiscal 2017, and as of September 2018 we had arranged opportunities for approximately 200 suppliers to discuss any difficulties that they were encountering in their transactions with JTEKT. We are striving to make improvements based on the views expressed by suppliers. Follow-up meetings have been held, and we will continue to implement this initiative in the future.
Implementation of a combined procurement meeting in India
In May 2018, the JTEKT Group held its first procurement policy presentation in India since the merging of the procurement functions of our three local subsidiaries in India: JTEKT India Ltd., Koyo Bearings India Private Ltd., and JTEKT Sona Automotive India Ltd. Besides explanations of JTEKT’s procurement policy, current market trends, and the company’s quality strategy, there was also a Q&A session; the aim of which was to provide an opportunity for suppliers to develop a better understanding of the future activities of the “new” JTEKT India.

Fiscal 2018 was the sixth year of this initiative and a total of ¥2,478,384 was raised in donations. The money raised was do- nated to nine volleyball teams in five schools in Kesennuma City and Minamisanriku, as well as the Kesennuma Asobiba Community Organiza-
tion, to support their ac- tivities.
Initiatives aimed at fostering harmony with nature
The Tokyo Plant has signed an agreement with the Tokyo Environmental Public Service Corporation and with NPO Yokosawairi Tanbo no Kai, and in April 2018 the plant began participating in environmental protection activities in the Yokosawairi Satoyama Conservation Zone in Tokyo. Tokyo Greenship Action is an initiative whereby local residents, NPOs, business enterprises, and government agencies collaborate to help safeguard the priceless natural heritage of Tokyo’s remaining forests and satoyama (traditional community-managed forest) landscapes. In the future,
Aiming for highly transparent management
We strive to secure transparency in our management and to build long-term relationships of trust with all our shareholders and investors.
In terms of information disclosure relating to management, naturally we comply with rules relating to legal disclosure and timely disclosure. As well, in order to increase the transparency of our management and help shareholders and investors to deepen their understanding of JTEKT and the JTEKT Group, we also proactively disclose information voluntarily in a fair, timely, and appropriate manner through various investor relations (IR) activities.
JTEKT bond ratings
Expanding opportunities for dialogue
At the financial results briefing for analysts and institutional investors that was held in May 2019, the president and relevant company officers engaged in direct dialogue with analysts and institutional investors regarding the current status of JTEKT’s various businesses. We are endeavoring to ensure that the views expressed by analysts and institutional investors during this dialogue are reflected in our business activities.
Shareholder returns policy
JTEKT’s basic approach is to strive to enhance the company’s corporate value on an ongoing basis, and to provide stable dividends over the long term. While the management of the company does attach due importance to enhancing return on assets (ROA), we emphasize not only ROA but also return on equity (ROE), and by improving the efficiency of asset utilization and boosting profitability, we aim both to maintain the financial soundness of the company and to facilitate the steady return of value to shareholders.
The automotive industry is entering a period of dramatic structural transformation. Besides implementing an adequate amount of necessary forward-looking investment, we believe we have an obligation to our investors to maintain the stable, long-term operation of the company into the future, so that we can continue to issue dividends.

TOGETHER WITH SOCIETY
Toward setting targets for 2030
In order to realize the goal of minimizing CO2 emissions that was stated in Environmental Challenge 2050, JTEKT has set intermediate goals in the form of interim targets for 2030.
Initiatives for reducing water consumption
 Our approach toward setting an overall emissions
target for 2030
We have set our overall emissions target for 2030 in line with the goal of staying within a 2°C increase from pre-industrial levels, which was agreed on at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris.
Target value
We have set a global target of reducing overall CO2 emissions by 26% compared to fiscal 2013. Within Japan, by prioritizing the reduction of energy consumption through production technology innovation and day-to-day improvements, we are aiming to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 35% compared to fiscal 2013.
Scenario analysis in regard to climate change
In relation to our setting of overall CO2 emission reduction target for 2030, we have been utilizing the climate change scenario analysis framework developed by the TCFD*3 to evaluate climate- related risks and opportunities, and review our medium-term objectives.
*3 The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established by Japan’s Financial Stability Board (FSB) to encourage business enterprises to use the TCFD’s climate change scenarios to adjust business strategy and risk management based on the results of assessment of the climate-related risks and opportunities for the individual enterprise in question, and to disclose the anticipated impact on the enterprise’s finances.

[Conversion coefficient used to calculate CO2 emissions]
With regard to the management of CO2 emissions per unit of production output in the period up until 2020, we have adopted a conversion coefficient that facilitates assessment of the results achieved in the company’s improvement efforts.
For overall emissions management in the period from 2021 onward, to ensure that CO2 emissions data more closely reflects the actual situation, calculation is performed using the market-based conversion coefficient specified by the individual electric power company for the year in question.
Concrete measures adopted in fiscal 2018
Measures to reduce CO2 emissions through production technology innovation (Development of energy-saving equipment)
We are working to reduce CO2 emissions through production technology innovation, with the aim of meeting our CO2 emissions reduction target for fiscal 2020 (which is to reduce emissions by 50% compared to fiscal 2001).
In addition to realizing efficient utilization of water resources by improving water consumption per unit of production output, starting from 2017 JTEKT has also been assessing the level of water risk at each of its business locations, using Aqueduct*4.
In the future, when working to reduce water usage, we will strive to ensure the effective utilization of water resources by implementing measures based on water risk assessment results— including forecasts—and on actual water consumption and water dependency levels at each facility.
*4 Aqueduct is a database run by the World Resources Institute (WRI). It provides global maps and data showing various types of water risk, including physical water stress, water quality, regulatory risk relating to water resources, reputation risk, etc.
Implementing measures to reduce underground water consumption (Bearing Business Headquarters, Tokushima Plant)
As a measure to reduce consumption of underground water, starting from fiscal 2018 JTEKT’s Tokushima Plant has been taking steps to recycle the cooling water used in heat treatment. Prior to this, because the cooling water circuit for heat treatment equipment functioned as a closed circuit, water was discharged into a nearby river after use.
A cyclical system has now been adopted to reduce underground water consumption, focusing in particular on the heat treatment equipment at five plants, which had a particularly high level of water consumption (28,000 m3 per month). In fiscal 2018, countermeasures were implemented for two sets of heat treatment equipment and five sets of conversion furnaces, realizing a reduction in underground water consumption of 14,690 m3 per month (176,280 m3 per year), representing a year-on-year improvement of 20%. Regarding countermeasures for the remaining heat treatment furnaces in fiscal 2019, it is anticipated that the adoption of cyclical systems will be completed for all five plants’ heat treatment equipment.
On the basis of the water risk assessment results of various JTEKT production locations around the world, India and the Dalian region of China were assessed as having the highest level of water risk.
Based on surveys of actual water consumption and the overall state of water usage in regions with high water risk, in India, where there is a problem with unsatisfactory water quality, reverse osmosis (RO) equipment has been adopted so that water quality can be improved before water is supplied to production processes. As the actual amount of water consumed by JTEKT’s business operations in areas with high water risk is relatively low (172,000 m3 in India and 187,000 m3 in China), it was determined that the level of risk associated with water usage was limited.
We are currently working to reduce water consumption at JTEKT’s Tokushima Plant in Japan and at JTEKT AUTOMOTIVE LYON S.A.S. in France, which have been using relatively large amounts of underground water and river water.

Intensive investment is needed to support sustainable growth of the Company. We are currently building a solid financial base to make this possible.
            Kazuhisa Makino Executive Director
         For JTEKT to continue its sustainable growth, we must help resolve social issues through our business activities.
Toward that end, the finance division works to build a strong financial base to support such business activities as R&D, improved productivity, and building professionals.
Investment Strategy
JTEKT’s business environment is at a major turning point. We are now at the stage where we must plant the seeds of our future by taking a long-term view of what JTEKT needs in order to realize sustainable growth. We need to make aggressive forward-looking investments to strengthen our management infrastructure in such areas as R&D, IT, and building professionals. In particular, the transformation in the automotive industry encapsulated in the acronyms CASE*1 and MaaS*2 represents both the biggest risks and opportunities for JTEKT. We will continue to invest aggressively in R&D and new business development to capture growth opportunities created by these changes. As the CFO, I will support business activities by fully reviewing the need for investment and associated potential returns. After organizing these plans in a manner that is readily visible to management, I will work to secure funding for R&D and alliances as well as consider a variety of investment methods to support JTEKT’s business activities.
Furthermore, with regard to the global market, we expect continued growth in Asia and Africa and anticipate considerable business opportunities in those regions. To cite one example, we have made a publicly listed company in India in the Steering business into a JTEKT subsidiary. I believe we should continue to make such strategic investments in a dynamic manner going forward.
With respect to investments in other companies including through M&A, we will support planning and implementation and the provision of funding. At the same time, I believe we need to strengthen our function for formulating exit strategies, looking carefully at the timing to recoup investments and, as the case may be, the timing to withdraw.
To implement such strategic investments, our policy is to shrink business assets and secure the funding necessary for management with good asset efficiency while minimizing our interest-bearing debt balance. We will not only be managing profitability as part of business administration but also promoting business management that is focused on the balance sheet and cash flows through such measures as monitoring the cash conversion cycle and introducing asset efficiency metrics for each business.
Capital Strategy
       The JTEKT Group is currently working to shrink its interest-bearing debt balance. In addition, we have proactively introduced cash management systems*3 with hubs in each regional headquarters and are conducting financing on a cross-border basis to raise capital efficiency of the Group as a whole. We consider such activities to be increasingly important for controlling interest rate expenses, particularly as countries around the world are changing their low interest rate policies.
Meanwhile, we maintain a certain level of working capital in preparation for unforeseen circumstances given the significant latent risks inherent in the JTEKT Group’s business environment. For the Group as a whole, we have built a structure in which the headquarters holds an appropriate level of working capital while reducing net interest-bearing debt on a consolidated basis. We are thus able to quickly supply funds from the headquarters to Group companies as and when needed.
As a result of such activities, our interest-bearing debt balance is currently higher than it was five years ago, but this reflects an intentional increase in working capital and in fact our net interest- bearing debt balance decreased. I think it is commendable that we have generated a degree of success in responding to one-off demand for funding for loan repayments, M&A investment, capital investment, and the like by generating cash flows from operating activities and working to create funds by trimming the balance sheet.
We intend to continue these activities going forward. I believe even more efficient and advantageous fundraising will be possible by continuing such activities and by concentrating capital management functions at the Group and at regional headquarters.
Cost Strategy
The JTEKT Group is currently working to improve its cost structure to strengthen its earning power, including bringing its fixed costs to appropriate levels. The Group has a global footprint and therefore has, for example, R&D and purchasing functions in each region tailored to the local market environment and local management issues. While giving due recognition to local nuances, we are working to manage fixed costs at appropriate levels for each region and thus improve the efficiency of indirect divisions in the Group as a whole.

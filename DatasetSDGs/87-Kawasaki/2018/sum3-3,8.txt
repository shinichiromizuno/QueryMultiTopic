We will address issues related to an aging society and labor shortage, particularly evident in developed countries, through the use of robot technologies.

In developed countries where the aging of society is increasingly noticeable, making it easier for peo- ple to access high-quality medical care through the development of medical robots, and using robot technology to support prescription drug production, nursing and medical care and everyone in the field of healthcare who develops therapies and treatments that reduce the physical burden on patients.

Developing and manufac- turing robots that collabo- rate with humans in work operations and making them intelligent enough to create solutions to the labor shortages that are particularly evident in developed countries.

We positioned medical robots as a business that will sup- port an aging society, established Medicaroid Corpora- tion—a joint venture with Sysmex Corporation—and are now engaged in development of Robotically Assisted Sur- gical Device and applied robots using industrial robot technology with the goal of creating new businesses. We also seek to promote collaboration with humans in work operations, with an emphasis on duAro—our dual-armed SCARA robot—and cultivate demand for greater automa- tion at manufacturing sites.

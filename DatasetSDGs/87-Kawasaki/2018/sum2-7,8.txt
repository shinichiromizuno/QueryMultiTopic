Kawasaki seeks to create clean energy by establishing a CO2-free hydrogen energy supply chain designed to reduce environmental risk on a global scale.

Providing equipment, such as hydrogen bases, liquefaction systems, carriers, and hydrogen-fuel gas turbines, and contributing to the development of a hydrogen society as a supplier of liquefied hydrogen transport infrastructure systems and packages.

We are working with partner companies to
develop strategic technology for a hydrogen
energy supply chain. It is a journey that begins
with hydrogen production and liquefaction (manufacturing) from Australian brown coal—an unused resource—and renewable energy, then moves to loading and unloading liquefied hydrogen at land depots and between ships and transporting the liquid in large quantities by sea (trans- port), stockpiling liquefied hydrogen (storage) and finally applying hydrogen in gas turbine power generation (use) perfectly optimized to the characteristics of this fuel.

The application of carbon dioxide capture and storage—a process for capturing CO2 generated when hydrogen is produced from fossil fuel—makes it possible to use hydro- gen as a clean energy source that minimizes the output of CO2 through all stages of the supply chain.

The hydrogen chain that Kawasaki and its partners seek to build will, if realized, do more than just ensure access to a stable form of clean energy in large quantities. It has the potential to greatly reduce CO2 emissions.

Operating Environment and Strategies
Against a backdrop of economic development in emerging countries and transport infrastructure repair and rebuild work under way in developed countries, demand for roll- ing stock remains strong, especially overseas. At the same time, demand in recurring revenue businesses, including components and maintenance, is expanding. However, the entry of manufacturers based in emerging countries has intensified competition, necessitating approaches to boost profitability through enhanced non-price competitiveness and business model reform.
This business recorded significant losses in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. Taking this very seriously, we estab- lished the Rolling Stock Business Restructuring Committee, chaired by the president, to drasti-
cally reinforce project management and improve quality control.
Furthermore, based on a policy of putting quality before quantity, we will focus on projects in which we can dem- onstrate Kawasaki’s superiority while expanding recur- ring revenue businesses in Japan, aiming to increase profitability, which has been an issue.
In the North American market, we will steadily fulfill existing orders from such customers as the New York City Department of Transportation. We will also work to build a stable revenue base by commercializing track monitoring using IoT and focusing on such businesses as components, repair and rebuild, and maintenance.
The Asian market presents huge growth potential. In this market, we will seek business expansion through such means as securing orders for projects financed by
ODA loans in emerging countries in line with the Japanese govern-
ment’s policies of promoting exports of railway infrastructure.

Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Rolling Stock Company has designated as its vision for 2030 helping to build better global transportation infrastructure by manufacturing rolling stock that is safe and comfortable to ride in, highly reliable, highly cost efficient over its life cycle, and energy saving to minimize the burden on the environment. To this end, we will pro- mote participation in high-speed train projects at home and abroad and continue to provide rolling stock to cus- tomers in Japan, North America, and Asia while seeking to participate in projects to build new rolling stock infra- structure in emerging Asian countries. In addition, to
better meet customer needs, we will further develop monitoring technologies that combine sensing, image analysis, and IoT technologies; work to maintain and improve safety and dependability; improve train mainte- nance efficiency; and contribute to the realization of train systems boasting excellent cost efficiency over their entire life cycle.Goals for the MTBP 2019

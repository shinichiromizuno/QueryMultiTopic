Opportunities Risks
  • Growing demand for energy and infrastructure in emerging and resource-rich countries
• Growing demand for distributed gas-fueled power generation facilities prompted by lower LNG fuel prices
• Tightening environmental regulations
• Demand to build new or replace various power generation facil- ities following the Great East Japan Earthquake
• Demand for infrastructure replacement in Japan ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
Business Direction under MTBP 2019
• Delayed projects due to prolonged slump in price of oil
• Weakening investment incentive paralleling economic slowdowns in emerging countries and resource-rich countries
• Prolonged slump in the shipping market
  Core Competence• Ability to provide solutions leveraging synergy from combining Kawasaki-brand products, such as the combined cycle power plant (CCPP) standard package, which combines a gas turbine, steam turbine, and waste heat recovery boiler, as well as gas engine/gas turbine hybrid projects
• Environment-friendly technologies and development capabilities in core products and systems as well as compre- hensive engineering capabilities developed through wide-ranging projects
• Locally rooted sales system leveraging overseas sites
• Create new technologies, products, and added value that contributes to reducing environmental burden
• Reinforce project responsiveness by effectively utilizing and sharing resources
• Advance overseas business development through initiatives closely tailored to local communities and customers and build a foundation for future earnings growth

        Operating Environment and Strategies
In the energy and marine sectors, demand for gas-fired power generation is expanding, and distributed power generation needs are also increasing, especially in Asia. In this business environment, we will accelerate business development based on system solutions combining core products to achieve business growth, especially on the sales front in Southeast Asia.
In the plant sector, we anticipate stable domestic and overseas demand, reflecting infrastructure development and heightened interest in environmental protection, especially in emerging countries, including those in Southeast Asia. However, price competition is fierce, and finding ways to sharpen cost-competitiveness is an issue that requires our attention. In this environment, we aim to secure orders by providing unique, high-value-added
Gas-to-gasoline (GTG) plant
products and strengthening our sales systems and main- tenance and after-sales services. When bidding for orders, we will be more selective, emphasizing profitabil- ity over scale. We will also reinforce quality assurance and risk management systems to reduce costs from defective products and improve profitability.
Furthermore, aiming to expand sales of the CCPP stan- dard package, which combines a Kawasaki gas turbine, steam turbine and waste heat recovery boiler, we will reinforce our overseas sales systems. We are also advancing investment in hydrogen-related projects and product development aimed at future business growth and the realization of a carbon-free society. To this end, we plan to begin operations of a pilot hydrogen supply chain in 2020.
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Energy System & Plant Engineering Company has desig- nated as its vision for 2030 being a distinctive equipment, system, and plant manufacturer that uses technologies and quality underpinned by sophisticated product development expertise, manufacturing technology, and engineering know-how to globally provide products and services that help protect the environment and earn high customer satis- faction, mainly in are areas of energy and the environment.
To achieve this vision, we aim to advance both economic growth and environmental protection by providing energy- saving, highly resource-efficient equipment, such as gas tur- bines that realize the world’s highest level of efficiency and environmental performance, gas engines that realize the
world’s highest level of performance, and other power gen- eration facilities. We are working to combine core products and incorporate in-house know-how, reinforce our ability to handle overseas projects, and create new solutions. We will contribute to infrastructure improvement by providing such products as tunnel boring machines and cryogenic storage facilities while also contributing to environmental protec- tion in urban areas through deliveries of energy-saving waste incinerators, water treatment facilities, desulfuriza- tion/denitrification devices, and other systems.

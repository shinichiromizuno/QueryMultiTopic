Precision Machinery Business Division
The Precision Machinery Business Division has designat- ed the following as its vision for 2030.
• Make Kawasaki hydraulic machinery and systems the
global standard by expanding sales to customers around
the world and achieve stable production and supply
• Support the development of next-generation of human-
and environment-friendly construction machinery through Kawasaki products to contribute to the improve- ment of infrastructure, mainly in emerging countries
• Promote the development and sale of energy-saving products, hydrogen-oriented products and renewable energy-oriented products to contribute to the reduction of environmental burden
• Combine new technologies, such as ICT, IoT and AI, with Kawasaki’s robot technology and hydraulic control technology to create new value
Hydraulic pump for construction machinery
To achieve this vision, we are working to establish sys- tems for stable production and supply and advancing R&D into hydraulics systems aimed at creating ICT-linked, automated and unmanned next-generation construction machinery for customers while advancing product devel- opment and sales in the pursuit of full-scale entry into agricultural machinery and industrial vehicle sectors. In addition, following the adoption of our high-pressure hydrogen regulator by a European automaker, we
have commenced primary mass-production and are
now advancing development toward secondary mass- production. Also of note, total sales of Eco-Servo, an energy-saving and low-noise hydraulic hybrid system, have reached 4,000 units, and we are working on a com- pact electro-hydraulic actuator for humanoid robots, as well.

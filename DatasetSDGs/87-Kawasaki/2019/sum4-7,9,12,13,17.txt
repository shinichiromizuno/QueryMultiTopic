Yoshinori Mochida
President,
Ship & Offshore Structure Company
   Opportunities
• Increasing demand for vessels with low environmental burden due to tightened environmental regulations
• Recovery in carrier demand, owing to growing demand for LNG
• Greater automation, using IoT and AI
• Expanding operations to meet needs for an increasing fleet of submarines
Risks
• Increasingly fierce competition with China and South Korea
• Prolonged slump in shipping market
  Core Competence• Low-temperature and high-pressure gas-related technologies accumulated through the development and construc- tion of LNG and LPG carriers
• Quality and cost competitiveness of the overall Group, including Chinese joint ventures (NACKS, DACKS*)
• Energy-saving, environmental burden-reducing technologies, and ability to develop new ship designs
• Sophisticated technology specific to submarines
* NACKS, DACKS: Shipbuilding joint ventures established in Nantong, Jiangsu Province and Dalian, Liaoning Province, with China COSCO Shipping Corporation Limited (China COSCO)

    Operating Environment and Strategies
For two years—fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016—this business segment booked sizable losses, prompting business struc- ture reforms led by the president. The basic policy driving these reforms is to maintain gas-related vessels as our main business while moving the axis of merchant ship construction from Japan to China. We have made steady progress in reducing fixed costs in Japan and increasing
Jetfoil
our construction capacity in China. As large-scale LNG projects that had been stalled begin to firm up and various environmental regulations tighten, the market is expected to improve, and we aim to continue structural reforms.
In the merchant ship business, we will concentrate domestic construction at the Sakaide Works and reinforce base functions, such as human resource development and engineering, while promoting greater integration of opera- tions with our Chinese joint ventures through such approaches as taking orders together and dividing con- struction between us. These efforts will help sharpen our cost competitiveness and improve profitability. In addition, we will pursue sales expansion of our ship operation and performance analysis support system (SOPass), which com- bines ship-related knowledge accumulated by Kawasaki with big data technology. In addition, we will steadily the advance development of liquefied hydrogen carriers.
In the submarine business, we will reinforce our R&D framework, aiming to secure orders for next-generation submarines. At the same time, we will apply our accumu- lated wealth of submarine-related technologies to the development of such products as autonomous under water vehicles (AUVs).
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Ship & Offshore Structure Company is contributing to environmental conservation by promoting the spread of LNG-fueled ships and developing and building large hydrogen-fueled liquefied hydrogen carriers. Compared with heavy oil, the use of LNG enables substantial reduc- tions in emissions of atmospheric pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SOx). By develop- ing and building a variety of LNG-fueled vessels, we are helping to meet NOx and SOx emissions regulations for ships to prevent air pollution over the sea. Furthermore, we are providing our LNG-fueled propulsion systems for ships constructed by other shipbuilders, and working to commercialize LNG fuel gas supply systems (FGSSs) to
promote the operation of environmentally friendly LNG- fueled vessels around the world. We are also developing high-capacity liquefied hydrogen carriers. As hydrogen emits no CO2 when used as fuel, it is the ultimate in clean energy. By commercializing the world’s first ships that can economically carry large volumes of hydrogen, Kawasaki will promote the spread of hydrogen energy and contribute to the realization of a CO2 emission-free society. In addition, we are developing hydrogen-fueled ship propulsion systems.

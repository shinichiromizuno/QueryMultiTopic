Robot Business Division
The Robot Business Division has designated as its vision for 2030 improving access to high-quality medical care through the development of medical robots in developed countries facing demographic graying as well as using robot technology to support medical supplies production, nursing and medical care and the development of therapies and treatments that reduce the physical burden on patients while developing and manufacturing robots that collaborate with humans in work operations and making them intelli- gent enough to help address labor shortages, mainly in developed countries. To achieve this vision, we have
positioned medical robots as a business that will support aging societies and established Medicaroid Corporation—a joint venture with Sysmex Corporation—through which we are developing robotically assisted surgical devices and applied robots using industrial robot technology with the goal of creating new businesses. We also seek to promote collaboration with humans in work operations, focusing mainly on duAro—our Dual-Arm SCARA Robot—to cultivate demand for greater automation at manufacturing sites.

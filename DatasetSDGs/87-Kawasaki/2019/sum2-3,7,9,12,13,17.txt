Operating Environment and Strategies
As global air passenger and air freight volume expand over the medium to long term due to economic growth in emerging countries, we expect continued growth in demand for commercial aircraft and jet engines. In this operating environment, we will implement a range of strategies in pursuit of ongoing growth.
In the defense aircraft sector, we will move steadily toward mass production of the P-1 patrol aircraft and C-2 transport aircraft while seeking to capture orders for modernized and derivative types of aircraft. We will also export defense equipment in line with government policy.
In the commercial aircraft sector, we will further strengthen our relationship with Boeing and work to increase production capacity through streamlining using robotics and other means while advancing considerations of participation in next-generation aircraft programs.
In the jet engine sector, we will work to further stabilize quality, reduce costs, and reinforce supply chains for
projects in which we already participate while adopting IoT and other advanced technologies to improve produc- tivity. We will further reinforce our technological strengths in compressors, combustors, and gears—strategic components for Kawasaki—and use these strengths as a foundation for participating in new projects. In addition, we aim to gradually secure engine maintenance capabili- ties with a view to entering the MRO business.
In April 2018, Kawasaki integrated the former Aerospace Company and the jet engine business of the former Gas Turbine & Machinery Company, creating the Aerospace Systems Company. By inte-
grating our aerospace- related businesses, we
are looking to continue to reinforce cost competitive- ness, collaborate to expand business, and develop
The Aerospace Systems Company has designated as its vision for 2030 providing air transportation systems com- bining excellent environmental performance with excel- lent safety and reliability. To achieve this vision, we are participating in the development of Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft as well as jet engines, such as the Trent series and PW1100G-JM, to contribute to the steady supply of low fuel consumption aircraft and low fuel consumption engines. We will also focus on the production and sale of
be used in firefighting, disaster response, and ambulance services. Furthermore, we aim to participate in the joint international development of new, environmentally con- scious aircraft and engines and thereby contribute to environmental improvement.Goals for the MTBP 2019
• Provide environmentally conscious aircraft, helicopters, and engines and participate in new programs
• Produce components for Boeing 787
• Sales of BK117 units: Produce finished units and components
• Produce components for Trent 1000, Trent XWB and
PW1100G-JM low fuel consumption enginesFiscal 2018 Results• Components for Boeing 787: 146 units sold
• Sales of BK117 units: One finished unit and 79 components
• Produce components for Trent 1000, Trent XWB, and PW1100G-JM low fuel consumption engines 26 Kawasaki Report 2019

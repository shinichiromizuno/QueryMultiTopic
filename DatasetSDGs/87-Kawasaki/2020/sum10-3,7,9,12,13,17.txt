Vision
Guided by the “Kawasaki, working as one” philosophy, continue to grow as a manufacturer with primary focus on high-value-added domains in the power sports and general-purpose engine markets.
Operating Environment and Strategies
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook in our main- stay markets in Europe, the United States and Southeast Asia is unclear. Furthermore, conditions are growing more challenging, as raw materials costs and tariffs increase, reflecting U.S.-China trade tensions, and new manufactur- ers based in emerging countries enter markets. As such, Kawasaki needs to improve its productivity.
In this environment, we will anticipate the needs of customers and draw on world-class product develop- ment expertise and our strong, highly differentiated brands, such as Ninja, Z, MULE, and TERYX to quickly bring attractive, highly competitive models to market. At the same time, we will work to establish Kawasaki as a high-end brand through such means as customer relationship management. Furthermore, we will imple- ment initiatives aimed at establishing and strengthen- ing systems to control and streamline our global management resources from the perspective of overall optimization. By implementing this and other strate- gies, we will strengthen our financial platform (increase the operating income margin and free cash flow).
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Motorcycle & Engine Company has designated as its vision for 2030 developing, manufacturing and delivering environmentally friendly motorcycles, as well as models with “fun-to-ride” appeal and advanced rider-support features. To realize this vision, in line with the philosophy that drives product development at Kawasaki, the concepts of “Fun to Ride,” “Ease of Riding,” and “Better Environmental Performance,”
we are working to improve motorcycle performance, enhance rider-support features, and respond to tougher exhaust gas, noise, and other environmental regula- tions. Kawasaki aims to put motorcycles with C-ITS* functions and other advanced rider support functions on the market as soon as possible. In electric motorcy- cles, hybrid motorcycles, and other motorcycles pow- ered by clean energy, we are building and evaluating the performance of prototypes with an eye to future business development.

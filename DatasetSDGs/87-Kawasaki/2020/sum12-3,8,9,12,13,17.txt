The Robot Business Division has designated as its vision for 2030 improving access to high-quality medical care through the development of medical robots in developed countries facing demographic graying as well as using robot technology to support medical supplies production, nursing and medical care, and the development of thera- pies and treatments that reduce the physical burden on patients while developing and improving the intelligence of Successor, humanoid robots and other robots to help address labor shortages, mainly in developed countries. To achieve this vision, we have positioned medical robots as a business that will support aging societies and established
Medicaroid Corporation—a joint venture with Sysmex Corporation—through which we are working to create new business around robotically assisted surgical devices and applied robots using industrial robot technology. With regard to Successor, we have begun sales to specified customers and are developing a new market. We contin- ue to advance the development of humanoid robots, aiming for commercialization.

The Precision Machinery Business Division has designated the following as its vision for 2030.
• Make Kawasaki hydraulic machinery and systems the
global standard by expanding sales to customers around
the world and achieve stable production and supply
• Support the development of next-generation of human-
and environment-friendly construction machinery through Kawasaki products to contribute to the improve- ment of infrastructure, mainly in emerging countries
• Promote the development and sale of energy-saving products, hydrogen-oriented products and renewable energy-oriented products to contribute to the reduction of environmental burden
• Combine new technologies, such as ICT, IoT, and AI, with Kawasaki’s robot technology and hydraulic control tech- nology to create new value
To achieve this vision, we are working to establish sys- tems for stable production and supply and advancing R&D into hydraulics systems aimed at creating ICT-linked, auto- mated, and unmanned next-generation construction machinery for customers while advancing product devel- opment and sales in the pursuit of full-scale entry into agricultural machinery and industrial vehicle sectors. In addition, we are now mass-producing a high-pressure hydrogen regulator and advancing development toward secondary mass-production. Sales of Eco-Servo, an energy-saving, low-noise hydraulic hybrid system, have been strong, and we advancing the development of a compact electro-hydraulic actuator for humanoid robots, as well.

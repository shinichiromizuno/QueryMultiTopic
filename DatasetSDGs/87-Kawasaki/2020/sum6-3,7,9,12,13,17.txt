Operating Environment and Strategies
Global air passenger and air freight volume were expected to expand over the medium to long term, reflecting economic growth in emerging countries, but in fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused passen- ger demand to fall sharply, and recovery in the com- mercial aircraft and jet engine markets is expected to take several years. In this business environment, we will work toward further improvement in productivity and efficiency while aiming for quick recovery in busi- ness performance by implementing a variety of new initiatives (such as pursuing automatic PCR viral testing systems) not bound by our conventional businesses.
In the defense aircraft sector, we will move steadily toward mass production of the P-1 patrol aircraft and C-2 transport aircraft while seeking to capture orders for modernized and derivative types of aircraft. We will also export defense equipment in line with government policy.
In the commercial aircraft sector, we will work to improve productivity and efficiency in response to decreased aircraft demand while advancing considerations of participation in next-generation aircraft programs.
In the jet engine division, we will work to further sta- bilize quality, reduce costs, and reinforce supply chains for projects in which we already participate while adopting IoT and other advanced technologies to improve productivity.
We will further reinforce our technological strengths in compressors, combustors, and gears—strategic com- ponents for Kawasaki—and use these strengths as a foundation for participating in new projects. In addi- tion, we aim to gradually secure engine maintenance capabilities with a view to entering the MRO business.
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Aerospace Systems Company has designated as its vision for 2030 providing air transportation systems combining excellent environmental performance with excellent safety and reliability. To achieve this vision, we are participating in the development of Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft as well as jet engines, such as the Trent series and PW1100G-JM, to contribute to the steady supply of low fuel consumption aircraft and low fuel consumption engines. We will also focus on the production and sale of the BK117 low-noise helicopter, which is expected to be used in firefighting, disaster response, and ambulance services. Furthermore, we aim to participate in the joint international development of new, environmentally conscious aircraft and engines and thereby contribute to environmental improvement.

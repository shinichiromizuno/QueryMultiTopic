Operating Environment and Strategies
In the energy sector, demand for gas-fired power genera- tion is expanding, and distributed power generation needs are also increasing, especially in Asia. In the plant sector, we anticipate stable domestic and overseas demand, reflecting infrastructure development and heightened inter- est in environmental protection, especially in emerging countries, including those in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, in the marine propulsion sector, demand is expected to grow in areas related to improving environmental perfor- mance, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improving safety, reducing the need for specialized skills, and increasing the efficiency of ship operations. However, some customers are revising or delaying their capital expenditure decisions due to the COVID-19 pan- demic, price competition remains intense, and reinforcing cost competitiveness will be a task going forward.
In this operating environment, we aim to secure orders by providing unique, high-value-added products and strengthening our sales systems and maintenance and after-sales services. When bidding for orders, we will be more selective, emphasizing profitability over scale. We will also reinforce quality assurance and risk management systems to reduce costs from defective products and improve profitability.
Furthermore, aiming to expand sales of the CCPP standard package, which combines a Kawasaki gas turbine, steam tur- bine, and waste heat recovery boiler, we will reinforce our overseas sales systems. We are also advancing investment in hydrogen-related projects and product development aimed at future business growth and the realization of a carbon-free society. To this end, we plan to begin operations of a pilot hydrogen supply chain by the end of 2020.
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Energy System & Plant Engineering Company has des- ignated as its vision for 2030 being a distinctive equip- ment, system, and plant manufacturer that uses technologies and boasts quality underpinned by sophisticated product development expertise, manufacturing technology, and engineering know-how to globally provide products and services that help realize CO2-free energy and reduce envi- ronmental burden while earning high customer satisfaction, mainly in the areas of energy and the environment.
To achieve this vision, we aim to advance both economic growth and environmental protection by providing energy- saving, highly resource-efficient equipment, such as gas turbines that realize the world’s highest level of efficiency and environmental performance, gas engines that realize the world’s highest level of performance, and other power generation facilities. Specifically, we are working to com- bine core products and incorporate in-house know-how, reinforce our ability to handle overseas projects, and create new solutions while concentrating management resources on the hydrogen business and advancing the development of products that contribute to decarbonization. We will con- tribute to infrastructure improvement by providing such products as tunnel boring machines and cryogenic storage facilities while also contributing to environmental protec- tion in urban areas through deliveries of energy-saving waste incinerators, water treatment facilities, desulfuriza- tion/denitrification devices, and other systems.
    • Growing demand for energy and infrastructure in emerging and resource-rich countries
• Growing demand for distributed gas-fueled power generation facilities prompted by lower LNG fuel prices
• Tightening environmental regulations
• Demand for CO2-free power generation facilities for new
installations and facility replacement

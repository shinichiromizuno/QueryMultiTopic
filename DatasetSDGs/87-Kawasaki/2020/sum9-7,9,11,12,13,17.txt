Opportunities Risks
Operating Environment and Strategies
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of rail pas- sengers in Japan has declined, and railway companies are revising their investment plans. Meanwhile, delays are emerging in the construction of new rail lines over- seas. Nevertheless, railway systems are an environmen- tally friendly mode of public transportation and necessary to daily life, and stable demand growth is expected over the long term due to urban transportation development to address congestion and environmental issues in major cities. These issues arise from continued urbanization around the world as well as rising demand for railway infrastructure accompanying economic development in Asian countries.
In this operating environment, the Rolling Stock busi- ness is working to improve profitability through enhanced competitiveness in areas other than price and business model reform while reinforcing product man- agement and enhancing quality control. Furthermore, based on a policy of putting quality before quantity, we will focus on projects in which we can demonstrate Kawasaki’s superiority while expanding recurring reve- nue businesses in and outside Japan, aiming to increase profitability, which has been an issue.
In the North American market, we will steadily fulfill existing orders from such customers as the MTA New York City Transit. We will also work to build a stable revenue base by commercializing track monitoring using IoT and focusing on such businesses as components, repair and rebuild, and maintenance.
In this market, we will seek business expansion through such means as securing orders for projects financed by ODA loans in emerging countries in line with the Japanese government’s policies of promoting exports of railway infrastructure.
Initiatives to Create Social Value
The Rolling Stock Company has designated as its vision for 2030 helping to build better global transportation infrastructure by manufacturing rolling stock that is safe and comfortable to ride in, highly reliable, highly cost efficient over its life cycle, and energy saving to mini- mize the burden on the environment. To this end, we will promote participation in high-speed train projects at home and abroad and continue to provide rolling stock to customers in Japan, North America, and Asia while seek- ing to participate in projects to build new rolling stock infrastructure in emerging Asian countries. At the same time, we will develop a diverse lineup of more environ- mentally friendly products, including locomotives, elec- tric train cars, and diesel railcars. In addition, to better meet customer needs, we will further develop monitoring technologies that combine sensing, image analysis, and IoT technologies; work to maintain and improve safety and dependability; improve train maintenance efficiency; and contribute to the realization of train systems boast- ing excellent cost efficiency over their entire life cycle.

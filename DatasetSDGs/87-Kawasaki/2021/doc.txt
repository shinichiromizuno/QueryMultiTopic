We will operate businesses within the three groups of Land & Air Transportation Systems, Motion Control & Motor Vehicles, and Energy & Marine Engineering and increase the effectiveness of coordination between businesses.
The Kawasaki Group identifies material issues based on such factors as the relationships between social issues and Group business activities and their impact on stakeholders. In June 2021, the Sustainability Committee, chaired by the president, revised our material issues, changing the material issues under “social value created through our busi- nesses” to the three focal fields of Group Vision 2030. Going forward, we will continue to periodically revise our material issues in light of changes in the business environment and society’s expectations.

 STEP 1
Step 1: Identify and narrow down sustainability issues
We analyzed criteria evaluated by ESG ratings institutions and international sustainability reporting guidelines to identify and then narrow down material issues.
 STEP 2
Step 2: Evaluate importance of issues and assign priorities
We analyzed the importance of the individual criteria evaluated by ESG ratings institutions to create a provisional order of importance to society and stakeholders. We also held internal workshops to establish a provisional order of importance to the Company. Furthermore, we grouped responses to social issues that were identified under Medium-Term Business Plan 2016 into the category of “social value created through our businesses,” which we made our top priority.
STEP 3
Step 3: Interview outside experts and decide the material issues
We interviewed outside experts and, based on their comments, revised the importance to society and stakeholders we had assigned to the issues. We also defined the issues in the social value created through our businesses category as top priorities to address over the long-term and the other issues as the foundation of our business activities.
STEP 4
Step 4: Formulate the plan and conduct a review
Aiming to comply with the management approach defined under the GRI standards, we designated responsible divisions and officers, poli- cies, and specific numerical targets related to the material issues identified and implemented activities aimed at achieving said targets.

Reducing CO2 Emissions through Product-Based Contributions
   Kawasaki promotes the separation, capture, utilization, and storage of CO2 emitted by power stations and manufacturing plants. We are building a pilot-scale test facility at Kansai Electric Power’s Maizuru Power Station, where we will begin demonstration testing of CO2 capture in fiscal 2022.
In light of the changing social environment, Kawasaki will accelerate the shift to electric and hybrid technologies in its transporta- tion equipment and systems while reinforc- ing coordination within the industry.
More than 90% of the CO2 emitted during the life cycles of our products is released during post-sale product use. To promote the reduction of CO2 emissions during product use, since 2014 we have operated the Kawasaki-brand Green Products system, an ISO 14021-compliant internal system for certifying environmentally friendly products. Products that meet our proprietary standards related to boosting the environmental performance of the products themselves and reducing the envi- ronmental impact caused by associated manufacturing processes are registered under the system.
As of the end of fiscal 2020, the number of registered Kawasaki-brand Green Products stood at 61. We have also established rules for calculating CO2 emissions reductions through product-based contributions in order to quantify the contribu- tions of such products to the mitigation of global warming.* Calculations based on these rules showed that Kawasaki products sold in fiscal 2020 (mainly Kawasaki- brand Green Products) reduced CO2 emissions by about 24.0 million tons.

  Message from the President
Advancing Group Vision 2030 and working to quickly create new value to solve social issues.
Yasuhiko Hashimoto
Representative Director, President and Chief Executive Officer
My First Year as President
When I took office as president last year, we were already in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Aerospace Systems segment, one of our mainstay business areas, was facing a rapid decline in perfor- mance. However, over the course of my career, I have been appointed to lead at many times of dramatic social and economic change, and I approached this, too, as a new and exciting opportunity to blaze the trail forward to the future.
My first job as president was to believe in our future. I felt the importance of this strongly when I made the rounds to greet our customers and business partners after taking office. It was evident to me that many of our customers see Kawasaki as a company with integrity.
In November 2020, the Kawasaki Group established Group Vision 2030. The vision contains the message “Trustworthy Solutions for the Future.” Indeed, we determined our vision for a bigger, brighter future based on our culture of valuing trustworthiness.
I have seen the dedication of our employees as they put customer value first. At the same time, I have also once again felt that, as we tend to focus so much on customers’ immediate needs, we are not as strong as we should be in terms of offering suggestions that go one step further—to solve issues or offer value the customer has not even thought of yet. Looking at Kawasaki from an engineer’s perspective, there is value in all our technologies, and these are important assets for the Company. If we can be more strategic when converting these diverse technologies into cus- tomer value, I am confident that Kawasaki will contin- ue to grow going forward.
It has also been a year since the transition to a com- pany with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, and the Board of Directors now discusses important matters even more actively. In fiscal 2020, I met individually with our executive officers and officer candidates, about 150 people in total, recording each meeting and making the videos available to the Audit & Supervisory Committee, Nomination Advisory Committee, and Compensation Advisory Committee. I hope to further enhance the transparency of the pro- cesses used to fill important positions so that we can more objectively evaluate candidates.

  Generating Synergies in Three Focal Fields to Become a Market Leader
Growth Scenario Leading to 2030
Under Group Vision 2030, we will make strong invest- ments in growth businesses as we pursue ongoing growth. As a result of these efforts, we aim for an operating profit margin of 5% to 8% and pre-tax ROIC that is 3% or more higher than WACC.
In the ship & offshore structure and rolling stock businesses, which have faced challenging circumstanc- es since several years before the COVID-19 pandemic, we are implementing business structure reforms in order to promote growth going forward. By merging the Ship & Offshore Structure Company and Energy System & Plant Engineering Company, we are reinforc- ing the system engineering business, leveraging syner- gies with hydrogen-related businesses and the marine propulsion business, with the aim of greatly increasing profitability and boosting sales.
In the rolling stock business, the R211 subway car project for the New York City Transit Authority, for which we have a large order backlog, has begun. Through a corporate split, we will transition to a framework that allows this business to nimbly and flexibly work with industry companies, thereby bol- stering our ability to propose solutions and meet rail- way demand around the world. Furthermore, the motorcycle business is seeing strong growth in off- road motorcycles and four-wheelers for developed countries. The spin-off of this business will allow us to devolve greater authority and thus more quickly respond to market needs and dealer requests, and we
  Kawasaki has long prioritized technological synergy. The three focal fields of business under Group Vision 2030, “a safe and secure remotely connected society,” “near-future mobility,” and “energy and environmental solutions,” comprise a new framework for realizing such synergy.
Under “a safe and secure remotely connected soci- ety,” we will leverage our technologies to realize better living using remote technologies, eliminate accessibility gaps between those who are skilled at using remote technologies and those who are not, and better protect lives and property from natural disasters. For example, our automated PCR testing business uses robotics to help alleviate personnel shortages and eliminate the risk of contagion for persons administering tests. Having now seen the havoc that a tiny virus can wreak upon society, and given that the next pandemic could strike at any time, we expect to see ongoing demand in this area going forward, even after COVID-19. We are also offering solutions to allow PCR testing equipment to snap into action when needed at airports or other facilities without disrupting the flow of people.
In addition, the field of medicine faces certain issues that can only be resolved with remote technologies. Medicaroid Corporation, our joint venture with Sysmex Corporation, developed hinotori, the first robotic assisted surgery system produced in Japan, which I believe will be remembered as having opened the door to remote medicine. Also, our new joint venture with Sony Group Corporation, announced in May 2021, will create a platform to connect people who want to work with businesses seeking labor by enabling the remote operation of robots. By doing so, it will help eliminate dangerous and highly strenuous work. At the same time, it will offer new ways of working, enabling more people to take part in society on their own terms, including people who would like to work but cannot physically go to worksites.
Realizing a safe and secure society will require deal- ing with natural disasters. To this end, we will bring together the Group’s diverse range of technologies to develop hospital ships and floating power plants. In addition to medical service helicopters, off-road four- wheelers, and stand-by generator sets, we aim to offer new solutions for use in disasters that integrate our unique concept of telemedicine using robots for remote medicine in order to protect lives and property.
Spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the movement of people for business purposes (such as commuting and business travel) is expected to be replaced permanently by remote operations, but the shift to “new normal” lifestyles is also increasing demand for logistics, such as deliveries to individuals. Under “near-future mobility,” we aim to combine our mobility technologies in such areas as airplanes, robots, motorcycles, and off-road four-wheelers to develop new forms of mobility, like remotely con- trolled, unmanned helicopters and self-driving delivery robots. By doing so, we will, for example, offer new solutions to the last-mile problem in logistics. Few companies in the world other than Kawasaki have the technologies spanning multiple fields necessary to pro- vide these new mobility solutions. “Near-future mobili- ty” is thus a prime example of how we can create new value through synergies between Group technologies.
The hydrogen business (in the energy and environ- mental solutions field) is an excellent example of an initiative that spans the borders between the internal companies. We anticipate the growing presence of hydrogen in a wide range of fields, including the cre- ation of a hydrogen supply chain. As such, we estab- lished the Hydrogen Strategy Division within the Head Office to coordinate hydrogen-related businesses. Hydrogen businesses will be crucial if Japan is to reach its goal of realizing a carbon-neutral society in 2050, and this is an unparalleled area in which Kawasaki is concentrating strengths from across the Group.
The three focal fields under Group Vision 2030 are all new areas, the very frontier. We have taken the lead in developing hydrogen, in particular, for a decade already, based on our belief that it will be powerful tool for eliminating carbon emissions. I think that this will be a major advantage for Kawasaki. We are, in fact, receiving inquiries about our hydrogen business from around the world. We will now work to set global standards based on the components and operational know-how of our liquefied hydrogen carri- er, SUISO FRONTIER, and other efforts thus far. Similarly, we will make our technologies for medical robots the global standard. Through such efforts, and while working with a wide range of other players, we will remain a market leader far into the future.
aim for dramatic growth through aggressive invest- ment. The motorcycle business enjoys great brand rec- ognition around the world and, as our only B-to-C business, will continue to be the vanguard of the Kawasaki brand.
As part of Group Vision 2030, we have laid out the following growth scenario leading to 2030.
1) Our mass-production businesses, such as precision machinery, robots, motorcycles, and energy products, will provide revenue for the time being, while the establishment of the automated PCR viral testing busi- ness will help speed the recovery of aviation demand.
2) Once the Aerospace Systems business recovers, the steady expansion of the aerospace market will gen- erate revenue and cash.
3) Further down the line, new businesses, such as hydrogen and medical robots, will become revenue pillars, leading to a stable growth trajectory.
For the period leading to 2030, we have already laid out an overall roadmap delineating areas in which we expect to generate profit and areas that will need sup- port at each stage. In this way, as we advance under Group Vision 2030, we will reinforce profitability and earn social recognition for Kawasaki’s contribution to the realization of a sustainable world.

       Message from the President
  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality
Given that hydrogen is a key Group business, we rec- ognize contributing to the achievement of a carbon- neutral society as a major responsibility of the Group. We must not only promote the elimination of carbon emissions on the part of customers and society through our hydrogen and other businesses, but accel- erate initiatives to eliminate emissions in our product manufacturing processes and throughout the value chain. In the Kawasaki Global Environmental Vision
The future-oriented path we have laid out for solving issues, including dealing with the low birth rate and aging population, our ideas for a remotely connected society, and energy and environmental solutions, was well received at the Group Vision 2030 progress report meeting we held in June 2021. Our three focal fields of business are all areas in which we aim to solve social issues. To achieve this, employees will need broad perspectives and an ambitious spirit. This is precisely the objective of our new personnel system, which eliminates seniority-based elements and uses a job-based pay system. We are creating ways to give opportunities to employees who are motivated and capable, even if they are young, and to allow older employees who are still up to taking on new challenges to continue to do so.
Under the new personnel system, we aim to increase the portion of highly effective employees by giving due recognition and reward to those who are highly capable and produce results. This requires motivation on the part of employees as well as effort on the part of the Company to provide an environment that will
Encouraging a Greater Emphasis on Speed
  2050, established in 2017, we announced our target of carbon neutrality by 2050, but we hope to reach this target far earlier. Until now, we have worked to reduce CO2 emissions, save energy, and reduce waste at the individual plant level. To achieve carbon neu- trality, however, we must work strategically at the Company-wide level. We are currently studying ways that we might realize plants that emit no CO2. I look forward to sharing the details soon.
allow them to excel. The world’s top companies are said to be more than 55% highly effective employees. Kawasaki will therefore build mechanisms to provide the conditions that allow highly motivated employees to thrive, aiming to raise our proportion of highly effective employees to over 50%.
Suggestions and contributions toward the growth of Kawasaki as a whole, not just specific internal compa- nies, will be incorporated into the evaluations of exec- utive officers and above. Outstanding suggestions and ambitious targets will be viewed favorably, and even more favorably if they lead to results. The role of divi- sion heads will be to keep an eye on social needs, commit to addressing even difficult issues, and encour- aging personnel to take on ambitious challenges. By getting as many people as possible to take on more ambitious targets, we seek to bolster the vitality of the Company as a whole.
The new personnel system is a framework for accu- rately evaluating those who are trying hard, even when they are not successful, and recognizing those who are working with passion. We have instituted more systematic methods to ensure that supervisors carefully observe their subordinates’ work. Employees will be evaluated on the results they achieve, but their effort will also be a significant factor.
The personnel system reforms are also aimed at uniting all our employees in the effort to realize Group Vision 2030. The new system places greater weight on abilities, roles, and achievements and enables the more flexible utilization of human resources beyond the bounds of the internal companies. At the same time, we have established the Presidential Project Management Division and will work to quickly achieve results from Company-wide projects, such as the auto- mated PCR viral testing service business and efforts in near-future mobility.
Since before I took office as president, I have been saying that speed produces value, and I think more employees have come to understand the importance of this principle. I am sure that the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, though still ongoing, has only reinforced this awareness.
As I see it, there are two types of speed. The first type is about reacting quickly. For example, quickly deciding what we could rapidly do in response to the halt in the movement of people due to COVID-19. This led to the automated PCR viral testing business.
The second type of speed is about quickly grasping
global trends and future trajectories to stay a step ahead. The hydrogen business is a prime example of this. Our ability to quickly respond now that the world is waking up to hydrogen is thanks to our having foreseen the importance of hydrogen more than a decade ago and all the work we have done on related technologies since.
Accomplishing tasks quickly depends on training— even preparing a single document involves knowing the most efficient methods and the right procedures. The key to survival in a business environment of diz- zying change is speed, and speed is a skill and a habit that can be built up and honed.
 Personnel System Reforms,
Including the Elimination of Seniority-Based Elements
 Promoting Dialogue, Disclosure, and Sustainability Management
 After taking office as president, I gained an increased awareness of how unforgiving analysts are in their opinions about Kawasaki. I asked myself how we could help them understand us better, and came to the con- clusion that dialogue and disclosure are, as always, key. Our work to enhance our quarterly financial results materials in the current fiscal year is part of efforts in this area. We are enhancing disclosure not only of financial information, but also ESG-related data. Through dialogue and disclosure, we aim to fur- ther invigorate communication with stakeholders and build stronger relationships of trust.
In formulating Group Vision 2030, we analyzed global social issues, considered the strengths and com- petitive advantages of our business portfolio, envi- sioned what we think the Company should look like in 2030, and then worked out a growth scenario to get there. Based on the vision, we recently reviewed our
designated material issues and positioned our three focal fields of business as top priorities for the Group to address over the long term. By promoting efforts in these three fields, we will also contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have defined our vision for the Group in 2030 using quantitative targets as much as possible, and we will regularly report progress against these targets going forward.
In addition, we are reinforcing ESG initiatives, which we position as part of the foundation supporting the achievement of Group Vision 2030. As a signatory company to the United Nations Global Compact, Kawasaki supports the Compact’s 10 principles in the four areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. By practicing them in our business activities, we will promote sustainability for society, the environment, and Kawasaki.
   Reaping the Fruits of Diverse New Initiatives in the Coming Year
Over the past year, although we have faced crises, we have also begun many new initiatives. We implemented the new personnel system, laid out a new strategy, and reorganized our businesses. Amid a severe drop in per- formance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire Company worked steadfastly to secure a profit. Unfortunately, these efforts ultimately fell short, and we recorded a net loss for fiscal 2020. I take my responsibility for this as the head of management very seriously. However, we returned to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, with operating profit nearly the highest it has been in a decade. By advancing Group
Vision 2030, I am confident that we will accomplish our plan for the fiscal year and continue to grow our busi- nesses around the world.
As evoked by the philosophy espoused by Kawasaki founder Shozo Kawasaki of “contributing to the nation—to society—through expertise,” solving social issues through business is in Kawasaki’s very DNA. Staying true to this heritage, we will strive to increase our enterprise value and fulfill the roles required of us going forward so that we can provide “Trustworthy Solutions for the Future.”

Financial Management Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic
Business Reforms under Group Vision 2030
    Under Group Vision 2030, we are aiming to at achieve total optimization across the Group by implementing Company-wide reforms that transcend the barriers separating internal compa- nies. First, to quickly create new businesses that span the bounds of the internal companies, we have set up a variety of businesses under the Presidential Project Management Division, including automated PCR testing and near-future mobility. Furthermore, we have integrated the Ship & Offshore Structure Company and the Energy System & Plant Engineering Company to form the Energy Solution & Marine Engineering Company, thereby creating a framework for advancing business centered on hydrogen-related businesses and the core component engi- neering business. We have decided to redirect the capacities of the merchant ship business within the new internal company, mainly toward the liquefied hydrogen carrier business and core component businesses, such as system engineering and marine propulsion. The construction of general vessels will now be
carried out instead via collaboration with a Chinese joint ven- ture and other companies.
In the rolling stock business, which has recorded operating losses for four consecutive years, we formed a Company-wide North American task force to reinforce the profitability of North American production sites from a Company-wide per- spective. By leveraging insights into quality control from the Aerospace Systems segment and expertise about production efficiency from the motorcycle business, we aim to ensure that the rolling stock business returns to profitability in fiscal 2021.
The rolling stock business and the motorcycle business were each spun off into new, separate companies in October, afford- ing them a high degree of management autonomy. This will allow the rolling stock business to nimbly and flexibly work with companies throughout the industry and the motorcycle business to leverage its characteristics as a B-to-C business to speed up decision making.
  Investment in Growth and Sustainable Capital Procurement
   Financial Strategy
   The global economic stagnation caused by the COVID-19 pan- demic has greatly affected Kawasaki’s business. Nowhere was this more evident than in the Aerospace Systems segment, which, having accounted for almost 70% of Group operating profit until the previous fiscal year, saw sharp declines in reve- nue and profit due to stagnant air travel demand. We were forced to react as the presumptions underlying our business plans suddenly fell out from under us, and we implemented measures that included the issuance of ¥60 billion in straight bonds, our largest issuance ever, as well as commercial paper to ensure that we would have adequate liquidity on hand.
In August 2020, we forecast that the operating loss for the fiscal year could be as large as ¥30 billion. However, sales of off-road motorcycles and four-wheelers grew in the North American market, and sales of excavator hydraulic machinery, mainly for the Chinese market, were quick to recover. In addi- tion, sales of robots for semiconductor manufacturing equip- ment were strong, reflecting a rise in semiconductor demand that was due in part to the expansion of remote work. The final result of these factors and the enormous impact of COVID-19 was that we recorded an operating loss of ¥5.3 bil- lion for fiscal 2020.
Capital expenditures have been rising in recent years, reflecting ongoing upfront investment in growth fields. However, the pace of such investment in the hydrogen business and other areas has subsided somewhat, and, going forward, we plan to keep capital expenditures within the range of depreciation and amortization, in principle. At the same time, we will set aside a separate investment budget for future businesses, such as those related to digital transformation (DX), near-future mobili- ty, and automated PCR testing robots.
In the hydrogen business, support from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Green Innovation Fund has begun, and hundreds of billions of yen will be invested. Using this capital and leveraging the advantage of having started investing in this area well ahead of the competition, we will

grow the hydrogen business.
In terms of R&D, we intend to concentrate investment in
products and technologies for which we see future potential after the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly in the focal fields under Group Vision 2030. We plan to maintain R&D spending at around ¥50 billion, for a ratio of R&D spending to net sales of around 3% to 3.5%, for the time being.
Looking at capital procurement, in July 2021, Kawasaki issued its first-ever sustainability bond to fund projects related to the popularization of the automated robotic PCR testing sys- tem and the establishment of a hydrogen supply chain. Going forward, we will continue to expand our businesses that con- tribute to social and environmental sustainability, procuring capital mainly through sustainability bonds and loans.

 Due to COVID-19, demand for air travel rapidly declined, lead- ing to a pileup in aerospace systems inventory, which, among other factors, caused the net D/E ratio to worsen in turn to 100% as of the end of the fiscal year. In the current fiscal year, with inventories decreasing due to adjustments in airplane pro- duction rates and business results recovering, we expect the D/E ratio to improve. By implementing a program of financial management improvement* aimed at controlling working capi- tal, we hope to quickly return the D/E ratio to the 70% to 80% range, which we believe is an appropriate level.
The cash conversion cycle (CCC) also worsened to over 150 days in fiscal 2020 due to a range of factors, including weak performance in the airplane business, the suspension of opera- tions at rolling stock production plants in the United States due to COVID-19, reduced production capacity due to social distanc- ing, and delays in railway operators accepting rolling stock.
Operations have now returned to normal, so, considering the
expected improvement in results, we aim to quickly return the CCC to around 100 days via the aforementioned program of financial management improvement.
Over the past three years, we have fallen short of our plans for profit and loss due to losses on big projects. However, since being put in charge of Company-wide finance and accounting, I have been working urgently to reinforce Company-wide profit and loss management. For important projects with a significant impact on management, we are reinforcing pre-contract risk checking and implementing a risk control approach that keeps the total risk of losses within a level commensurate with the relevant organization’s financial strength. Through such mea- sures, we are reinforcing project risk management and enhanc-
ing the precision of profit and loss planning.

 rapidly, has not been factored into the annual revenue plan, so the growth of this business will further boost results. In terms of shareholder returns, based on a comprehensive consider- ation of results forecasts and our financial standing (including free cash flow and the D/E ratio), and seeking to ensure stable dividends, we plan for a consolidated payout ratio (calculated against profit attributable to owners of the parent) of approxi- mately 30% over the medium to long term. We thus aim to
increase dividends by enhancing profit.
Our current stock price reflects high expectations regarding
the future of our businesses, including the hydrogen business. To continue to meet these expectations we will promote DX, proactively allocate management resources to growth fields, and reinforce business reforms and profit-loss management, aiming to reach a market capitalization of ¥1 trillion.
Now, however, we have changed the age of eligibility to include employees in their 30s and begun accepting employees based not only on recommendations but also applications from employees themselves. In the first year, we have received even more applications than expected, reinforcing our awareness that we have a great deal of ambitious employees.
Formulating section-level leadership plans has also been an issue. Going forward, we will develop the next generation of leader candidates through the enhancement of our training systems to select successors for key posts from a more Company-wide perspective that includes the promotion of younger employees.
  Human Resource Strategy
The New Personnel System Is Built around Fostering a Culture of Taking on New Challenges and Commitment.
time for the new personnel system to change the mindsets of all employees. My mission is to drive the uptake of the new system as quickly as possible and thereby accelerate the achievement of Group Vision 2030.
By firmly establishing this new system built around the ideas of taking on new challenges and commitment, we will foster a corporate culture in which every Group employee embodies our slogan, “Changing Forward.” and takes an active role in achieving our management targets.
Fostering a Corporate Culture that Embodies “Changing Forward.”
I think that we need to strengthen the human resource strategy of the entire Group, including overseas subsidiaries. However, even as we aim for global human resource management, there are variations in the makeup of individual businesses in terms of country, work performed, and the people who work in them. Introducing a globally unified system all at once is thus diffi- cult, so we are beginning initiatives in this area in the United States, in light of the significant impact that our businesses there have on the Group as a whole.
We recently formed a North America Project Management Task Force to reinforce the rolling stock business. This task force includes human resource divisions. We plan to begin with carrying out employee engagement surveys and reexamining the personnel systems of our U.S. subsidiaries and will formu- late necessary measures accordingly.
We also need to reinforce our human resource data platform using DX technologies. We will make human resource data—like the current assignments, skills, experience, and evaluation results of individuals—more easily accessible in order to more effectively use human resources Group-wide.
Our efforts to enhance the personnel system will not end with the adoption of the new system. The ongoing enhance- ment of the system’s operational level will require time to be spent on setting and evaluating targets and assiduously plan- ning, executing, checking, and improving measures taken.
In an unusual move for Kawasaki, since April 2021, I have been in charge of not only overseeing overall human resource operations as vice president, but also leading the Human Resources Division as its general manager. It will take some
Key Features of the New Personnel Management System
 Achieving Group Vision 2030
Group Vision 2030 expresses our intention to address social issues with innovative solutions and transcend existing bound- aries to act quickly and take on new challenges. For the Kawasaki Group to solve social issues and achieve its vision,
a human resource strategy aimed at developing and rein- forcing human resources is especially important.
To achieve the vision, we are emphasizing the firm establish- ment among employees of market-oriented thinking, the idea that speed produces value, awareness that extends beyond orga- nizational bounds, and a culture of valuing ambitious initiative.
Until now, our human resource allocation was oriented mainly around the internal companies and tended to result in
outstanding personnel remaining within those companies. The limited exchange of human resources across company lines resulted in conditions that were not conducive to synergy. This may have even been demotivating for employees hoping to realize bold new ideas that span the bounds of internal companies. Unless the Company prioritizes the creation of environments in which employees can engage in work based on their aspirations and grow as individuals, achieving Group Vision 2030 will be very difficult. Based on that understand- ing, in fiscal 2021, we have launched a new personnel system, aiming to create a framework for the optimal utilization of our human resources.
   Boosting Employee Motivation to Grow through the Use of a Job-centered System
A key feature of the new personnel system is the introduction of a job-based pay system.
Under the job-based pay system, employee pay and compen- sation is decided based on standards related to their job, including the duties they perform and results they achieve.
To maximize the results of this system, each job must be defined in detail—i.e., in terms of the objectives and responsi- bilities associated with specific tasks, how they are performed, where the delineations separating them lie, and the skills and qualifications necessary for their fulfillment. We began this task by first evaluating the breadth of the role associated with every single post within the Company and reassigned ranks to employees accordingly. By thus clarifying the role entailed in each post, we are continuing to raise employee awareness.
The achievements of employees will be evaluated objectively,
based on whether they have fulfilled the prescribed require- ments of their job. Furthermore, we have incorporated a mecha- nism for increasing the compensation of employees who set and achieve more ambitious targets. This will encourage all employ- ees to take on new approaches and ideas and exercise their abilities to the fullest. We expect the implementation of these systems to not only directly bolster productivity internally, but facilitate external hiring by clearly defining available posts, thereby reinforcing the Company’s competitiveness.
In addition, the new system enables the more active transfer and mingling of personnel between internal companies. More active exchange among the human resources of the internal companies will stimulate the growth of individuals. By thus nurturing inter-organizational synergies, we seek to achieve the ongoing enhancement of our enterprise value.
To achieve Group Vision 2030, we aim to realize a personnel system in which diverse human resources can utilize their abili- ties to the fullest and produce high added-value results.
Feature 1: Compensation based on ability, job, and results
• Abolished seniority-based elements, shifting to a system of com- pensation based on ability, job, and results
• Introduced an ability-based qualification system in which employ- ees are evaluated and compensated based on ability, job, and results; compensation comprising wages, regular bonuses and retirement bonuses; and an employee review system
Feature 2: Prompting employees to strive and grow
• Reorganized the ability-based qualification system and took other steps to enable employees to get involved in various types of work and support them in acquiring a broad range of experience
• Adopted an approach that prompts the desire to take on challenges, with those who take on harder tasks evaluated favorably, and that encourages the growth in character and skills that comes from the process and accomplishment of solving problems
Motivation rises
Role and responsibilities expand
Striving, enhancing abilities
Evaluations and compensation improve
      Personnel Allocation Focused on Abilities and the Development of Next- Generation Leader Candidates
Virtuous cycle
Another feature of the new personnel system is the elimination of age-based seniority elements. We seek to allocate human resources with a focus on individual abilities, quickly promoting outstanding young employees to encourage their development while also enabling veteran employees to continue to actively contribute, regardless of age.
In addition, I think it is important to create the conditions necessary to ensure that anyone motivated to do so can take
part in ambitious initiatives, like the rapid commercialization of our automated PCR testing business. To that end, we will set up a variety of promotion and hiring frameworks.
Among these frameworks are the Kawasaki executive coach- ing programs, which provide training aimed at developing man- agement candidates. In the past, this training was offered principally to older employees at the senior manager level who had been recommended from within the internal companies.

Technological Development
Technological Development Aimed at Carbon Neutrality
         Kawasaki simultaneously advances product innovation, which accelerates the resolution of social issues, and process innovation, which improves the profitability of existing busi- nesses. Furthermore, with an eye to the future we are reinforc- ing our technological base by engaging in the development of innovative, cross-field basic technologies as well as the human resource development of engineers and technicians.
In terms of product innovation, we aim to create new solu- tions in the three fields of focus designated under Group Vision 2030 and to transform our business models.
To realize “a safe and secure remotely connected society,” we will further hone remote operation technologies, building on a core comprising the robotics technologies the Group has devel- oped over the years, to realize a society that is safe and inclu- sive for all. To ensure the safety and security of remote operations, we are taking an open innovation approach to

quickly solve such technical issues as response lags and signal interruptions. We aim to expand the use of robots into fields that until now have been dependent on in-person human labor, such as medicine, logistics, construction, and manufacturing.
Regarding “near-future mobility,” we envision smart cities in which means of mobility are interconnected. Various forms of autonomous mobility, such as transport robots, drones, ships, and off-road utility vehicles, will coordinate with one another, seamlessly connecting with individual needs and data from the surrounding area, making it possible to meet diverse logistics needs. This can provide an answer to the last mile problem, which is expanding alongside demographic graying and popula- tion decline, and the Kawasaki Group is advancing technological development in this area through the various forms of mobility technology it boasts.
that control power supply in response to demand will be crucial. We are examining the possibility of building on the EMS-related technologies we have developed to optimize the operations of our customers’ power stations and plants to create systems that provide stable regional power supplies.
The other major area of development is process innovation. We have begun efforts in this area with the reinforcement of
total quality management (TQM) aimed at enhancing the effi- ciency of existing business processes. At the same time, we are advancing digital transformation (DX) in our value chains and operational management to strengthen and streamline our business foundations.
In terms of DX, beginning in fiscal 2021, we are focusing on building the foundations of work style and professional fulfil- ment reforms, a management data platform, and next- generation cybersecurity. Furthermore, we have been quick to begin building digital innovation platforms with the intention of transforming the Group’s business models by shifting from sell- ing physical products to selling IP and services. For example, in
We also see the shift to electric-powered mobility as essen- tial and are working to rapidly develop technologies for electrification, including that of airplanes, ships, hydraulic systems, and motorcycles.
the hydrogen business, in order to respond to future demand growth, we plan to advance into such fields as licensing, the supply of core components, the provision of services, and the operation of hydrogen systems.
We are implementing an initiative to enhance development and design processes, dubbed Kawasaki Design Process Transformation (K-DPX), with the ultimate aim of unifying and standardizing design processes Company-wide. Furthermore, we are employing digital technologies to reinforce coordination between engineering chains and supply chains and more actively utilize existing expertise. Unifying and standardizing design processes will facilitate the flow of people between internal companies and is also important in terms of reducing procurement and quality control costs at the Group-wide level.

  Under “energy and environmental solutions,” we are taking on the major issue of realizing a carbon-neutral society. The Japanese government’s declaration of its intention to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 has triggered a major acceleration in the shift to a hydrogen-powered society.
Specifically, expected hydrogen consumption in 2030 has grown tenfold from previous estimates to 3,000,000 tons. There are currently many technological hurdles that will have to be overcome to meet this much demand. These include increasing the size of the tank systems on liquefied hydrogen carriers as well as at liquefied hydrogen bases and developing high- efficiency, large-scale liquefaction systems. However, Kawasaki has the advantage of more than decade of technological develop- ment aimed at building a liquefied hydrogen supply chain, and we will continue to lead the way toward a carbon neutral society.
To achieve a hydrogen-powered society, stimulating demand among potential large-scale users of hydrogen will also be
important. We are already working on the development of high-efficiency hydrogen gas turbines and hydrogen gas engines. In addition, we are advancing development aimed at securing our position as a leader in the field of hydrogen-fueled airplanes, looking at the development of new aircraft and engines as well as airport infrastructure for rapid refueling.
In carbon recycling, we have begun demonstration testing of the Kawasaki CO2 Capture (KCC), an energy-saving system for separating and capturing CO2. Building on this technology going forward, we envision direct air capture (DAC) for capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. Low-cost hydrogen supply is key to these efforts as well, and we are nurturing nascent technolo- gies that we hope will allow us to realize business models based on new material chains that are not reliant on fossil fuels.
Achieving net zero CO2 emissions will also require the balanced use of renewable energy. To prevent the danger of large-scale blackouts, sophisticated energy management systems (EMSs)
Developing Human Resources and Technologies to Be Ready for Future Risks
   34 Kawasaki Report 2021
Kawasaki Report 2021 35
Even the most cutting-edge technologies will eventually become obsolete. The sustainable management of a business therefore requires the strategic turnover and activation of human resources and technologies. Foreseeing the issues that society will face in 10 or 20 years is not easy, and I think that imagining and preparing for a variety of possibilities is the only way to ensure our ability to rapidly respond to emerging needs. In fact, I would say that preparing for risks and developing the technologies and people to avoid them is the core impetus for everything that the Corporate Technology Division does.
For example, the rapid uptake of electric technologies could disrupt the stable procurement of motors. The development of
motors that use no rare-earth magnets is a way of preparing for and avoiding this business continuity risk. Holding seminars on applying AI and programs for nurturing young engineers to develop personnel with the technical skills to create new solu- tion businesses is also among the measures we need to take to be ready for the future.
Striving to ensure we can meet the needs of society no mat- ter how times change, we will continue to advance product innovation and process innovation while further honing our basic technologies and creating new value using digital technol- ogies. By doing so, we will ensure that Kawasaki will continue “Changing Forward.”

Initiatives to Spread TQM Launched in Fiscal 2019
The three years ending with the current fiscal year have been a period of foundation building. The three years begin- ning fiscal 2022 will be a period for realizing the full effect of TQM. We are advancing efforts to promote the uptake of TQM with the goal of quickly reaching the concrete result
level. We aim to see the emergence of divisions that can
contend for the Deming Prize* in a few years’ time.
*Deming Prize: An award bestowed by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers to organizations successfully implementing TQM.

  Spreading TQM Full effect of TQM 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024
     The serious incident involving a series N700 Shinkansen railcar bogie frame in 2017 prompted us to deeply reflect and reexamine our quality control system. As a result, we decided to set up a robust quality control system based on Total Quality Management (TQM) at the Company-wide level.
Approaching the three years from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2021 as a period for spreading TQM internally, we estab- lished the TQM Department within the Corporate Technology Division, bringing together the employees responsible for TQM at the internal companies to advance activities. In addition, we set up the Company-wide Quality Committee, where TQM promoters from each business seg- ment meet once a quarter. The committee facilitates infor- mation exchange and helps ensure TQM policy compliance, thereby expediting activities and improving their efficiency.
The TQM Department implements Company-wide educa- tion to foster awareness and understanding of TQM, evalu- ates the level of TQM at individual divisions, and encourages
them to raise said level. These efforts are based on initia- tives in policy management, day-to-day management, and quality management education.
Policy management entails not only top-down communi- cation of policy, but also bottom-up communication and horizontal coordination, expanding discussions beyond organizational boundaries.
Day-to-day management is aimed at standardizing opera- tions and is closely linked with digital transformation (DX). Standardization is a necessary prerequisite for transforming the Company using digital technologies. In that sense, TQM has a major role to play in advancing DX.
In terms of quality management education, we have been holding ongoing TQM seminars for management and all employees and completed the creation of our own level- specific curriculum. Through such efforts, we are further bolstering motivation to advance TQM among everyone from new recruits to top management.
Enhancing Operational Quality and Efficiency Based on KPS and TQM
   Promoting Awareness Using Surveys Based on TQM Techniques
People Are the Core of TQM—More Creative Work through Standardization
The foundation of the TQM approach is standardization. This is highly compatible with the Kawasaki Production System (KPS), which we apply in our manufacturing divisions. KPS is a unique Kawasaki-developed production management method that makes it easier to confirm operational conformity with stan- dards. First adopted at the motorcycle division, KPS has been honed and further developed across the internal companies.
KPS standardizes operational procedures and mandates that each procedure is observed and the outcomes of each process recorded. This ensures that any abnormality is swiftly addressed and any non-conforming process correct- ed. When an abnormality is detected, we pause operations to determine the cause so that we can then implement
improvements. The continuous implementation of this cycle is an aspect that TQM and KPS have in common. On the front lines of manufacturing, we implement quality control mainly through KPS, while for Company-wide operations and services, including those of back-office divisions, we apply the TQM approach to enhance quality and efficiency. Based on TQM and KPS, we thus seek to advance the adop- tion of better quality management and comprehensively improve all operational processes. We believe that these activities will help us break away from overreliance on manufacturing front lines, which was one of the major causes identified by our investigation and analysis of the serious incident mentioned earlier.
     To introduce and advance TQM, we must first understand the state of current activities and identify areas that require improvement. To this end, since 2019, we have been implement- ing surveys of the level of quality control using TQM techniques.
The survey examines around 30 items (though the exact content varies by year), getting into the details of front-line operations to evaluate the level of TQM adoption. When we began these initiatives, major divisions were, on average, at the mechanism-building level. In fiscal 2020, however, the average had advanced to nearly the operating level, affirm- ing that our TQM activities are beginning to take hold across a wide range of sections.
For these evaluations, TQM Department staff meet with staff from the internal companies, score initiatives, and review the results with said staff. Even more than this,
however, we prioritize visiting workplaces to engage in dia- logue with internal company staff. We believe that this helps to deepen mutual understanding and makes the evalu- ations themselves a valuable part of the process of advanc- ing the uptake of TQM.
Until now, each internal company had its own approaches to manufacturing and operating processes honed and improved over the course of their unique history. While this is in one sense a strength, it has also made assessing these companies using the same parameters difficult, as each was using different yardsticks and a different vocabulary. The TQM level survey was the first time that the Kawasaki Group quantitatively assessed all the internal companies and divisions using common indicators. Through this survey, we seek to share the strengths of each com- pany while improving weak areas.
With the advance of standardization through TQM, we will be able to ensure a certain level of quality regardless of who carries out a specific task. This may seem at first glance like it leaves no room for the value of experience or individ- uality. Quality improvement, however, is not implemented by techniques, but by people. Only people can discover problems, work to implement improvements, and constantly enhance quality. One of the tenets of TQM is respect for the contributions of workers as human beings. As this indicates, rather than forcing greater burdens on employees for the sake of quality, we seek to find more efficient ways of working so that they can redirect some of their capacity toward more creative tasks, thereby simultaneously increas- ing profitability and generating new professional fulfillment.
I wish to emphasize that these are, in this way, very human- centric initiatives.
Under Group Vision 2030, we are targeting innovation that goes beyond the bounds of the internal companies. To that end, employees must be able to work together smooth- ly. This is another area where TQM, by advancing standard- ization, can be effective. In addition, by establishing a common awareness and understanding of manufacturing processes, we will be able to more nimbly move human resources to where they are needed. Improvements like this are the goal of TQM, and I am confident that TQM will con- tribute greatly to the realization of new solutions to social problems, as targeted in Group Vision 2030.

Kanehana When President Hashimoto took office, the principal expectation I had was for change. With the world changing in dizzying ways due to the COVID-19 pandemic, speed is of the essence. Until now, most of Kawasaki’s former presidents have come up through businesses in which products
are made to order and the time from planning to execution is measured in years. President Hashimoto, however, came up through the industrial robot business—a mass-production business— so, above all, I expected that he would approach the job with a greater sense of speed. In the year since he took
office, he has fully lived up to this expectation. It is evident that decisions and the rollout of new measures, such as the launches of the Presidential Project Management Division and the PCR testing business, have gotten faster.
The Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
   Please tell us about the functioning of the Board of Directors and challenges in this area since the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee.
  Supervisory Committee, on the execu- tive side, the internal company presi- dents were taken off the Board of Directors, bringing the number of internal Directors very close to the number of Outside Directors. I have been an Outside Director for only two years, but I think that Kawasaki’s internal and Outside Directors work together effectively as a team. Although their positions differ, focus- ing respectively on execution and oversight, I think that we are all aligned in our sense of urgency regard- ing corporate performance and the makeup of the Company as well as in our determination to solve problems. Previously, Kawasaki’s internal compa- nies each had an air of being their own, individual entity. Now, while keeping the strengths that make each of them unique, they are more united, as one Kawasaki. There are still hurdles to overcome, but Kawasaki has clearly defined its path forward, so the key will be to continue effectively moving in that direction.
RTohe Board anduDirectors andnthe Roles ofdIts Members table Given your respective areas of expertise, what do you see as your roles as
Outside Directors?
Kanehana One of the main objectives of changing our structure was to shift the role of the Board of Directors from management to oversight. This past year has been one of trial and error as we advanced efforts in this area. Upon the change in structure, we also changed the composition of the Board of Directors, increasing the proportion of Outside Directors. Discussions at Board of Directors meetings are very active, so much so that they often do not finish on time. Going forward, I hope to further improve the selection of agenda items and the efficiency of Board proceedings to ensure that we have the time needed for in-depth discussions of major management policy, such as sustainability issues, human resource strategy, and corpo- rate transformation.
Tsujimura In the year since I took office as Outside Director, I’ve been surprised by how actively the Directors ask questions and offer opin- ions in Board of Directors meetings. I have also appreciated the quality and
breadth of the prior explanations of Board agenda items provided to Outside Directors.
Kohdera I’ve worked with many com- panies as an attorney, but when I came to Kawasaki as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member four years ago, I was struck by the open atmosphere of Kawasaki’s Board of Directors meetings, which makes it easy for participants to voice their opinions. Not only that, the opinions of outside officers are taken seriously, and when they offer better alternatives, the Board responds flexi- bly. With the shift to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, the legal framework is different, as is my own mindset as a director. The compa- ny with an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure is, legally speaking, intended to strengthen management’s oversight functions, so I feel that, as a director, it is important for me to be more incisive and probing in my Board participation than before.

uniform Company-wide measures, so I hope I can help with such efforts to create systems that function even better.
Saito The role of an Outside Director is to leverage one’s own expertise and to support the decisions of top man- agement by considering how, based on
such expertise, the company can achieve total optimization. I have a great deal of experience in manage- ment in and outside Japan, including as a CFO, so I try to provide a perspective that differs from that within Kawasaki in areas related to that experience.
Kanehana In terms of ideas from the front lines, we are implementing a project called the Business Idea Challenge. The spark for this arose from ideas that junior employees were posting in various communities within SKIP, our internal SNS. The project col- lects such ideas to launch new busi- nesses within the Company. It has received well over a hundred submis- sions, from which we recently selected three outstanding ideas. The top pick was for noslisu electric three-wheelers, as featured in Group Vision 2030. We hope to expand such activities, grow- ing them from initiatives within the infrastructure of existing businesses to freestanding businesses of their own.
Saito Kawasaki both encourages bottom-up initiatives like this and selects businesses in a top-down manner. The important thing is to foster the kind of ambitious spirit needed to propose and try out ideas without fear of failure. In addition, the people working in cross-business projects under the direct control of the president are now discovering various initiatives at other internal companies—discoveries that I think will create tremendous future opportunities for Kawasaki. I think we can expect great things from this.
leveraging data will, I think, generate new businesses. The fact that Kawasaki handles such a tremendous amount of data means that it already has a tre- mendous amount of raw material to work with, so I have great expectations for DX.
Kohdera The integration of the inter- nal companies and other internal units is very important, but I think that, whether for Group Vision 2030 or DX, Kawasaki can achieve its goals faster by working more with outside part- ners. Competing in global markets means that Kawasaki is up against not only the rest of Japan, but the world. Given that, I think that to reach its major goals going forward, Kawasaki should advance collaboration, such as cooperation between Japanese compa- nies. Kawasaki does relatively little M&A, so this will require a proactive and deliberate approach.
   Tell us your thoughts on Group Vision 2030.
Saito Kawasaki’s internal companies have each built their own information platforms, and integrating these has been very challenging. Although cer- tain difficulties may be inevitable due to Kawasaki’s conglomerate nature, right now, standardizing the base upon which such systems are built is crucial. Standardization is the foundation of DX, and processes that are unstandard- ized cannot be digitized. At the same
time, we must think about ways to use AI in grander initiatives. Until now, Kawasaki has been a bit behind in DX, but if the Company can effectively implement initiatives in AI and related areas, it could quickly turn the tables. I think that Kawasaki’s aggressive investment to take advantage of this opportunity is highly laudable. Furthermore, I hope to see Kawasaki steadily build global networks.
    Has the vision for Kawasaki’s future changed in light of the TCFD recommendations or the Japanese government’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050?
   Tsujimura A key part of Group Vision 2030 is the idea of building new teams that combine the distinct strengths of the internal companies. I think this is an excellent vision for the Group and provides inspiration for the future even amid the downturn in performance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Achieving it will require the internal companies to change their mentalities. To that end, Kawasaki has launched projects under the direct control of the president. These have had a tremen- dous impact. Our role as members of top management is to guide new busi- nesses toward success, however small their beginnings. Also, I think it will be
important for new business ideas to come not only from President Hashimoto, but also from the people at the front lines of existing businesses.
Kohdera As Mr. Tsujimura said, I think that what Kawasaki needs now is cross-divisional development in tech- nological and other areas that tran- scends the boundaries of the internal companies. The ideas in Group Vision 2030 are very good, but 2030 will be here before we know it. It will be cru- cial to make sure that Kawasaki does not content itself with simply having drawn up the vision, but rather takes action, with an emphasis on speed, to make it a reality.
Kanehana Addressing climate change involves both offensive and defensive strategies. The offensive side includes selling products aimed at achieving low or zero carbon emissions, such as those using hydrogen. Defense entails reducing CO2 emissions throughout the value chain; we are already approach- ing a time when it will be difficult to sell products if such efforts are neglected. Developing both defensive and offensive measures will be an extremely important topic for us to discuss within the Board of Directors. Saito Kawasaki has always manufac- tured and sold products that emit CO2. In terms of offering products that help reduce CO2 emissions, I think that the
development of hydrogen-powered tur- bines and reciprocating engines is very promising. I doubt that, going forward, electric motors will be adopted for all forms of propulsion, so hydrogen fuel will be essential. What’s more, I think that only Kawasaki can develop the air- planes, ships, plants, and other products that will use new hydrogen technolo- gies. It will be important to take the lead in manufacturing in the hydrogen- powered market in order to win out over global competition, and for this, Kawasaki will need to move fast. Kohdera With TCFD, the carbon neu- tral target, and other systems as well, international frameworks have first developed overseas, and Japanese
companies have then had to adjust to them in order to do business. I think that Japanese companies need to take part in the formulation of such sys- tems, with a more proactive mindset of creating systems and standards and driving change around the world them- selves. Kawasaki is just one company, so there are areas in which there is no alternative to a more passive approach, working within bounds set by others. However, looking around the world, I think there is a clear pat- terns of companies that have been highly effective in creating systems and de-facto standards, resulting in great profits.
Tsujimura Kawasaki is at the leading edge in hydrogen and has a tremen- dous advantage, so I think that, no matter what, Kawasaki needs to be creating the international standards. For this, Kawasaki may also need to further strengthen cooperation with government agencies. As Japan and the world work toward carbon neutral- ity, companies with outstanding tech- nologies will gain a greater edge. This will take time, but I think Kawasaki must continue to patiently invest in such areas.

Transforming Mindsets
Kawasaki has adopted a new personnel system. Please tell us about its uptake inter- nally and any changes in mindsets or behavior you have seen in employees.
     Kanehana Transforming employee mindsets requires ongoing work. Shortly after I became president, we launched K-Win Activities to promote innovation in our organizational struc- tures, mindsets, and work processes, and President Hashimoto has carried on this charge. Changing mindsets requires the combination of K-Win Activities, the Business Idea Challenge, projects under the direct control of the president, changes to the personnel system, and businesses that go beyond the bounds of existing systems, activi- ties, and organizations. I think that such efforts are gradually beginning to yield results, and I will be interested to see how the results of our annual employee engagement survey change going forward.
understand employee performance and recognize such performance fairly. We also sought to build mechanisms to help employees sustain a spirit of ambition over the long term. I think that Kawasaki must begin by carefully communicating these purposes of the system to employees. The employee engagement survey is also important. If the survey results are unfavorable, Kawasaki must assiduously identify the root of the problem and patiently implement improvements, just as with quality control issues. If the new per- sonnel system is operated poorly in the first year or two, I think employee demotivation could become a serious risk. I hope to provide oversight to help ensure that such problems do not arise, because the foundation of a company is its people.
their hard work and motivation, but I
think that the portion of employees who struggle to adapt to the new sys- tem will probably be greater. Keeping an eye on and addressing such dark spots will be important.
Saito Under the new personnel sys- tem, Kawasaki has created a new indi- cator, the designation of highly effective employee, based on the engagement survey. Increasing the number of highly effective employees is important, but if it leads to a kind of stereotyping of employees as either highly effective or not, I think it will have a negative effect. If the sur- vey finds few highly effective employees, that reflects a shortcoming on the part of the Company and man- agement, something for human resources divisions to solve, rather than a fault in employees. The mecha- nisms of the new system can be a double-edged sword, so Kawasaki’s human resources divisions and man- agement will need to work hard to enhance their knowledge and abilities as needed. Setting the course for the system over the next two years or so will be extremely important.

Kanehana We decided to have Vice- President Yamamoto serve as general manager of the Human Resources Division for that reason. President Hashimoto and Vice President Yamamoto are very dedicated to per- sonnel system reforms. Because the system is new, there may be issues and difficulties at first, but I am sure they will be able to find top-down fixes as they proceed. For my part, I will work to ensure that the Board of

 Corporate Governance System
Kawasaki is a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee and has voluntarily established a Nomination Advisory Committee and a Compensation Advisory Committee as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors as a well as a Management Committee, an Executive Officers Committee, and other governance bodies.
Compensation Advisory Committee
The Compensation Advisory Committee has been established as an advisory body to the Board of Directors in an effort to reinforce the transparency and objectivity of its deliberations. A majority of the committee members are Outside Directors, as is the presiding officer. The Compensation Advisory Committee discusses such matters as Director compensation policy and systems and the appropriateness of individual Directors’ compensation and provides reports and advice to the Board of Directors.
Business Execution Framework
Kawasaki has adopted an executive officer system in order to facilitate response to rapid changes in the business environment. To accelerate decision making, a great deal of authority over business execution decisions is delegated to the executive Directors and executive officers, who are appointed by the Board of Directors.

• Management Committee
Kawasaki maintains a Management Committee, comprising mainly executive Directors and internal company presidents, as an advisory body to the president. The Management Committee discusses matters that are important to business execution.
For the sake of auditing business execution, Directors who serve as full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee Members also attend the committee’s meetings.
• Executive Officers Committee
Kawasaki maintains an Executive Officers Committee, compris- ing all of the executive officers, with the President as the pre- siding officer, to build unified consensus in Group management and smoothly advance business execution. This committee issues business execution policy based on management policy and plans determined mainly by the Board of Directors and Management Committee as well as decisions made by the Management Committee. It also discusses management issues.
For the sake of auditing business execution, Directors who serve as full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee Members also attend the committee’s meetings.
• Major Project Committee
To manage risk before bidding on and making investment deci- sions regarding major projects that could significantly impact operations and performance, Kawasaki maintains a Major Project Committee, attended by representatives from related Head Office divisions and divisions related to specific projects, with the general manager of the Corporate Planning Division serving as presiding officer. The Major Project Committee evaluates and considers ways of addressing the risks of such projects.
• Company-wide Quality Committee
To reinforce quality control at the internal companies, Kawasaki maintains a Company-wide Quality Committee, com- prising representatives from the Corporate Planning Division, Corporate Technology Division, and the related divisions of the internal companies and other related companies, with the vice president in charge of technology serving as the presiding offi- cer. The Company-wide Quality Committee discusses Company- wide quality control policy, ensures its application, and shares information.
• Sustainability Committee
To promote the sustainability of society, the environment, and the Kawasaki Group, Kawasaki maintains a Sustainability Committee, comprising the Directors (excluding the Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside Directors), the internal company presidents, the executive officer in charge of sustainability, the general managers of the Head Office divi- sions, and others, with the President serving as presiding offi- cer. The Sustainability Committee discusses and decides measures to promote sustainability and monitors the achieve- ment of targets and compliance with such policy.
For the sake of auditing business execution and to reflect a broad range of external insights and opinions in the commit- tee’s decisions, Directors who serve as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members as well as the remaining Outside Directors also attend the committee’s meetings.
• Company-wide Compliance Committee
To ensure rigorous compliance throughout the Kawasaki Group, Kawasaki maintains a Company-wide Compliance Committee, comprising the Directors (excluding the Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside Directors), the internal com- pany presidents, the executive officer in charge of compliance, the general managers of the Head Office divisions, and others, with the President serving as presiding officer. The Company- wide Compliance Committee discusses and decides measures to ensure thorough compliance and monitors the achievement of targets and compliance with such policy.
For the sake of auditing business execution and to reflect a broad range of external insights and opinions in the commit- tee’s decisions, Directors who serve as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members as well as the remaining Outside Directors also attend the committee’s meetings.

 The Board of Directors comprises 13 Directors (of whom, five serve as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members), with the chairman serving as the presiding officer by resolution of the Board. Six Directors are Outside Directors (of whom, three serve as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members) and independent of business execution. By avoiding having Directors serve concurrently as officers responsible for specific businesses (the internal company presidents), the Company seeks to enhance the sep- aration of management oversight and business execution and thereby further rein- force the Board of Director’s oversight functions.
Audit & Supervisory Committee
The Audit & Supervisory Committee comprises five Directors, including three Outside Directors. To secure effective oversight, the two internal Directors have been appoint- ed as full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee Members. Furthermore, to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, the Company appoints Audit & Supervisory Committee Members who have considerable knowledge of finance and accounting.
Nomination Advisory Committee
The Nomination Advisory Committee has been established as an advisory body to the Board of Directors in an effort to reinforce the transparency and objectivity of its deliberations. A majority of the committee members are Outside Directors, as is the presiding officer. The Nomination Advisory Committee discusses such matters as poli- cies and standards pertaining to the appointment of Directors and other officers as well as the appropriateness of candidates for such positions and provides reports and advice to the Board of Directors.

 Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ Effectiveness
The Board of Directors strives to ensure that its members, including independent Outside Directors, engage in free, vigorous dis- cussion based on their insights and experience and reach appropriate management decisions. As part of these efforts, since fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors annually evaluates and analyzes the effectiveness of its operations.
Initiatives to Address Issues Identified in the Course of Preceding Evaluations
Along with overlaps between agenda items discussed by the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, the delegation of authority from the former to the latter has been considered an issue that must be addressed. In response, the Board of Directors delegated its authority over decisions on specific projects and other matters to executive bodies, including the Management Committee, in conjunction with the June 2020 transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. In this way, the Board of Directors strove to resolve the aforementioned overlaps. At the same time, it was decided that matters deemed particularly important must be dis- cussed by the Board of Directors, which is charged with supervising the execution of business, after sufficient deliberation by the Management Committee. As such, efforts are under way to strengthen the Company’s governance structure.
To realize Group Vision 2030, “Trustworthy Solutions for the Future,” established in November 2020, the compensation system for Directors (excluding Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside Directors) was revised in accordance with basic policies described on page 58.
Descriptions of risk analysis in handout materials used at Board of Directors meetings have been considered insufficient. To resolve this issue, a new process was instituted, mandating that projects to be discussed by the Board of Directors must undergo suffi- cient verification in terms of risk identification and risk countermeasures. Following this verification, these projects must be deliberated by the Management Committee before being addressed by the Board of Directors which, in turn, receives briefings on risk verification results, examines conclusions reached by the Management Committee, and gives final approval.
With the objective of ensuring the early detection of signs of changes in the business environment, a framework has been developed to ensure that, among factors that could exert a profound impact on the Company’s management plans and operating results, matters deemed particularly important are swiftly reported to the Board of Directors. By doing so, the Company is endeavoring to strengthen monitoring functions provided by the Board of Directors.
Initiatives to Further Improve Effectiveness
The Board of Directors engages in the periodic discussion of important management policies and strategies (e.g. sustainability management policies, human resource strate- gies, corporate transformation) in light of the recent revision of the Corporate Governance Code.
The Board of Directors and the Nomination Advisory Committee strive to identify skills and other requirements for Director candidates in light of the Company’s medium- to long-term management policies and strategies. Through the preparation of a skills matrix, the Board of Directors also endeavors to ensure that its members, collectively, possess all the necessary skills.
The Board of Directors and the Nomination Advisory Committee deliberate on require- ments for future leadership successors, such as desirable traits of those in key posi- tions, including the CEO and internal company presidents, thereby pushing ahead with the preparation of successor training plans.
The Board of Directors receives periodic reporting on the status of the development and operation of risk management structures in addition to monitoring the results of evaluations regarding the development and operation of internal control systems as part of its efforts to strengthen its supervisory functions.

   Director Compensation
To realize Group Vision 2030, “Trustworthy Solutions for the Future,” established in November 2020, the Company has revised its basic policies for Director compensation as well as its composition, determination process, and other relevant matters. Details are as follows.
Basic Policy
Placing stronger emphasis on contribution to the Company’s goals, the revised compensation system is designed to reward each recipient based on their responsibilities and accomplishments. To this end, it not only provides short-term incentives but also rewards Directors for their contributions to medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value. In this way, we aim to promote the sharing of value between Directors and stakeholders, including shareholders.
Compensation for Directors (Excluding Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and Outside Directors)
Short-term incentives (performance-based compensation)
1 Payment Ratio Based on Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent
2 Process for Determining Level of Achievement of Individual Performance Targets
Setting of Targets
Each Director sets their own targets in terms of addressing short-, medium- and long-term issues, including those associated with business units and operations under their supervision and Company-wide issues. These include targets pertaining to important financial indicators as well as targets associat- ed with initiatives aimed at realizing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), efforts to improve employee engagement, and other aspects of non-financial performance.
•Targets for short-term issues: Targets to be achieved by the end of the fiscal year •Targets for medium- to long-term issues: Targets to be achieved in light of
the Group Vision 2030
Methods for Determining the Level of Target Achievement
•President: After a face-to-face interview with Outside Directors who serve as members of the Compensation Advisory Committee, the level of achieve- ment is determined via discussion among these Outside Directors.
•Vice President: After a face-to-face interview with Outside Directors who serve as members of the Compensation Advisory Committee, the level of achievement is determined via discussion among these Outside Directors and the president.
•Other Directors: After a face-to-face interview with the president and vice president, who together formulate a draft performance evaluation, the level of achievement is determined by the resolution of the Board of Directors based on the deliberations of the Compensation Advisory Committee.

     Compensation for Directors consists of basic compensation, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. Basic compen- sation and short-term incentives are paid in cash. Long-term incentives are paid in the form of performance-based stock compensation to promote the sharing of benefits and risks between the Directors and shareholders in addition to more strongly incentivizing medium- to long-term contribution to corporate value.
These three components of director compensation account for approximately 50%, 30%, and 20%, respectively, of the total, assuming that the Group’s consolidated operating results in the preceding fiscal year reached target levels and that each Director’s individual performance targets for said fiscal year are fully met.
    Basic compensation (fixed compensation)
Payment method
Cash
Each Director’s pay grade is determined based on the missions assigned to them.
Performance-based compensation is determined in line with single-year operating results and other indicators. Specifically, the amount of this compensation is determined based on consolidated operat- ing results and the level of achievement of each Director’s individual performance targets.
Profit attributable to owners of parent is used as the indicator for assessing consolidated operating results, with the aim of providing incentives for the steady accomplishment of single-year operating results targets and promoting the sharing of value with shareholders.
The payment ratio applied to this performance-based compensation is determined based on the profit attributable to owners of parent for the year, as presented on the next page (see 1). Details of the process for determining the level of achievement are presented in 2 on the same page.
Long-term incentives utilize a stock benefit trust and are determined based on fixed points granted to Directors in line with their periods of service as well as performance-based points granted for their accomplishments vis-à-vis individual performance targets. In principle, these incentives are paid to the recipients in the form of both Company shares and cash (the latter being in an amount equivalent to the value of a portion of said shares after conversion) at the time of their retirement as Director. The proportions of fixed points and performance-based points are designed to account for 50% each when the recipient’s level of achievement is at a standard level.
Details of the process for determining the level of achievement are presented in 2 on the next page.
Compensation of Outside Directors and Directors Serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members
To ensure their professional independence, compensation for these individuals consists only of fixed compensation and is not linked with performance.

          Cash
Methods for Determining Compensation
The total maximum amount of compensation for Directors (exclud- ing Audit & Compensation Committee Members) is set by a resolu- tion passed at the General Meeting of Shareholders. Within this limit, the amount of compensation is determined by the resolution of the Board of Directors based on the deliberations of the Compensation Advisory Committee. The presiding officer and a majority of the members of the Compensation Advisory Committee are Outside Directors.
The Board of Directors may also resolve to entrust the president with the responsibility of determining the amount of
compensation for each director. In such cases, however, the presi- dent is required to honor the conclusions reached via the delibera- tions of the Compensation Advisory Committee and comply with policies regarding the determination of the amounts of director compensation and methods for calculating such compensation.
To ensure their professional independence, compensation for Audit & Supervisory Committee Members consists only of fixed compensation and is not linked with performance. Compensation for these individuals is determined by deliberations among Directors who serve as Audit & Supervisory Committee Members.

Compliance/Risk Management
  Basic Stance on Compliance
The Kawasaki Group Management Principles, part of the Kawasaki Group Mission Statement, extol the corporate virtue of “recognizing social responsibility and coexisting harmoniously with the environ- ment, society as a whole, local communities, and individuals,” and in the Kawasaki Group Action Guidelines, we ask each and every member of the Group to “earn the trust of the community through high ethical standards and the example you set for others.”
We have established the Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct and set ethical standards to be the basis of decisions. At the same time, the Regulations Concerning the Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct, a set of internal rules, requires executives and employees to comply with the Code of Conduct.
Compliance Promotion Structure
The Corporate CSR Committee comprises all Directors and Audit & Supervisory Committee Members and is chaired by the Kawasaki president. The committee meets at least twice a year (three meet- ings in fiscal 2020). Its functions are to discuss and determine mea- sures to ensure that the Kawasaki Group fulfills its corporate social responsibilities and maintains thorough compliance, and to monitor the achievement levels and status of compliance efforts. To ensure that the objectives of the Corporate CSR Committee extend to all corporate structures throughout the Group, business segment CSR committee meetings are held at least twice a year at the head office and internal companies.
In fiscal 2021, the committee was renamed the Company-wide Compliance Committee and the committee structure revised to place greater weight on discussing Company-wide compliance issues and measures going forward.

Compliance Promotion Initiatives
Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct
In July 2017, we established the Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct as a set of ethical standards to guide the decision making of Kawasaki Group executives and employees. This code is a set of common conduct guidelines that all members of the Group must abide by, regardless of the situation or
Compliance Guidebook
The Compliance Guidebook provides knowledge that is neces- sary and useful for ensuring thorough compliance within the Company in an easy-to-understand way. The guidebook is dis- tributed to all executives, employees, and temporary staff at all Group companies in Japan.
The Compliance Guidebook is structured to correspond with the items in the Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct and serves as a guide for the Code of Conduct’s practical application. It outlines the Group’s compliance system and activities as well as the Compliance Reporting and Consultation System, which serves as the Group’s internal whistle-blowing system. The
Employee Awareness Surveys
The Kawasaki Group previously implemented periodic employ- ee awareness surveys to monitor internal compliance violation risks. Since 2020, compliance awareness is measured using compliance-related questions that have been added to the employee engagement surveys carried out by the Human
Basic Stance on Risk Management
In accordance with the Companies Act, the Kawasaki Board of Directors has adopted a basic policy for internal control systems. This policy stipulates that we identify, classify, analyze, and assess risks and then implement risk management (avoidance, reduction, etc.) in line with the Risk Management Regulations.
Risk Monitoring System
In order to appropriately handle diverse risks, Kawasaki desig- nates the internal committees and divisions responsible for specific risk types, requiring them to establish and operate management methods and systems. In addition, we have established a system for the centralized monitoring of the effectiveness and workability of such management systems to avoid and minimize risks and losses caused by the materializa- tion of risks.

The Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct contains 12 sections
under the theme “Acting Correctly” and 10 sections under the theme “Working with Stakeholders.”
guidebook uses illustrations to provide accessible explanations of relevant laws and regulations, important compliance-related matters, and case studies. It is divided into 19 sections under two overarching themes, which are the same as those in the Group Code of Conduct: “Acceptable Business Conduct” and “Dealing with Stakeholders.”
The Compliance Guidebook is used in internal compliance training and educational activities. Since the first edition was issued in 2003, its content has been constantly updated in light of evolving compliance requirements around the world, and it was completely overhauled in 2021.
Resources Division. Kawasaki studies the survey results and implements any necessary compliance measures based on its findings. In addition, changes and trends in employee aware- ness are analyzed and reflected in subsequent initiatives.
In addition, to achieve sustained improvements in profitabil- ity and enterprise value, the Kawasaki Group Mission Statement identifies risk management as a guiding theme of the Kawasaki Group Management Principles.
execution, in accordance with such company regulations as the Major Project Risk Management Regulations, the relevant divi- sions must assess and analyze such risks in advance and fully consider appropriate responses. In particular, the Company practices even more thorough risk management for major proj- ects with significant impact on operations, including that at the time of bidding and concluding agreements for such projects as well as regular follow-up by the Head Office and internal companies as needed after such projects begin.
We have established the Compliance Reporting and Consultation System, with an outside lawyer acting as the contact, so that execu- tives and employees (including contract employees, temporary staff, and retired employees) of the Company and domestic consolidated subsidiaries can report or seek consultation regarding suspected violations of compliance practices relating to their operations.
Under the Compliance Reporting and Consultation System, employees report to or consult with an outside lawyer directly. The lawyer then investigates to determine whether or not there is in fact a compliance problem and, if a problem is found, advises the Company on how to remedy it. Furthermore, the lawyer reports the results of this process back to the employee who used the system.
During the investigation, the employee’s name is not disclosed to the Company without his or her permission. The system accepts
both anonymous reports and reports filed under the complainants’ names, enabling us to able to gather information on and address a wider range of compliance issues.
The Group works to ensure that employees know how to use this system by providing information on it via such means as the Company intranet, Kawasaki Group Code of Conduct pamphlets, Compliance Guidebook, and Group newsletters.
There were 39 reports or consultations made through the Compliance Reporting and Consultation System in fiscal 2020.
In fiscal 2020, we launched a global whistle-blowing system for some overseas affiliates. We will increase the range of companies covered by the system in fiscal 2021 and beyond, operating it as key part of the Group’s compliance promotion efforts at the global level.

The MSCI Japan ESG Select Leaders Index features companies with high ESG perfor- mance selected from its parent index (MSCI Japan IMI Top 700 Index: Top 700 securities based on market capitalization). The index selects companies with the tar- get of covering 50% of the market capital- ization within each GICS® sector of the parent index.
The MSCI Japan Empowering Women Index (WIN) features companies with excellent gender diversity selected from each GICS® sector of its parent index (MSCI Japan IMI Top 700 Index: Top 700 securi- ties based on market capitalization).
The S&P/JPX Carbon Efficient Index uses as its parent index the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), a leading stock index used to represent the movement of the Japanese market and weights companies based on their environmental information disclosure and carbon efficiency (carbon emissions per unit of net sales).

Products to be assessed: Kawasaki-brand Green Products, products that use waste, waste heat, and renewable energy, as well as cogeneration systems and rolling stock pertaining to modal shifts, etc. Estimated based on product deliveries. Calculation rules were revised in fiscal 2017, and a flow- based approach (based on the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Guideline for Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Contribution) in which the period of assessment is the estimated useful life of products sold in the fiscal year was adopted. This allows us to calculate the difference in CO2 emissions between our products and industry standard class products.

Management Discussion & Analysis
Overview
With the spread of variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 around the world, the out- look for an end to the pandemic remains uncertain. However, due to the progress of vaccination mainly in developed countries, there has been a decrease in the number of new infections in some areas, and there are also signs of a recovery in demand for short- distance flights and an increase in demand for air freight in the United States and Japan. In addition, there are promising signs that the global economy will recover in the future, supported by various countries’ fiscal and monetary policies of and efforts to real- ize a decarbonized society. As U.S.-China relations remain unimproved, it is necessary to continue to pay close attention to the downside risks of the global economy.
Amid such an operating environment, the Group’s orders received in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, decreased versus the previous fiscal year, in the Aerospace Systems segment and the Rolling Stock segment despite increases in the Ship & Offshore Structure and the Precision Machinery & Robot segment. Net sales decreased versus the previous fiscal year overall, due to decreases in the Aerospace Systems segment and other segments despite increases in the Precision Machinery & Robot segment and Ship & Offshore Structure segment. Operating profit declined, due to deterioration in profitability in the Aerospace Systems segment and other fac- tors, despite the improvement in the Motorcycle & Engine segment. Recurring profit declined due to a decline in operating profit despite foreign exchange gains and reversal of the provision for the in-service issues of commercial aircraft. A loss attribut- able to owners of parent was recorded due to impairment losses recorded under extraordinary loss as well as a recurring loss despite decrease in tax expense due to rec- ognition of deferred tax assets.
As a result, the Group’s consolidated orders received decreased ¥111.0 billion versus the same period of the previous fis- cal year to ¥1,402.4 billion, consolidated net sales decreased ¥152.8 billion year on year to ¥1,488.4 billion, operating loss came to ¥5.3 billion, deteriorating ¥67.3 billion year on year, recurring loss totaled ¥2.8 billion, deteriorating ¥43.2 billion year on year, and loss attributable to owners of parent came
to ¥19.3 billion, deteriorating ¥37.9 billion
year on year. ROIC* was negative 1.0%, while
ROE was negative 4.2%.
* Before-tax ROIC = EBIT (profit before income taxes + interest expense) / invested capital (interest-bearing debt + shareholders’ equity)
The Company has changed the fiscal year- end of its six consolidated subsidiaries from December 31 to March 31 or to a provision- al fiscal year-end method. As a result, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the accounting period of 6 consolidated subsid- iaries was 15 months (January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021).
Business segment
The following sections supply additional details on the consolidated performance of each business segment. Please note that operating profit or loss includes interseg- ment transactions.
Aerospace Systems
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Aerospace Systems segment, there is a certain level of demand from the Ministry of Defense in Japan amid the tight defense budget. With respect to commercial aircraft, global passenger demand has been sluggish due to the COVID-19 pandemic and demand for commercial aircraft airframes and jet engines has declined.
Amid such an operating environment, con- solidated orders received decreased ¥85.4 billion year on year to ¥329.5 billion due to decreases in orders for component parts of airframes and jet engines for commercial air- craft, despite an increase in orders received from the Ministry of Defense in Japan.
Consolidated net sales decreased ¥154.8 billion year on year to ¥377.7 billion due to decreases in sales of component parts of air- frames for Ministry of Defense in Japan and commercial aircraft and of component parts of commercial aircraft jet engines.
Operating loss came to ¥31.6 billion, dete- riorating ¥74.4 billion year on year, mainly due to the decrease in sales.
Energy System & Plant Engineering
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Energy System & Plant Engineering segment, in Japan, there is ongoing demand for replacing aging facilities for refuse incineration plants, while over the medium to long term, demand for
distributed power sources in Japan and overseas, and for energy infrastructure development in emerging markets, remains firmly rooted. On the other hand, although there are signs of economic recovery in the Chinese market, where the virus has been successfully contained at a relatively early stage, and in some developed countries where the infection is showing signs of abat- ing, there are concerns about the impact on some sales and after-sales service activities because restrictions on the movement of people remain significant.
Amid such an operating environment, con- solidated orders received amounted to ¥219.0 billion, a decrease of ¥33.3 billion compared to the same period of the previ- ous year, when the Company received orders for major construction of domestic waste disposal facilities.
Consolidated net sales decreased by ¥2.8 billion to ¥240.1 billion compared to the same period of the previous year, when the Company recorded sales to overseas chemi- cal plants, despite an increase in the volume of work on domestic waste disposal facilities and higher sales of Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (GTCC) power plants in Japan.
Operating profit decreased ¥4.1 billion year on year to ¥13.4 billion due to the decrease in revenue, as well as losses on operations resulting from the effect of COVID-19 pandemic.
Precision Machinery & Robot
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Precision Machinery & Robot segment, in the precision machinery field, the Chinese construction machinery market recovered quickly from the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and saw record-high sales of hydraulic excavators. While construction machinery markets out- side China had stagnated, with demand declining significantly due to the impact of the pandemic, lately there have been very clear signs of a recovery in demand. In the robot field, while some general-purpose robots projects have been postponed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of general industrial robots have been solid in the Chinese market where the recovery in sales of such robots was rapid. With respect to robots for the semiconductor market, per- formance is strong due to increased capital investment by manufacturers of semicon- ductor manufacturing equipment, and
demand is expected to steadily expand over the medium to long term as well.
Amid such an operating environment, con- solidated orders received increased ¥40.5 billion year on year to ¥259.4 billion, due to increases in hydraulic components for the construction machinery market and robots for the semiconductor and vehicle body assembly markets.
Consolidated net sales increased by ¥23.4 billion year on year to ¥240.8 billion due to increases in sales of hydraulic components for the construction machinery market and robots for the semiconductor and vehicle body assembly markets.
Operating profit increased ¥1.8 billion year on year to ¥14.0 billion due to the increase in revenue.
Ship & Offshore Structure
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Ship & Offshore Structure seg- ment, despite the emergence of demand for gas-fueled vessels in conjunction with tight- er environmental regulations, the situation remains challenging due to the limited num- ber of business talks on new projects due to the continued uncertainty of the global economy.
Amid such an operating environment, con- solidated orders received increased by ¥41.8 billion to ¥98.1 billion from the previ- ous fiscal year due to orders for a submarine for Ministry of Defense in Japan.
Consolidated net sales increased ¥7.7 bil- lion year on year to ¥79.4 billion, mainly due to an increase in the volume of work of submarines for Ministry of Defense in Japan.
Operating loss worsened by ¥2.4 billion year on year to ¥3.0 billion mainly due to the posting of losses from operations, despite the increase in revenue.
Rolling Stock
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Rolling Stock segment, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a review of railway-related investment plans in Japan, and delays in work processes as well as postponement and cancellation of biddings overseas. In the medium and long terms, however, relatively stable growth is expected around the world due to the devel- opment of urban transportation as an envi- ronmental protection measure and to ease congestion in large cities caused by increas- ing population concentration, as well as
  70 Kawasaki Report 2021
Kawasaki Report 2021 71

demand for railway infrastructure following economic development in Asian countries.
Amid such an operating environment, consolidated orders received amounted to ¥77.0 billion, a decline of ¥48.7 billion com- pared with the previous fiscal year, when the Company received orders for large-scale projects in Japan.
Consolidated net sales decreased ¥3.3 bil- lion year on year to ¥133.2 billion, due to
a decrease in sales of rolling stock in the United States.
Operating loss worsened by ¥0.7 billion year on year to ¥4.5 billion, mainly due to a deterioration in the profitability of over- seas projects caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to the decrease in revenue.
Motorcycle & Engine
Regarding the business environment sur- rounding the Motorcycle & Engine segment, the COVID-19 impacted the main markets. In the United States, a major market, demand for off-road models such as four-wheeled vehicles increased compared with the previ- ous year, and in the European market, although there was a temporary negative impact from the lockdown in various coun- tries in the early spring, the level has recov- ered to the level of the previous year. Meanwhile, Southeast Asian markets continued to stagnate.
Amid such an operating environment, con- solidated net sales decreased ¥1.0 billion year on year to ¥336.6 billion, due to decreased sales of motorcycles in Southeast Asian markets and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar, despite increased sales of off-road models such as four-wheeled vehicles in the North American market.
Operating profit came to ¥11.7 billion, improving ¥13.7 billion year on year, due to reductions in fixed costs and promotion expenses.
Other Operations
Consolidated net sales decreased ¥22.0 billion year on year to ¥80.4 billion.
Operating profit decreased ¥0.7 billion year on year to ¥0.4 billion.
In the Group Vision 2030, the Group will focus on three fields; “A Safe and Secure Remotely-Connected Society”, “Near-Future Mobility” and “Energy and Environmental Solutions” and will transform our business
structure into a form that promises faster growth in line with environmental changes. The Group is making steady progress in new businesses, such as the development of sur- gical support robots and automated PCR testing, the development of delivery robots and unmanned transport helicopters, and the promotion of hydrogen-related projects.
Consolidated financial position
(1) Assets
Current assets were ¥1,285.4 billion, a ¥26.6 billion increase from the previous fiscal year mainly due to an increase in inventories. Fixed assets were ¥677.8 billion, a ¥21.1 billion decrease from the previous fiscal year mainly due to depreciation of property, plant and equipment. As a result, total assets were ¥1,963.2 billion, ¥5.4 billion increase from the previous fiscal year.
(2) Liabilities
Interest-bearing debt was ¥593.3 billion, a ¥25.8 billion increase from the previous fis- cal year. Total liabilities were ¥1,480.5 bil- lion, a ¥5.7 billion decrease from the previous fiscal year mainly due to a decrease in notes and accounts payable-trade.
(3) Net assets
Total net assets were ¥482.7 billion, an ¥11.2 billion increase from the previous fis- cal year mainly due to an increase in remea- surements of defined benefit plans.
Cash Flows
(1) Cash flows from operating activities
Operating activities provided net cash of ¥34.6 billion, a ¥50.0 billion turnaround from the previous fiscal year, when operat- ing activities used net cash of ¥15.4 billion. Major sources of operating cash flows included a decrease in trade receivables of ¥23.2 billion and depreciation and amortiza- tion of ¥61.2 billion. Major uses of operating cash flows included the expenditure of ¥26.3 billion due to an increase in invento- ries assets, ¥16.7 billion due to a decrease in trade payables.
(2) Cash flows from investing activities
Investing activities used net cash of ¥37.3 billion which is ¥32.0 billion less than in the
previous fiscal year, and mainly reflected the purchase of property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets.
(3) Cash flows from financing activities
Financing activities provided net cash of ¥23.0 billion, which is ¥92.7 billion less than in the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to proceeds from issuance of bonds.
Dividends
As a basic management policy, the Company aims to increase corporate value by consis- tently generating profit exceeding the cost of invested capital. In line with this policy, the Company believes that one priority for management is to engage in cutting-edge research and development as well as the innovative capital investment required to achieve future growth and thereby return profits to shareholders by enhancing share- holder value over the long term.
In order to maintain a good balance between enhancing shareholder value and returning profits to shareholders through dividends, the Company has set a medium- to long-term consolidated payout ratio stan- dard of 30% corresponding to the consolidated profit attributable to the own- ers of the parent and in light of both the outlook for future earnings and a compre- hensive examination of its financial condi- tion, including its free cash flow, D/E ratio (debt-to-equity ratio) and other factors.
The Company has a basic policy of distrib- uting surplus retained earnings as dividends twice a year, once after the fiscal second quarter and once after the fiscal year-end. Interim dividends are authorized by the Board of Directors, while year-end dividends are authorized at the general meetings of shareholders.

Kawasaki Report 2021 81
The accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
KAWASAKI HEAVY INDUSTRIES, LTD. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
1.
Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (together the “Companies”) have been prepared from the financial statements filed with the Prime Minister as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act in Japan and in accordance with accounting principles gener- ally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements from International Financial Reporting Standards. Certain reclassifications have been made in the accompanying consolidated financial state- ments to facilitate understanding by readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifica- tions have been made in the 2020 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classification used in 2021. The Company and its subsidiaries adopted ASBJ Statement No. 31 “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates” (March 31, 2020) to the consolidated financial statements for the current consolidated fiscal year, and therefore significant accounting estimates are disclosed in the note to the consolidated financial- statements. The note does not include information for the prior consolidated fiscal year in accordance with the transitional provision set out in paragraph 11 of the Accounting Standard.
The translations of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2021, which was ¥110.72 to U.S.$1.00. The translations should not be construed as rep- resentations that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been or could in the future be converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. As permitted, fractional amounts have not been adjusted.
(a) Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and significant companies over which the Company has power of control through majority voting rights or the existence of certain other conditions evidencing control. The consolidat- ed financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 99 subsidiaries (96 in the year ended March 31, 2020). The aggregate amount of total assets, net sales, profit and retained earnings of the excluded subsidiaries would not have had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if they had been included in the consolidation.
(b) Application of the equity method of accounting
Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for by the equity method. For the year ended March 31, 2021, 19 affiliates (17 in 2020) were accounted for by the equity method. For the year ended March 31, 2021, investments in 11 affiliates (11 in 2020) were stated at cost without applying the equity method of accounting. If the equity method had been applied for these investments, the profit and retained earnings of these excluded subsidiaries and affiliates would not have had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
(c) Consolidated subsidiaries’ fiscal year-end
For the year ended March 31, 2021, the fiscal year-end of 24 consolidated subsidiaries (30 in 2020) was December 31. These subsidiaries were consolidated as of December 31, and significant transactions for the period between December 31 and March 31, the Company’s fiscal year-end, were adjusted for on consolidation.
Effective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, 6 companies of Kawasaki Precision Machinery (Suzhou) Ltd., Kawasaki Precision Machinery Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Kawasaki Robotics (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., Kawasaki Chunhui Precision Machinery (Zhejiang) Ltd., Kawasaki Robotics (Kunshan) Co., Ltd. and Kawasaki Robotics Korea, Ltd., which previously had December 31 as their fiscal year-end, changed their fiscal year-end to March 31 or changed to a method of having provisional settlement on March 31, which is the
consolidated fiscal year-end, in accordance with the final settlement and consolidating it. Accordingly, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company consolidated the finan- cial statements of these consolidated subsidiaries for the 15-month period from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021, and the effect of the change in the fiscal year-end was adjusted for on the consolidated statements of profit and loss. These consolidated subsidiaries whose fis- cal year-ends were changed recorded net sales of ¥13,522 million ($122,128 thousand), operating profit of ¥1,976 million ($17,847 thousand), ordinary profit of ¥2,447 million ($22,101 thousand) and Profit before income taxes of ¥2,447 million ($22,101 thousand) from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021.
(d) Foreign currency translations
Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at year-end rates. The balance sheets of the consolidated overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at year-end rates, except for shareholders’ equity accounts, which are translated at historical rates. The income statements of the consolidated overseas subsidiaries are translated at average rates. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries report foreign currency translation adjustments in net assets.
(e) Revenue recognition
<Sales of products and construction contracts>
The percentage-of-completion method is applied to construction contracts if the outcome of the construction activity is deemed certain during the period of the activity. Otherwise, the completed contract method is applied.
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash on hand, readily available deposits and short-term highly liquid and low risk invest- ments with maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase are considered to be cash and cash equivalents in preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows.
(g) Allowance for doubtful receivables
An allowance for possible losses from notes and accounts receivable, loans and other receivables is provided based on past experience and the Companies’ estimates of losses on collection.
(h) Assets and liabilities arising from derivative transactions
Assets and liabilities arising from derivative transactions are stated at fair value.
(i) Inventories
Inventories are stated mainly at historical cost computed using the specific identification cost method, the moving average cost method or the first-in, first-out method. The ending balance of inventories is measured at the lower of cost or market.
(j) Investment securities
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries classify securities as (a) debt securities intended to be held to maturity (hereafter, “held-to-maturity debt securities”), (b) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies and (c) all other securities (hereaf- ter, “available-for-sale securities”). There were no trading securities at March 31, 2021 or 2020. Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated mainly at amortized cost. Equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method are stated at moving average cost. Available-for-sale securities with available fair market values are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and unrealized losses on these securities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate compo- nent of net assets. Realized gains and losses on the sale of such securities are computed using moving average cost. Other securities with no available market value are stated at moving average cost.

Significant accounting policies
  82 Kawasaki Report 2021
Kawasaki Report 2021 83

If the market value of held-to-maturity debt securities, equity securities issued by non-consolidated subsidiaries or affiliated companies or available-for-sale securities declines significantly, such securities are stated at market value, and the difference between the mar- ket value and the carrying amount is recognized as loss in the period of the decline. If the market value of equity securities issued by a non-consolidated subsidiary or affiliated com- pany not subject to the equity method is not readily available, the securities should be writ- ten down to net asset value with a corresponding charge in the statements of income in the event the net asset value declines significantly. In these cases, the market value or the net asset value will be the carrying amount of the securities at the beginning of the next year.
(k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed mainly by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
(l) Intangible assets
Amortization of intangible assets, including software for the Company’s own use, is comput- ed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.
An equivalent amount of goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over the period the Company benefits from its use. If the amount is not significant, it is expensed when incurred.
(m) Provision for bonuses
Accrued bonuses for employees are provided for based on the estimated amount of payment.
(n) Provision for construction warranties
The provision for construction warranties is based on past experience or provided separately when it can be reasonably estimated.
(o) Provision for loss on construction contracts
A provision for loss on construction contracts at the fiscal year-end is made when substantial loss is anticipated for the next fiscal year and beyond and such loss can be reasonably estimated.
(p) Provision for the in-service issues of commercial aircraft jet engines
Of the costs related to the significant in-service issues of commercial aircraft jet engines that arose in the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine program, in which the Company participates as
a risk and revenue sharing partner, the Company has made a provision for the abnormal costs related to the in-service issues which the Company would cover as a member of this program.
(q) Provision for sales promotion expenses
With regard to dealer inventories at the fiscal year-end, a provision is made for sales rebates etc., expected to be paid in the next fiscal year and beyond based on past experience or on separate estimates when this can be reasonably estimated.
(r) Retirement benefit liability
Employees who terminate their services with the Company or some consolidated domestic subsidiaries are generally entitled to lump-sum payments, the amounts of which are deter- mined by reference to basic rates of pay at the time of termination and length of service.
The liabilities and expenses for retirement and severance benefits are determined based on amounts actuarially calculated using certain assumptions. The Company and its consoli- dated domestic subsidiaries provide the allowance for employees’ retirement and severance benefits based on the estimated amounts of projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, including assets in the retirement benefit trust.
Actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs are charged to income on a straight-line basis primarily over 10 years commencing with the following period and the current period, respectively. With regard to previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and
3.
Significant accounting estimates
unrecognized prior services costs, after adjusting for tax effects, the Company records any accumulated adjustment for retirement benefits as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within net assets.
In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the Company uses a benefit formula basis to attribute expected benefits to periods of service.
Employees of the Company’s overseas consolidated subsidiaries are generally covered by various pension plans accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin- ciples in the respective country of domicile.
(s) Hedge accounting
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries employ deferred hedge accounting. If deriva- tive financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries defer recognition of gain or loss resulting from
a change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument until the related loss or gain on the hedged item is recognized.
(t) Finance leases
Lease assets under finance leases that transfer ownership of the lease assets to the lessee are amortized by the same method as that used for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Lease assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the lease assets to the lessee are amortized by the straight-line-method over the lease term with zero residual value.
(u) Accounting for consumption taxes
National and local consumption taxes are accounted for based on the net amount.
(v) Application of consolidated tax reporting
The Company and its wholly owned consolidated domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return.
(w) Application of tax effect accounting for the transition from the consolidated taxation system to the group tax sharing system
With respect to the transition to the group tax sharing system established under the Act for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 8 of 2020) and the revision of the nonconsolidated taxation system in conjunction with the transition to the group tax sharing system, due to the treatment prescribed in Paragraph 3 of the Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System (PITF No. 39, March 31, 2020), the Company and some of its consolidated subsidiaries have not adopted the provisions of Paragraph 44 of the Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting (ASBJ Guidance No. 28, February 16, 2018), and the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are based on the provisions of pre-amended tax legislation.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
(a) The ending balance of deferred tax assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2021
Deferred tax assets ¥70,452 million ($636,308 thousand)
(b) Information on the content of significant accounting estimates for identified items
(i) Calculation method of estimates
Deferred tax assets are examined for recoverability based on the generation of taxable income and tax planning in certain future periods based on business plans.

Kawasaki Report 2021 85

4.
Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted
(ii) Major assumptions used in calculating estimates
Forecasts of net sales and profits, which are the main elements of the business plan, are based on certain assumptions about future changes in economic conditions and other fac- tors. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread impact on the business plan for year ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the accounting estimates are made on the following assumptions for each business.
• In the Aerospace Systems business, passenger demand has been stagnant globally. Although the demand will gradually recover due to the deregulation of travel regula- tions, it will take a considerable period of time for a full recovery.
• In other businesses, sales of hydraulic equipment for the Chinese construction machin- ery market in the precision machinery and robots business, robots for semiconductors, and motorcycles and engines business in developed countries have already recovered to the level before the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. However while stable demand is expected in the future, it will take time for the recovery in demand of other products.
(iii) Effect on the consolidated financial statements for the following year
Future estimates are affected by future changes in economic conditions, the conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Although the Company reasonably estimates recoverability, changes in the terms of these estimates for the future could have a significant impact on the amount of deferred tax assets in the consolidated finan- cial statements for subsequent fiscal years.
The following guidance was issued but not yet adopted.

Under the Japanese Corporate Law (“the Law”), the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, designate an amount not exceeding one half of the price of the new shares as capital reserve, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Law, if a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of capital reserve and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as capital reserve or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the Law, legal earnings reserve and capital reserve can be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit or capitalized by a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting.
Capital reserve and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Law, all capital reserve and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends.
The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Law.

(c) Reasons for recognition of impairment losses 25.
Due to a deterioration in business profit and loss, the Company reduced the book value of certain assets to the recoverable amount.
(d) Methods used to determine recoverable amounts
The recoverable amounts were determined by the net realizable value or value in use. Net realizable value is mainly based on real estate appraisals, and those that are difficult to sell or convert to other are stated at memorandum values. Value in use is calculated by discount- ing future cash flows at a discount rate of 5.5%
Amounts reclassified to profit (loss) in the current period that were recognized in other com- prehensive income in the current or previous periods and the tax effects for each compo- nent of other comprehensive income were as follows:

($129,787 thousand) (the amount obtained by multiplying the statutory and effective tax rate). The deferred tax assets were primarily recognized as part of tax loss carryforwards of the Company. The tax loss carryforwards that allocated the deferred tax assets were primarily due to the recording of a net loss before income taxes in the year ended March 31, 2021, and by prospecting future taxable income, the Company has determined that it will be recoverable and has not recognized a valuation allowance.

(ii) Management of market risk (related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, etc.)
The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries hedge foreign currency fluctua- tion risk on receivables and payables in foreign currencies using mainly exchange con- tracts, which are categorized by the type of currency and the monthly due date. In principle, the net position of receivables less payables in a foreign currency is hedged mainly with forward exchange contracts. The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries hedge interest rate risk on debt using interest rate swap contracts and currency swap contracts.
With regard to investments in securities, the Company reviews its holding policies through periodic analysis of market prices and the financial condition of the issuers, taking into consideration the relationships with its business partners.
With regard to derivatives, in accordance with rules for the provision of transaction authorization, the Company’s finance functions and those of its consolidated subsidiaries manage transactions in accordance with an established set of fundamental policies, such as those covering limitations on transaction amounts, under the authority of the director in charge of finance. Transactions are reported to the director in charge of finance on
a monthly basis. Consolidated subsidiaries manage derivatives in accordance with the same rules as those of the Company.
(iii) Management of liquidity risk (risk of the Company being unable to meet its payment obli- gations by their due dates)
The Company manages liquidity risk through its finance department, maintaining and updating its finance plans based on reports from each business division. Liquidity risk is managed through the diversification of financing methods, taking into consideration the financing environment and balancing long- and short-term financing requirements, secur- ing commitment lines, etc.
(d) Supplemental information on the fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments includes values based on market price and reasonably estimated values when market price is not available. However, as variables are inherent in these value calculations, the resulting values may differ if different assumptions are used. With regard to the contract amounts, etc., of the derivatives described in Note 30, “Derivative transactions,” these amounts do not represent the market risk associated with the corresponding derivative transactions themselves.
(2) Fair values of financial instruments
The book values, the fair values and the differences between these values as of March 31, 2021 were as follows (Financial instruments for which the fair value was extremely difficult to determine were not included, as described in remark (ii)):
      31.
Financial instruments
Information related to financial instruments as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows.
(1) Matters related to the status of financial instruments
(a) Policies on the use of financial instruments
The Company meets its long-term operating capital and capital expenditure requirements through bank loans and the issuance of bonds and meets its short-term operating capital requirements through bank loans and the issuance of short-term bonds (electronic commer- cial paper). Temporary surplus funds are managed in the form of financial assets that have a high level of safety. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks described below and does not engage in speculative transactions as a matter of policy.
(b) Details of financial instruments and risks associated with those instruments
Notes and accounts receivable – trade are exposed to the credit risk of customers. The Company operates internationally and has significant exposure to the risk of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. However, this risk is hedged using exchange contracts, etc., against the net position of foreign currency exposure. Investments in securities comprise mainly equity securities of companies with which the Company conducts business and are held to maintain relationships with these business partners. With such securities, listed stocks are exposed to market fluctuation risk.
Almost all notes and accounts payable – trade and electronically recorded obligations are due within one year. A portion of accounts payable - trade are denominated in foreign currency—specifically those related to payment for imported materials, etc., and are exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation. However, this risk is mitigated principally by the position of accounts payable - trade denominated in foreign currency being less than the position of receivables in the same currency. Borrowings and bonds payable are used mainly to raise operating capital and carry out capital expenditure and are due in a maximum of twenty years from March 31, 2021 (twenty years in 2020). A portion of these instruments is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuation. However, such risk is hedged using derivatives (interest rate and currency swaps) as necessary.
In sum, derivatives comprise exchange and currency option contracts used to hedge for- eign currency fluctuation risk on receivables and payables in foreign currencies and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate fluctuation risk on debt. With regard to hedge accounting, see Note 2(s), “Hedge accounting.”

Management of credit risk, including customer default risk
The Company’s sales management functions and those of its consolidated subsidiaries regularly evaluate the financial circumstances of customers and monitor the due dates and balances by customer to identify and limit doubtful accounts.
With regard to derivative transactions, the Company enters into contracts with highly rated financial institutions to reduce counterparty risk. The amount presented in the bal- ance sheet is the maximum credit risk at the fiscal year-end of the financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk.

Methods used to calculate the fair value of financial instruments and details of securities and derivative instruments
<Assets>
• Cash and deposits
The book values are used as the fair values since the settlement periods of these items are short and their fair values are substantially the same as their book values.
• Notes and accounts receivable - trade
The fair value of notes and accounts payable – trade is stated at present value comput- ed by applying a discount rate reflecting the settlement period and the credit risk.
• Investment securities
Equity securities are stated at the fair value, and bonds are stated at market price. See Note 2(j), “Investment securities,” for the detailed information by classification.
<Liabilities>
• Notes and accounts payable - trade, electronically recorded obligations - operating, short-term borrowings and current portion of bonds payable
Since the settlement periods of these items are short and their fair values are substan- tially the same as their book values, the relevant book values are used.
• Long-term debt, less current portion
The fair value of bonds payable is stated at the market price. The fair value of long- term borrowings is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total principal and interest. That discount rate is based on the interest rates of similar new loans.

The Company’s operations are divided into internal companies based on product categories. Certain authority is delegated to each of the internal companies, based on which they conduct businesses in Japan and overseas. The Company’s operations are therefore segmented based on each internal company’s product categories. The Company’s seven reportable segments are the Aerospace Systems segment, the Energy System & Plant Engineering segment, the Precision Machinery & Robot segment, the Ship & Offshore Structure segment, the Rolling Stock segment, the Motorcycle & Engine segment, and the Other segment.

<Receipt of customs duty reassessment notification in the Kingdom of Thailand>
KAWASAKI MOTORS ENTERPRISE (THAILAND) CO., LTD. (hereinafter, “KMT”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company in the Kingdom of Thailand, received a reassessment notifica- tion of customs duties for 4,029 million baht (equivalent to approximately ¥14,000 million ($126,445 thousand) when converted at a rate of 0.29 yen to 1 baht) from the Revenue Department of Thailand. KMT had until that time filed its customs duties in accordance with guidance from the Revenue Department. Since the content of the notification of reassess- ment lacked a legitimate basis and was extremely unreasonable, KMT could not accept it and submitted an appeal of the reassessment to the Commission of Appeal, the appeals body for tax assessments received from the Revenue Department of Thailand. Based on the opinion of attorneys consulted regarding this matter, the Company maintains that there is
a strong possibility KMT’s assertion will be upheld.
<Claim for damages in overseas LNG tank construction work>
In connection with a certain liquefied natural gas (LNG) tank construction project carried out by the Company overseas, the Company filed a petition for arbitration with The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) concerning losses sustained by the Company due to the breach of contract by an overseas construction subcontractor. During the arbitration proceedings, the counterparty claimed damages from the Company, but the Company believes that these claims lack legitimate grounds and are thus unjustified. The Company will continue to assert the legitimacy of its claims through the arbitration process.

Kawasaki Report 2021 111
At the Management Committee held on June 15, 2021, it was resolved to issue the following straight bonds (sustainability bonds) as follows:

Independent auditor’s report
To the Board of Directors of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.:
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (“the Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in net assets and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
in Note 26. “Income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements, the amount of gross deferred tax assets before being offset by deferred tax liabilities amounted to ¥85,121 million. Of this amount, the gross deferred tax assets held by the Company that files a consolidated tax return with its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries amounted to ¥67,306 million, representing approximately 3.4% of total assets in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences are expected to reduce future taxable income. When significant tax loss carryforwards exist, a more deliberate consideration is required to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
The future taxable income to be generated by the Company, which was used to determine the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, was primarily estimated based on the business plan prepared by management. This business plan involved uncertainty due to the reasons set forth below, and had a significant effect on the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
・ Forecasts of revenue and profit, which are the key elements of the business plan, may be affected by changes in economic conditions in the future, and other factors.
・ Estimates related to the effect of COVID-19 incorporated into the business plan, including the forecasts of global passenger travel demands, involved significant management judgment.
We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the appropriateness of management’s judgement on the recoverability of deferred tax assets of the Company was one of the most significant matters in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.
(1) Internal control testing
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls relevant to the judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets.
In this assessment, we focused our testing on internal controls over the preparation of the business plan used to estimate the Company’s future taxable income.
(2) Assessment of the reasonableness of the estimated future taxable income
In order to assess the reasonableness of key assumptions adopted in preparing the business plan, that served as the basis for estimating future taxable income, we:
・ evaluated the process of preparing the business plan that served as the basis for estimating future taxable income by inquiring of management and each company president and inspecting the minutes of Management Committee of the Company;
・ assessed the consistency of the estimated future taxable income used to determine the recoverability of deferred tax assets with the business plan approved by Management Committee of the Company;
・ assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions, which formed the basis for the sales forecasts used for the estimates incorporated into the business plan of Aerospace Systems Company, by comparing them with information provided by major customers and the market forecast reports published by the International Air Transport Association; and
evaluated the reasonableness of the scheduling of deductible temporary differences and tax-return adjustments included in the calculation of future taxable income by comparing them with the taxable income calculation for the current fiscal year.
                Appropriateness of management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.
   The key audit matter
In the consolidated balance sheet of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (hereinafter, the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021, deferred tax assets of ¥70,452 million were recognized. As described
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The primary procedures we performed to assess whether management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets of the Company was appropriate included the following:
       112 Kawasaki Report 2021
Kawasaki Report 2021 113

    Management’s assessment of the amount recoverable related to a loss sustained due to a breach of contract by an overseas construction subcontractor that failed to fulfill the contract on a certain overseas LNG tank construction work (Energy System & Plant Engineering Company)
consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.
counsel, and evaluated the consistency of the information with the result of management’s assessment of the overseas construction subcontractor’s ability to make payment.
      The key audit matter
As described in Note 9. “Claim for damages in overseas LNG tank construction work,” Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (hereinafter, the “Company”) sustained a loss of approximately ¥51billion due to a breach of contract by an overseas construction subcontractor that failed to fulfill the contract on a certain overseas LNG tank construction work. In connection with this issue, the Company filed a petition for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”). The Company plans to settle this dispute through the arbitration process, and recognized an asset for the expected amount recoverable as a result of the arbitration within Other under Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
The amount recoverable through the arbitration was assessed considering the progress of the arbitration proceedings at the ICC and the prospect for an award of the arbitral tribunal, as well as the business environment and the financial conditions of the overseas construction subcontractor. These estimates included subjective assumptions requiring significant management judgment, such as an award of the arbitral tribunal related to the subject and amount of damages, the Company alleged, caused by the breach of contract by the overseas construction subcontractor, as well as the ability of the overseas construction subcontractor to make payment for any monetary award to be determined by the arbitral tribunal, which involved uncertainty.
We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the appropriateness of management’s assessment of the amount recoverable related to a loss sustained due to a breach of contract by an overseas construction subcontractor that failed to fulfill the contract on a certain overseas LNG tank construction project was one of the most significant matters in our audit of the
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The primary procedures we performed to assess the reasonableness of management’s assumptions used for assessing the amount recoverable through the arbitration included the following:
(1) Internal control testing
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls relevant to management’s assessment of the amount recoverable through the arbitration. In the assessment, we focused on internal controls in which the personnel responsible for the accounting division assess the estimates of the recoverability of each item of damages alleged, giving consideration to the opinion of the Company’s legal counsel.
(2) Assessment of the reasonableness of the estimated amount recoverable through the arbitration
・ We inspected the minutes of Management Committee of the Company related to the result of management’s assessment of the amount recoverable. In addition, we inquired of several personnel, such as management (including the president of Energy System & Plant Engineering Company) and those responsible for the administration division and the accounting division, and then assessed the reasonableness of their respective responses.
・ We circularized, through a written legal confirmation, directly with the legal counsel engaged by the Company to assess the amount recoverable, and assessed the consistency of the opinion of the legal counsel with the result of management’s assessment of the amount recoverable.
We inspected the annual reports issued by the overseas construction subcontractor and the monthly research reports on the financial conditions, order booking status and other information of the overseas construction subcontractor submitted by the Company’s legal
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
The audit and supervisory committee is responsible for overseeing the directors’ performance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

           114 Kawasaki Report 2021
Kawasaki Report 2021 115

 Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit and supervisory committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit and supervisory committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit and supervisory committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Convenience Translation
The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Interest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan
We do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan.

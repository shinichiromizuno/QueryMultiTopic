Measures against global warming and climate change
(Addressing TCFD recommendations)
Concordia Financial Group believes that addressing global warming and climate change is an important priority and has endorsed the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)* in December 2019. The Group recognizes the importance of disclosing information on climate change and will enhance the disclosure of information on climate change based on the disclosure framework of the TCFD recommendations.
(*) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): A privately-led task force established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in December 2015 to encourage companies to disclose climate-related information.

1. Governance
We have established a Group SDGs Policy. An SDGs Committee chaired by the President holds concentrated responsibility for formulating and managing the progress of policies related to environmental and social initiatives, including climate change.
The SDGs Committee’s deliberations are reported to and discussed by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s climate change initiatives.
2. Strategy
We are working to address global warming and climate change as a priority environmental and social issue from the perspectives of both risk and opportunity.
Risk
(1) Transition risk
Transition risks include the risk of financial deterioration of business partners due to stricter regulations on greenhouse gas emissions or the introduction of a carbon tax, the risk of business partners’ businesses (particularly fossil fuels and electric power) becoming stranded assets due to technological advances associated with the transition to a low-carbon society, and the risk of damage to brand value due to insufficient global warming countermeasures or inability to respond to changes in consumer preferences.
Anticipated main impact on the Group
There is a possibility that credit-related expenses will increase due to deterioration in the financial condition of our business partners, the turning of their businesses into stranded assets, damage to their brand value, and other factors. In addition, our brand value may be damaged due to rumors about our global warming countermeasures and investments in fossil fuel-related industries.
(2) Physical risk
These include acute natural disasters such as flooding, which can be exacerbated by abnormal weather, and the risk of damage to buildings and business interruption due to chronic climate change, such as rainfall and changes in weather patterns.
Anticipated main impact on the Group
The Company’s head office and branches may be damaged by natural disasters, which may result in losses. In addition, credit-related expenses may increase as a result of financial deterioration, such as damage to collateral or a decrease in sales due to damage to customers’ company buildings or factories caused by flooding.
(3) Scenario analysis
With regard to physical risk, we are in the process of establishing a system for estimating the amount of increase in credit-related expenses for business loans and housing loans due to financial deterioration caused by damage to collateral properties or business interruption of customers in the event of
a flood. Specifically, we estimate the cumulative impact until 2050, taking into account the increase in credit-related costs in the event of inundation indicated by the hazard maps, and the probability of such inundation occurring under the IPCC RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios (“RCP2.6“: 2°C scenario, “RCP8.5“: 4°C scenario).
We will study the estimation method for the transition risk after identifying the target industries.
(4) Carbon related assets
The value of carbon-related assets (electricity, energy, etc., but excluding loans for renewable energy, etc.) as a percentage of total loans is limited to 0.6%.
* From this fiscal year, overseas loan assets and contracted unrealized assets are included.

  Opportunities
We have set new long-term KPIs for sustainable finance and green finance. In addition, we launched an investment trust targeting publicly traded companies that focus on SDGs management for corporate and individual customers with high sustainability orientation.
By proactively engaging in dialogue with customers in order to improve their ability to adapt to climate change and transition to a decarbonized society, we will provide green finance for renewable energy projects and solutions to support customers’ transition to a decarbonized society, thereby expanding business opportunities. We will also strengthen our efforts to address the SDGs, including registration and certification systems, in collaboration with local governments.

3. Risk management
With regard to climate change risk (transition risk and physical risk), we first recognize physical risk as the top risk (occurrence of a natural catastrophe), taking into account the degree of impact and probability of occurrence, and are working to build a system for managing it within the framework of comprehensive risk management. (See Page 68.)
We are working to construct a management system for credit risk, risk related to the Group’s tangible fixed assets, operational risk, etc., based on the impact of climate change risks on the Group’s loans.
We have established a policy (sector policy) for investments and loans where the use of funds is likely to have a negative impact on the environment and society, and are working to reduce or avoid environmental and social impacts. Since FY2020 when the sector policy was established, we have not made any new investments or loans that fall under the sector policy.

  1. Coal-fired power generation business
We will not, in principle, engage in new investments or loans for coal-fired power generation projects that are likely to have a negative impact on the environment.
However, when considering exceptional measures, we will carefully consider each project’s background and characteristics, such as power generation efficiency and performance, impact on the environment, and impact on local communities, with reference to international guidelines etc.
  There are no new investments or loans for coal-fired power generation.
The balance of existing investments and loans is scheduled to be reduced to zero in FY2037.
   2. Cluster bomb manufacturing business
  New investments in and loans to companies that manufacture cluster munitions are prohibited, regardless of the use of the funds.
   There are no investments or loans to businesses related to the manufacture of cluster bombs.
   3. Palm oil plantation development business
From the perspectives of conservation of forest resources and biodiversity and protection of human rights, we prohibit new investments and loans for those developments of palm oil plantations that may involve human rights violations such as illegal logging and child labor.
In addition, investments and loans for palm oil plantation development will be made with careful attention to the status of certification by the RSPO(*1), the international certification for sustainable palm oil, as well as consideration for local communities and the environment.
  There are no investments or loans for palm oil plantation development projects.
   4. Forest harvesting projects
  We make new investments and loans for forest harvesting projects with great care, taking into account whether they have received international certifications (FSC (*2), PEFC (*3) etc.) and the consideration given to local communities and the environment.
  There are no investments or loans for large-scale forest harvesting projects.

 4. Indicators and Targets
We have set long-term goals related to global warming and climate change, including sustainable and green finance and CO2 emission reduction targets.
Sustainable Finance and Green Finance
We have set a target of 2 trillion yen in sustainable finance by FY2030, including 1 trillion yen in green finance. The actual results by FY2020 are 1.0 trillion yen in sustainable finance, of which 0.2 trillion yen is green finance.
Conversion of Bank of Yokohama Head Office Building Electricity to Renewable Energy
As a concrete measure to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of renewable energy, in April 2021 we introduced Aqua de Power Kanagawa, which uses renewable energy generated at the Kanagawa Prefectural Hydroelectric Power Plant, and switched to renewable energy for the electricity
used at the Bank of Yokohama Head Office Building. The introduction of this system will reduce annual CO2 emissions by 2,451 tons (equivalent to approximately 170,000 cedar trees).

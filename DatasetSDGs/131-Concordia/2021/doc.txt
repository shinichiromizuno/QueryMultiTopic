 TOP COMMITMENT
Concordia Financial Group Yasuyoshi Oya, President and Representative Director
Accumulating the successful experience
of being of use to customers leads to our employees having a sense of enjoyment and accomplishment in their work, and the sense of contributing to society and the community leads to a sense of fulfillment.
 78
Protecting the regional economy is a top priority.
The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to an unprecedented stoppage of human movement globally. The impact of the crisis on the whole world and on society itself has been far greater than the economic crisis of the Lehman Shock.
The coronavirus pandemic has had an impact on all aspects
of people's daily lives, lifestyles, corporate activities, and
work styles, and has created a situation that has forced
people to reconsider conventional wisdom. The coronavirus pandemic has brought to the fore issues that we had long
been concerned about, and in some areas, this has accelerated the pace of our efforts. We think that due to the pressure of
the pandemic, moves to deal with issues immediately are spreading. Examples are promoting digitization and improving productivity for companies. For small and medium-sized companies, business succession is another example.
It was a year in which we, as a regional financial institution, felt a renewed sense of pride in our ability to play a role in the local economy. When it came to funding support for customers, banks were once said to “take away umbrellas on a rainy day,” but this time, with the support of the government and financial authorities, we were able to work with a sense of speed, placing the highest priority on staying close to customers and protecting their businesses and employment and, by extension, the regional economy.
However, now it is time to think seriously about how we should face our customers. What is the plan for repaying the capital and what can be done to improve the profitability of the core business? It has become even more important to provide consulting and support on the measures are necessary to achieve these goals. At a time when the issues and needs of our customers are rapidly becoming more apparent, we think it is important for us to increase their trust by providing them with necessary solutions, and supporting them while staying close to them. The cumulative effect of these individual sincere efforts will lead to growth opportunities for us.

FY2021 to provide answers regarding legacy transformation
In these projects, we receive a fee for the arrangements we are involved in, and we expect to see growth in our solution fees.
In addition, the fields of wealth management and tax consulting are also growing in the individual sector.
Equity finance may be a theme that is of the most interest to listed companies, but business succession and sponsorship support come up for unlisted small and medium-sized companies too, so I believe that we are making full use of the know-how we have accumulated.
Outstanding balance of sophisticated financing (*)
 There is much legacy in banking. The five main forms of this legacy are branches, human resources, systems, business processes, and sales style. The aim of the current medium- term management plan is to change this. The final year of the program, FY2021, will be a phase in which the five legacies will be properly addressed.
For example, branches. We are improving productivity
by reducing inefficient operations, but we must not inconvenience our customers by doing so. Rather, I believe that only when we can enhance the convenience of transactions through the power of digital technology and create a system that eliminates the need for customers to come all the way to our branches will people understand our decision to revamp some of the functions of our branches.
In the past year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, it has been difficult for customers to visit our branches, so we have been expanding the number of procedures that can be performed through our apps and website, which we call “Bank of Yokohama at Home” and which are open 24 hours a day for customers. We have increased the number of transactions that do not require signature seals or paper documents, and the reform of our branch operations is on track to bring forward the original five-year plan to three years. The convenience for customers has created a cycle of making
effective use of management resources.
For us, Digital Transformation (DX) is not just about systemization, but about changing business processes to increase user convenience. There are hundreds or thousands of patterns to each of the bank's business processes, and greater efficiency is needed for investment too. By laying the foundation for reflecting data through API connections from the preliminary stages of the accounting system, we have been able to process business in similar transactions for both branches and in applications.
For example, currently, when opening a new account at a store, customers enter the necessary information on a tablet. For customers, it is easy and convenient to complete the procedures without having to wait in line at the counter, but ultimately we want to make it possible to do the same thing at home. In addition, many customers have asked us to close their accounts while staying at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the past, this procedure had to be carried out
in a store, but this was changed in 2020 so that it could be handled over the telephone Branches, systems, and business processes are a connected story. With ingenuity and ideas, we should think about how to eliminate the stress of banking transactions on our customers.

 Support for sustainability with potential
  Support that “helps the customer” leads to subsequent business
In terms of providing new solutions, support for sustainability holds potential. For example, the transition to a decarbonized society will be a major theme for corporate customers.
In Kanagawa Prefecture, there are many suppliers to the automotive industry, and it is expected that environmental considerations will be a condition for doing business, even for small and medium-sized companies. The Bank of Yokohama is promoting initiatives such as sustainability linked loans, and the use of hydroelectric power to generate electricity
for its head office building. Consulting to help customers integrate sustainability into their management is one of the solutions that will be needed in the future.
Because we live in an age of 100-year lifespans, individual customers need life-plan consulting throughout their lives.
Until now, we have tended to provide support separately for each life event, such as mortgage guidance, retirement fund management, and inheritance measures, but we would like
to create a system that provides uninterrupted support in line with life plans. This is not limited to simulation and design of
funding. For example, in the case of mortgage loans, we would like to be a point of contact for all aspects of life and living, such as introducing customers to clients who can build the house they want to live in, or introducing schools according to their children's desired career paths. Our goal is to create
a sustainable relationship that links the generations from parents to children and their children.
 Our human resources and sales style are closely linked to the major pillar of our medium-term management plan, which
is to deepen our core businesses. Traditionally, banks have focused on a plain sales style, asking corporate customers
to borrow money. However, this senior loan sector does not lead to differentiation because all banks do this, and lending to companies with good financial standing tends to lead to interest rate competition among multiple banks. In order to be a bank that is useful to our customers, it is essential that we have the ability to make proposals through consulting and have a range of solutions that we can provide.
We are fortunate to have the characteristics of an urban regional bank. The Bank of Yokohama outperforms other banks in the depth of its relationships with small and medium-sized listed companies. The Bank of Yokohama is the core bank for one in four of the 800 or so listed companies with which we do business.
Each listed company faces a number of challenges and concerns. We are often asked how to increase market capitalization, what can be done to improve return on equity (ROE), and how to optimize the shareholder composition. This
is where high-level support is needed, including beneficial business matching, M&A, digitization, and environmental considerations. I believe that by providing solid solutions to these issues, we can earn the trust of our customers, which can lead to new loans for the necessary funds.
Change is already occurring. In the previous fiscal year, the Bank of Yokohama provided MBO financing for two projects. We have received consultations from several companies this year. This used to be something that happened once every three years or so. The process of implementing an MBO requires the ability to arrange capital packages, such as the issuance of preferred stock and subordinated loans. Even
if this does not lead to an MBO, it may develop into creative M&A financing, such as a leveraged buyout (LBO) loan where a fund acquires a company. The outstanding balance of such advanced financing reached approximately 360 billion yen, more than triple the actual balance in FY2018. By shifting assets from senior loans to high value-added loans, we will be able to enhance our relationship with customers and increase the profitability of the bank itself.
Active pursuit of alliances with external parties
 9 10
We will actively pursue alliances with external parties to achieve our long-term goal of becoming a “new financial company that goes beyond the bounds of traditional banks”. In this case also, the objective and focus should be on two things: whether it will help customers, and whether it will improve the functioning of the bank itself.
For example, the “Chiba-Yokohama Partnership” is a business alliance with Chiba Bank. By joining forces, the two banks, which are both urban regional banks but do not compete with each other to any great extent, can combine their respective functions. As a result, we have been able to broaden the scope of our solutions, including joint structuring of investment products, and we have been able to mutually participate
in syndicated loans, which would have been difficult to do by ourselves.
To improve productivity, the Bank of Yokohama led the development of a multi-bank joint use system (MEJAR)
in 2010, which will be developed into the next system to improve operational efficiency. The aim is to improve the convenience of online banking and eliminate business waste, as I mentioned at the beginning of this report.
In order to enhance our solutions, we are expanding our business areas through strategic investments and capital investments in a wide range of fields. In February 2021, we teamed up with IT company Digital Garage Inc. to establish the Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) fund. We expect to invest in about 15 companies, including startups. CVC doesn't just aim for a net investment return. We find value in closely monitoring the trends of the companies we discover and invest in, developing into other businesses such as M&A and matching these companies with existing customers, and helping them solve their problems.

   Promoting transformation into a mindset that relishes challenges
Our customer base is our greatest asset
As a listed company, we must not neglect our efforts for capital to increase profitability in order to continue to grow. There are three key points to consider when thinking about capital policy. The first point is to make a profit. Capital is, so to speak, the accumulation of profits, and profits are what improves the value of our customers, in which we are able to share. The second point is to increase profitability. We will create an efficient management structure with an emphasis on profit per employee. The third point is the use of capital. The idea is to create an asset portfolio in which to invest and with which to provide loans. We will then improve our earning power through effective capital management and contribute to our shareholders and other stakeholders.
The Bank of Yokohama celebrated its 100th anniversary in December 2020. Higashi-Nippon Bank will be celebrating
its 100th anniversary in 2024. We have 5 million individual customers and 250,000 corporate customers, which we have built up over many years of trust. Our customer base is our greatest asset. What we need to do now is to further increase the trust of our customers and expand our customer base. To this end, we will further accelerate and deepen our solutions business, which is useful to our customers, and link it to a new stage of growth.
We hope that you will continue to support us as we take on the challenge of achieving sustainable growth.
Encouraging employees to pursue the careers they want to pursue
One thing to consider in this process is the evaluation system. Traditionally, I think banks have been short-term results-based organizations, and that orientation was highly regarded. That may generate immediate revenue, but it simply cannot provide a sustainable business. Even if you don't see immediate results in terms of revenue, you can motivate your employees by setting a goal that they will give themselves credit for achieving by making customers happy.
Accumulating the successful experience of being useful to customers leads to employees' enjoyment of work and sense of accomplishment. By extension, the feeling of being able to contribute to society and the community is rewarding. If we can instill in our people the understanding that this attitude
adds value to the Concordia Financial Group, we will have the opportunity to create another success story.
As a result of sales process reforms, more and more jobs that once existed are being replaced through digitization, and
an increasing number of job categories are disappearing.
It is very important to create an environment in which the employees who were responsible for the work that is no longer needed can move on to their next career. There is a wide range of work that will be required in the future, such as inheritances, estate administration, IT, and consulting. We encourage all employees to pursue the careers they want to pursue, and the future of our company depends on each individual's ability to improve with goals and fulfillment.

Top Management Commitments
In order to provide a wide range of advanced solutions, it is essential to secure human resources. The Bank of Yokohama introduced the Professional Human Capital System in FY2019, offering compensation equal to the level of department manager or higher for those who excel in their expertise. We are promoting the mid-career hiring of specialist personnel in investment banking, markets, IT, and other divisions from outside the company, and the results are beginning to show.
As we have developed our ability to close complex financing such as MBO financing on our own, we are increasingly being approached by our clients for various other matters. We see this as an opportunity to make proposals in areas where we can contribute to our customers. For example, Kanagawa Prefecture is the logistics hub of the Tokyo metropolitan area, and there are many next-generation warehouses belonging
to players including both Japanese and foreign companies, and this is expected to increase in the future. Logistics-related financing is a growing area of focus for us.
The IT department is stepping up its game on cybersecurity. Here, too, we have hired outside personnel to enhance our internal knowledge and strengthen our functions.
The Bank of Yokohama has always been active in mid-career hiring, with about 10% of its total workforce being mid-career hires. However, this does not mean that employees who
have come up within the company do not have a sense of resistance to the appointment of specialist personnel from outside the bank. I would like to see our employees that have been with us from the start of their career improve their skills and play an increasingly active role as specialists, but the key to this is how they are rated by our customers. As the number of customers who are delighted with our new solutions increases, the motivation to have such a challenge-oriented mindset should emerge. We will promote such awareness transformation throughout the company.

  from FY2019 to FY2021) based on three basic policies: deepening our core businesses, improving profitability through structural reforms, and strengthening our management base.
In the two years FY2019 and FY2020, we made solid progress in raising the top line, reducing costs, and strengthening human resources through measures based on our basic policies.
For the first basic policy item, “Deepening Core Businesses,” we strengthened our solution provision structure through such steps as establishing an investment banking team and opening a branch
¥22.3 billion.
In the second area of the basic policy, improving productivity through structural reforms, we implemented measures to improve both customer convenience and operational efficiency, including the introduction of RPA and the expansion of non-face- to-face transactions. In addition, we promoted the lightening
and consolidation of branches in order to build a store network optimized for meeting changing social conditions, such as declining population and the advance of digitization, while maintaining customer convenience. As a result, we have reduced
in Singapore, and we also expanded our solution provision menu by enhancing our capital loan products and entering the trust business. As a result, the Bank of Yokohama raised its top-line
 FY2020 Results
The spread of the novel coronavirus has changed the economic climate in Japan and had a major impact on the business environment of the Group.
On the financial front, the Bank of Japan continued its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing with long and short-term interest rate operations and further strengthened its monetary easing policy, resulting in a continued low interest rate environment.
In this environment, net income attributable to shareholders of the parent company for FY2020 was ¥25.3 billion, a decrease of ¥21.2 billion from the previous fiscal year. There were two main reasons for the decrease in profits.
The first was the improvement in the soundness of the securities portfolio at the Bank of Yokohama through the disposal of unrealized losses on investment trusts (bear funds). The Bank of Yokohama had been holding bear funds to avoid the risk of falling stock prices, but unrealized losses expanded as stock prices
rose. By wiping out this unrealized loss, we recorded a loss on the cancellation of investment trusts, while significantly improving our net unrealized gains on securities.
The second was the improvement of the soundness of loan assets
Business Forecast for FY2021
In FY2021, we plan to significantly improve net income by 19.6 billion yen year-over-year to 45.0 billion yen by recovering market- related gains and losses at the Bank of Yokohama, accelerating efforts to improve productivity through greater sophistication of
at the Higashi-Nippon Bank by implementing preventive provisions. The impact of the spread of the new coronavirus infection on
credit costs was in line with the plan, and no major bankruptcies occurred. However, the Higashi-Nippon Bank determined that it was necessary to make additional precautionary provisions for certain large loans and recorded additional credit costs.
On the other hand, a positive aspect of the financial results
for FY2020 is that both interest income on loans and service transactions in the domestic business sector increased from
the previous fiscal year. We were able to finally halt the decline
in profitability, which had been continuing for some time, by increasing the number of financing transactions with high margins and by growing service revenues such as for loan arrangements and connecting with the performance of our efforts to raise the level of our solutions business.
With regard to capital, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.40%, and the total capital ratio was 13.66%. Through the use of a risk appetite framework, we have secured a high quality and sufficient level of capital to prepare for future risks.

branch expenses by more than 1 billion yen per year and eliminated the workload of a cumulative total of 615 employees.
In the third area of our basic policy, strengthening our management base, we are working to take on the challenge of new business areas through strategic investment and capital participation, and we are also working to strengthen human resource development
to support sustainable growth. Taking on the challenge of new business areas, we implemented a total of 11 projects over
<Initiatives for FY2021>
FY2021, the final year of the medium-term management plan, is positioned as a year to finish our overall structural reforms. We will accelerate and deepen the implementation of priority measures based on the three basic policies set forth in the medium-term management plan, and we will build a management base that is resilient and capable of generating sustainable earnings, thereby leading into a new growth stage.
In this way, we expect to achieve the target indicators set out
in the medium-term management plan, with a gross operating income RORA of 2.3% and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.63%
the two years, including the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership, a business alliance between the Bank of Yokohama and Chiba Bank, and strategic investments in Bank Resona Perdania and others. To strengthen our human resource development, we are actively recruiting specialist mid-career personnel and actively promoting staff changing careers from clerical work to sales with the aim of upgrading our solution sales. We have completed this with a total of 107 employees.
in FY2021, which is the long-term goal. Our OHR is expected
to be 61.5% in FY2021, but by implementing structural reform initiatives ahead of schedule and realizing the benefits of those initiatives, the target is to achieve a level of 58.8% in FY2022, which will be one year behind the target of the current medium-term management plan. In addition, ROE has remained at a low level, which we recognize as our most important issue. We will increase our earning power mainly at the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi- Nippon Bank, and we will steadily increase ROE by managing capital to maintain a proper capital adequacy ratio through appropriate risk control.

 Capital Policy and Shareholder Returns
We use our risk appetite framework to manage capital in a way that maintains soundness and improves capital efficiency.
The common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio) was 12.40% as of March 2021, remaining at a level sufficient to withstand a crisis on the level of the Lehman Shock. In addition, from the perspective
of improving capital efficiency, we systematically procure subordinated debt, thereby procuring regulatory capital stably and at low cost without relying on the accumulation of common equity and other Tier 1 assets (CET1 ratio).
In FY2021, we will continue to actively allocate capital to strategic investments to increase risk-weighted assets for future growth and for taking on the challenge of new business areas, while at
the same time managing capital to provide flexible returns to shareholders in order to increase capital efficiency, based on an assessment of the state of improvement in business performance.
Strategic Shareholdings Policy
The Group has established a “Policy on Cross-Shareholdings” and continues to reduce its cross-shareholdings, being aware of the impact of stock price fluctuation risk on equity capital and the cost of capital.
The Board of Directors periodically verifies the shares that continue to be cross-held, from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. On the qualitative side, we verify that such cross-held shares contribute to the revitalization of the regional economy and strengthening of long-term and stable business relationships. On the quantitative side, we use RORA and return on capital employed to verify that the return is commensurate with the cost of capital.

 Symposium
We will engage in discussions to grow with the development of the community, and to aim for sustainable growth through coexistence and co-prosperity with all stakeholders.
Outside Directors Roundtable Discussion
Management Letter
    Changes in the environment require quick management decisions.
As an outside director, what is your assessment of the Company's Board of Directors, and what is your opinion of its governance structure?
Akiyoshi - Speaking from my experience of participation in the boards of directors of trading companies and other retail and energy-related companies, I believe that the Group's board of directors has an openness and respect for the opinions of outside directors that is second to none. In particular, President Ohya
is enthusiastic about actively incorporating the opinions of our outside directors, and our Board of Directors meetings have become forums for active discussion and exchange of opinions.
Yamada - I come from a background in financial analysis, and the number of directors involved is very important when comparing and evaluating boards. In that sense, I think seven people in our group is a very comfortable number. We also have a very good balance in that, of the seven directors, three are outside directors. We are able to discuss and exchange opinions frankly, and some of our recommendations are reflected in actual policy.
Yoda - Yes, I agree with you both. Furthermore, the pre-meeting briefings of the Board of Directors are another point for evaluation. Opportunities are provided for the Board of Directors to explain the agenda prior to the meeting. If we have any questions or concerns on this point, they will be investigated and answered by the Board of Directors. Although there are many agenda items to be considered at board of director meetings, the board of directors makes every effort to discuss them as efficiently as possible through careful preparations such as advance briefings.
On the other hand, I also feel that there are challenges. Over the past year, I think there have been a number of agenda items that should have been discussed by management regarding the immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future,
I would like to have more discussion of medium- and long-term management strategies. Discussion on the next medium-term management plan may well be a turning point.
Yamada - Due to their position, internal directors tend to focus
their discussions on reporting on, and responding to, day-to-
day business operations. It is therefore very important to have discussions from a broad perspective at board meetings with outside directors. When we look at the banking sector as a whole, different banks have different strategies, but the first thing we need to consider is what is most important for our local customers and shareholders. The timing is right for these discussions, and the next medium-term management plan will be positioned as the axis of these discussions.
In addition, the world is moving very quickly, and we are at a time when we need to discuss how to proceed with digitization. There are many examples of digitization to learn from, both within Japan and overseas. I would like to include such matters and proceed with discussions from a broad perspective.
What kind of advice can you provide in terms of the pace of management and strengthening of governance?
Akiyoshi - In the past, banks may not have paid so much attention to transforming themselves because of the regulatory environment. However, as the business environment becomes even more difficult, financial institutions are expected to become the driving force for revitalization and creation of local communities at the same time that deregulation is progressing by means of measures such as amendments to the Banking Act. The Group recognizes the importance of contributing to the revitalization of local economies by differentiating itself from other banks and demonstrating originality. We believe it is important for us to manage our business so that we can quickly become a financial group able to provide new financial services needed in the region, services that go beyond traditional banking services. Accordingly, the Board of Directors also emphasizes the pace of management.

Special

Outside Directors Roundtable Discussion
Management Letter
Yoda - Local businesses have very high expectations of local financial institutions. We believe that a financial institution should be like a fount of wisdom available to corporate customers to continue or further develop their business. To achieve this, the Group needs to have the knowledge to discern and advise on
the direction in which the world and society are moving, from both broad and long-term perspectives. We should be the kind
of financial institution that can lead the region in terms of both digitization and financial technology.
Yamada - Currently, the watchword for financial institutions around the world is 'agile', in other words, making decisions quickly. Without this approach, it is not possible to cope with
the speed of change. The reason for the need for agility can be seen in the changing demographics. As millennials become an increasing proportion of the world's population, their ideas are driving the world, and their values are oriented toward social and environmental responsibility. In the US, companies are striving to harmonize their operations with their employees and local communities, as symbolized by the shift from a shareholder-first approach to a stakeholder-oriented approach.
Although it is difficult for the Group to change its mindset immediately, it is essential that the Board of Directors itself change its way of thinking so that it can respond to the new era.
Please tell us about the issues discussed by the Board of Directors and the challenges ahead for the Group as it seeks to enhance its ability to provide solutions and contribute to sustainability.
Yamada - Recruitment and training of professional talent within the company These require us to devise working hours that provide work-life balance and contribute to society. We should rethink the way we do business and promote digitization to create new time. Recruiting talent is important not only in consulting but also in the IT sector. We need more discussion about how to chart a career path and how to transition a career after hiring.
With SDGs, it is important to think of ways to balance the concerns of the community with the efforts of the bank itself. Furthermore, as all banks are promoting SDGs, I believe there will be more opportunities in the future to discuss concrete measures, and the digitization that supports them in a comprehensive manner.
Akiyoshi - As a financial institution with deep roots in the local community, the Group is very involved with local companies and people, and I believe that our sales branches are already aware of customers' concerns and requests regarding sustainability. I would like to have these customer opinions fed back to the Board of Directors to deepen specific discussions.
As a member of the Board of Directors, it is always my view that Concordia Financial Group is a publicly traded company. I believe that only by growing and expanding as a listed company can we demonstrate our value as a reliable financial institution in the community. In order to do so, we should be more aware of our increased value as a company and of our stock price. We will never be more satisfied than when the growth scenario we are trying
to achieve matches the market's assessment. We will discuss how we can achieve this and put it into action at the Board of Directors meeting.
Yamada - I'd also like to discuss measures that maximize shareholder value over the long term. If there is one thing that should be added about our contribution to stakeholders, it is employee engagement. The sense of pride in working for the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank is transmitted not only to but also to the employees who work there but also to our customers. That is why creating an organization that can nurture such feelings is also a topic.
  Boldly Envisioning the Future Through Diverse Voices
What are your views on the ideal image and vision for a “new financial company that goes beyond the bounds of traditional banks”?
Akiyoshi - Both the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank have a history of almost 100 years and are certainly financial institutions with deep roots in the community. Precisely because we are an indispensable part of the local community, it is desirable for us to grow and expand along with the vitality and development of the community. Amid calls for the realization of a sustainable
society, there are high expectations on the Group to provide the necessary financial services to the people and companies who live there. Without a long-term vision for the next 10 to 20 years, there is no point in discussing the next 3 to 5 years. How do you see financial institutions changing in the future? We recognize that it is important for us to fully discuss and share among ourselves the direction we are taking as the Concordia Financial Group.
Yamada - There is a strong need for a consulting function to find solutions while worrying together with customers. The millennial generation that I mentioned earlier has a strong focus on SDGs and ESG. Finding answers by staying close to such customers will lead to coexistence and co-prosperity and to the raison d'être of the Concordia Financial Group in the community.
Yoda - I think it would be great if we could play the role of an accelerator to encourage and accelerate change in the community or of an agent of change. To do this, we need expertise from outside of our traditional financial operations. When it comes to sustainability, we are able to provide comprehensive solutions such as advice plus financial product proposals.
With the coming of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kanagawa Prefecture is changing from being a bedroom community from which people commute to the city center into being a place where people live and work. As a result, business opportunities are expanding, and the need for business transformation and entrepreneurship is increasing. It is important that we become an organization that can support new ways of existing in the community.
Yoda - Our Group has a very good operating base and excellent employees among regional financial institutions in Japan. In this era of rapid change, it is desirable to have the ability to boldly envision the future while assessing both risks and opportunities.
We have an opportunity to discuss medium and long-term management strategies for the next medium-term management plan. As with our outside directors, I would like to see opportunities created for as many employees as possible to participate in
these discussions.
Akiyoshi - In the end, the financial services industry is only as good as its people. As the pace of change in the world's environment continues to intensify, organizations must seek diversity to incorporate the opinions and ideas of many different people in order to achieve transformation. We, the outside directors, will also participate in these discussions with the aims of training highly specialized and competitive personnel the equal of our competitors, and of creating a financial group that is unique and diverse.

Group SDG Policy
Based on our management philosophy, we at the Concordia Financial Group will achieve sustainable improvement in corporate value and solve social issues through our core business and will contribute to the sustainable development of society by engaging in activities that contribute to the community as a member of the community.
Under this policy, the Group will confer with stakeholders on its initiatives and actively disclose information.
Long-term sustainability KPIs
As an action plan based on its SDGs policy, in November 2020 the Group formulated its Sustainability Long-Term KPIs for the period up to FY2030. Furthermore, the renewable energy system introduced at the Bank of Yokohama head office building in April 2021 is expected to achieve the targeted reduction in CO2 emissions by May 2021, and the target for reduction in CO2 emissions has therefore been revised upward, and a carbon neutral target and a renewable energy ratio target for 2050 have been newly established.
Materialities
We examine and discuss the priority level of issues to address from the perspective of the degree of impact on stakeholders and our social presence as a regional financial institution, and finally set the “Six Materialities” via the Board of Directors. Based on these materialities, the business units work together to promote business strategies.

Although the external environment has changed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the essential management issues that we need to resolve have not changed.
To this end, we will respond to changes in the current environment and build a strong management foundation by digging deep into each measure and accelerating it under the three basic policies of deepening our core businesses, improving productivity through structural reforms, and strengthening our management base.
We will then move to a new stage of growth in the next medium-term management plan and strive to realize our long-term vision.

Strengthening Initiatives to Improve Corporate Value of Higashi-Nippon Bank - Aiming to be a 'Total Partner for Small and Medium Enterprises' -
After completing our response to the Business Improvement Order, in November 2020, Higashi-Nihon Bank formulated the 'Higashi-Nihon Bank Sunrise Plan - Next 100 -', which includes measures to improve the top line and reorganize branches, in order to ensure sustainable profitability and future well-being, even in the face of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the corporate philosophy of Higashi-Nippon Bank, we will cherish our relationships with our customers by providing earnest face-to-face support. By implementing the following measures, we will rebuild our business model to lead beyond the 100th anniversary of our founding in April 2024 and into the next 100 years, and achieve our transformation into a “total partner for small and medium-sized enterprises” to provide comprehensive support in solving the various management issues of our customers, who are primarily small and medium-sized enterprises.

 Report Interbank cooperation MEJAR Joint Use System
MEJAR is a joint-use system that began operating in 2010 with the aim of reducing IT costs. As of July 2021, five banks are jointly using the core system, which handles business processing functions such as deposits, foreign exchange, and loans, as well as systems for data utilization, ATMs, and Internet banking.
Business Strategy for Value Creation
MEJAR
       First in Banking - Agreement to Use Open Platform for Core System
(Together with the online data collaboration platform, the project was selected to support the Financial Services Agency's Core Systems Front-Runner Support Hub.)
In order to meet the diversifying needs of their customers and the progress of digitization, in April 2021, the five banks using MEJAR agreed to adopt an open platform that allows flexible selection of various hardware and software according to changes in the environment. This is the first initiative in the banking industry to open up a core system for joint use.
This will allow for future scalability of functionality and use of the latest technology, while significantly reducing operating costs. In addition, the introduction of environmentally friendly Green IT will reduce power consumption by 20% compared to current levels and contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the Bank of Yokohama will build an online data linkage platform as the foundation for linking non- face-to-face channels and the bank's internal sales-related systems with the core banking system (i.e. the accounting system) in order to make it possible to add functions flexibly and at low-cost.
These initiatives were selected as a project to support the Financial Services Agency's Core System Front-Runner Support Hub in May 2021.
 Adopt “Open Platform*”
* Scheduled for 2024
The joint-use core system is
the first in the banking industry.
Development Launched for a Next-Generation SFA/CRM/Loan Screening System to Reform Liaison Operations
In May 2021, the five banks using MEJAR began development of a next-generation SFA/CRM(*)/loan screening system to reform their liaison operations with the aims of improving their ability to present proposals and raising the level of their sales forces, as well as streamlining and increasing efficiency. This system will be developed with the aim of becoming operational in 2024. The operation of this system is expected to reduce liaison work by approximately 350,000 hours per year (the equivalent of almost 200 employees). In addition, by allocating the time saved to liaison activities, we can expect to improve profitability.

   Challenging New Business Areas through Strategic Investments and Financing
In order to take on the challenge of new business areas that go beyond existing business models, the current medium-term management plan calls for investment of 50 billion yen over three years.

Business Strategy for Value Creation
 Initiatives for Value Creation
In addition to supporting the SDGs management of local companies, we are working to support the enhancement of corporate value through the resolution of customer issues, including support for digitization and equity financing, with an eye towards the post-pandemic situation.
Support for SDGs management in local companies
Launched SDGs sustainability linked loans and other products
As a long-term KPI for sustainability, the Group has set a target of executing a cumulative ¥2 trillion in sustainable finance from FY2019 to FY2030.
In April 2021, the Bank of Yokohama launched the “SDGs Sustainability Linked Loan”, which offers interest rate reductions and other incentives based on the degree of achievement of ESG targets, and the “SDGs Green Loan/Social Loan”, which limits the use of funds to eligible projects based on various principles for environmental improvement (green) and social problem solving (social), in order to support the SDGs management of local companies. Both products will be evaluated by an external organization (third-party evaluation) to ensure that the loans comply with the various standards published by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and other organizations, allowing companies to appeal to investors and other parties regarding their commitment to the SDGs through financing with this product.
Collaboration with local governments
The Bank of Yokohama promotes SDGs in the region in cooperation with local governments in Kanagawa Prefecture and Yokohama City, which have been selected as SDGs future cities. In December 2018, we signed a partnership agreement with Kanagawa Prefecture to promote the SDGs, and we are implementing a variety of joint measures, including holding SDGs seminars for small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, we dispatched a bank employee to the expert committee for the “Y-SDGs” certification system of the City of Yokohama to participate in discussions on the operation of the system.
Hamagin Research Institute, a Group company, regularly provides information on the SDGs to its member companies, and has been entrusted with the “SME Support Services” launched by Kanagawa Prefecture to support the SDGs initiatives of SMEs. They are working to promote SDGs management among local companies by supporting the formulation of business plans that incorporate the SDGs, including SDGs for SMEs.
Support for post-pandemic initiatives
Online consultation and digitization support
The Bank of Yokohama has held online consultation meetings to match customers who have business issues that have become apparent as a result of the pandemic to businesses that can provide solutions.
In addition, we have appointed “Digital Advisors” within the Digital Strategy Department to support the digitization of companies, in collaboration with the Bank of Yokohama Group’s Hamagin Research Institute and external specialist companies.
Expansion of non-face-to-face services
The Bank of Yokohama is expanding its non-face-to-face services through “Hamagin Business Connect”, a portal site for corporate members. This service allows the details of deposits and other transactions to be checked, including those with other banks, and to complete a variety of transactions on the Internet, such as loans within the limit of an overdraft facility, recommendation-based loans, and business matching.
Support through equity finance
The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank provide capital loans, in which borrowings can be regarded as equity for the purpose of credit screening, as a means of providing relief from damage to equity capital caused by temporary losses due to the effects of the novel coronavirus.
The Bank of Yokohama provides a syndicated loan scheme using the “New Coronavirus Measures Capital Subordinated Loan” of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC). In addition to supporting the formulation of management and financing plans for businesses, JFC provides capital funds to turn around deteriorating financial conditions, and the Bank of Yokohama provides senior loans in a coordinated manner.
Supporting Customers’ Overseas Business
Concordia Financial Group supports the diversified overseas businesses of its customers, including overseas expansion, overseas sales channel expansion, and business acquisitions, by leveraging the overseas offices of the Bank of Yokohama and the overseas bank networks affiliated with the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank.
In Southeast Asia, we are expanding our client support network by opening a branch in Singapore and investing in Bank Resona Purdania in Indonesia. We are also working with Chiba Bank, with which we have a business alliance, to provide financial cooperation through their overseas offices.
We aim to grow overseas business income by accumulating overseas assets through support for corporate business growth and increased investment capabilities. We plan to expand our overseas assets to over 400 billion yen by FY2021 by extending cross-border loans from Japan (*), expanding our overseas network to facilitate lending to customers’ local entities, and collaborating with other regional financial institutions.
(*) This is a method of direct financing from Japan to a customer’s local entity overseas.

Business Strategy for Value Creation
   Initiatives for Value Creation
We contribute to our customers attaining rich lives by providing financial products and services tailored to their life plans, including support for the growth of children, who will bear the future, support for asset building in accordance with their life plans, and support for the lives of senior citizens.
Supporting greater financial literacy and children’s growth
In order to meet the needs of non-face-to-face and non-contact customers during the pandemic, we have expanded procedures on our smartphone app and website, and conducted webinars on a variety of topics, including asset management and inheritance. At the Bank of Yokohama, you can apply to open an “Investment Trust Specific Account” or a “NISA Account”, and purchase “Tsumitate NISA” at the same time using just your smartphone.
Initiatives for Financial Education
As a long-term KPI for sustainability, the Group has set a target of 100,000 participants in financial education between FY2019 and FY2030.
The Bank of Yokohama is working to promote and improve financial literacy through its financial education program, “Hamagin Okane no Kyoshitsu” (Hamagin’s Money Classroom), by holding school visits and work experience programs, and providing content on its website. The Bank also provides children with opportunities to think about their future by planning and sponsoring “Kanagawa EduTown Ashitane” (Kanagawa Education Town Tomorrow), a career education and job research website for elementary, junior high, and high school students.
In addition to holding school visits and work experience programs, Higashi-Nippon Bank also cooperates with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s Entrepreneurship Education Program for elementary and junior high school students, and supports the development of entrepreneurial spirit and entrepreneurial qualities and abilities among a wide range of people, including children.
Publication of “SDGs for Beginners”
As part of our initiatives concerning the SDGs, we publish a booklet entitled “SDGs for Beginners” to help local children learn the basics of the SDGs. In addition to promoting the use of this system for on-site classes and work experience, it can also be downloaded from our website. We support children, who will be the leaders of the future, to learn in a wide range of fields, not only in finance.
TOPIC Launch of the “Hamagin Money Class” website
The Bank of Yokohama launched the “Hamagin Okane no Kyoshitsu” (Hamagin Money Class) website for the financial education program in December 2020 to ensure online educational opportunities in light of the social situation of the coronavirus pandemic.
The bank’s mascot character “Hamapen” appears on the site, and provides easy-to- understand videos such as “How to use your allowance” and “How to think about money”, as well as financial quizzes, calculation simulations, and other fun learning content for both children and adults. Various content, such as teaching plans and worksheets, can be downloaded easily, so they can be used in schools and local communities.
Bank of Yokohama Website https://www.boy.co.jp/boy/brand/okane/
Provision of financial products and services that meet life plan needs
Long-term asset building support
In order to support asset building through long-term accumulation, we provide information on “iDeCo” and “Tsumitate NISA”, a tax exemption system for small investment amounts, through seminars at workplaces and webinars. We also offer a Junior NISA, a children’s version that allows legal representatives (e.g. persons with parental authority) to manage assets on behalf of their children or grandchildren until they reach the age of 20.
Start of Bank of Yokohama fund wrapper service
In April 2021, the Bank of Yokohama began offering the Bank of Yokohama Fund Wrapper, a discretionary investment service that designs an optimal plan for each customer and manages the funds in accordance with that plan on behalf of the customer. The product is designed to provide customers with moderate asset growth in line with economic growth and preparation for future life events. By regularly confirming customers’ intentions and reflecting them in investment proposals, we achieve asset management that meets the needs of each customer.
We are also working to enhance the sophistication of the solutions we offer by strengthening our “goal-based approach”, which proposes asset management methods tailored to customers’ life goals, and our “portfolio proposals”, which propose optimal financial asset allocations based on investment objectives, risk tolerance, and other factors, in order to respond in detail to the needs of each customer.
The opening of the second Hamagin Insurance Parlor
The Bank of Yokohama provides customers with attentive consultation on insurance matters at the “Hamagin Insurance Parlor”, a dedicated insurance consultation window, and proposes tailor-made insurance plans to meet their needs. Our specialist staff, who are “insurance professionals” with a thorough understanding of
the characteristics of each insurance product, will propose the most suitable insurance plan from a variety
of products, including protection and savings, after thoroughly reviewing the customer’s life plan and needs, including a review of insurance and the contents of the insurance currently in force. In June 2020, we opened a second branch at the west exit of Yokohama Station to meet growing insurance needs.
Support for life during the senior years
Dealing with Dementia Issues
At the Bank of Yokohama, we introduce customers to trust companies that we have partnered with if
they wish to use the “Adult Guardianship System” to manage their assets and support their life, as well as guardianship system support deposits to protect the assets of customers who are already within the system (wards), and dementia insurance to pay for dementia treatment.
In addition, approximately 2,400 employees of the Bank have taken courses on the symptoms of dementia, how to support dementia and how to be prepared for dementia, taught by staff of the Regional Comprehensive Support Center, and these 2,400 have been assigned as “dementia supporters” at all domestic branches.
Conducting a demonstration experiment of a communication tablet for
seniors
The Bank of Yokohama, together with the Chiba Bank, Ltd., and NEC Corporation, has conducted a demonstration test of the “Tablet PaPeRo”, a communication tablet for seniors, in order to study new services for seniors that utilize digital technology. The Bank lent tablets to senior customers and provided them with
a virtual assistant, PaPeRo, and the Bank’s mascot character, Hamapen, to help them with their daily life problems, as well as various health-related functions such as cognitive function tests.

Revitalizing the local economy
By proactively working to resolve regional issues and contributing to the revitalization and sustainable development of regional economies, we will continue to grow as a company with a regional operating base.
Business Strategy for Value Creation
In order to systematically promote regional development, we have established promotion policies and medium- to long-term measures in each field of “Community, People, and Work”, and formulated “Action Plans for Regional Strategy Promotion” for activities to meet the diversified and individualized challenges and needs of each region.
In the “Hamagin 10 Years Ahead Project”, in order to develop rich and sustainable local communities, the Bank of Yokohama goes beyond simply supporting the implementation of measures laid out by the government and independently identifies problems that the region could face ten years from now, proactively moving to propose and implement measures that will enable us to achieve our vision of the bank of 10 years in the future.
Regional Strategy Promotion System
In order to strengthen its community-based initiatives, the Bank of Yokohama has established a regional head office system, which divides its business area into two districts (Head Office, Tokyo and outside the prefecture) and five regions (Eastern, Central, Western, Southern, and Kawasaki). Under
the regional headquarters system, the general managers assigned to each district and region play the role of “regional managers” and, based on the Action Plan for the Promotion of Regional Strategies, work to resolve regional issues while leveraging the bank’s strengths in its customer base and its networks with local governments, local universities, and other financial institutions.
Higashi-Nippon Bank has a “block sales division system” that organizes its business areas into 10 blocks, and promotes strategies tailored to the characteristics of each block.
Business Strategy for Value Creation
Major Collaborations with Local Governments (since FY 2016)
Initiatives to create sustainable cities
Participation in Yokohama City’s “Social Impact Bond” model project
In August 2020, the Bank of Yokohama participated in the City of Yokohama’s Social Impact Bond* model project and supported an online consultation service to ease the anxiety of mothers during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
This model project by the City of Yokohama provided a service that allows mothers to easily consult a specialist doctor online from the time of pregnancy until four months after childbirth, when anxiety is particularly likely to be high, and verified the effect in reducing the risk of postpartum depression in mothers. The Bank of Yokohama provided the necessary funds to the online service provider and also monitored the business.
(*) A system of public-private partnership in which the private sector’s funds and know-how are used to implement projects (services) that require solutions to social issues, and the government pays project costs and compensation when results are achieved.
Participation in PFI Projects
Cooperation with the “Fujisawa City Fujigaoka 2-Chome Area Redevelopment
Project”
The Bank of Yokohama participated in Fujisawa City’s PFI (*) project, the Fujisawa City Fujigaoka 2-Chome Area Redevelopment Project, and supported the project to rebuild Fujigaoka Nursery School and to consolidate public facilities around the nursery school to create a mixed-use facility by providing project funds as a regional financial institution. This project promotes the three themes of “child rearing support”, “health maintenance and preventive nursing care”, and “multi-generational exchange” with the aim of realizing a smart wellness town based on the Fujisawa Vision for Community, People, and Work. It undertakes events for the community, as well as operating private sector facilities such as clinics, pharmacies, and residential care facilities.
(*) This method of public works utilizes private sector funds, management capabilities, and technical know-how to design, operate, renovate, and renew public facilities, as well as to maintain, manage, and operate them.
Cooperation with the “Yokohama City Kamigo Mori no Ie (Kamigo Forest House) Renovation and
Management Project”
The Bank of Yokohama participated in the PFI project for the redevelopment of the Kamigo-Mori No Ie (Kamigo Forest House) training and accommodation facility in Yokohama. The City of Yokohama will retain ownership of the facility and a private sector operator will raise funds to renovate and repair the facility, and then maintain and manage the facility under the PFI scheme. The Bank of Yokohama will help fund not only the renovation and maintenance costs of the facility, but also the management and operational costs of the project in the future.
Support for the Rehabilitation of Large Housing Complexes
The Bank of Yokohama is working with local governments to support the revitalization of large-scale housing complexes in order to help build communities where multiple generations can live safely and securely.
Sakuradai Danchi, a large-scale housing complex located in Aoba Ward, Yokohama City, decided to reconstruct the entire complex into a new 820-unit housing complex in response to the deterioration of the buildings, the need to make the complex barrier-free, and the aging of the residents, so in August 2020 the “Sakuradai Mansions Renovation Association” was formed. The Bank of Yokohama, as arranger, arranged a syndicated loan to provide reconstruction funds to the reconstruction association, and is also providing reverse mortgage loans and other support to elderly residents who wish to move back into the building.
Cashless Transactions Taking Root in the Community
“HamaPay” smartphone payment service
The Bank of Yokohama was one of the first in the financial industry to provide a smartphone-based payment service (HamaPay), with a focus on revolutionizing distribution and commercial transactions through cashless payment and on creating sustainable communities where people can live with peace of mind. In collaboration with local governments, universities, shopping malls and commercial facilities, we aim to realize a safe and secure cashless society rooted in the community.
Participation in Kanagawa Prefecture’s “Cashless Consumption Stimulation Project”
The Bank of Yokohama was commissioned by Kanagawa Prefecture to manage its “Cashless Consumption Stimulation Project” as the representative organization of the joint venture. In addition to supporting businesses in the prefecture that have experienced a decline in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, as a settlement provider we are promoting cashless settlements that are in line with new lifestyles.

 Revitalizing the local economy
Business Strategy for Value Creation
  Initiatives to create a flow of people into regions
Revitalization of tourism by utilizing historical resources in Odawara
The Bank of Yokohama has invested in the Houtoku Shiho Corporation (named after a 19th century Japanese economic recovery policy) through the Tourism Heritage Industrialization Investment Limited Partnership (Tourism Heritage Industrialization Fund), a joint venture with the Regional Economy Vitalization Corporation of Japan (REVIC). In addition we have provided the company with advice on business operations and cooperation in real estate renovation funds to revitalize tourism using Odawara City’s historical resources.
The company renovated its real estate holdings with investment from the fund and opened Hakone-Guchi Garage (Houtoku Plaza), which promotes tourism and local community projects. Hakone-Guchi Garage is located near Odawara Castle and other historical buildings, and operates a restaurant, café, and flower shop to promote tourism in the area. The proceeds are used to operate a local community where three generations can gather and provide a variety of lifestyle services to local residents, centered on a local cafeteria.
(*) A system of public-private partnership in which the private sector’s funds and know-how are used to implement projects (services) that require solutions to social issues, and the government pays project costs and compensation when results are achieved.
Support for local businesses, such as restaurants and lodging facilities
The Bank of Yokohama implemented an initiative from August 2020 to January 2021 to promote consumption of local currency by Bank of Yokohama employees in order to support, through consumption, the local restaurant and lodging industries, whose business activities were severely affected by the spread
of the novel coronavirus pandemic. In an initiative that also served as a demonstration test for local currency using a dedicated smartphone application, the bank sought to increase consumption by subsidizing a certain amount of money as part of employee benefits, and to contribute to the recovery of the local economy by ensuring that employees themselves had the opportunity to participate in supporting business partners.
Support for the revitalization of the entire Miura Peninsula
Bank of Yokohama has concluded a partnership agreement with Miura City, the Regional Economy Vitalization Initiative Corporation (REVIC), the Keihin Electric Express Railway Company, and the Miura Trust Co. to promote revitalization of the entire area utilizing the rich local resources of Miura City, such as by promoting excursions utilizing tourist content, by distributing information, etc. We support the revitalization of tourism by providing a variety of solutions, including financial support for businesses, business matching, business succession, and cashless settlement.
We have also concluded cooperative agreements with the Keihin Electric Express Railway Co., Ltd., and NTT DoCoMo, Inc., to revitalize the local economy and are working to support industrial development and marine leisure.
Based on the spread of telework, satellite office work, and work vacations (workations), we are also encouraging migration and settlement from outside Kanagawa Prefecture to the prefecture. In online seminars on migration and dual-residence held with Chiba Bank, with which we have a business alliance, panel discussions were held on themes such as “migration”, “dual-residence” and “work vacations”, inviting migrants to Miura City in Kanagawa Prefecture and Minamiboso City in Chiba Prefecture.
Initiatives to create jobs in the region
Support for Commercialization through Industry-University Collaboration
New Technology Online Matching Meetings
The Bank of Yokohama supports the commercialization of new technologies at the R&D stage by linking researchers and businesses through industry-academia collaboration initiatives.
At the “New Technology Online Matching Meeting”, held in conjunction with Chiba Bank, with which we have a business alliance, researchers from all nine universities and technical colleges in Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures delivered video presentations on new technologies and held individual consultations with each company online.
Appointment System for Coordinators of Industry-Academia-Government-
Finance Cooperation
The Bank of Yokohama has been appointed by Yokohama National University, with which it has a comprehensive cooperation agreement, as the “Yokohama National University Industry-Academia-Government-Finance Collaboration Coordinator.”
The coordinators provide academic and technical guidance, consultation and acceptance of joint research, etc., provide support for matching the seeds of technology, and introduce projects in which patents are released free of charge, so the Bank of Yokohama acts as a bridge for proposals to the Bank’s business partners.
Support for cultivation of industry
Support for venture businesses through subsidy programs
The Bank of Yokohama promotes the commercialization of seeds held by researchers aiming to start their own businesses and venture companies that have just begun their operations by contributing to the research and development grant program of the Hamagin Foundation for Industrial and Cultural Advancement. In FY2020, a total of 12 million yen in subsidies was provided to four companies.
Supporting Student Entrepreneurship
The Bank of Yokohama, together with Chiba Bank, with which it has a business alliance, co-hosted a business
idea contest for students, inviting a wide range of business ideas and plans from students living or studying in the two banks’ business areas, with the aim of fostering entrepreneurship among students, who will become future leaders of the local economy. In FY2020, a total of 700,000 yen in supplementary prizes was awarded to five groups selected through a selection committee.
Support for the development of women entrepreneurs
The Bank of Yokohama held an online “Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Support Seminar” mainly for women who aspire to start their own businesses. Women entrepreneurs with ties to Kanagawa gave lectures based on their own entrepreneurial experiences and held a panel discussion on the theme of “Initiatives for SDGs.” The Bank provides ongoing support to seminar participants in their activities to start their own businesses by encouraging them to participate in business contests and seminars for business start-ups organized by the Bank.
Support for expansion of sales channels for local companies
       The Bank of Yokohama has launched an initiative to support
the product development and sales of its business partners through an investment in the “New Product Development Support Project Anonymous Partnership” with TV Tokyo Communications Corporation (TXCOM) as the operator. By crossing well-known intellectual property (IP), such as characters and animation,
with high-quality products of local companies, we contribute
to strengthening the competitiveness of those products and to expanding the recognition of those companies and products utilizing the IP and we support the sustainable growth of local companies. We will also consider launching a regional trading company business in the medium to long term.

 Promotion of Financial Digitization (DX)
Business Strategy for Value Creation
We aim to diversify our services using digital technology by supplementing the needs for “things, people, and experiences” that are beyond financial needs, and by building a “regional ecosystem” to communicate with customers through connections “outside” of finance, including cashless and settlement services.
Improved operational efficiency through data linkage and
operations without handling cash
Data entered by customers on the AGENT in-store terminal is automatically linked to the business system through API integration. As a result, it is possible to reduce the processing time for operations and customer service that was formerly performed manually.
In addition, for procedures involving cash we are progressively installing “Quick Counter ATMs” at all branch counters, which allow customers to make their own deposits. Also, since April 2021, we have begun taking the processing of a wide variety of low-volume administrative work at all of our branches and consolidating it into the Business Support Office at the head office, and we are making steady progress in reducing workloads by promoting various measures to improve operational efficiency.

  Overview of Digital Strategy
To achieve “digital transformation” that can respond to the growth of the Internet economy by utilizing digital technologies such as data collaboration platforms, we will move forward to reform traditional business operations (digital transformation of business operations) and to take on the challenge of new business domains (digital transformation of business models) in order to transform ourselves into a more convenient bank.

  Digital Transformation of Operations
Business process improvement
Based on the “operational reforms using digital technology” set forth in the medium-term management plan, we are promoting fundamental reforms in branch administration (branch operation reforms). As a result, branches will be transformed into “places where customers can consult”, while at the same time we will reduce costs by improving operational efficiency through data linkage and operations without handling cash.
Turning branches into a place for consultation
The Bank of Yokohama has been introducing AGENT and completed the roll out to all branches in December 2020. By enabling customers to complete various transactions, such as opening a savings account or changing the items they have registered, using tablet terminals installed in the lobby,
we have made each procedure paperless, shortened the waiting time for customers, and made the process stress-free. In October 2020, we added transactions such as bankcard applications and inheritance reception. By progressively expanding the range of transactions in the future, we will make it possible for customers to complete all transactions on their own using tablet terminals, turning the counters into a “place for consultation” for asset management, inheritance, etc.
The Marketing Strategy Office, which was established within the Digital Strategy Department, is proactively involved in all promotional plans that come into contact with customers, and the marketing department takes the lead in promoting sales measures. We are also promoting initiatives that leverage the added value of data through finely-tuned communication based on analysis of customer behavioral data, such as using cutting-edge machine learning technology, to approach new customers with latent needs, and we are steadily achieving results.
Behavioral data analysis as a starting point for communication
Tsumitate-NISA
In addition to promoting Tsumitate-NISA to clients who participated in asset formation seminars, we contribute to improving the performance of Tsumitate-NISA through communication by flexibly reviewing the content of the promotion based on client responses.

Digitization support
  The Bank of Yokohama has newly assigned a “Digital Advisor” within the Digital Strategy Department to propose optimal solutions to companies. The Digital Advisor will visit companies directly in collaboration with branch offices to identify digitization needs and provide solutions. In collaboration with the Bank of Yokohama Group’s think tank, the Hamagin Research Institute, and external specialist companies, we help our clients create new businesses and innovations by providing a wide range of consulting services, including business process improvement, support for the introduction of telework, data aggregation and analysis for the purpose of sales expansion, and introductions to IT personnel.
Linkage between HamaPay and Kotora will ensure interoperability, improve customer convenience, and further promote cashless transactions.
Hamagin App
Against the backdrop of the growing cashless society, mobile apps have grown to become the most important channel, used by more than 500,000 people. In December 2020, the Hamagin App was renewed, and in addition to the existing balance inquiry function, many functions were added, such as transfers and pay-easy, making the app more convenient for customers to use. We will continue to evolve it into an “app that is close to customers’ lives”, that is convenient and reliable anytime, anywhere with a smartphone, without having to go to a bank or ATM.

1. Governance
We have established a Group SDGs Policy. An SDGs Committee chaired by the President holds concentrated responsibility for formulating and managing the progress of policies related to environmental and social initiatives, including climate change.
The SDGs Committee’s deliberations are reported to and discussed by the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors oversees the Company’s climate change initiatives.
2. Strategy
We are working to address global warming and climate change as a priority environmental and social issue from the perspectives of both risk and opportunity.
Risk
(1) Transition risk
Transition risks include the risk of financial deterioration of business partners due to stricter regulations on greenhouse gas emissions or the introduction of a carbon tax, the risk of business partners’ businesses (particularly fossil fuels and electric power) becoming stranded assets due to technological advances associated with the transition to a low-carbon society, and the risk of damage to brand value due to insufficient global warming countermeasures or inability to respond to changes in consumer preferences.
Anticipated main impact on the Group
There is a possibility that credit-related expenses will increase due to deterioration in the financial condition of our business partners, the turning of their businesses into stranded assets, damage to their brand value, and other factors. In addition, our brand value may be damaged due to rumors about our global warming countermeasures and investments in fossil fuel-related industries.
(2) Physical risk
These include acute natural disasters such as flooding, which can be exacerbated by abnormal weather, and the risk of damage to buildings and business interruption due to chronic climate change, such as rainfall and changes in weather patterns.
Anticipated main impact on the Group
The Company’s head office and branches may be damaged by natural disasters, which may result in losses. In addition, credit-related expenses may increase as a result of financial deterioration, such as damage to collateral or a decrease in sales due to damage to customers’ company buildings or factories caused by flooding.
(3) Scenario analysis
With regard to physical risk, we are in the process of establishing a system for estimating the amount of increase in credit-related expenses for business loans and housing loans due to financial deterioration caused by damage to collateral properties or business interruption of customers in the event of
a flood. Specifically, we estimate the cumulative impact until 2050, taking into account the increase in credit-related costs in the event of inundation indicated by the hazard maps, and the probability of such inundation occurring under the IPCC RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios (“RCP2.6“: 2°C scenario, “RCP8.5“: 4°C scenario).
We will study the estimation method for the transition risk after identifying the target industries.
(4) Carbon related assets
The value of carbon-related assets (electricity, energy, etc., but excluding loans for renewable energy, etc.) as a percentage of total loans is limited to 0.6%.
* From this fiscal year, overseas loan assets and contracted unrealized assets are included.

Business Strategy for Value Creation
  Opportunities
We have set new long-term KPIs for sustainable finance and green finance. In addition, we launched an investment trust targeting publicly traded companies that focus on SDGs management for corporate and individual customers with high sustainability orientation.
By proactively engaging in dialogue with customers in order to improve their ability to adapt to climate change and transition to a decarbonized society, we will provide green finance for renewable energy projects and solutions to support customers’ transition to a decarbonized society, thereby expanding business opportunities. We will also strengthen our efforts to address the SDGs, including registration and certification systems, in collaboration with local governments.
Sustainable Finance Lineup
3. Risk management
With regard to climate change risk (transition risk and physical risk), we first recognize physical risk as the top risk (occurrence of a natural catastrophe), taking into account the degree of impact and probability of occurrence, and are working to build a system for managing it within the framework of comprehensive risk management. (See Page 68.)
We are working to construct a management system for credit risk, risk related to the Group’s tangible fixed assets, operational risk, etc., based on the impact of climate change risks on the Group’s loans.
We have established a policy (sector policy) for investments and loans where the use of funds is likely to have a negative impact on the environment and society, and are working to reduce or avoid environmental and social impacts. Since FY2020 when the sector policy was established, we have not made any new investments or loans that fall under the sector policy.

  1. Coal-fired power generation business
We will not, in principle, engage in new investments or loans for coal-fired power generation projects that are likely to have a negative impact on the environment.
However, when considering exceptional measures, we will carefully consider each project’s background and characteristics, such as power generation efficiency and performance, impact on the environment, and impact on local communities, with reference to international guidelines etc.
  There are no new investments or loans for coal-fired power generation.
The balance of existing investments and loans is scheduled to be reduced to zero in FY2037.
   2. Cluster bomb manufacturing business
  New investments in and loans to companies that manufacture cluster munitions are prohibited, regardless of the use of the funds.
   There are no investments or loans to businesses related to the manufacture of cluster bombs.
   3. Palm oil plantation development business
From the perspectives of conservation of forest resources and biodiversity and protection of human rights, we prohibit new investments and loans for those developments of palm oil plantations that may involve human rights violations such as illegal logging and child labor.
In addition, investments and loans for palm oil plantation development will be made with careful attention to the status of certification by the RSPO(*1), the international certification for sustainable palm oil, as well as consideration for local communities and the environment.
  There are no investments or loans for palm oil plantation development projects.
   4. Forest harvesting projects
  We make new investments and loans for forest harvesting projects with great care, taking into account whether they have received international certifications (FSC (*2), PEFC (*3) etc.) and the consideration given to local communities and the environment.
  There are no investments or loans for large-scale forest harvesting projects.

  4. Indicators and Targets
We have set long-term goals related to global warming and climate change, including sustainable and green finance and CO2 emission reduction targets.
Sustainable Finance and Green Finance
We have set a target of 2 trillion yen in sustainable finance by FY2030, including 1 trillion yen in green finance. The actual results by FY2020 are 1.0 trillion yen in sustainable finance, of which 0.2 trillion yen is green finance.
Conversion of Bank of Yokohama Head Office Building Electricity to Renewable Energy
As a concrete measure to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of renewable energy, in April 2021 we introduced Aqua de Power Kanagawa, which uses renewable energy generated at the Kanagawa Prefectural Hydroelectric Power Plant, and switched to renewable energy for the electricity
used at the Bank of Yokohama Head Office Building. The introduction of this system will reduce annual CO2 emissions by 2,451 tons (equivalent to approximately 170,000 cedar trees).

 Workplace Reform and Promotion of Diversity
Concordia Financial Group is striving to transform itself into a highly productive organization where diverse human resources can maximize their capabilities, and to foster an organizational culture that encourages employees to take on new challenges and grow.
Business Strategy for Value Creation
Based on the belief that improving the job satisfaction
and engagement of each and every employee is essential for us to become a strong organization that can achieve sustainable growth, we are promoting initiatives to develop human resources, including personnel systems and human resource development that encourage employees to take on new challenges and grow, to create an organization in which human rights are respected and diverse human resources can play an active role, and to create a workplace in which employees can work with peace of mind.
Personnel development
Personnel system
Promotion of Active Participation Across All Generations
In order to enhance the job satisfaction of each and every employee and achieve sustainable growth for the Group, the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi- Nippon Bank are implementing the “Hamagin Full Participation Project” and the “Higashi-Nippon Bank Full Participation Project”, respectively, to foster
a sense of unity across all generations within the Group and promote fair and proper treatment regardless of seniority or personal factors. In addition, as part of our efforts for the diversification of part-timers, we revised our personnel system based on the principle of “equal pay for equal work”. This included reviewing the payment system to reflect the diverse status of work, strengthening our training and on-the-job training functions, and expanding our bonus, retirement benefit, vacation systems, etc. We encourage those who are willing to take on the challenge of transferring to a new position and we are strengthening our support system for skill enhancement and career changes.
New personnel system
In January 2021, we reviewed our personnel system with the aim of creating a system that encourages each employee to take on challenges and boost their growth, reviewing the system so that motivated employees can play an active role regardless of their generation, and encouraging diverse human resources to play an even more active role through initiatives aimed at realizing diverse career paths. We will raise each individual’s motivation to take on challenges and grow and encourage the activities of diverse human resources by varying the treatment to a greater extent than before in accordance with the weight of work responsibilities, such as the difficulty and scope of responsibilities and roles, and the contribution to business results.
Training and development
Effective Human Resource Development and Staff Deployment
The Bank of Yokohama introduced a talent management system in January 2021 in order to develop human resource strategies linked to management and sales strategies and to implement strategic human resource management. By using this system, we will unify the management of information regarding each employee’s skills, knowledge, aptitude, and career design, which has tended to be fragmented in the past, in order to develop and allocate human resources more effectively.
Developing human resources to strengthen problem-solving skills
In order to support employees’ courage and motivation to take on new roles, we provide career change training for employees who wish to change their careers, such as from over-the-counter services to retail sales. In FY2020, 36 new trainees changed careers after this training and were placed in new workplaces, expanding their fields of activity. In addition, we provide a variety of skill improvement training programs to strengthen our problem-solving capabilities for the advancement of solution sales. There is a system of switching courses between general staff and customer service staff, in order to meet the career vision of each individual.
Business Strategy for Value Creation
Next Generation Leader Development
In order to develop human resources for management positions and top management prospects, we conduct training with external experts and implement next-generation leader development programs on themes such as organizational management, leadership, and strategic planning skills.
Training by job classification
The Bank of Yokohama provides career design training as well as a variety of other training programs
based on job function and rank in order to give employees the opportunity to think about their future career development. In March 2021, we opened the Hamagin Learning Center, a training facility for bank employees, in the same building as the Kawasaki Branch of the Bank of Yokohama. In addition to the installation of
web conferencing systems in all training rooms, the cafeteria and lodging spaces are used to enhance the effectiveness of training by deepening interaction among bank employees. We are also working to raise the level of human resources throughout the Group through joint use with Higashi-Nippon Bank. Higashi-Nippon Bank conducts training by course and rank to strengthen sales skills and management capabilities, and is also enhancing customer protection and compliance training.

Professional Human Resources System
The Bank of Yokohama has been operating a Professional Human Resources System with a high level of expertise since FY2019. As human resources with diverse senses of values and career perspectives increase, we are preparing career paths and a compensation system that enables employees to play an active role as professionals in their field of expertise by utilizing their strengths, and preparing the foundation for strengthening and developing specialized human resources. Also, the compensation system will provide more incentive to contribute to the Company’s results than a normal compensation system. The level of compensation will be determined individually based on factors such as the level of expertise and performance, which may result in compensation at the executive or general manager level. We are also actively recruiting mid-career professionals from outside the company. In FY2020, we hired 13 people with a high level of expertise in the digital and ICT fields.

The Bank of Yokohama has newly established the Digital ICT Course and the Data Science Course, which will enable employees to start their careers in the Digital Strategy Division and the ICT Promotion Division of the Head Office, rather than being limited to assignments at branches, so that they can make the most of their expertise in digital and IT technologies from FY2021 (joining the Bank in FY2022).
Open recruitment system (dispatch to domestic and foreign companies, overseas MBA acquisition)
In order to motivate employees to develop themselves and provide them with opportunities for proactive career development, we have established an open recruitment system that allows applications from employees of all career stages, from young employees to managers. There are two types of open recruitment: Head Office Trainee and External Dispatch. Head Office Trainee is mainly for departments such as the Market Sales Department, Loan Department, Digital Strategy Department, and Sales Strategy Department “External Dispatch” destinations include Group companies, financial institutions, government organizations, central government organizations, etc. We also provide support for staff to study abroad to obtain an MBA.
 TOPIC Employee Idea Contest
As part of the Bank of Yokohama’s 100th anniversary celebrations, the Bank of Yokohama held the “Hamagin Idea Contest 2020” in order to solicit ideas from employees on new business themes for the next 100 years that transcend the boundaries of banking and to help employees hone their planning and proposal skills and improve their individual skills.
This contest received applications from 115 employees, and four teams made presentations in front of the executives at the final selection round held in March 2021.

  Workplace Reform and Promotion of Diversity
Business Strategy for Value Creation
   Concordia Financial Group has established the Group Human Rights Policy and is promoting initiatives to respect the fundamental human rights of customers, employees, and all other stakeholders.
A safe, secure place to work
We are working to expand our systems so that employees can work flexibly and efficiently according to their lifestyles and life stages.
Efficient Work Styles
Use of flextime and staggered work hours
In order to realize a flexible and efficient work style, we have introduced a flextime system and a staggered workday system that allows employees to choose their own starting and ending times according to their own lives and work situations, without being constrained by the concept of “regular hours.” From 2020, we have abolished core hours in the flextime system in order to encourage more diverse work styles.
Introduction of a Work Shift Interval System
We provide an 11-hour rest period (work hour interval) between the end of one workday and the start of the next workday to help employees refresh their minds and bodies, maintain their health, and achieve a good work-life balance.
 Group Human Rights Policy
We at Concordia Financial Group respect the fundamental human rights of our customers, employees, and all other stakeholders, and aim to be a financial group that is trusted by our customers and indispensable to the community.
1. Respect for international norms
We respect international norms such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
2. Elimination of discrimination
We will not discriminate or violate human rights in any of our corporate activities on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, origin, social status, beliefs, age, disability, physical characteristics, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other such basis.
3. Fostering a corporate culture
We foster a corporate culture that respects human rights by viewing all human rights issues as our own, encouraging people to see things from the perspective of others.
4. Establishing a comfortable working environment
We are building relationships of equality where officers and employees recognize each other as business partners and can freely express their opinions.
We eliminate all harassment from the workplace.
5. Implementation of fair recruitment
We hire employees through a rigorous and fair selection process based solely on their ability and aptitude.
6. Implementation of human rights awareness training
We engage in a wide range of human rights awareness-raising activities, including anti-discrimination activities, to help each and every employee have a deep and correct knowledge and understanding of human rights, with the aim of resolving all human rights issues.
Under this policy, we are concerned with negative impacts on human rights from corporate activities of our investment and financing partners and our procurement and contracting partners (supply chain), and we strive to improve and enhance our efforts to respect human rights through dialogue and consultation with relevant stakeholders.
Telework System and Satellite Offices
We have introduced a telework system for all employees, and are accelerating the digitization and streamlining of work styles by improving and expanding our infrastructure to allow employees to work flexibly in line with their lifestyles, regardless of time or location.
The Bank of Yokohama formulated the “Hamagin Style” as an initiative to improve productivity and as a countermeasure against infectious diseases, and added mobile work to the existing telework system (telecommuting and satellite office work).
In December 2020 we established “Hamasate” satellite offices at four locations
in the prefecture.
A safe, secure place to work
Hamagin Style ~ Be a SMART banker
  Getting away from the “paper” and “stamp” culture
Let’s review the department and branch rules! From concern for superiors to concern for the environment
 Let’s telework! Let’s review travel time.
 In addition, as an initiative based on the Group Human Rights Policy, we conduct educational training for employees on unconscious bias.
Supporting Diverse Human Resources in Their Work
Support for Women in the Workplace
In order to further promote the activities of women employees and to support their career development and continued employment, we are increasing opportunities for employees with time constraints and creating an environment that allows them to work flexibly.
Workplace vaccination for novel coronavirus and introduction of vaccine leave
In order to ensure the health of our employees and provide our customers with peace of mind when using the bank, we have been providing vaccinations for those who wish to receive them since June 2021. In addition, we introduced vaccine leave that can be taken when employees are vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or when they accompany family members being vaccinated.
Support for balancing work with childcare and nursing care
We have established systems (childcare leave, nursing care leave, etc.) that allow all employees, regardless of gender, to participate in childcare and nursing care and to balance work and family life. In 2019, the Bank of Yokohama opened the Hamagin Kids Park (Nishi-ku, Yokohama), an in-house daycare center for employees, to support employees who are raising children to return to work and continue working.

The Yokohama Bank Health Declaration underlines our efforts to help employees achieve their full potential through initiatives involving health management. We have established a cross-functional “Health Management Promotion Liaison Committee” to promote health management and have taken a variety of initiatives to maintain and promote employee health. These include the establishment of a health management center at our head office, individual interviews with industrial physicians for those working long hours, and complete prohibition of smoking in offices.
We have been recognized as an “Excellent Health Management Company - White 500 -” in the category of large-scale corporations in accordance with the “Superior Corporate Health Management Accreditation System” established by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Japan Health Conference (Nippon Kenko Kaigi).
Asset formation support
In order to support systematic asset building by employees and foster in them a sense of participation in management, we have introduced an employee stock ownership system and provide incentives based on the amount accumulated. In October 2020, as part of the Bank of Yokohama’s 100th anniversary celebrations, we increased the amount of incentive grants for the Employee Stock Ownership Plan and raised the maximum amount of contributions eligible for incentive grants.

Management Base Supporting Value Creation
   Basic Concepts
The Company has a Corporate Governance Basic Policy that establishes policies and frameworks for achieving effective corporate governance with the aim of promoting sustainable growth of the Group and improving corporate value over the medium to long term. We constantly review our philosophy of corporate governance and work to improve it.
Furthermore, based on our Management Philosophy, we are implementing management that contributes to the value creation of various stakeholders such as shareholders, customers, employees, and local communities, ensuring the fairness, transparency, and speed of decision-making, and building a corporate governance system appropriate for a regional financial group.
* Corporate Governance Basic Policy
Refer to our website. https://www.concordia-fg.jp/common/pdf/cg_kihon.pdf
The Company has an Audit and Supervisory Board, with the Board of Directors, auditors, and Audit and Supervisory Board responsible for management supervision. Auditors, including independent outside auditors, audit the legality and appropriateness of the directors' execution of their duties
by attending meetings of the Board of Directors and reviewing important documents, thereby fulfilling their management auditing function. In
addition, independent outside directors supervise management from an independent standpoint and provide opinions and proposals to ensure the appropriateness of decision-making. The Company has adopted the current corporate governance system because it believes that these systems sufficiently fulfill the auditing and supervisory functions.

Based on the results of the FY2019 effectiveness evaluation, the Board of Directors operated with an awareness of strengthening supervision
and monitoring of the status of responses to important management issues, confirmed the progress of the medium-term management plan, and deliberated on the recognition of business execution issues by division and initiatives to resolve them. Furthermore, deliberations of the Board of Directors have been revitalized by continuing to enhance the advance briefings on agenda items and provision of information to outside directors as implemented since the previous fiscal year.
We evaluated that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has progressed steadily through efforts to improve the issues recognized in FY2019.
Evaluation method
As described below, in the FY2020 effectiveness evaluation, we conducted a self-evaluation by utilizing a third party perspective, questionnaires, and interviews, and by discussing issues and future efforts for the effectiveness of Board of Directors meetings.
Composition of the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board
In order to ensure that the Board of Directors functions most effectively and efficiently, and from the perspective of revitalizing the Board of Directors, the Articles of Incorporation stipulate that the number of directors be limited to 10. The Board of Directors is composed of a diverse range of directors with different backgrounds in expertise and experience etc. to ensure that the Board of Directors as a whole has a well-balanced mix of knowledge, experience, and ability, combining internal directors familiar with the Group's operations with multiple external directors having a wealth of experience and knowledge outside the Company. As of June 22, 2021, of the seven directors (six men and one woman), three are independent outside directors. To ensure the effectiveness of audits, the Articles of Incorporation stipulate a maximum of five auditors, with at least half that number being outside auditors. As of June 22, 2021, of the five auditors (four men and one woman), three are independent outside auditors.
  Recognition of issues and policy for FY2021
  1. Enhance discussions on medium to long-term strategies with an awareness of sustainable growth and enhancement of corporate value in response to changes in the environment.
2. Enhance the operational framework and improve effectiveness of internal control to strengthen group cooperation.

  Risk Management Initiatives
Management Base Supporting Value Creation
   Basic Concepts
In order to foster and spread a risk culture, the Group conducts risk management based on the following basic policies.
• To minimize the negative impact of economic fluctuations, and to provide stable and continuous financial services as a financial group trusted by the community, the Group will conduct appropriate risk management.
• The Company ensures sound management by identifying, assessing, monitoring, and controlling the risks of the entire Group as comprehensively as possible, and strives to secure stable earnings commensurate with the risks through the appropriate allocation of management resources.
• In order to ensure objectivity and account for the interaction between risks, we strive to quantify and manage various risks in an integrated manner.
In Concordia Financial Group, the subsidiaries (the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank) manage risk by setting up risk management and control departments for each type of risk, while the holding company manages the risks of the Group as a whole in an integrated manner. Specifically, the subsidiaries manage risks appropriately in accordance with their risk profiles and report to the holding company on the status of risks. The holding company provides the subsidiaries with necessary guidance, and the ALM and Risk Management Committee (Management Conference) monitors, discusses, and decides on various types of risks and risks for the entire Group.
Introduction of the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF)
The Concordia Financial Group is introducing a Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) to monitor and clarify the type and amount of risk taken on during operations, while taking into account the balance
of earnings, risk, and our capital buffer. In formulating the medium-
term management plan and the budget for each financial year, a Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which defines the types and amounts of risks that management should willingly accept or avoid, is adopted at a Board of Directors' meeting. We plan to optimize risk-return, using the RAF to constantly monitor the risk assets and their relationship to return, which are incorporated in the budget.

 Overview of Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) Management System
Capital allocation and risk capacity based capping
 Stress testing
 Top Risk Management
 • The potential maximum loss (risk amount) of each risk is measured using value-at- risk (VaR) and other measures, and capital is allocated to each risk type in order to keep the risk amount within the range
of the equity capital available for risk- taking. For risk-weighted assets, the risk appetite is determined within the measured risk capacity.
• The Company verifies the appropriateness of risk-taking by estimating losses for each type of risk and measuring the impact on capital, earnings, risk-weighted assets, and risk volume using group-wide stress scenarios to confirm the adequacy of capital in budgetary plans and to ensure that management has an acceptable level of profit in times of stress.
 • In order to manage top management risks, as much as possible, we set up Key Risk Indicators (KRI) as warning indicators to detect the possibility of risks materializing in the future. We continuously monitor these KRIs to understand the signs and prepare
to respond flexibly in the event that risks do materialize.

it should manage as "top management risks".
We continuously monitor our top management risks and strive to perceive the signs and are prepared to respond flexibly in the event that a risk manifests.
  Main Top Management Risks
 - Additional monetary easing by the Bank of Japan - Large-scale losses caused by cyberattacks - Natural disasters - Sanctions due to inadequate anti-money laundering measures - Significant deterioration in business conditions and bankruptcies of certain large clients - Spread of the novel coronavirus, etc.
*These are some of the risks that the Company has recognized, but risks other than those mentioned above may have a particularly significant adverse effect on our business.
  Crisis Management
 The Group has a crisis management system in place to ensure the safety of its customers and employees, the smooth execution of financial operations, and the protection of customers' assets in the event of an earthquake or other large-scale disaster, system failure, or spread of infectious diseases etc. In the event of a crisis, the Crisis Management Committee chaired by the president and representative director instructs companies within the Group to set up an emergency headquarters to centrally manage the response to the situation.
In response to the novel coronavirus, we are working to thoroughly prevent infection by installing alcohol, acrylic panels and other countermeasure equipment in stores and asking customers to maintain social distance. Employees strive to avoid 'dense' workplaces through telework and staggered work schedules, in addition to taking basic infection prevention measures. We have also introduced split operations for key operations at the head office to ensure that we have the personnel necessary to continue operations.
The Group will work to prevent the spread of COVID-19, placing the highest priority on the health and safety of its customers and related parties, and will strive to maintain and continue its financial functions as a financial infrastructure essential to the maintenance of social functions.

Integrated understanding and management of risks across the Group

     Integrated Risk Management
I. Basic Concepts
The Group classifies and manages Group risks in the following categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and reputational risk. In addition, we ensure the soundness of management by identifying, evaluating, monitoring, and controlling risks in an integrated manner to the greatest extent possible, including risks related to the development, provision and revision of products and services, as well as risks related to outsourcing of operations. We are also prepared to secure stable earnings through the appropriate allocation of management resources, commensurate with the risks involved.
Concordia Financial Group has positioned cyberattacks as one of the top risks in protecting the property of its customers and ensuring the stable operation of the financial system as part of the nation's important infrastructure, and is therefore under management leadership. We continuously monitor and strive to understand the signs, and prepare a response in the event of cyber risks appearing.
I. Cybersecurity Governance
Concordia Financial Group has established cybersecurity measures based on the Cybersecurity Framework set forth by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is an international standard guideline, and is formulating strategies, building organizational structures, and promoting initiatives to strengthen security.
In addition to the assessment, we conduct the Threat Led Penetration Test (TLPT), in which white hackers actually penetrate internal systems to assess vulnerabilities, to identify issues, and to strengthen countermeasures.
As an organizational structure, we have established the Cybersecurity Response Group, a specialized cybersecurity organization within the ICT Management Department, which reports to the Board of Directors and the Management Conference on threats and regulatory trends, security measures taken in light of these trends, and the current status, as appropriate, in order to make appropriate management decisions.
In addition, because cybersecurity operations require specialized knowledge and skills, we have hired several experts in mid-career to strengthen security measures for the entire Group.
II. Incident Response System
In order to respond to the evolving threat of cyber attacks, we have formed the Concordia Financial Group-CSIRT, which consists of CSIRT members from each Group company. In addition to collecting and disseminating threat information on a daily basis, and investigating and responding to attacks when they are detected, we prepare for emergencies by regularly participating in drills organized by the Cabinet Cybersecurity Center (NISC), the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and the Financial ISAC in order to verify cooperation with government agencies, industry organizations, and Group companies.
In addition, we have formed the MEJAR-CSIRT with regional financial institutions and NTT DATA, which operates the MEJAR core system, to regularly exchange information, confirm systems, and conduct joint training.
III. Education and Training for Group Executives, Employees, and Customers
Concordia Financial Group believes that in addition to technical responses to cyberattacks, it is essential to improve cybersecurity literacy of all Group executives and employees, and conducts training and e-mail drills for all Group executives and employees on a regular basis. We invite external experts to conduct study sessions for management and encourage CSIRT members to participate in external specialized training and acquire specialized qualifications.
In addition, in response to the recent increase in the number of fraudulent remittances through phishing and other means, in order to alert customers when a phishing site is detected, we have posted information on our website about fraudulent remittance methods, examples of suspicious e-mails and SMS (short messages) that have exploited our company name, and information.
Cybersecurity
Management Base Supporting Value Creation
     Credit risk
Risk of loss due to a decline in the value of assets due to deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower
 Market risk
Risk of loss due to fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities held resulting from changes
in various market risk factors, such as those
for interest rates and securities
 Liquidity risk
Risk of losses due to unexpected outflows of funds (cash flow risk and market liquidity risk)
 Operational risk
Risk of losses due to inadequate administration, inadequate systems, violations of laws or regulations, natural disasters, and health hazards for executives and employees
 Reputational risk
Risk of incurring losses due to negative external publicity as a result of the words, actions and behavior of the Group, its officers, employees, etc.
II. Integrated Risk Management Framework
Ensuring soundness through capital allocation
The Group measures the potential maximum loss (risk amount) for each risk using value-at-risk (VaR) and other measures, and allocates capital by risk type in order to keep the amount of risk within the range of real equity capital (the risk tolerance limit, which is defined as common equity Tier 1 less deferred tax asset equivalents etc.) When allocating capital, we check the sufficiency of the buffer (unallocated capital) to ensure that our real equity capital is not exceeded in
times of stress.
Ensuring soundness through stress testing
In order to assess the adequacy of the buffer (unallocated capital) and to confirm the appropriateness of risk-taking, the Group conducts stress tests in which stress scenarios are established and the amount of loss and risk in the event of such a stress event is estimated across the risk categories.
The stress scenarios have been established for the Group taking into consideration past sharp economic downturns and future environmental changes.
   Ensuring sound management
Increasing profitability and efficiency
     1. Understanding management strength (risk tolerance limit)
2. Understanding scale of losses based on frequency of risk
3. Allocating capital after checking adequacy of buffer
4. Risk control within the scope of capital allocation
5. Risk-return assessments by department and business etc.

  Compliance Initiatives
Management Base Supporting Value Creation
   Basic Concepts
Concordia Financial Group recognizes compliance as an important management issue, with executives and employees working together to enhance the compliance system based on our Basic Compliance Policy(*).
With the widespread transfer of funds by criminal groups, terrorists and others, and the growing threat of international terrorism, the risk of financial institutions being entangled in money laundering and terrorist financing has increased.
The Concordia Financial Group is committed to complying with the basic requirements for checking, etc., at the time of transactions
as stipulated in relevant laws and regulations, such as the Act
on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. We are also committed to effective countermeasures against money laundering and terrorist financing to ensure that we are able to respond to the risks that may change
Concordia Financial Group is deeply aware of the importance that banks must place on their public mission and social responsibilities. The Group absolutely refuses financing for antisocial elements that pose a threat to the order and safety of civil society. Our organization as a whole works towards the elimination of all relationships, including transactions, with antisocial elements, and takes a firm stance against unjustified demands and intervention by such elements.
Concordia Financial Group considers customer protection to be one of the most crucial areas of management. We stand in the customer's perspective and strictly follow all laws and regulations, and conduct our corporate activities fairly and in good faith.
To protect customers and ensure thorough compliance, all employees receive e-learning and group training for their respective duties
and positions with themes such as fiduciary duty, management of customer information, abuse of a superior position, and conflict of interest management. We also conduct information security training for all employees based on the basic policies set out in the Security Policy to ensure the safety of our information assets.
The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank each have their own
We are consolidating the existing Anti-Bribery and Corruption Regulations as a preventive initiative, by clearly identifying and positioning the risks associated with bribery and corruption as money laundering risks etc. and are taking initiatives to prevent bribery
and corruption.
from over time, and to playing our role as a participant in the financial system in order to maintain its integrity.
Specifically, each entity prepares a risk assessment document based on the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, which comprehensively and specifically identifies and evaluates risks, and implements risk mitigation measures such as proper notification of suspicious transactions. In addition, we have established a Money Laundering Prevention Program to verify the effectiveness of risk- reduction measures and we review the program annually to enhance our preparedness.
More specifically, Concordia Financial Group has used this basic principle to formulate a Basic Policy on Anti-Social Elements (*)
from the perspective of preventing harm due to antisocial elements. Executives and employees are made aware of company policies through workshops, and the Risk Management Department of each Group company works with lawyers and public administration agencies such as law enforcement to prevent transactions and interactions with anti-social elements.
(*) Basic Policy Against Antisocial Elements: https://www.concordia-fg.jp/ antisocial/index.html
customer support office accepting consultations and complaints. The Concordia Financial Group has entered into a basic agreement with the Japanese Bankers Association, a designated dispute resolution organization under the Japan Banking Act. All customer conflicts
are handled using the Financial ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) System, a system to resolve conflicts through third party involvement.
As part of Concordia Financial Group's efforts to protect personal information, we not only have our policy on the handling of personal information available on our website, but also all executives and employees are notified of the various rules and regulations, and any subsequent modifications concerning the appropriate handling of such information.
(*) Basic Compliance Policy: https://www.concordia-fg.jp/compliance/index.html
A Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of compliance-related issues for the entire Concordia Financial Group. The Risk Management Department manages and provides guidance to the entire Group on compliance-related issues.
In addition, as a specific plan of practice to achieve compliance throughout the Group, we establish a Compliance Program for each financial year in accordance with the Basic Compliance Policy and have newly established action principles for the realization of the program. In our FY2020 compliance program, we are focusing on
initiatives such as maintaining a thorough awareness of compliance and a sensible sales attitude, practicing customer-oriented services, managing information rigorously, combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and taking appropriate action against antisocial elements and financial crime.
Furthermore, to enhance its effectiveness, the Compliance Conference meets regularly to monitor the progress of the Compliance Program and the status of compliance and reports to Board of Directors meetings.

  Internal audit system
Customer-Focused Management Base Supporting Value Creation
Business Operation
Concordia Financial Group has formulated and announced its Fiduciary Duty Statement as part of its commitment to customer-oriented business operations. The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank have adopted a policy based on this declaration, and are working on proposals for customer-oriented asset management.
To view our Fiduciary Duty Statement, visit our website: https://www.concordia-fg.jp/company/fd/index.html
We have prepared "Four Promises and Two Approaches", an informational document summarizing our customer-oriented asset management proposals in an easy-to-understand manner, and we actively use it when selling products and following up with customers.
Initiatives to Support Customer Asset Formation and Management (the Bank of Yokohama)
By adopting a goal-based approach, we share investment objectives with our clients and provide support for asset formation and management in line with client needs.
Investment Product Transactions (Bank of Yokohama and Hamagin TT Securities)
The number of holders of investment-type products is increasing, albeit moderately, due to an increase in the number of customers who have started asset formation and management. In addition, the balance of assets in our custody has increased due to market factors. Furthermore, as the number of customers making new funded investments centered on Tsumitate NISA is increasing, the number of investment trust funded policies, and the amounts of funded policies, are continuing their increase of the previous year.
  Role of Internal Auditing
The Audit Department (the Group's internal audit department), verifies and evaluates the effectiveness and appropriateness of internal management systems and internal controls, including compliance and risk management, from a standpoint independent of the executive divisions, with the aim of ensuring the sound and appropriate operation of business and contributing to the achievement of management goals, and makes recommendations for correcting and improving issue points.
In order to ensure that methods and standards are consistent within the Group, the Company has established the Basic Internal Audit Regulations based on the policies and regulations established by the Company and its subsidiaries regarding internal audits.
The members of the Audit Department of the Company are generally assigned concurrently to the Audit Departments of the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank. This establishes a system for efficient and effective internal audits on a group-wide basis and conducts consistent internal audits, thus strengthening the internal audit function.
The Company's Audit Department conducts internal audits of each department and consolidated subsidiary based on the basic internal audit plan formulated each fiscal year, and reports the results of the internal audits and the status of the executive departments' responses to issues to the Group Management Audit Committee, the Board of Directors and the Audit and Supervisory Board.
In addition, in order to conduct more effective internal audits, we collaborate with auditors, accounting auditors, and departments in charge of internal control functions by periodically exchanging information.

Internal Audit
The Company Auditing Department assesses the risks inherent in the departments and operations to be audited (risk assessment) and determines the scope, frequency, and depth of internal audits accordingly, in order to allocate limited audit resources effectively and efficiently and to conduct risk- based audits.
Furthermore, in order to maintain and improve audit quality, in addition to securing diverse specialized personnel, we work to enhance internal audit resources for the entire group, such as by formulating a training plan for auditing staff and by systematically working on development of personnel.

   The four promises ... For customers considering investment trusts
Promise 1 - We will propose asset formation and management that is close to the customer. Promise 2 - We will provide the best investment products
Promise 3 - We will give customers information and highly satisfactory services.
Promise 4 - We will do our work as finance professionals
 Two thoughts ... For customers holding investment trusts
Thought 1 - Invest slowly and carefully from a long-term perspective, rather than trying to guess the market. "Thought 2 - When in doubt, take the two "return to basics".
     Audit and Supervisory Board and Auditors
    What is a goal-based approach?
This is a method of considering asset formation in accordance with the future goals of each individual customer, and is based on the concept of setting an ultimate goal and working backwards from there to determine investment policy.
Based on various life events such as leisure and other entertainment expenses, wedding funds, education funds, housing funds, and retirement funds, we calculate how much money will be needed in how many years and decide how to approach the goal.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to goals. We listen carefully to our clients' ideas, make the most appropriate proposals, and work with them to realize their goals.

In order to share the vision of management and employees, we conduct a variety of initiatives with management including roundtable discussions. . In October 2020, the Bank of Yokohama held an online employee event to celebrate its 100th anniversary. The event was designed for employees' families as well, and to enhance a sense of unity and togetherness among employees as we look toward the next 100 years.
We are also promoting various initiatives to increase engagement, such as incorporating employee feedback into management by conducting regular employee engagement surveys and reporting the results to the Board of Directors.
Support for establishment of Yokohama Children's Hospice -
Sea and Sky Home
In commemoration of its 100th anniversary in December 2020, the Bank of Yokohama handled a private placement bond to support the activities of the Children's Hospice. The Children's Hospice is a facility that provides children who have life-threatening illnesses or disabilities and their families with opportunities to play and learn in a safe, secure, and comfortable environment supervised by specialists in a variety of fields, with the aim of improving their quality of life. The Bank of Yokohama will donate an amount equivalent to 0.2% of the issue amount to the Yokohama Children's Hospice Project when this private placement bond is issued by customers. The project is preparing for the opening of the Children's Hospice in the fall of 2021, and this donation will be used for the operating expenses of the facility. The Bank of Yokohama is supporting their activities by donating 10 million yen as part of the funds to establish a children's hospice facility.
Marine conservation efforts through the company cafeteria
The Bank of Yokohama is the first bank in Japan to offer a menu of Sustainable Seafood (*) in its headquarters employee cafeteria. Incorporating sustainable marine products into the company cafeteria menu encourages each employee to change his or her food awareness and behavior.
(*) Sustainable seafood is not over-fished and is caught in a way that is environmentally friendly. There are two types of fisheries products - fish caught in the wild in consideration of marine resources and the environment and farmed fish raised in a way that minimizes their impact on the environment. Both require certification by an inspection organization (e.g. MSC or ASC certification).

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2021
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, in accordance with the Enforcement Regulation for the Banking Act, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorporated and operates. As permitted by the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, amounts less than one million yen have been omitted. As a result, the totals do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts. Yen amounts, other than per share amounts, have been rounded down to millions of yen. Yen per share amounts have been rounded down to two decimal places.
The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.72 to U.S. $1, the rate of exchange at March 31, 2021. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Principles of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries and its associates accounted for by the equity method.
The number of consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 were 12 and 13, respectively.
Hamagin Mortgage Service Co., Ltd. was excluded from the scope of consolidation as the liquidation was completed during the year ended March 31, 2021.
The number of associates accounted for by the equity method as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 was four.
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.
The balance sheet dates of the consolidated subsidiaries are the same as the balance sheet date of the Company.
The consolidated financial statements do not include the accounts of five subsidiaries in 2021, and four subsidiaries in 2020, because the total assets, total income, net income, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income of these entities would not have had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in the unconsolidated subsidiaries and associates to which the equity method accounting is not applied are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material.
All significant intercompany balances, transactions, and unrealized profits included in assets have been eliminated in consolidation.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition is amortized over a period of 5 to 10 years.
b. Trading-Purpose Transactions — “Transactions for trading purposes” (for the purpose of capturing gains arising from short-term changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or market prices of securities and other market-related indices or from arbitrage opportunities) are included in “Trading assets” and “Trading liabilities” on a trade-date basis. Trading securities and monetary claims bought for trading purposes recorded in these accounts are stated at fair value and trading-related financial derivatives are stated at the amounts that would be settled if they were terminated at the end of the fiscal year.
Profits and losses on transactions for trading purposes are shown as “Trading income” or “Trading expenses” on a trade-date basis.
c. Securities — Securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management’s intent, as follows:
(1)Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity,
are reported at amortized cost computed using the straight-line method.

(2)Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity. Securities whose fair values cannot be reliably determined are stated at cost determined by the moving-average method.
For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income.
d. Property, Plant and Equipment — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment owned by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is computed mainly using the straight-line method.
The range of useful lives is from 2 to 60 years for buildings and from 2 to 20 years for equipment.
Depreciation of leased property and equipment owned by consolidated subsidiaries is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease periods.
e. Software — Cost of computer software obtained for internal use is amortized principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years.
f. Long-Lived Assets — The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
g. Revaluation Reserve for Land — Under the “Law of Land Revaluation,” The Bank of Yokohama, Ltd. (“BOY”) elected a one-time revaluation of its own-use land to a value based on real estate appraisal information as of March 31, 1998.
The resulting revaluation reserve for land represents unrealized appreciation of land and is stated, net of income taxes, as a component of equity. There was no effect on the consolidated statement of income. Continuous readjustment is not permitted, unless the land value subsequently declines significantly, such that the amount of the decline in value should be removed from the revaluation reserve for land account and related deferred tax liabilities.
The carrying amount of the land after the above one-time revaluation exceeded the market value by ¥34,883 million ($ 315,057 thousand) and ¥36,241 million as of March 31, 2021and 2020, respectively.
h. Deferred Charges — Bond issue expenses are recognized as expense when incurred.
i. Allowance for Loan Losses — Major consolidated subsidiaries provide an allowance for loan losses, which is determined based on management’s judgment and an assessment of future losses based on major consolidated subsidiary’s self-assessment systems. These systems reflect past experience of credit losses, possible credit losses, business and economic conditions, the character, quality and performance of the portfolio, the value of collateral or guarantees, and other pertinent indicators.
Major consolidated subsidiaries have implemented a self-assessment system to determine its asset quality. The quality of all loans is assessed by branches and the credit supervisory division with a subsequent audit by the asset review and inspection division, which is independent from the operating divisions, in accordance with major consolidated subsidiary’s policy and guidelines for the self- assessment of asset quality.
Major consolidated subsidiaries have established a credit rating system under which its customers are classified into five categories. The credit rating system is used in the self-assessment of asset quality. All loans are classified into five categories for self-assessment purposes: “normal,” “in need of caution,” “possible bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “legal bankruptcy.”
The allowance for loan losses is calculated based on the actual historical loss ratio for “normal” and “in need of caution” categories; the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and other factors of solvency, including future cash flows for other categories. For claims to borrowers whose loans are classified as “possible bankruptcy” or “restructured loans” over a certain amount, for which future cash flows could be reasonably estimated, an allowance is provided for the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contracted interest rate and the carrying value of the claims (the “DCF method”). Also, for claims for which allowance has been provided based on the DCF method in previous fiscal years, an allowance is provided based on the DCF method.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2021
For collateralized or guaranteed claims to borrowers who are in the “virtual bankruptcy” or “legal bankruptcy” category, the amount exceeding the estimated value of collateral or guarantees has been deducted as deemed uncollectible directly from those claims. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the deducted amounts were ¥ 29,403 million ($265,571 thousand) and ¥36,874 million, respectively.
Other consolidated subsidiaries maintain allowances for possible loan losses that are provided as deemed necessary to cover expected losses based on their own experience.
j. Provision for Bonuses — Provision for bonuses is provided in the amount of the estimated bonuses that are attributable to each fiscal year.
k. Provision for Directors’ Bonuses — Provision for directors’ bonuses is provided in the amount of the estimated bonuses that are attributable to each fiscal year.
l. Provision for Share-Based Compensation — Provision for share-based compensation is provided in the amount of the estimated payment based on the stock compensation system for directors, etc. of the Company and major consolidated subsidiaries that are attributable to each fiscal year.

Provision for Contingent Losses — Provision for contingent losses is provided for contingent losses not covered by other provisions in an amount deemed necessary based on estimated losses in the future.
Reserve under Special Laws — Reserve under special laws is provided for contingent liabilities from brokering of security transactions in accordance with Section 1 of Article 46-5 of the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
Retirement and Pension Plans — Major consolidated subsidiaries have contributory funded defined benefit pension plans, lump- sum payment plans, and defined contribution pension plans for employees. Other consolidated subsidiaries have lump-sum payment plans, and some of these subsidiaries have defined contribution pension plans.
Major consolidated subsidiaries accounted for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 15 years within the average remaining service period. The discount rate is determined using a single weighted-average discount rate reflecting the estimated timing and amount of benefit payment.
Stock Options — Compensation expenses for employee stock options are recognized based on the fair value at the date of grant and over the vesting period as consideration for receiving goods or services in accordance with Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 8, “Accounting Standard for Stock Options”. Stock options granted to nonemployees are accounted for based on the fair value of either the stock option or the goods or services received. In the balance sheet, the stock option is presented as subscription rights to shares as a separate component of equity until exercised.
Leases — Finance leases that are deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as lease receivables, and finance leases that are not deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as investments in lease.
Lease revenue and lease costs are recognized over the lease period.
Income Taxes — The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences.
Translation of Foreign Currencies — Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and accounts of overseas branches held by the Group are translated at exchange rates prevailing as of the balance sheet date.

u. Derivatives and Hedging Activities — Derivative financial instruments are classified and accounted for as follows: (a) all derivatives, except those entered into for hedging purposes, are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value with gains or losses on derivative transactions recognized in the statement of income or (b) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of a high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the gains or losses on the derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions (deferral hedge accounting).
Consolidated banking subsidiaries apply deferral hedge accounting based on the rules of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 24 for interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk from various financial assets and liabilities as a whole. Under these rules, the effectiveness of a fair value hedge is assessed by an identified group of hedge deposits, loans, and similar instruments and by a corresponding group of hedging instruments, such as interest rate swaps in the same maturity category. Also, under these rules, the effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed based on the correlation between a base interest rate index of the hedged cash flow and that of the hedging instrument.
Consolidated banking subsidiaries apply deferral hedge accounting based on the rules of the JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 25 for currency swaps and funding swaps used for the purpose of currency exchange.
v. Cash and Cash Equivalents — For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents represent cash and due from the Bank of Japan.
w. Cash Dividends — Cash dividends charged to retained earnings are dividends paid during the year and represent year-end dividends for the preceding year and interim dividends for the current fiscal year.
x. Per Share Information — Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits.
Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net income per share of common stock assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants.
Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective fiscal years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.
y. Significant Accounting Estimates — Items for which amounts are recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year based on accounting estimates that may have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements for the next fiscal year are as follows:
Allowance for loan losses: ¥ 76,134 million ($687,628 thousand).
The Group calculates the amount of allowance for loan losses as described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, i. Allowance for Loan Losses.” and uses the following key assumptions in recognizing the amount.
• Future prospects of borrowers in determining the borrower classification based on their status and business improvement plans,
• Estimation of disposable amounts of real estate collaterals in the future based on the past results,
• Prospects for the collection of principal and interest of receivables based on the current performance under the cash flow
estimation method, and
• Future prospects based on long-term historical results and trends to be taken into account in making necessary adjustments to
the loss rate based on the historical average in calculating the expected credit losses.
These assumptions may be affected by changes in uncertain economic conditions in the future. If there is a material difference
between the assumptions and the actual results, the balance of allowance for loan losses and the amount of provision for loan losses for the next fiscal year may be significantly affected.
The Group assumes that the infection of Novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease would gradually ease toward the end of the next fiscal year. Although the Group expects credit losses from some debtors due to deterioration of business performance and cash flows resulting from the continuing impact of stagnation of economic activities, the Group collects latest detailed information as much as possible and determines the debtor classification based on the future prospects to calculate the allowance for loan losses. In addition, for some debtors whose business activities have been significantly affected by Novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease, the Group has calculated the amount of expected credit losses with additional necessary adjustments considering the uncertainty of future prospects and credit risk. The assumption of the impact of Novel Coronavirus Infectious Disease is uncertain, and actual credit losses may exceed the expected credit losses if the deterioration of debtors’ business performance exceeds the assumption based on the latest available information due to sluggish consumer spending and stagnation of production activities.

ab. Additional Information
(Stock compensation system that utilizes trusts)
(1)
Outline of Transactions
The Company introduced a stock compensation system that utilizes trusts (the “System”) for the purpose of sharing interests with its shareholders, and boosting the motivation to promote the sustainable growth of the Company group as a whole and to enhance corporate value over the medium to long term.
The System applies to the directors (excluding outside directors and non-executive directors) and the executive officers of the Company and major consolidated subsidiaries. In the System, the Company entrusts the trust bank with cash to the extent approved by resolution at the general meeting of shareholders of the Company, combined with the cash contributed by the subsidiaries to the extent approved by resolution at the general meeting of shareholders of the subsidiaries, and creates the trust in which the beneficiaries are directors, etc. who satisfy the beneficiary requirements. The trust acquires shares of the Company from the stock market by using the cash entrusted as the source of financing.
During the trust period, beneficiaries receive: a certain number of points that are awarded in accordance with the respective stock-granting rules of each company; shares of the Company that are granted in the number accounting for a certain ratio of the number of such points; and cash in the amount equivalent to the conversion value of shares of the Company corresponding to the number of remaining points after the conversion of the shares in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement.
Under the System, two types of trusts are created. One type is the trust which executes the granting or payment (the “Granting, etc.”) of shares of the Company and cash in the amount equivalent to the conversion value of the Company shares (the “Shares of the Company, etc.”) after the retirement of directors, etc. according to their respective job positions, and the other type is the trust which executes the Granting, etc. of the Shares of the Company, etc. after the end of the medium-term management plan period according to the extent to which performance targets of the medium-term management plan have been fulfilled.
Shares of the Company Residing in the Trust
Shares of the Company residing in the trust are recognized as treasury shares in equity at the carrying amounts in the trust. The carrying amounts of such treasury shares as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, were ¥1,042 million ($9,415 thousand) for 2,469 thousand shares and ¥1,107 million for 2,626 thousand shares, respectively.
(Application of the Consolidated Tax Payment System)
The Company and some consolidated subsidiaries have obtained approval from the Commissioner of the National Tax Agency for the application of the consolidated tax payment system from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. Accordingly, in the
(2)
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2021

current fiscal year, the Group has adopted the accounting treatments based on the consolidated tax payment system in accordance with the “Practical Solution on Tentative Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting Under Consolidated Taxation System (Part 1)” (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 5) and the “Practical Solution on Tentative Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting Under Consolidated Taxation System (Part 2)” (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 7).
(Adoption of the Tax Effect Accounting in Transition from the Consolidated Tax Payment System to the Group Tax Sharing System)
With respect to items in transition to the group tax sharing system established in the “Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 8 of 2020) and those for which the non-consolidated tax payment system has been reviewed in line with the transition to the group tax sharing system, The Company and some consolidated subsidiaries have not applied Paragraph 44 of the “Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Guidance No. 28) in accordance with Paragraph 3 of the “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Sharing System” (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 39) and recorded the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the provisions of the tax laws prior to the revision.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2021
The allowance for loan losses is not deducted from the amounts of loans shown in the above three paragraphs.
Contracts of overdraft facilities and loan commitment limits are contracts under which the Group lends to customers up to the prescribed limits in response to customer applications for loans as long as there is no violation of any condition in the contracts. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts of unused commitments were ¥ 2,589,410 million ($23,387,019 thousand) and ¥ 2,316,865 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts of unused commitments whose remaining contract terms were within one year were ¥ 1,395,214 million ($12,601,288 thousand) and¥ 1,474,309 million, respectively.
As many of these commitments expire without being drawn down, the unused amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement. Most of these contracts have conditions whereby the Group can refuse customer applications for loans or decrease the contract limits for certain reasons (e.g., changes in financial situation and deterioration in customers’ creditworthiness). At the inception of the contracts, the Group obtains real estate, securities, or other assets as collateral if considered to be necessary. Subsequently, the Group performs periodic reviews of the customers’ business results based on internal rules and takes necessary measures to reconsider conditions in the contracts and/or require additional collateral and guarantees.
Discounting bills are treated as secured lending transactions. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Group has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge bills discounted and foreign exchange bills bought, and their total face value was ¥27,538 million ($248,721 thousand) and ¥39,437 million, respectively.

Major consolidated subsidiaries have defined benefit corporate pension plans, lump-sum payment plans, and defined contribution pension plans for their employees. In addition, it is possible for major consolidated subsidiaries to pay additional retirement benefits.
Major consolidated subsidiaries contribute to a retirement benefit trust to fund defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump- sum payment plans.
Other consolidated subsidiaries have lump-sum payment plans, and some of these subsidiaries have defined contribution pension plans. These subsidiaries recorded their net defined benefit liability at the amount that would be required if employees retired at each balance sheet date (the “simplified method”).

Japanese banks are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”) and the Banking Act. The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:
a. Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the stockholders meeting. Additionally, for companies that meet certain criteria including (1) having a Board of Directors, (2) having independent auditors, (3) having an Audit & Supervisory Board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than the normal two-year term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria.
The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends-in-kind (noncash assets) to stockholders subject to certain limitations and additional requirements.
Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors if the articles of incorporation of the Company so stipulate. The Companies Act and the Banking Act provide certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares.
b. Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve, and Surplus
The Banking Act requires that an amount equal to 20% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the total of the aggregate amount of the legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 100% of capital stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal retained earnings may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that capital stock, legal retained earnings, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus, and other retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the stockholders.
c. Treasury Shares and Treasury Subscription Rights to Shares
The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury shares and dispose of such treasury shares by resolution of the Board of Directors. The amount of treasury shares purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the stockholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, subscription rights to shares are presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury subscription rights to shares and treasury shares. Such treasury subscription rights to shares are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from subscription rights to shares.

* HNB a consolidated subsidiary of the Company has decided to integrate, close and relocate its branches, and investment amounts for certain branches (land and buildings, etc.) are no longer expected to be recovered. As a result, impairment losses of ¥1,608 million ($14,528 thousand) were recognized for the current fiscal year due to the reduction of the carrying amount of the branches to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount was measured based on the net realizable value and was calculated by deducting estimated disposal costs from the appraised value based on the criteria for appraisal of real estates. The Higashi-Nippon Bank, Limited mainly groups its assets by branch, which is the smallest unit for management accounting.
A reconciliation between the normal effective statutory tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2020 and the actual effective tax rate reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income was not required under Japanese accounting standards due to immaterial differences.

27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
(1) Group Policies for Financial Instruments
The Group engages in banking as its mainstay business, as well as securities, leasing, conducting survey research and other information services, venture capital, and other financial service businesses. As the Group positions services exclusively for local small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals as its core business, it is a fundamental policy of the Group to aim to minimize any adverse effects of economic fluctuations and the changing market environment and to provide financial services reliably. Under this policy, the Group endeavors to maintain sound management by continuously identifying, assessing, monitoring, and controlling the various risks inherent in financial instruments that correspond to the strategic goals of the Company, including medium-term management plans and management policies.
(2) Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments
The financial assets of the Group, which mainly consist of loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and personal housing loans, are exposed to customer credit risk. Securities mainly consist of debt securities, equity securities, and investment trusts, and are accounted for as trading securities, held-to-maturity securities, and available-for-sale securities. These securities are exposed to issuers’ credit risk and the risk of market price fluctuations.
The financial liabilities of the Group are mainly personal deposits, which consist of liquidity deposits and fixed deposits. These deposits are exposed to liquidity risk, such as losses generated by unexpected withdrawals.
There are certain mismatches in interest rates and contract periods between financial assets, such as loans, and financial liabilities, such as deposits, that are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. However, a part of this risk is mitigated by using interest-rate swap derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to foreign exchange risk that affects those values with changes of foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses swaps, futures, forward and option contracts, and other similar types of contracts based on either interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or securities prices. These financial instruments are used in trading activities to generate trading revenues and fee income and are also used in Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) activities to control exposure to fluctuations in such market rates or prices.
The Group uses derivatives to provide customers with risk-hedging methods, to complement their ALM activities, to hedge market risks, and to strengthen earnings. The Group carefully studies the risks involved with derivative transactions and maintains a policy of limiting the volume of the risks within a range that it is capable of controlling based on its financial strength.
Derivatives used for hedging purposes are recorded on the basis of hedge accounting in accordance with the Japanese accounting standard for financial instruments. Such derivatives are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward exchange contracts that are utilized to control the risks from loans and bills discounted, bonds, foreign currency monetary claims and debt, and equity. The Group reviews the effectiveness of hedging activities using the methods permitted under the accounting standards.
Similar to other market transactions, derivative transactions are subject to a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity. Among those risks, the Group emphasizes establishing a risk management structure to understand and manage market risk and credit risk.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries hold lease receivables and installment receivables. These financial instruments are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates and credit risk.
(3) Risk Management for Financial Instruments
(a) Credit risk management
Under the consensus that credit risk is the risk with most influence on the Group’s financial stability, the Company has established a “Credit Policy” and takes every initiative to optimize its credit portfolio management and credit control of individual accounts.
In addition, the Company has developed an “Internal Credit Rating System” and a “Self-Assessment System” to categorize the credibility of debtors and individual loan projects from an independent point of view.
The Company monitors the credit risk management situation of the Group and the credit concentration risk of the whole our group. The Company provides guidance and advice as needed.
(b) Market risk management (foreign exchange risk and interest risk)
It is a fundamental policy of the Company to enter into market transactions that appropriately meet customers’ needs, which have been increasingly diversified due to the development of financial engineering (such as the emergence of various derivative transactions), as well as in transactions that enhance the profitability of the Group.

Management obtains the information related to the characteristic of the subsidiaries’ market risks for the risk evaluation and decision. Those actions are for monitoring whether the subsidiaries undertake appropriate risks with its financial strength and the returns are appropriate for those risks.
The status of compliance with various risk limits and profit and loss situation of the market business are directly reported to management on a daily basis. Those are based on the reports from the risk management post of the subsidiary. And those report the situation of the market risk in ALM and risk management meeting held every month.
Each bank of the Group separates the market operations into trading operations and banking operations. Each bank of the Group’s trading operations include profit-generating trading transactions that take advantage of short-term fluctuations and differences in value among markets in indices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and market quotations of financial instruments. The trading operations also deal with transactions for the purpose of mitigating possible losses incurred from the above-mentioned transactions. The financial instruments that are allowed to be dealt with in the trading operations include Japanese government bonds (“JGBs”), JGB futures, interest rate swaps, and interest rate futures. Operations other than trading operations are defined as banking operations. The trading operations are carried out in a rigid manner in compliance with each bank of the Group’s internal rules on definition of trading transactions, authorities for fair value calculation, and its methods.
The Group currently utilizes various effective measurement methods suitable for operational features and investment policies, in addition to Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) and Basis Point Value, to quantify market risk.
The Group performs quantitative analysis on market risks relating to all financial instruments in principle, using mainly VaR. In calculating VaR, the Company uses the historical simulation method (confidence interval: 99.9%, observation period: 1,250 days). As for holding periods, the Group has set 10 days for financial instruments for trading purposes and periods considered appropriate (primarily from one month to one year, based on the position settlement periods and other factors) for financial instruments for nontrading purposes (those for banking operations).
The aggregate amount of the market risks (estimated loss amount) of the Group’s trading business was ¥57 million ($522 thousand) and ¥24 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The aggregate amount of the market risks of the banking business, excluding market risks of unlisted equity securities and other financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably determined, stood at ¥242,625 million ($2,191,345 thousand) and ¥150,598 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020,respectively. It should be noted that the aggregate amounts of market risks represent a simple sum of amounts of each market risk categorized by risk type.
It should be noted that VaR measures the amount of market risk at certain probability levels statistically calculated based on historical market fluctuations, and therefore, there may be cases where market risks cannot be captured in such situations where market conditions are changing dramatically beyond what was experienced historically.
(c) Liquidity risk management
Managing liquidity risk is recognized as a top-priority issue for the Group. Each bank of the Group closely stipulates its internal regulations and the methods of liquidity risk management to be used in day-to-day operations, as well as appropriate countermeasures to be taken in case of concern or in critical situations regarding liquidity risk.
Risk supervisory department directly reports the status of compliance with various risk limits to management on a daily basis. Those are based on the reports from the risk management post of the subsidiaries. The situation of the liquidity risk and the situation of the fund raising are reported in ALM and risk management meeting held every month.
In case of concern or in critical situations related to liquidity risk for the subsidiary, the Company will take necessary actions for those issues. The crisis committee will order to set the task force in the subsidiary if the committee concludes it is necessary based on the reports from the subsidiary.
(4) Supplementary Explanation on Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments are based on their market prices and, in cases where market prices are not readily available, reasonably calculated prices. Such prices have been calculated using certain assumptions and these prices may differ if calculated based on different assumptions.
(5) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, other rational valuation techniques are used instead.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2021
For loans to customers deemed as “legal bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “possible bankruptcy,” an allowance for credit losses is provided based on the DCF method or based on amounts expected to be collected through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees. The book value, net of the reserve, as of the consolidated balance sheet date is a reasonable estimate of the fair values of those loans.
The book values of loans and bills discounted that do not have fixed maturities due to loan characteristics, such as limited loan amounts within the value of pledged assets, approximate fair value due to their expected repayment periods and interest rate conditions.
Liabilities
(1) Deposits and (2) Negotiable certificates of deposit
The fair values of demand deposits are recognized as payment at the date of the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows grouped by product and by the remaining duration at the rates that would be applied for similar new contracts. The book values of the deposits with maturities less than one year approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities.
(3) Call Money and Bills Sold and (4) Payables under securities lending transactions
The book values of call money and bills sold and payables under securities lending transactions approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(5) Borrowed Money
The book value of borrowed money with floating interest rates approximates fair value because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rate and the credit risks of the Group have not changed significantly after borrowing. The fair value of borrowed money with fixed interest rates is determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate that would be applied for similar new contracts. The book value of borrowed money with maturity of less than one year approximates fair value because of its short maturity period.
Derivatives
The fair values of derivative instruments are measured at the market price or determined using the discounted cash flow method or option-pricing model.

are presented net of assets and liabilities associated with derivative transactions.
*3 The Group has applied the “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Hedge Accounting for Financial Instruments that Reference LIBOR” (ASBJ
Practical Issues Task Force No. 40) to hedging relationships of financial instruments that reference LIBOR, such as deferred hedging through interest rate swap transactions that aim to reduce market fluctuation risk in available-for-sale securities (debt securities) and deferred hedging through currency swap transactions that aim to reduce foreign exchange fluctuation risk in monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with the “Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Accounting for Foreign Currency Transactions in Banking Industry” (the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA) Industry Audit Committee Report No.25).
Assets
(1) Cash and Due from Banks
The book values of due from banks with no maturities approximate fair value. For due from banks with maturities, the book values approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(2) Call Loans and Bills Bought
The book values of call loans and bills bought approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(3) Securities
The fair values of marketable equity securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for equity instruments. Fair values of bonds are measured at the reference statistical price of the Japan Securities Dealers Association or the quoted price obtained from financial institutions. Fair values of investment trusts are measured at the quoted price.
The fair values of private placements with floating interest rates approximate their book values as long as customers’ credit risks have not changed significantly after issuance because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rates. The fair values of private placements with fixed interest rates are determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate that consists of the risk-free rate and the credit risk premium that corresponds to the internal credit rating.
(4) Loans and Bills Discounted
The book values of loans and bills discounted with floating interest rates approximate fair value as long as customers’ credit risks have not changed significantly after lending because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rates.
The fair values of loans and bills discounted with fixed interest rates are mainly determined by discounting the future cash flows at rates that consist of the risk-free rate and the credit risk premium that corresponds to the internal credit rating. The book values of loans and bills discounted with maturities less than one year approximate fair value because of their short maturities.

        Under the ASBJ Statement No. 17, “Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” and ASBJ Guidance No. 20, “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” an entity is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available, and such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decisionmaker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
Segment information has been omitted because the Group operates in one segment, the banking business.
* The terms and conditions of transactions and policies of determining the terms and conditions are similar to general cases.

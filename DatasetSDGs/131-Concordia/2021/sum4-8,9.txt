Promotion of Financial Digitization (DX)
Business Strategy for Value Creation
We aim to diversify our services using digital technology by supplementing the needs for “things, people, and experiences” that are beyond financial needs, and by building a “regional ecosystem” to communicate with customers through connections “outside” of finance, including cashless and settlement services.
Improved operational efficiency through data linkage and
operations without handling cash
Data entered by customers on the AGENT in-store terminal is automatically linked to the business system through API integration. As a result, it is possible to reduce the processing time for operations and customer service that was formerly performed manually.
In addition, for procedures involving cash we are progressively installing “Quick Counter ATMs” at all branch counters, which allow customers to make their own deposits. Also, since April 2021, we have begun taking the processing of a wide variety of low-volume administrative work at all of our branches and consolidating it into the Business Support Office at the head office, and we are making steady progress in reducing workloads by promoting various measures to improve operational efficiency.

 Overview of Digital Strategy
To achieve “digital transformation” that can respond to the growth of the Internet economy by utilizing digital technologies such as data collaboration platforms, we will move forward to reform traditional business operations (digital transformation of business operations) and to take on the challenge of new business domains (digital transformation of business models) in order to transform ourselves into a more convenient bank.

 Digital Transformation of Operations
Business process improvement
Based on the “operational reforms using digital technology” set forth in the medium-term management plan, we are promoting fundamental reforms in branch administration (branch operation reforms). As a result, branches will be transformed into “places where customers can consult”, while at the same time we will reduce costs by improving operational efficiency through data linkage and operations without handling cash.
Turning branches into a place for consultation
The Bank of Yokohama has been introducing AGENT and completed the roll out to all branches in December 2020. By enabling customers to complete various transactions, such as opening a savings account or changing the items they have registered, using tablet terminals installed in the lobby,
we have made each procedure paperless, shortened the waiting time for customers, and made the process stress-free. In October 2020, we added transactions such as bankcard applications and inheritance reception. By progressively expanding the range of transactions in the future, we will make it possible for customers to complete all transactions on their own using tablet terminals, turning the counters into a “place for consultation” for asset management, inheritance, etc.
The Marketing Strategy Office, which was established within the Digital Strategy Department, is proactively involved in all promotional plans that come into contact with customers, and the marketing department takes the lead in promoting sales measures. We are also promoting initiatives that leverage the added value of data through finely-tuned communication based on analysis of customer behavioral data, such as using cutting-edge machine learning technology, to approach new customers with latent needs, and we are steadily achieving results.

In addition to promoting Tsumitate-NISA to clients who participated in asset formation seminars, we contribute to improving the performance of Tsumitate-NISA through communication by flexibly reviewing the content of the promotion based on client responses.

Introduction of online management support platform
In June 2020, the Bank of Yokohama launched the Bank of Yokohama Big Advance, an online management support platform that supports the expansion of sales channels via the Internet in an environment where non-face-to-face communication is required as a measure against infectious diseases. Higashi-Nippon Bank also offers the “Higashi-Nippon Big Advance”, and the Group is working together to support the expansion of customer transactions.

  Creation of new businesses and innovation
Digitization supportThe Bank of Yokohama has newly assigned a “Digital Advisor” within the Digital Strategy Department to propose optimal solutions to companies. The Digital Advisor will visit companies directly in collaboration with branch offices to identify digitization needs and provide solutions. In collaboration with the Bank of Yokohama Group’s think tank, the Hamagin Research Institute, and external specialist companies, we help our clients create new businesses and innovations by providing a wide range of consulting services, including business process improvement, support for the introduction of telework, data aggregation and analysis for the purpose of sales expansion, and introductions to IT personnel.
Linkage between HamaPay and Kotora will ensure interoperability, improve customer convenience, and further promote cashless transactions.
Hamagin App
Against the backdrop of the growing cashless society, mobile apps have grown to become the most important channel, used by more than 500,000 people. In December 2020, the Hamagin App was renewed, and in addition to the existing balance inquiry function, many functions were added, such as transfers and pay-easy, making the app more convenient for customers to use. We will continue to evolve it into an “app that is close to customers’ lives”, that is convenient and reliable anytime, anywhere with a smartphone, without having to go to a bank or ATM.

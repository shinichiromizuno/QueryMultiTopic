In addition to supporting the SDGs management of local companies, we are working to support the enhancement of corporate value through the resolution of customer issues, including support for digitization and equity financing, with an eye towards the post-pandemic situation.
Support for SDGs management in local companies
Launched SDGs sustainability linked loans and other products
As a long-term KPI for sustainability, the Group has set a target of executing a cumulative ¥2 trillion in sustainable finance from FY2019 to FY2030.
In April 2021, the Bank of Yokohama launched the “SDGs Sustainability Linked Loan”, which offers interest rate reductions and other incentives based on the degree of achievement of ESG targets, and the “SDGs Green Loan/Social Loan”, which limits the use of funds to eligible projects based on various principles for environmental improvement (green) and social problem solving (social), in order to support the SDGs management of local companies. Both products will be evaluated by an external organization (third-party evaluation) to ensure that the loans comply with the various standards published by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) and other organizations, allowing companies to appeal to investors and other parties regarding their commitment to the SDGs through financing with this product.
Collaboration with local governments
The Bank of Yokohama promotes SDGs in the region in cooperation with local governments in Kanagawa Prefecture and Yokohama City, which have been selected as SDGs future cities. In December 2018, we signed a partnership agreement with Kanagawa Prefecture to promote the SDGs, and we are implementing a variety of joint measures, including holding SDGs seminars for small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, we dispatched a bank employee to the expert committee for the “Y-SDGs” certification system of the City of Yokohama to participate in discussions on the operation of the system.
Hamagin Research Institute, a Group company, regularly provides information on the SDGs to its member companies, and has been entrusted with the “SME Support Services” launched by Kanagawa Prefecture to support the SDGs initiatives of SMEs. They are working to promote SDGs management among local companies by supporting the formulation of business plans that incorporate the SDGs, including SDGs for SMEs.
Support for post-pandemic initiatives
Online consultation and digitization support
The Bank of Yokohama has held online consultation meetings to match customers who have business issues that have become apparent as a result of the pandemic to businesses that can provide solutions.
In addition, we have appointed “Digital Advisors” within the Digital Strategy Department to support the digitization of companies, in collaboration with the Bank of Yokohama Group’s Hamagin Research Institute and external specialist companies.
Expansion of non-face-to-face services
The Bank of Yokohama is expanding its non-face-to-face services through “Hamagin Business Connect”, a portal site for corporate members. This service allows the details of deposits and other transactions to be checked, including those with other banks, and to complete a variety of transactions on the Internet, such as loans within the limit of an overdraft facility, recommendation-based loans, and business matching.
Support through equity finance
The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank provide capital loans, in which borrowings can be regarded as equity for the purpose of credit screening, as a means of providing relief from damage to equity capital caused by temporary losses due to the effects of the novel coronavirus.
The Bank of Yokohama provides a syndicated loan scheme using the “New Coronavirus Measures Capital Subordinated Loan” of Japan Finance Corporation (JFC). In addition to supporting the formulation of management and financing plans for businesses, JFC provides capital funds to turn around deteriorating financial conditions, and the Bank of Yokohama provides senior loans in a coordinated manner.
Supporting Customers’ Overseas Business
Concordia Financial Group supports the diversified overseas businesses of its customers, including overseas expansion, overseas sales channel expansion, and business acquisitions, by leveraging the overseas offices of the Bank of Yokohama and the overseas bank networks affiliated with the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank.
In Southeast Asia, we are expanding our client support network by opening a branch in Singapore and investing in Bank Resona Purdania in Indonesia. We are also working with Chiba Bank, with which we have a business alliance, to provide financial cooperation through their overseas offices.
We aim to grow overseas business income by accumulating overseas assets through support for corporate business growth and increased investment capabilities. We plan to expand our overseas assets to over 400 billion yen by FY2021 by extending cross-border loans from Japan (*), expanding our overseas network to facilitate lending to customers’ local entities, and collaborating with other regional financial institutions.
(*) This is a method of direct financing from Japan to a customer’s local entity overseas.

 Top Management Commitments
The Concordia Financial Group was inaugurated four years ago. In the meantime, major changes have occurred in the structure of society.
What is the direction of the regional bank group’s management in the midst of rough seas?
Yasutoshi Oya, who took over as Concordia’s president in April, shared his thoughts.
Accelerate our efforts to be a company that serves our customers
First of all, let me ask you about your perception of the environment of regional banks and the Concordia Financial Group. This year in particular, the spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on society as a whole.
I would ask that we all look beyond COVID-19.
 The scope of the COVID-19 problem is very significant, with global demand disappearing and supply chains vanishing, and the impact is not limited to Japan. We recognize that the impact on our business partners, and the impact on the local economy, are also very significant and unprecedented.
In this context, as a regional financial institution, we need to focus not only on providing immediate cash flow support
to our customers, but also on rebuilding damaged demand and supply chains and on consulting for digitization. After conquering COVID-19, the community must not go back to what it was before. Positive changes are required and I believe that we have a very important role to play in this process.
We have been working on a new medium-term management plan since last year.
Given the impact of COVID-19, do you think our long-term management strategy and goals will change?
 The Concordia Financial Group
President and Representative Director Yasuyoshi Oya
 Circulate the growth of local communities and improvement in our own corporate value in a sustainable manner
Over the past few years, due in part to changes in the social structure, the mission of regional banks has been emphasized as a way to contribute to the community.
 In the days when both deposits and loans grew steadily, the bank and the community may have grown naturally and everyone could enjoy some share of the profits, but in an age of negative growth, population decline, and a surplus of capital, this is not possible.
The development of a region creates a demand for capital, which in turn creates employment opportunities and various economic activities, and as the region grows, the bank grows in a sustainable manner. Our goal is to become a
company needed by local customers and useful to the local community, thereby creating a sustainable cycle of growth for the community and increased corporate value.
It is true that Kanagawa Prefecture, where we are based, is often seen as a more favorable area than other prefectures. However, it is also a highly competitive region and the solutions required are of a considerably higher level. We must hone our capacity for proposals and increase the value we can provide.
CONCORDIA Financial Group 10
The axis of our strategy, or what we are aiming for, has not changed at all. Our goal is to be a company that is useful to our customers. With the advent of the corona virus crisis, I feel strongly that we must become even more useful and indispensable to our customers and local communities as a regional financial institution.
Even before COVID-19, the environment around us had already changed dramatically. There are challenges in various areas of the SDGs, including a low birthrate and an aging population, corporate cash surpluses, and environmental issues. Digitization is also progressing rapidly. Against this backdrop, I think the most important thing for a bank to do is to make sure that it is providing useful services to its customers as the starting point. We need to accelerate our progress toward becoming a company that is truly useful to everyone in the community.
This requires a wide range of specialized solutions to solve customer issues and local issues.
Although we have traditionally focused on plain senior loans, there is still room for us to improve our solutions to meet the various needs of our customers, whether it be liquidity needs or capital needs. In addition, we will provide a yet higher level of consulting services to help our clients grow and increase their corporate value.
Furthermore, with the accelerating trend toward digitization, we need to expand the range of our solutions to include new areas, such as support for customers in the IT field, how to change business models in the digital age, and how to provide appropriate specialized and managerial human resources.

Growth Strategies for Value Creation
 Where do you think the biggest changes are needed relative to what you have been doing as a banking business?
A key phrase is ‘helping our customers’, and we should stop thinking about sales and operational efficiency just from the bank’s benefit. We are committed to thinking of everything from the customer perspective.
For example, the Group is in the process of closing and consolidating branches and reviewing its administrative operations, but we are thinking in terms of customers, not the benefit of the bank. Customers visiting the counter are required to apply identity seals, fill in pages of documents, and do clerical work that is all for the convenience of the bank. We must eliminate this. We would like to change our administrative processes to work from the customer’s perspective and to become the most user-friendly, convenient bank in Japan. The result will be a change in the way branches are run, and in turn,
they can be lighter and more integrated. I think it’s very important to take the customer perspective as a starting point for reforming branch channels and administrative processes.
In fact, a variety of services are already available through online banking and smartphone apps, such as changing your address and opening an account with Investment Trusts. However, inadequate PR means that customers may not have heard about these. How are we going to make breakthroughs there as well? With the help of digital technology, we will pursue products and services that are truly valued by our customers. We want the branch to be a hub for advice on matters such as inheritance and estate management when customers are really facing problems.
We’ve made some progress in deepening our core businesses.
Next, how do you feel about the progress of the medium-term management plan at the end of the first year? Also, what are the challenges for the second year and beyond?
 The medium-term plan lists three basic policies as major topics. The first is Deepening Our Core Businesses. We are raising our capacity for solutions. We have made considerable progress in building a framework to provide better services to our customers by increasing our corporate value through investments and alliances with other financial institutions and entities that have functions that we lack. Asset growth and profitability have also increased in each of these areas
compared to the previous medium-term period. We have made some progress in terms of deepening our core businesses.
The second topic, Improving Productivity through Structural Reform, has been thoroughly discussed over the past year. We are at an advanced stage with reforms aimed at increasing the sophistication of our solutions and we have developed plans for reforms in our sales system, branches and channels, personnel system, and administrative processes.
11 CONCORDIA Financial Group
 There is much work to be done to reform administrative and business processes from the customer’s perspective. We’ve been working on a number of points in response to the COVID-19 voluntary lockdown, but there are still many areas we can change so that further visits to the bank are not required to complete processes. This is currently the most requested issue.
For the third topic, Strengthening the Management Base, we will start personnel system reforms this year with the creation of a strong organization. How do we motivate our employees? The
1. 2. 3.
bank’s assets are its customers and its employees, and as such, we aim to manage our business in a way that values people.
We make the work interesting and change it from a job that you are forced to do into a job that you want to do. Employees who can improve their skills, be appreciated by customers, increase their motivation, and realize a yet higher level of advanced skill. I would like to make the bank a place that attracts large numbers of such people.

uPage 47 - Management base for growth
 Three basic policies presented in the medium-term management plan
 How is the strategic investment plan for new areas progressing?
The aim of this is also the Deepening of Core Businesses. Up till now, the main use of capital has been as a risk-weighted asset for senior loans and the like. However as we are changing our direction to become more about solutions than about asset accumulation, it is important to know how to improve functionality. There are investment, partnership, and the hiring of professional personnel. Strategic investment is one of the many ways to improve capacity to offer solutions that are the value of a bank.
The area for investment is enhancement of our capacity for
solutions, that is, deepening our current core businesses. We will further enrich our areas of expertise.
And overseas too. Up till now, our overseas business was limited to customer support, but how should we hold overseas assets in the sense of diversifying our operations? We are working on this while considering liquidity and profitability.
And, again, the digital field. How to achieve a digital transformation? Investing in a fintech company may be an example. If an opportunity arises, I’d like to focus on those features and enhance them.

Growth Strategies for Value Creation
 Human resource development is the foundation for improving solution capabilities.
In order to provide even more advanced services in response to customer needs and changes in society, will the image of what is desired from bank personnel change?
 Yes, that’s right. One important measure is human resource development. We are able to communicate well with our customers and draw out their needs and challenges. And we can provide advice that meets the needs of our customers with a range of specialized knowledge and expertise. We need to develop such people.
Also, the nature of the business branch will change. We will use digitization to make our existing systems more and more efficient, and we will use the time freed up in this way to focus on areas that our customers really think are problematic, such as inheritance advice and estate management for people with dementia concerns.
It is difficult to build up a highly specialized workforce.
Last year, we introduced a Professional Human Resources System. This system rewards people in their field of expertise to some extent. Those with specialized knowledge and experience can be compensated above the level of a department manager. For the time being, we will have to rely on outside experts in specialized fields, so our aim is to make it easier to attract people. I hope that more and more regular employees will also be eligible.
That’s why we’ve been focusing on career change training since the previous fiscal year. For example, those in charge of internal clerical matters will be challenged to provide asset management counseling services, those with only experience in asset management counseling will be able to learn about loans and expand the range of services they can provide, and sales representatives dealing with individuals will also be able to make proposals for corporations. In addition to simple training, we will ensure that our employees have opportunities to interact with experts from outside the bank, such as from universities, research institutes, and consulting firms, and tax accountants and other professionals in order to improve their skills.
For the IT, investment banking, market, and overseas departments, we have already hired more professional personnel in mid-career in the previous year alone than in the three years of the previous medium-term plan. Originally, the Bank of Yokohama had an active mid-career hiring program. Currently about 12% of the total workforce is mid-career hires. We will continue to accelerate the use of professional staff and improve the quality of our regular employees.
Demonstrating our strength as an urban regional bank
What are your thoughts on Concordia’s metropolitan area strategy as a uniquely urban regional bank? Please also tell us about the division of roles between the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank.
 I have often been asked what are the Bank of Yokohama’s strengths compared to other regional banks? Of course, we have the advantage of building a customer base in the very profitable market of Kanagawa Prefecture, but the depth of our relationships with listed companies in Tokyo is also one of our overwhelming strengths, even among regional banks. We do business with about 800 listed companies, including those with which we do not have financing transactions. A quarter of these businesses have the Bank of Yokohama as their core bank. The concerns of listed companies with regard to financing, such as capital policies, stock prices, equity securities held (market value), parent-subsidiary listing issues, and business succession, are very much in focus right now, and providing solutions to these concerns is a very rewarding job. The know-
how and services that we have developed through our relationships with listed companies in the process of upgrading our corporate solutions business are very promising as items that we can offer to unlisted companies and small and medium- sized enterprises. We believe that we have a level of expertise that no other bank can offer.
With regard to personal transactions, Kanagawa and Tokyo are markets with high asset values. People with financial and real estate assets want asset or tax consulting and solutions for their inheritance and asset succession concerns. There are many business opportunities, but the solutions required are also very sophisticated, so this is an area where we want to continue to improve to become a dominant presence.
13 CONCORDIA Financial Group
 Higashi-Nippon Bank, on the other hand, focuses on sales to small and medium-sized businesses, mainly in Tokyo. We have many long-term customers, but until now, our business has been more focused on financing. In addition, the major issue is how to provide solutions. We are currently strengthening these capabilities. Building on these efforts will assist us in winning the trust of our customers.
In order to do so, it is important to develop personnel. We have entered a phase of increasing our organizational strength and motivating all our employees. Helping companies grow by providing them solutions is a very rewarding job to. The accumulation of this work will lead to the growth of Higashi- Nippon Bank. We have a strong customer base in Tokyo and I am confident that we will be able to make our presence felt.
You entered into a business partnership with Chiba Bank in July 2019. What was your aim?
Chiba Bank and the Bank of Yokohama have very similar business models as banks located in the same metropolitan area. On the other hand, we do not compete at all. There is little overlap between our branch network and our international offices. While our business models are similar, we do not compete with ecah other, which makes it easy for us to
collaborate and cooperate with each other. As we each further refine our solutions business to meet the diverse challenges of our customers, we can collaborate with each other and gradually fill in the missing parts of our solution capabilities to increase their sophistication. On the finance side of things, I think it’s easier to share because we’re on the same page.
To be a bank indispensable to the community for the next 100 years. Finally, what are your ambitions as President of the Financial Group?
At the moment, we are placing the highest priority on responding to customers affected by COVID-19, but through a series of operational reforms, we will continue to deepen our solutions business, which is useful to our customers. We want to create a group brand that says ‘convenience in banking’. I know that it is difficult to be the bank with the ‘easiest banking in Japan’, but that is the kind of motivation I want to use to reform our business. I want all employees to be aware that they must change things, that they must change themselves, and that it is okay to change, and I want to make sure that they are aware of the need to change for the sake of our customers.
Thanks to you, the Bank of Yokohama will be celebrating its 100th anniversary in December 2020. Higashi-Nippon Bank will also be celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2024. We would not be where we are today without the support of our customers, local communities and shareholders over the years.
We have built up a firm customer base through years of trust from our customers, an invaluable asset and a great strength of our company. With an awareness of the weight of our history, we will continue to innovate without fear of change so that we can continue to be the bank of choice and be trusted for the next 100 years.
We look forward to your continued support and patronage.

Growth Strategies for Value Creation
  While building a strong financial base that supports the regional economy, through strategic investment, we will take on the challenge of new business
areas and increase our corporate value.
Financial Targets and Progress of the Medium-Term
Management Plan
Our medium-term management plan spanning the three years from FY 2019 to FY 2021 includes the following four numerical targets for both the fi- nal year of the plan in FY 2021 and the long-term.
Even in the continuing low-interest rate environment, we plan to maintain our level of gross operating income RORA, an indicator of earnings compared to risk assets, through enhanced solutions sales and appropriate risk-taking, and to leverage structural reform-driven productivity gains to improve OHR, an indicator of efficiency, and to boost ROE, an indicator of earnings compared to shareholder equity. Furthermore, our capital policy aims to maintain financial health and improve capital efficiency, balancing investment for growth with
shareholder returns while keeping the CET1 capital ratio at an appropriate level.
This will be achieved by strengthening and enhancing core businesses, such as by upgrading solutions sales, and by improving productivity through structural reforms such as operational reforms using digital technology.
We will also actively pursue new business fields using strategic investment and financing in an effort to drive further profit growth.

  Results for FY 2019
Looking back at the Japanese economy in FY 2019, in the first half of the year, the economy maintained a moderate recovery trend as domestic demand remained strong while exports were weak. However, in the second half of the fiscal year, the economic downturn became clearer as exports remained sluggish, while the increase in the consumption tax rate and the spread of COVID-19 caused personal consumption and exports to remain sluggish and corporate production activities to decline.
In this environment, the Group’s deposits increased 2 8 8.2 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 16.2336 trillion yen, and loans increased by 406.3 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year to 13.0683 trillion yen, steadily expanding the management base. On the other hand, consolidated ordinary income decreased by 0.2 billion yen year-on-year to 306.2 billion yen due to a decrease in
Basic Policy of Medium-Term Management Plan
1. Strengthen and enhance core businesses
In Kanagawa, where we have an overwhelmingly large customer base, and Tokyo, which is a huge market, we will work to upgrade solutions sales based on sales strategies tailored to the characteristics of each region, while at the same time supporting the growth of our business partners and expanding our overseas business.
In light of the widening of the deposit-loan gap and the continuing low interest rate environment, we will diversify our fund management activities by enhancing diversified investment and expanding the scope of our investments to ensure stable income income and to improve valuation gains under appropriate risk management.
2. Productivity improvement through structural reform
In order to further strengthen efficient management, one of the strengths of the Group, and to improve productivity in existing banking operations, we will undertake structural reforms centered on reform of operations using digital technology, reform of branch channels, and improvement in the efficiency of business operation systems.
3. Strengthen the management base
To transform ourselves into a ‘new financial services company surpassing conventional banks’, we will leverage strategic investments and financing to take on the challenge of new business areas, while proactively working to build a strong organization and human resources to support sustainable growth and to achieve SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).
Using the Risk Appetite Framework, we will continue to maintain a balance of shareholder returns through a capital policy that combines soundness and capital efficiency.

With a CET1 ratio of 12.27% and a total equity ratio of 13.28%, we continue to utilize the risk appetite framework to secure a sufficient capital level for future risks.
For credit-related costs such as provision for loan losses, strict provisions were made in consideration of the impact of the spread of COVID-19 and Higashi-Nippon Bank began stricter self-assessment of operations. This resulted in an increase of 15.3 billion yen over the previous year. In planning for FY 2020 too, we are incorporating the impact of COVID-19.

Capital policy
The company’s CET1 capital ratio was 12.27% as of March 2020. This is sufficiently above the level required under a stress test that assumes a crisis on the scale of the Lehman Brothers collapse.
We will use our Risk Appetite Framework and a capital policy that aims to both maintain financial health and to improve capital efficiency in order to continue delivering balanced shareholder returns while increasing risk assets and strategic investment for growth.
We need to further increase the efficiency of capital management in order to push forward with fundamental structural reforms while improving corporate value by using strategic investment and financing to aggressively enter new business fields. With this in mind, we plan to keep the CET1 ratio at around 12% during the term of the medium-term plan, aiming for around 11.5% over the longer term.
Capital allocation during the term of the medium-term plan
Returns to shareholders
Our shareholder returns policy strives to meet the expectations of long-term and retail investors. We aim to increase the dividend while maintaining its stability.
In FY 2019 we paid an annual ordinary dividend of 16 yen. Combined with a share buyback of 10 billion yen, the total return ratio was 63%. For FY 2020, the Company plans to pay a dividend of 17 yen per share, in addition to a commemorative dividend of 1 yen to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Bank of Yokohama. We will continue to repurchase company stock in a flexible manner, taking into account market trends and earnings prospects in accordance with our policy of shareholder returns.
The regional economy has been severely affected by the spread of COVID-19. As a financial institution that supports the community, we will build a strong financial base and increase our corporate value by balancing strategic investments, capital investments, and returns to shareholders.

    Strategic Shareholdings Policy
The Group has a cross shareholding policy of reducing the cross shareholdings, taking into account the cost of capital and the impact of share price volatility risk on equity capital.
Our holdings in each company are periodically reviewed individually at the directors’ meeting for economic rationality in terms of their contribution to the development of the region, the strengthening of long-term and stable business relationships, and the risk/reward in terms of the cost of capital. To ensure economic rationality, we have established thresholds for RORA and return on capital employed that are aligned with our return on equity (ROE) targets.

The Bank of Yokohama and Chiba Bank, both based in the Tokyo metropolitan area, will work together to provide customers with high value-added services and products.
Purpose of the alliance
Amidst majorchanges in the business environment, including an aging population, a low birthrate, and prolonged negative interest rates, Chiba Bank and the Bank of Yokohama, both based in the Tokyo metropolitan area, signed a business alliance, the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership, in July 2019 with the aim of achieving sustainable growth and increasedcorporate value for both companies through collaboration and pooling of know-how.
Desired effects
Measures will be implemented mainly in the sales departments of the two banks and collaboration is expected to have an effect of approximately 20 billion yen in the first five years of the project.
 The Bank of Yokohama has approximately 1 8 0 branches in Kanagawa
Prefecture, with a loan market share of over 35% in the prefecture, and has Kanagawa Prefecture built a solid business base and is strengthening its operations closely linked (%)
with the region through its Regional Headquarters System, which places
general managers in each district and region.
From August 2020, we are integrating branches located close to each other
into a single Sales Department to shareknowledge and expertise on high

In addition to continuing to deploy the solutions sales know-how cultivated in Kanagawa Prefecture to small and midsizecompanies in Tokyo, we will also expand businessfor asset owners, including the effective use of realestate. In addition, we will work with our partner Chiba Bank to build a corporate support system that rivals that of the megabanks in Tokyo, including syndicated loans to large and medium-sized companies in the metropolitan area.

  Vision
In Kanagawa and Tokyo, where Corporate customers are at various stages of growth, we will contribute in the development of our customers’ businesses as an indispensable financial group in the region by providing optimal solutions through business evaluation, leveraging the customer base built up over the years.
Medium-Term Management Plan Strategy
We will assist with financing and strengthen our Group-wide solutions provision system. In addition to establishing and strengthening direct sales functions from headquarters to customers, we established the Solutions Sales Department in April 2019 at the headquarters of the Bank of Yokohama to team up with corporations and individuals to solve customer problems. Higashi- Nippon Bank is also increasing the number of solution sales staff at its headquarters.
We are also providing new solutions such as personnel placement as well as developing Internet services for corporations with work area consultation and information provision functions.
 Increased Sophistication and Diversification of Solution Sales
We contribute to the revitalization and healthy development of the local economy by supporting the growth and revitalization of local small and medium-sized enterprises and by helping to increase the corporate value of core companies in the region.
Startup Growth Maturity Transformation
In addition to ordinary loans, we also provide capital loans, which are long-term stable funds, and funds in cooperation with Yokohama Capital (a subsidiary of the Bank of Yokohama) and external institutions to provide a variety of funding options, as well as propose appropriate solutions to support corporate growth.
     Objectives of the Medium-Term Management Plan and Solution Delivery System
In addition to making the most of the functions of the Group’s companies, we are also expanding the appointment of professional personnel and partnerships with outside experts. In addition, our branch managers are strengthening top sales.

Expanded Partnerships
As a regional financial institution, we actively support local companies in their efforts to promote SDGs management and to help build a sustainable society through their core businesses.
The Bank of Yokohama promotes SDGs in the region in cooperation with local governments in Kanagawa Prefecture and Yokohama City, both of which have been selected as SDGs future cities. In December 2018, we signed a partnership agreement with Kanagawa Prefecture to promote the SDGs, and we are implementing a variety of joint measures, including holding SDGs seminars for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In addition, we offer the SDGs Friends Loan, a program that enables small and medium-sized business owners to identify the relevance of their management philosophies and plans to the SDGs goals, the actions they will take to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs through their businesses, and the impact they will have on society, through dialogue with corporate managers. Approximately 1,800 companies (as of March 31, 2020) have used the service since it was launched in October 2019.
The Hamagin Research Institute, one of our group companies, regularly introduces SDGs management in a booklet issued to its member companies and holds SDGs seminars, inviting experts to speak to promote the penetration of the SDGs in the community.

  COVID-19-related support
for companies
To support customers suffering losses through, or affected by, COVID-19, we are implementing a range of measures not only to provide financing support but also capital support and core business support with an eye on post- COVID scenarios to meet customer needs and problems.
Rapid Cash-Flow Support
In principle, the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank remain open at all branches in principle, even during the state of emergency, and have established a dedicated service desk and toll-free number for consultation on new loans, changes in terms and conditions, and other matters related to cash-flow.
The Bank of Yokohama is working to provide quick and detailed cash-flow support through the COVID-19 Emergency Fund, a proprietary loan that partially expands the decision-making authority of branch managers. For our large corporate customers, we work closely with the Chiba Bank, signatory to the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership Agreement, to quickly syndicate loans and provide funds.
Higashi-Nippon Bank supports customers’ cash flow stabilization with a special loan fund that utilizes the Bank of Japan’s ‘Special Operations for Corporate Financial Assistance for COVID-19’.
Cooperation with Local Governments and Credit Guarantee Associations
In cooperation with local governments and credit guarantee associations, we are actively involved in institutional financing, including essentially interest-free loans. At the Bank of Yokohama, we have established a one-stop system through which customers can apply for loans as well as request certifications and guarantees from credit guarantee associations. These operations are carried out by local governments through the bank. We also dispatch bank staff to credit guarantee associations and support the digitization of guarantee operations to ensure a speedy supply of funds.
Equity Finance
The Bank of Yokohama has established a crisis response framework for the Business Equity Loan, a capital loan that enables borrowed money to be treated as capital for credit examination in response to losses in equity capital due to temporary deficits resulting from the effects of COVID-19. In addition to improving balance sheets by capitalizing loans, the Bank has extended the maximum repayment period from 10 to 15 years for lump-sum repayment, providing customers with longer-term, stable funding.
We also provide capital support to meet the various needs of our customers, such as arranging hybrid loans where credit rating agencies evaluate a certain percentage of the funding amount as capital.
Issue of Subordinate Corporate Bonds
The Company will issue unsecured corporate bonds (subordinated corporate bonds) with a prepayment clause in the form of a public offering that limits the use of funds to provide cash flow support to customers affected by COVID-19. Funds raised by subordinated bonds will be provided as a subordinated loan to the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank and will be used to provide loans to customers affected by COVID-19 to support their cash flow.
Supporting Customers’ Overseas Business
Within the context of diversification of customers’ overseas business, we are utilizing Bank of Yokohama overseas offices, and overseas bank networks provided by the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank, to support overseas expansion, expansion of overseas sales channels, inbound response support, etc.
In Asia, we have further expanded our network supporting trading partners through our investment in Bank Resona Perdania in Indonesia.
We have also begun to provide financial support to our customers through our overseas offices and those of Chiba Bank, our partner in the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership.
  We aim to grow overseas business income by accumulating
overseas assets through support for corporate business growth
and increased investment capabilities. We plan to roughly double
our overseas assets to over 400 billion yen by FY 2021 by
extending cross-border loans from Japan(*), expanding our
overseas network to facilitate lending to customers’ local entities,
and collaborating with other regional financial institutions.
(*) This is a method of direct financing from Japan to a customer’s local entity overseas.

  Wealth building support
The iDeCo personal defined contribution pension plan and the Tsumitate NISA small investment tax exemption are available to support asset formation through mid- to long-term accumulation. We also offer a Junior NISA, a children’s version that allows legal representatives (e.g. persons with parental authority) to manage assets on behalf of their children and grandchildren until they reach the age of 20.
Supporting greater financial literacy and children’s growth
Economic and financial education
Spreading and improving financial literacy is the core business of regional financial institutions. We are working to nurture the children who will be both the future of the region and to further revitalize the region.
The Bank of Yokohama offers on-site classes and hands-on banking experience through its Hamagin Okane no Kyoshitsu [Hamagin Money Classroom] financial education program, as well as information on Tsumitate NISA and iDeCo which provide for asset formation through mid to long-term accumulation, and through occupational seminars. We held approximately 1,400 seminars in FY 2019.
In June 2020, we published the SDGs for Beginners booklet to help local children learn the basics of the SDGs and are promoting its use in financial education and other settings.

Club Anchor
The Bank of Yokohama is pleased to announce Club Anchor, a free membership service for customers 55 years and older. We believe that in order to live a long, fulfilling life, it is important to strike a balance between purpose in life, health, and money. That is why we provide a variety of information on financial services, nursing care, and inheritance.
In addition, we have set up a dedicated web-based Nursing Care Consultation Service in partnership with local nursing care providers, and our experts respond to your inquiries via e-mail.
Entry into trust business
The Bank of Yokohama handles trust services to meet the financial asset management and succession needs of individual customers.
The Hamagin Okane Trust, a monetary trust based substituting for a will, can meet two needs - that of asset succession, where money received from the customer is delivered in a lump sum to a second beneficiary designated in advance (the beneficiary) upon inheritance, and that of needs for asset administration, where the payment and use of the trust assets are entrusted to a person other than the customer (the beneficiary’s agent) if the customer becomes incapable of making decisions etc.
Support for Issues of Daily Life
The Bank of Yokohama provides Hamagin’s Eraberu Seikatsu Support, a service that introduces customers to partner businesses operating in the community to meet the needs of daily life, including nursing care facilities and renovations, home security, and monitoring services.
Special discounts, cash-back, and other benefits can be received by applying for services from a partner company via the dedicated page on the Yokohama Bank website. By helping to match the needs of customers with local businesses, we are also helping revitalize the region.

           Dealing with Dementia Issues
 Support for use of the guardianship system
The Bank of Yokohama introduces you to affiliated trust companies if you wish to use the Adult Guardianship System, which is designed to help you manage your property and receive support in day-to-day living should your decision- making ability deteriorate in the future.
In addition, we offer Support for Guardianship System Deposits, which are designed to more safely protect the assets of customers (wards) already using the guardianship system. Separate management of funds not intended for daily use and a directive issued by the family court for all transactions, such as opening accounts, withdrawals, and cancellations, will be required, so the ward’s assets can be properly managed.
 Placement of Dementia Supporters at all branches
 The Bank of Yokohama has around 2,400 employees who are ‘dementia supporters’ and are ready to help those with dementia and their families when the need arises. Dementia supporter training courses on symptoms of dementia, support methods, attitudes etc. are conducted for employees by instructors from staff of the Regional Comprehensive Support Center, and employees with correct knowledge and understanding are placed in all sales offices throughout Japan.
In addition, each branch is working to improve services for customers who do not have adequate decision-making abilities by collaborating with community comprehensive support centers.
 Dementia Insurance
 The Bank of Yokohama offers dementia insurance products. In addition to preparing for the expenses that arise when a person is diagnosed with dementia and requires treatment or needs nursing care, adding the Special Clause for Designated Representative Claims allows a family member designated in advance to claim the benefits on behalf of the insured person should the insured person become unable to claim benefits due to dementia etc.
 The Bank of Yokohama offers essentially interest-free education loans for trouble-free educational funding to families affected by COVID-19. Those who live in Kanagawa Prefecture and have children enrolled in educational institutions such as universities and vocational schools can receive interest subsidies of up to 1.70% per year for the entire borrowing period from Kanagawa Prefecture.
Preparation for Natural Disasters
The Bank of Yokohama offers Disaster Support Mortgages that can reduce the burden of repayment in the event of a natural disaster.
In recent years, due to the earthquake and tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the occurrence of typhoons and torrential rains including Typhoons No. 15 and No. 19 in 2019, customers have become increasingly concerned about natural disasters. This product can cover risks that are not covered by conventional insurance policies.

 Revitalizing the Regional Economy
Vision
By working to solve local problems and contributing to the sustainable development of the region, we will continue to develop as a company based on regional growth.
The Bank of Yokohama celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2020 and Higashi-Nippon Bank does so in 2024. We will continue to work hard to be an indispensable financial institution to our community for the next 100 years.
Medium-Term Management Plan Strategy
In the “Hamagin 10 Years in the Future Project”, in order to develop affluent and sustainable local communities, the Bank of Yokohama will go beyond simply supporting the implementation of measures laid out by the government and independently identify problems that the region could face ten years from now, proactively moving to propose and implement measures that will enable us to achieve our vision of the bank for 10 years in the future.
The bank will also collaborate with local governments, local universities, other financial institutions, and other partners to utilize its customer base and networks, which are the bank’s strengths, in order to build communities, revitalize tourism, and resolve issues faced by local businesses.
Concrete Initiatives
Support for Branding of Specialty Products
The Bank of Yokohama supported the Shonan Pomoron tomato product development project in cooperation with the city of Chigasaki and Bunkyo University after receiving an inquiry from a farmer in Chigasaki City about expanding sales channels for Shonan Pomorons, a tomato variety developed independently by Kanagawa Prefecture. This product was certified under the ‘Kanagawa Nadeshiko Brand’, a prefectural government project that recognizes outstanding products that women contributed to development of. Also, aroma oil developed in cooperation with the Oiso Town Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Sagami Women’s College is made from mandarin oranges grown in Oiso, and is sold at the college’s school festival and at the Oiso Town Chamber of Commerce and Industry Association.
Product Business Meetings
The Bank of Yokohama and the Tokyo Institute of Technology hold product business meetings with the aim of matching the university’s intellectual property with the needs of businesses and encouraging the development of new products and upgrading of technology by local companies. The business partners of Higashi-Nippon Bank and Chiba Bank have participated in the two product business meetings held so far and in one case university intellectual property has actually begun to be commercialized.
Also, joint product business meetings concerning food have been held with Chiba Bank and Yamanashi Chuo Bank. Buyers (trading companies, supermarkets, etc.) and suppliers (food manufacturers etc.) who are clients of each bank participated in the event, and a wide range of specialty products from Kanagawa, Chiba, and Yamanashi were traded to support the reconstruction of the areas affected by the typhoon and torrential rains.
Higashi-Nippon Bank organizes product business meetings to discover the appeal of food in collaboration with regional banks across the country, and works to match the businesses of our partner companies.
Cashless Taking Root in the Community
At the Bank of Yokohama, we were one of the first in the financial industry to provide the HamaPay smartphone-based payment service, with a focus on revolutionizing distribution and commercial transactions through cashless payment and creating a sustainable community where people can live with peace of mind. In cooperation with local governments, universities, shopping malls and commercial facilities, we aim to realize a safe and secure cashless society rooted in the community.
In addition to multi-bank support with BankPay member banks nationwide, such as the Japan Post Bank and Fukuoka Bank, HamaPay can also be used at JCB Smart Code merchants. The number of stores using HamaPay is expanding.
Building Sustainable Communities through Financing
The Bank of Yokohama cooperated with the City of Yokohama in financing the redevelopment of the Kamigo-Mori No Ie [Kamigo Forest House] training and accommodation facility in Yokohama.
The City of Yokohama will retain ownership of the facility and a private sector operator will raise funds to renovate and repair the facility, and then maintain and manage the facility under the RO PFI scheme. The Bank of Yokohama will help fund not only the renovation and maintenance costs of the facility, but also the management and operational costs of the project in the future.
The Bank of Yokohama assisted an agricultural corporation in the opening of a farmer’s restaurant in Fujisawa City, providing consultation services from the project’s conception, as well as application procedures for National Strategic Special Zone, financing, and the advice and business matching necessary for running the restaurant.
Strict regulations govern the construction of new buildings on farmland, but the restaurant was certified as a special zone by satisfying conditions such as producing its main ingredients in- house or procuring the ingredients within the city. The restaurant is built on farmland using elements of old Japanese-style housing from Kanagawa Prefecture and serves a menu that features local produce in a buffet style.
Regional Headquarters System
The Bank of Yokohama abolished its previous block sales headquarters system in April 2 0 1 8 and introduced a new regional headquarters system in order to work more closely with local communities. This new system organizes the sales area into two districts (head office, Tokyo and other prefectures) and five regions (East, Central, West, South, Kawasaki).
In the regional headquarters system, a regional manager is assigned as the head of each district or regionand is tasked with devising regional strategies to address the various issues and needs of the area, planning and putting into place the measures needed to achieve the strategy, as well as strengthening and enhancing the Hamagin 10 Yearsin the Future Project. Higashi-Nippon Bank has introduced a Block Sales Department System that organizes its sales area into 10 blocks.

  Centenary of Founding of
Bank of Yokohama
The Bank of Yokohama will be celebrating its 100th anniversary on December 16, 2020. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our customers and local residents for their support over the years. Thanks to this support, we have been able to build a 100-year history as a regional financial institution.
‘With 100 Years of Gratitude’ - the slogan created to celebrate our 100th anniversary A 100th year rookie declaration. It is our desire to return to our original intentions, to evoke a sense of gratitude, and to repay what everyone has given us.
The environment surrounding us is changing dramatically, but we will continue to work hard every day to transform ourselves into a new kind of financial institution, and will continue to be a bank that supports our customers and the communities we serve for the next 100 years.
   100 Years in Review
In December 1920, when 74 Bank, the largest ordinary bank in Yokohama at the time, was in financial difficulties, the local business community stood up and negotiated with the government to establish Yokohama Industrial Bank, the predecessor of the Bank of Yokohama, in order to rescue depositors and stabilize the local economy. Yokohama Industrial Bank was established with a special loan of 16 million yen from the government and the Bank of Japan, and its articles of incorporation clearly stated that its officers, except those employed full-time, would receive no remuneration, and that its shares would be ‘non-dividend’, making it an extremely public bank.
After surviving the Great Kanto Earthquake and the financial panic of the early Showa era of the late 1920s and 1930s, the bank became the only regional bank in Kanagawa Prefecture to see the end the war in 1945, and changed its name to the Bank of Yokohama in 1957. It steadily expanded its business in conjunction with the development of Kanagawa Prefecture and southwest Tokyo, where it was based and in 1969 it became the largest regional bank in Japan by volume of deposits.
The company moved to its current headquarters in Minatomirai, Nishi-ku, Yokohama, which was built in 1993, as part of its 70th anniversary project. After overcoming the tough times of the late 1990s when the impact of the bursting of the economic bubble was intense, in 2016 we merged with Higashi-Nippon Bank to launch a new financial group, the Concordia Financial Group, which has continued in operation since.
From the days of Yokohama Industrial Bank to the present, we have worked together with the people of the region as a regional financial institution.

  Supporting Revitalization of Tourism
We support the revitalization of the region through the creation of a vibrant local economy and brand through between the public and private sectors.
We are also working on measures to support the recovery of local economies affected by COVID-19.
 Revitalization of the Miura Peninsula
The Bank of Yokohama, together with the Keikyu Electric Railway Co. and NTT DoCoMo Inc., has signed the Agreement on Cooperation and Collaboration for the Economic Revitalization of the Miura Peninsula Region with the aim of revitalizing the Miura Peninsula region, which is facing the challenges of declining birthrates and an aging population.
In cooperation with Chiba Bank, local governments, and tourist facilities, we also held cycle tourism in the form of a cycle stamp rally on cycle roads on the Boso Peninsula in Chiba Prefecture and the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture. A portion of the sales was donated to the two prefectures, which were severely hit by the typhoon, to support their regional revitalization and the reconstruction of the affected areas.
Support for sightseeing tours around shopping districts and famous sites
For one-day tours that connect shopping districts in Yokohama and tourist attractions, the Bank of Yokohama supports the revitalization of local shopping districts that support the local economy and the lives of citizens by providing ideas for excursions, proposing events to shopping district associations, and publicizing tours. Aside from the direct economic impact on shopping districts and tourist attractions, the event also provides an opportunity for participants to rediscover the area’s attractions.
Use of the Kanagawa Tourism Revitalization Fund
The Bank of Yokohama and the Regional Economy Vitalization Corporation of Japan (REVIC) have invested in the Kanagawa Tourism Revitalization Fund to support the opening of the Fujiya Ryokan in Yugawara Town and the Kamakura Cocon, a private inn in Kamakura that has been renovated from an old house and converted into an accommodation facility.
Support for Local Lodging and Restaurants
The Group will continue to develop measures to support the recovery of local economies that have been depressed by the effects of COVID-19.
In order to support consumption at local food and beverage businesses and lodging businesses whose business activities have been significantly affected, the Bank of Yokohama will implement measures to encourage our employees to patronize them. This initiative, which also serves as a demonstration test for the use of a dedicated smart phone app for local currency, aims to further increase consumption by providing subsidies as part of the bank’s welfare program.

The Bank of Yokohama uses AI to check business reception records when selling financial products, to select documents for new graduate hires, and to monitor suspicious transactions such as money laundering and special fraud.
By utilizing AI for primary checking of sales contact records, the time required for the person in charge to create the records, and the time required for the manager to check the records, can be reduced by approximately 50%, improving efficiency and the quality of work. In new graduate hiring, AI can quantify the evaluation of entry sheets and use it as one of the criteria for making decisions, greatly reducing the amount of time spent on document screening and freeing up new time for face-to-face communication such as interviews.
In addition, in monitoring suspicious transactions, we expect to reduce the number of accounts requiring secondary investigation (detailed investigation) by 30 - 40% by utilizing AI technology for the primary investigation of deposit accounts selected based on certain conditions. It is expected that AI will identify deposit accounts, for which humans find it difficult to recognize risks, and will contribute to the prevention of financial crimes such as money laundering and special fraud.
Collaboration with MEJAR mission-critical system
MEJAR Digital Innovation Hub
The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank have collaborated with the regional financial institutions that are jointly operating the MEJAR core system to launch the MEJAR Digital Innovation Hub (MDIH) to collaboratively promote business process reforms, channel service reforms, and other measures using digital technology. The Bank of Yokohama’s Digital Strategy Department has accepted temporary staff transfers from other MEJAR banks. Temporary transfers of staff from NTT Data and the NTT Data Force have also been placed in various divisions of the bank to aid with development. By strengthening cooperation with the MEJAR banks, we aim to improve productivity and offer high value-added services suited to a digital society.
New Business Co-Creation Project
In light of the changes in the external environment, including deregulation and the advancement of digital technology, we have established the New Business Co-Creation Project with our business partner Chiba Bank in order to take on the challenge of new business areas that are not an extension of existing banking business. We will continue to enhance and diversify our digital solutions for our customers by considering new businesses such as digital banking and collaborating with outside companies for services.
Investment in Venture Capital Funds
The Bank of Yokohama is an anchor investor in Evolution Ventures 2 LP, a fund formed by Evolution Ventures, which has extensive contacts with leading venture companies in Silicon Valley, where many of the world’s most advanced digital technologies are born.
This Fund aims to create new, customized financial services for Japan by investing not only in leading US venture businesses, but also by supporting open innovation between the Fund’s investors, including the Bank of Yokohama, and companies invested in that have innovative digital technology.
The Bank of Yokohama will work with Evolution to create new value experiences for customers and communities, as well as to further enhance financial services, through this strategic collaboration.
Introduction of AGENT next-generation branch terminals
The Bank of Yokohama is in the process of introducing AGENT next generation branch terminals. Until now, customers were required to hand write application forms and stamp them with their signature stamps. Now however procedures such as opening an ordinary deposit account or making changes to personal information on the application form can all be completed on a tablet. In addition, input data is automatically linked to the business system through API integration, greatly reducing input and checking work that was previously performed by employees, resulting in paperless operations and increased productivity. We plan to introduce this system in all branches by the end of FY 2020.

   Promoting Financial Digitization
We will transform into a more convenient bank by moving into new business areas and advancing operational reforms through the use of digital technology.
Fintech, AI, IoT, and other digital technologies are rapidly becoming a part of everyday life, and have become issues that regional financial institutions must urgently address. In addition, in order to promptly develop advanced products and provide services that meet the needs of customers in the face of changes in the external environment, such as the continued monetary easing policy centered on negative interest rates by the Bank of Japan and the low birthrate and aging population. A new business model is urgently needed that is efficient and highly productive on the basis of business reviews and operational reforms. The Bank of Yokohama established a new Digital Strategy Department in April 2019 for initiatives utilizing digital technology, and the Group is working as one to promote digitization measures based on the following three pillars.
Initiatives to reform branches, business, and operations
Initiatives involving cashless settlement
Creation of a new business model using AI, fintech, and other digital technologies
* Digital transformation: The use of digital technology to rethink the way the company does business, and to reform corporate culture. This will enable us to generate new value, build a new business model with digital capabilities, revolutionize the customer experience, improve society and people’s lives, and gain a competitive edge.
In the medium-term management plan from FY 2019, we have set ‘operational reforms utilizing digital technology’ as a priority measure, and we will implement drastic reform of branch operations through three ‘less’ (paperless, less cash handling, and back office less) operations to transform the branch into a place for customer consultation. In addition, we will build a regional ecosystem that captures things, people, and experience needs ahead of financial needs, and communicate with customers from outside the connection with finance, expand payment services, provide a platform for issuing local currency to local governments, chambers of commerce, private companies, and shopping malls etc. with the aim of diversifying services utilizing digital technology.

When a call is received at Bank of Yokohama headquarters, the telephone number allows the bank to identify the customer and draw upon personal data stored at the bank (age, family structure, transaction status etc) to ascertain products and services that the customer might be interested in. The call is then automatically connected to operators who specialize in these products and services via intelligent routing. The Bank of Yokohama has also introduced a web chat service on its homepage to allow customers to ask specialist operators questions via the Internet.
  Recommendation-based online lending
The Hamagin Business Connect Loan, a recommendation- based online lending service, provides customers of Hamagin Business Connect, a members-only portal site for corporations, with information on the amount and interest rate level available for borrowing through a pre-screening process that utilizes big data such as account histories of deposit accounts.
Customers who wish to borrow money do not need to submit financial documents and can complete the procedure online. In addition, the loan is executed in as little as two business days after the application is submitted, enabling you to obtain funds quickly.

   Implementing Environmentally Conscious Sustainable Management
   Global warmingandclimate change are important issues related to a variety of social and economic activities that need to be addressed from a medium to long-term perspective. The Concordia Financial Group is committed to combating global warming and protecting the environment in its core business of financial services and in its own corporate activities, based on the Group Environmental Policy.
 The Concordia Financial Group’s Environmental Policy
The Concordia Financial Group strives to consider the environment in our core business of financial services and our own corporate activities and contributes to the sustainable development of society.
Endorsement of the Kanagawa Zero Plastic Trash Declaration
The Bank of Yokohama supports the Kanagawa Zero Plastic Litter Declaration that Kanagawa Prefecture, an SDGs future city, has established to eliminate plastic waste and supports efforts to tackle microplastic issues.
To commemorate the expansion of the use of the SDGs Friends Loan supporting SDGs management initiatives by local companies, we donated 5 million yen to the Kanagawa Coastal Beautification Foundation Public Interest Foundation Corporation The donation is used for coastal cleanup and coastal beautification awareness in an effort to solve the microplastic problem.
Environmental protection and social contributions through investment
The Bank of Yokohama invests in Sustainability Bonds issued by the Railway Construction and Transport Facilities Development Support Agency Independent Administration Corporation to reduce the environmental impact and improve transportation infrastructure essential to local life, and also invests in Social Bonds (JICA bonds) issued by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Independent Administration Corporation. The funds raised by JICA bonds will be used for the resolution of social issues in developing countries and for the sound development of the Japanese and international economy through Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects funded by JICA.
Environmental protection and social contributions through loans
The Bank of Yokohama, in cooperation with the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, has provided SDGs Social Loans to Pacifico Yokohama (official title: Yokohama International Peace Conference Center), one of the largest MICE complexes in Japan, for the large-scale renovation of the facility. The projects covered by the loan have been assessed by an external evaluator in accordance with the Social Bond Principles published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and other principles for social bonds, including the achievement of a sustainable environment.
Hamagin Forest
The Bank of Yokohama supports the Kanagawa 50-Year Reforestation Plan to pass on the rich blessings of the forests of Kanagawa Prefecture to the next generation, and uses CSR Environment Private Bonds donations as a Forest Revitalization Partner working on reforestation. As part of this activity, we acquired naming rights to the forest owned by the prefecture on the banks of Lake Tanzawa and named it Hamagin Forest.
Environmental considerations in corporate activities
Marine conservation efforts through the company cafeteria
The Bank of Yokohama is the first bank in Japan to offer a menu of Sustainable Seafood (*) in its headquarters employee cafeteria. Incorporating sustainable marine products into the company cafeteria menu encourages each employee to change his or her food awareness and behavior.
(*) Sustainable seafood is not over-fished and is caught in a way that is environmentally friendly. There are two types of fisheries products - fish caught in the wild in consideration of marine resources and the environment and farmed fish raised in a way that minimizes their impact on the environment. Both require certification by an inspection organization (e.g. MSC or ASC certification).
‘Plastic-free’ and ‘paperless’ efforts
With ‘plastic-free’ in mind, the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank have switched to the environmentally friendly Limex material for the bags used in branches to hold documents and other items, and for fans distributed in branches during the Cool Biz period. We also use LIMEX for our employee business cards and our leaflets to shareholders in consideration of the environmental issues facing the world, such as deforestation and water shortages.

The Concordia Financial Group endorses the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Information Disclosure (TCFD)(*) and will work to enhance disclosure of information on climate change as recommended by the TCFD and take appropriate action.
(*)TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures): A privately-led task force established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in December 2015 to encourage companies to disclose climate-related information
lWe established the Group SDGs Committee, chaired by the President of the company, to centrally manage the formulation and progress of policies on climate change initiatives.
lWe will establish a Group SDGs policy and formulate action plans concerning risks and opportunities for social issues including climate change, and report regularly to Directors’ meetings.
We have identified the Group’s Materiality on social issues including climate change.
We will work on the management of these assets and analyze the impact of physical risks and transition risks.
Based on the IEA 2°C Scenario and IEA Decision Policy Scenario (4°C Scenario) for transition risk as scenarios that might impact the management of the Group and based on IPCC’s RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios for physical risk, we will initiatives concerning the evaluation of risks and opportunities. (*1, 2)
l The ratio of carbon-related assets (electricity, energy etc.) to loans(*) is 0.3%.
lWe are working to construct a management system for credit risk, risk related to the Group’s tangible fixed assets,
operational risk etc. based on the impact of climate change risks on the Group’s loans.
lRecognizing the risks due to climate change, we will introduce policies for business related to coal-fired power generation, deforestation, and palm oil plantations, and work to limit the increase in carbon-related assets.
lThese risks will be managed within a comprehensive risk management framework, with an eye to the degree of impact and probability of climate change risks (physical risks and transition risks).
Policy for Specific Sectors
The Concordia Financial Group has a Sector Policy to ensure that loans and other financing are carefully judged to reduce or avoid the environmental and social impacts of investments and loans that are likely to contribute to negative environmental and social impacts.
1 Coal-fired power generation business
We will not, in principle, engage in new investments in or loans for coal-fired power generation projects that are likely to have a negative impact on the environment. However, when considering exceptional measures, we will carefully consider each project’s background and characteristics, such as power generation efficiency and performance, impact on the environment, and impact on local communities, with reference to international guidelines etc.
2 Cluster bomb manufacturing business
New investments in and loans to companies that manufacture cluster munitions are prohibited, regardless of the use of the funds.
3 Palm oil plantation development business
From the perspectives of conservation of forest resources and biodiversity and protection of human rights, we prohibit new investments and loans for those developments of palm oil plantations that may involve human rights violations such as illegal logging and child labor. In addition, investments and loans for palm oil plantation development will be made with careful attention to the status of certification by the RSPO(*1), the international certification for sustainable palm oil, as well as consideration for local communities and the environment.
4 Deforestation projects
We make new investments and loans for forest harvesting projects with great care, taking into account whether they have received international
certifications (FSC(*2), PEFC(*3) etc.) and the consideration given to local communities and the environment.
(*1) RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil): An organization that develops globally trusted certification standards to promote sustainable palm oil production and use
(*2) FSC (Forest Stewardship Council): A non-profit organization that operates an international forest certification system based on the principle of appropriate, socially beneficial, and
economically sustainable forest management from the perspective of environmental protection
(*3) PEFC (Forest Certification Program): An international umbrella organization that promotes examination of forest certification systems that have been individually developed in each
country based on the Intergovernmental Process for Sustainable Forest Management, which covers 85% of the world’s forests, and that promotes mutual recognition of these systems

 Results of the Management and Effectiveness Evaluation of the Board of Directors Meetings for Fiscal Year 2019
Based on the evaluation results of the FY 2 0 1 8 effectiveness evaluation, in FY2019 we managed the Board of Directors meetings with an emphasis on action and an increased sense of speed in management. The Medium-Term Management Plan, which began in fiscal 2019, was reviewed periodically for progress, and future initiatives to recognize and resolve issues were deliberated. In addition, we reviewed the authority for business execution and clarified the division
Recognition of Issues and Initiatives for FY 2020
From the perspective of further improving the effectiveness of the Company’s Board of Directors meetings, the Company recognizes the following three issues as challenges and will continue to work on them. 1. Enhancing discussions on strategies for sustainable growth and
increased corporate value in response to environmental changes
Evaluation Method
In the FY 2 0 1 9 effectiveness evaluation, as described below, we conducted a self-evaluation by utilizing a third party’s perspective, questionnaires, and interviews and by discussing issues and future efforts for the effectiveness of Board of Directors meetings.
1. To ensure objectivity and anonymity, a questionnaire from a third- party organization was given to each director and audit & supervisory who participates in Board of Directors meetings.
2. In addition to the responses to the questionnaire, individual interviews were conducted with each of the directors and audit & supervisory in order to obtain more specific information.
3. After compiling the results, we discussed the challenges and future initiatives to ensure the effectiveness of the Board of Directors meetings at the regular Board of Directors meeting in May 2020 and conducted a self-evaluation
of roles between the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, the deliberations at the Board of Directors meetings have been invigorated by providing enhanced explanations of the agenda and information to the outside directors in advance.
We assessed that these efforts to improve on the issues identified in FY 2018 have resulted in steady progress and ensured the effectiveness of the Board of Directors meetings in FY 2019.
2. Strengthening supervision and monitoring of responses to important management issues
3. Enhancing the operating framework to strengthen group collaboration
 Main evaluation items
Composition of Board of Directors meetings, provision of information, etc., matters to be discussed at Board of Directors meetings, status of deliberations at Board of Directors meetings, ensuring time for deliberations at Board of Directors meetings, remuneration and appointment of directors, coordination among officers, etc.
    In order to enhance Board of Directors meetings, the Company provides outside directors and outside auditors with advance explanations of the agenda of the Board of Directors meetings, as well as opportunities for on-site visits to sales branches of the Group companies. In order to ensure that directors obtain information about the company in a timely and appropriate manner, a staff member is assigned to the Corporate Planning Department to assist directors in obtaining information. To ensure that audits are conducted effectively, we have a dedicated staff member in the Audit & Supervisory Office to support the audits of audit & supervisory. We also provide opportunities for directors to obtain knowledge and information, as well as advice from outside experts, so that they can fulfill their roles and responsibilities.
When outside directors and outside auditors are appointed, they are provided with the opportunity to acquire knowledge and information about the Group’s management philosophy, management policies, business plans, and business structure. Furthermore, we ensure coordination between the outside
directors and the Representative Director, the audit & supervisory, internal audit departments, and the financial auditors, as well as interaction between the outside directors and the directors of the Group companies.

Audit & Supervisory Board
In accordance with the audit policy and audit plan established by the Audit & Supervisory Board, the audit & supervisory audits the legality and appropriateness of the execution of director’s business operations by attending important meetings such as Board of Directors meetings, examining the status of operations and assets, inspecting important decision-making documents, communicating with internal audit departments and Group companies, and
Management Conference
exchanging information with the financial auditor and other parties.
To ensure the effectiveness of audits, the Articles of Incorporation stipulate that the number of audit & supervisory may not exceed five, and half or more of them are outside auditors. As of June 19, 2020, we have three independent outside auditors out of the five auditors
(four male and one female).
V. Executive Compensation System
Basic Concepts
In order to promote the Group’s sustainable growth and increase its corporate value over the medium to long term, the Company has adopted a compensation system that increases the incentive for executives to take risks in an appropriate manner and implement aggressive governance.
The compensation structure, composition ratio, and level of executive compensation are determined based on data on executive compensation provided by an external research organization, and are compared and verified against benchmarks from other industries and groups of companies in similar industries and business categories to the Company.
Based on the basic policy and management plan decided at the Board of Directors meetings, the Management Conference discusses and decides on important business execution matters and strategies for flexible business execution in the Group, and also holds preliminary discussions of the resolutions of the Board of Directors meetings when necessary.
In addition, for important matters related to the Group’s business operations, the following meetings are positioned as part of the Management Conference and they deliberate in a concentrated manner on items under their respective jurisdictions.
1. Director
nCompensation structure
 Compensation consists of basic salary, bonus, and stock-based
compensation.
 Compensation consists of 6 6% base salary, 1 7% bonus, and
17% stock-based compensation (when bonuses and stock-based compensation are paid in standard amounts).
nDetails of each type of compensation
(a) Basic salary
 The basic salary is paid monthly based on the role and
responsibilities of the employee. (b) Bonus
 The bonus is an annual cash payment evaluated based on the Company’s performance (the level of the actual net earnings of the Bank of Yokohama, Ltd., and Higashi-Nippon Bank (hereafter referred to as the “two banks total”), the net earnings attributable to the parent company shareholders, etc.), and the business results of the individual officer.
 Note that the standard amounts of basic remuneration, bonuses, and stock-based remuneration are determined by position.
(c) Stock-based compensation
 Stock-based compensation refers to the amount of money
equivalent to the Company’s shares using a trust and cash proceeds from the realization of the Company’s shares (hereafter referred to as the “Company’s Shares, etc.”). Two types of trusts have been established, Trust I and Trust II, as follows.
1) Trust I
 Company shares etc. equivalent to the standard amount for
each position will be provided to each director upon their
resignation. 2) Trust II
 Company shares etc. will be provided at the end of the Medium- Term Management Plan, in an amount equal to the base amount for each position to which is applied a performance-linked coefficient (varying from 75% to 200% depending on the degree of achievement) reflecting the level of achievement of the performance targets in the Medium-Term Management Plan.
 The indicators used to evaluate the “degree of achievement of the performance targets of the medium-term management plan” are the target indicators of the current Medium-Term Management Plan (fiscal 2019-2021). The final performance-linked coefficient is determined after deliberation by the Compensation and Personnel Committee, taking into account non-financial indicators and qualitative matters.
Remuneration and Personnel Committee
In order to ensure objectivity and transparency in the remuneration and appointments of directors and executive officers, we have established a voluntary Remuneration and Personnel Committee consisting of Outside Directors. The Committee considers matters relating to the remuneration and appointment of directors and executive officers.

The business results of each officer are evaluated based on the degree of achievement of an initially set target (three to six items are set for each individual based on the department they are in charge of, such as achieving the budget for the department, the progress of each policy, the development of a risk management system, etc.). If the standard amount for each position is set at 100, the amount of payment to be paid to the executive officer will vary between 70% and 130% depending on the evaluation results for the individual officer. Note that the final evaluation of the Company’s performance and the performance of officers based on their work performance is subject the deliberation by the Compensation and Personnel Committee.

Outside Director Message
We are building a strong governance system to achieve the group’s goals.
Director Mitsuru Akiyoshi
Group, as well as engaging in a series of dialogues with former President Kawamura and President Oya. As a result, although partway through the 3-year Medium-term Management Plan, in December last year we discussed and decided on the new President of Higashi-Nippon Bank (Oishi, Representative Director of the Bank of Yokohama, Ltd., was appointed), and in April this year we decided that President Oya of the Bank of Yokohama, Ltd., should be appointed to the Board of Directors with concurrent position of FG President. The key points for discussion were how to bring together and demonstrate the Group’s strengths and how to promote a unifying management approach in response to the Group’s difficulties.
We determined that making the Bank of Yokohama the axis of the system would enable us to increase the effectiveness of our efforts to improve the corporate value of Higashi-Nippon Bank and increase the speed with which we could achieve our medium-term targets, so we consolidated the top management of the Bank of Yokohama in order to utilize the management resources of the company in an agile manner. Both Mr. Oya and Mr. Oishi have the courage to tackle difficult situations head on. They are both cheerful personalities with the ability to communicate directly with employees about the direction of management. That makes them suitable as leaders of the Group, and it is expected that they can achieve unifying management.
What is your evaluation of the effectiveness of our Board of Directors meetings?
We recognize that the governance of a financial institution is intended to achieve maximized corporate value and to ensure soundness. We understand that the role of the Board of Directors meetings is important in this context and that the responsibility of independent outside directors is particularly heavy.
At every meeting of FG’s Board of Directors, there is lively discussion with the executive officers focusing on questions and opinions from the outside directors and the external auditors. In addition, the fact that the outside directors have diverse backgrounds and professional expertise and that there are two women on the board means that the discussions at the meeting are conducted from more diverse perspectives.
A financial institution’s Board of Director meetings have more regulatory, soundness, and other specialized issues than those at a typical company, so the non-executive officers must be very prepared and strong-willed to deal with these issues. In this regard, we believe that the executive side has been able to hold careful briefing sessions in advance and fully respond to the opinions and questions of the outside directors, which has resulted in lively Board of Directors meetings.
In addition to the Board of Directors meetings, we also conduct visits to see and hear the actual situation in the field and talk directly with the employees. It has been a very valuable experience to see first-hand the challenges banks are facing today.
Going forward, as an outside director, I believe our important mission is to further deepen discussions on (1) how to steer the Group for sustainable growth and increased corporate value, and (2) to develop and strengthen human resources and identify and nurture the next generation of leaders to achieve this goal.
Management Base for Growth
   What is your evaluation after completing the first financial year of the three-year medium- term management plan as an outside director, and what is your opinion of the Company’s governance structure?
 This past year’s activities have reminded us of the challenging business environment surrounding regional financial institutions. The Group is a financial institution with an advantage over other regions, having its home market in Kanagawa Prefecture, where it has an overwhelming advantage, and access to the huge market of Tokyo, but competition is intensifying, including from other industries. We have positioned the current medium-term management plan as a three-year period of change in which we will transform ourselves into a “new financial company that surpasses conventional banks”. The entire Group shares a strong sense of urgency about the loss of corporate value if we continue with traditional banking management. In particular, “operational reform using digital technology” and “the challenge of new business areas using strategic investments and capital investments” go beyond the conventional framework of banking operations. We believe that the key issues are how to speed up
the pace of these initiatives and how to proactively utilize external human resources.
The Group must also improve and upgrade its operations and review its governance structure at Higashi-Nippon Bank. Although it has taken nearly two years since the business improvement order in August 2018, I judge that there is steady implementation and strengthening of our Compliance Awareness Reform and Business Improvement Plan. In the future, I expect that the results swiftly being produced by Governance Reform, Improvement of Profitability, and Unification of the Group, which are the goals of the Sunrise Plan formulated last November, will greatly contribute to improving the corporate value of the Group.
Since last summer, the Remuneration and Personnel Committee, which includes Outside Directors, has been thoroughly discussing the ideal governance structure of the

 Initiatives to Improve the Corporate Value of Higashi-Nippon Bank
Higashi-Nippon Bank, under the management and supervision of Concordia Financial Group, has been steadily implementing the Business Improvement Plan established in August 2 0 1 8. Furthermore, to ensure sustainable profitability and future financial health, we are making fundamental structural reforms, enhancing our core business, and strengthening our credit risk management under our “Higashi-Nippon Bank Sunrise Plan,” a profitability improvement plan that concludes in FY 2022.
Establishing a Legal Compliance System
To ensure sound and appropriate business operations, we completed the development of our internal control posture and business management posture by the first half of FY 2019. Based on the Business Improvement Plan, management is taking the lead in steadily implementing the action plan and in properly executing the PDCA cycle to improve the effectiveness of our measures.
   Establishment of legal compliance posture
In order to establish a corporate culture that emphasizes compliance, we have clarified the departments and managers responsible for promoting compliance and established an organization, rules, and a management system. In addition, in order to raise awareness of compliance across the entire bank, we continuously conduct training and other sessions with outside experts and conduct periodic compliance awareness surveys to determine the status of compliance.
Establishment of a customer-oriented business operation posture
The Customer Service Office was established as the department responsible for promoting customer- oriented business operations. In addition, to raise awareness of customer-oriented business operations across the entire bank, we continue to invite outside experts to provide training and other programs, and we have reviewed our personnel evaluation system and award system in order to revise the performance- oriented culture.
Initiatives for the Higashi-Nippon Bank Sunrise Plan
In December 2019, we changed our governance structure. We took on additional personnel from the Bank of Yokohama and with the strong support of the Group, we put in place a management structure to deliver structural change and improved profitability. We will accelerate the restructuring of our business model by focusing on (1) fundamental structural reforms, (2) deepening our core business, and (3) strengthening our credit risk management, with the aim of becoming a partner trusted by our customers in the Tokyo metropolitan area market, with a focus on Tokyo itself.
Radical structural reform Deepening our core businesses
Establishing a system for mutual checks
and balances and internal audits
In order to improve the mutual checks and balances, we have implemented structural reform of the headquarters organization, reviewed the division of operations among executives, reduced the decision- making authority of sales office managers, established a system for headquarters to monitor sales offices, developed an internal reporting system, etc. In addition, internal audit staff has been assigned to the three group companies to strengthen the integrated management of the group’s internal audit department, develop the audit staff, and improve specialist skills.
VI. Risk Governance
Introduction of the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF)
The Concordia Financial Group is introducing a Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) to monitor and clarify the type and amount of risk taken on during operations, while taking into account the balance of earnings, risk, and our capital buffer. In formulating the medium-term management plan and the budget for each financial year, a Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which defines the types and amounts of risks that management should willingly accept or avoid, is adopted at a Board of Directors’ meeting. We plan to optimize risk-return, using the RAF to constantly monitor the risk assets and their relationship to return, which are incorporated in the budget.
1. RAF Regulations
     5. Internal Controls
4. Monitoring
2. Medium-Term Management Plan RAS
3. Fiscal year RAS
   Overview of Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) Management System
 A. Capital allocation and risk capacity based capping
The potential maximum loss (risk amount) of each risk is measured using value-at-risk (VaR) and other measures, and capital is allocated to each risk type in order to keep the risk amount within the range of the equity capital available for risk-taking. For risk-weighted assets, the risk appetite is determined within the measured risk capacity.
B. Stress testing
The Company verifies the appropriateness of risk-taking by estimating losses for each type of risk and measuring the impact on capital, earnings, risk-weighted assets, and risk volume using group-wide stress scenarios to confirm the adequacy of capital in budgetary plans and to ensure that management has an acceptable level of profit in times of stress.
C. Management of Top Management Risks
 In order to manage our top management risks, as much as possible, we set up Key Risk Indicators (KRI) as warning indicators to detect the possibility of risks materializing in the future. We continuously monitor these KRI to understand the signs and prepare to respond flexibly in the event that risks do materialize.

The main initiatives are business finance and foreign currency loans, mortgages, and loans to wealthy individuals with strong asset backgrounds, which have been defined as the risks to be willingly accepted.
For our capital structure, in order to maintain financial health and improve capital efficiency, we will use the RAF to keep the CET1 capital ratio at about 12% while procuring Tier 2 capital.

Risk Culture
The Group’s risk management is based on the following basic policies.
In order to minimize the negative impact of economic fluctuations and to provide stable and continuous financial services as a financial group that is trusted by the community, the Group will conduct appropriate risk management.
The Company ensures management soundness by identifying, assessing, monitoring, and controlling the risks of the entire Group as comprehensively as possible, and strives to secure stable earnings that are commensurate with the risks through the appropriate allocation of management resources.
In order to ensure objectivity and take into account the interaction between risks, we will strive to quantify and manage various risks in an integrated manner.
Integrated Risk Management
1. Basic Concepts
The Group classifies and manages Group risks in the following categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and reputational risk. In addition, we ensure the soundness of management by identifying, evaluating, monitoring, and controlling risks in an integrated manner to the greatest extent possible, including risks related to the development, provision and revision of products and services, as well as risks related to outsourcing of operations. We are also prepared to secure stable earnings through the appropriate allocation of management resources, commensurate with the risks involved.
2. Integrated Risk Management Framework
nEnsuring soundness through capital allocation
The Group measures the potential maximum loss (risk amount) for each risk using value-at-risk (VaR) and other measures, and allocates capital by risk type in order to keep the amount of risk within the range of real equity capital (the risk tolerance limit, which is defined as common stock Tier 1 less deferred tax assets equivalent, etc.) When allocating capital, we check the sufficiency of the buffer (unallocated capital) to ensure that our real equity capital is not exceeded in times
of stress.
nCredit Risk nMarket Risk nLiquidity risk
nOperational Risk
nReputational Risk
nEnsuring soundness through stress testing
In order to assess the adequacy of the buffer (unallocated capital)
and to confirm the appropriateness of risk-taking, the Group conducts stress tests in which stress scenarios are established and the amount of loss and risk in the event of such a stress event is estimated across the risk categories.
The stress scenarios have been established for the Group taking into consideration past sharp economic downturns and future environmental changes.
Overview of Risk Management System
In the Concordia Financial Group, the subsidiaries (Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank) manage risk by setting up a risk management department and a control department for each type of risk, while the holding company manages the risks of the Group as a whole in an integrated manner. Specifically, the subsidiaries manage risks appropriately in accordance with their risk profiles and report to
the holding company on the status of risks. The holding company provides the subsidiaries with necessary guidance, and the ALM and Risk Management Committee (Management Conference) monitors, discusses, and decides on various types of risks and risks for the entire Group.
Management Base for Growth
  Risk of loss due to a decline in the value of assets due to deterioration of the financial condition of the borrower
 Risk of loss due to fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities held resulting from changes in various market risk factors, such as those for interest rates and securities
 Risk of losses due to unexpected outflows of funds (cash flow risk and market liquidity risk)
 Risk of loss due to inadequate administration, inadequate systems, violations of laws or regulations, natural disasters, and health hazards for executives and employees
 Risk of incurring losses due to negative external publicity as a result of the words, actions and behavior of the Group, its officers and employees, etc.

To ensure the safety of the Group’s information assets, we have established our basic Security Policy, and we implement system risk management by defining specific management methods in our Security Standards and System Risk Management Regulations. In addition, we have also established a CFG-CSIRT to collaborate with the CSIRTs established by Group companies to respond to cyberattacks and other attacks.
Crisis Management
The Group has a crisis management system in place to ensure the safety of its customers and employees, the smooth execution of financial operations, and the protection of customers’ assets in the event of an earthquake or other large-scale disaster, system failure, spread of an infectious disease, etc. In the event of a crisis, the Crisis Management Committee, chaired by the President and Representative Director, instructs companies within the Group to set up an emergency headquarters to centrally manage the response to the situation.

Compliance Initiatives
Basic Code of Compliance
The Concordia Financial Group recognizes compliance to be an important management issue, with executives and employees working together to enhance the compliance system based on our Basic Compliance Policy(*).
(*) Basic Compliance Policy https://www.concordia-fg.jp/compliance/index.html
Establishing a Compliance Program
The Concordia Financial Group designs compliance programs as concrete plans put into effect annually to improve compliance and ensure we meet our compliance goals. In our FY 2020 compliance program, we are focusing on initiatives such as maintaining a thorough awareness of compliance and a sensible sales attitude,
Initiatives to Prevent Money Laundering
With the widespread transfer of funds by criminal groups, terrorists and others, and the growing threat of international terrorism, the risk of financial institutions being entangled in money laundering and terrorist financing has increased.
The Concordia Financial Group is committed to complying with the basic requirements for checking, etc., at the time of transactions as stipulated in relevant laws and regulations, such as the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds and the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. We are also committed to effective countermeasures against money laundering and terrorist financing to ensure that we are able to respond to the risks that may change from
practicing customer-oriented services, rigorous information management, combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and taking appropriate action against anti-social forces and financial crimes.
over time, and to playing our role as a participant in the financial system in order to maintain its integrity.
Specifically, each entity prepares a risk assessment document based on the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, which comprehensively and specifically identifies and evaluates risks, and implements risk mitigation measures such as proper notification of suspicious transactions. In addition, we have established a Money Laundering Prevention Program to verify the effectiveness of risk reduction measures and we review the program annually to enhance our preparedness.
Compliance Operational Structure
A Chief Compliance Officer is in charge of compliance-related issues for the entire Concordia Financial Group. The Risk Management Department manages and provides guidance to the entire Group on compliance-related issues, .
In addition, as a specific plan of practice to achieve compliance throughout the Group, we establish a Compliance Program for each financial year in accordance with the Basic Compliance Policy and
have newly established action principles for the realization of the program. Also, to enhance its effectiveness, the Compliance Conference meets regularly to monitor the progress of the Compliance Program and the status of compliance and reports to Board of Directors meetings.

  Establishment of a Compliance Hotline
Furthermore, the Concordia Financial Group, the Bank of Yokohama, and Higashi-Nippon Bank each have their own Compliance Hotline to act as a whistleblowing system to encourage early detection and rectification of any acts or behavior violating laws.
Group executives and employees are able to use this hotline to consult directly on compliance-related issues. We also use an outside law firm as a contact point for whistleblowing.
The Concordia Financial Group considers customer protection to be one of the most crucial areas of management and operation. We stand in the customer’s perspective and follow all laws and regulations and conduct our corporate activities fairly and in good faith.
To protect customers and ensure thorough compliance, all employees receive e-learning and group training for their respective duties and positions with themes such as fiduciary duty, management of customer information, abuse of a superior position, and conflict of interest management. We also conduct information security training for all employees based on the basic policies set out in the Security Policy to ensure the safety of our information assets.
The Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank each have their own customer support office accepting consultations and complaints.
The Concordia Financial Group has entered into a basic agreement with the Japanese Bankers Association, a designated dispute resolution organization under the Japan Banking Act. All customer conflicts are handled using the Financial ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) System, a system to resolve conflicts through third party involvement.
As part of the Concordia Financial Group’s efforts to protect personal information, we not only have our policy on the handling of personal information available on our homepage, but also all executives and employees are notified of the various rules and regulations, and any subsequent modifications concerning the appropriate handling of such information.

■ The Role of the Internal Audit
To ensure sound and appropriate operations, the Group’s internal audit departments conduct internal audits of the effectiveness and appropriateness of each department’s compliance and risk management systems, as well as internal control over financial reporting, from a standpoint that is independent of the operating divisions. The results of each company’s internal audits are regularly reported to the Board of Directors meetings and other committees.
  Vision
In order to remain an attractive company where employees can work with pride, the Concordia Financial Group aims to transform into a highly productive organization where diverse human resources can unleash their full potential, and foster a culture that encourages employees to seek new challenges and growth.
Medium-Term Management Plan Strategy
Under the Medium-Term Management Plan, we have set “Strengthening the development of a strong organization and human resources to support sustainable growth” as a key policy, and we are working more than ever to strengthen our human resource development, to effectively utilize human resources, and to create a comfortable work environment in the Group.
■ The Group’s Internal Audit System
In order to ensure that the methods and standards are consistent within the Group, the Company has established the Basic Internal Audit Regulations, which are based on the policies and regulations established by the Company and its subsidiaries regarding internal audits.
The Group’s Audit Department, which includes members of the Audit Department of the Company and its subsidiaries, is working to strengthen the internal audit function by establishing a system for conducting efficient and effective risk-based audits across the Group and by ensuring consistency in the conduct of internal audits. For example, the Company’s Auditing Department takes the lead in conducting audits throughout the Group on key risks that are common within the Group.
In addition, the Group Management Audit Committee, which is part of the Management Conference, has been established to resolve, discuss, and report on important matters related to internal audits, as well as to discuss and report on matters related to the results of internal audits of the entire Group.

Promotion of Active Participation Across All Generations
In order to foster a sense of unity within the Group and to promote effective human resource utilization, we are building a unified platform for all generations to ensure fair and equitable treatment of employees regardless of personal factors.
In addition, as part of our efforts for the diversification of part-timers, we revised our personnel system based on the principle of “equal pay for equal work”. This included reviewing the payment system to reflect the diverse status of work, strengthening our training and on-the-job training functions, and expanding our bonus, retirement benefit, vacation systems, etc. We encourage those who are willing to take on the challenge of transferring to a new position and we are strengthening our support system for skill enhancement and career changes.
Enhanced Incentives Based on Job Responsibilities
With changes in the business environment, the roles that customers demand of us have become more sophisticated and diversified. This requires a fundamental review of operations through the use of digital technology and other means. To this end, we are working to develop the human resources that will be the driving force behind the Company, and we will support the success of our diverse human resources by thoroughly adopting a meritocracy system that leaves behind the emphasis on seniority, a system in which employees are treated according to the importance of their responsibilities based on the difficulty, scope, and role of their duties, and according to the degree of their contribution to the company’s performance.

 Evolving to a Human Resources System where All Employees can Thrive
We are reforming our personnel system to create an environment in which employees of all ages can play an active role, regardless of their seniority or age, that encourages employees to take on new challenges, and that encourages their individual growth. In addition, as the bank’s business lines diversify, we will restructure our multilinear career paths and upgrade our human resource management in order to make the most of our human resources with diverse values, skills, and abilities.
       1. Advanced Specialized Expertise
    Persons with expertise and skills in the business areas designated by the bank and the ability to perform their duties (and demonstrate results)
   2. Mindset
   Persons who understand the bank’s management policy, the intent of the business strategy, the numbers, etc., and who have the will to fulfill the required role (mission).
   3. Self-starter and developer of human resources (succession)
  Persons who strive to improve their skills and expertise through proactive efforts and continuous self-improvement, who serve as role models for employees, and who work to guide and train their successors
  ■ Efforts to Improve Internal Auditing Performance and Efficiency
Professional Human Resources System
In response to the diversification and sophistication of the banking business, we launched a Professional Human Resources System from FY 2 0 1 9, because there is a need to strengthen the development of human resources in priority fields with a high level of expertise. As human resources with diverse senses of values and career perspectives increase, we are preparing career paths and a compensation system that enables employees to play an active role as professionals in their field of expertise by utilizing their strengths, and preparing the foundation for strengthening and developing specialized human resources.
Also, the compensation system will provide more incentive to contribute to the Company’s results than a normal compensation system. The level of compensation will be determined individually based on factors such as the level of expertise and performance, which may result in compensation at the executive or general manager level.
We are actively recruiting mid-career workers from outside the company, and we hired 15 professionals with extensive work expertise, including some from foreign securities companies in FY 2019.
Professional Personnel Certification Requirements
Mid-career specialist staff recruiting results
The audit departments of the Company and its subsidiaries assess the risks inherent in the departments and operations to be audited (risk assessment) and determine the scope, frequency, and depth of internal audits accordingly, in order to allocate limited audit resources effectively and efficiently and conduct risk-based audits. In addition, we are working to increase the sophistication and efficiency of our operations
by ensuring sufficient cooperation between our internal audit departments and risk management departments, auditors, and financial auditors. In addition, audits are conducted into the suitability of cybersecurity management systems to ensure the safety of the Group’s information assets in light of recent cyberattacks and related threats.

 Fostering an Organizational Culture that Encourages Taking on Challenges and Growth and Strengthening Human Resources Development
We aim to foster an organizational culture that encourages taking on challenges and growth, and train and promote personnel who can provide financial services that meet customer expectations and earn their trust.
Improving Engagement
In order to realize a company where employees can work with pride, we regularly conduct an employee engagement survey to understand what employees find motivating and rewarding and the organizational factors that affect this. We survey employee views on the characteristics of the job, the work environment, and their sense of fulfillment, and use these results to derive indicators such as the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) and the outlook for the company. We then use these indicators to inform future personnel measures in an effort to create a workplace where staff can work more enthusiastically.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan
We have also introduced an employee stock ownership plan that assists employees in their planned asset formation and provides them with a sense of participation in management by paying incentives commensurate with the amount of savings and by regularly promoting the system.
As part of the Bank of Yokohama’s 100th anniversary project, we raised the incentive grant rate for employee stock ownership plans from October 2020, as well as the maximum amount of contributions eligible for the incentive plan.
Career Development Support
Internal Recruitment
To help support the development of our employees’ careers, we are offering MBA study abroad, a trainee system inside and outside the bank, a system for posting to specialized headquarters sections, dispatching to companies inside and outside the group, and other initiatives designed to de- velop highly specialized staff. We are also working on the management and strategic allocation of our human resources portfolio and systematic de- velopment of executive candidates.

We also provide career change training to support employees in taking on the challenges of new roles. Training recipients are officially placed in their new roles after their career change and are able to broaden their activities. In FY 2019, 44 employees changed careers, including the conversion to sales personnel of clerical personnel , which was achieved by improving operational efficiency, and the conversion from personal sales to corporate sales.
A Training and Development System that Encourages Taking on New Challenges and Growth
The Bank of Yokohama has assigned a full-time lecturer to provide training in various operations at its Financial Business School, which manages all education and training. In addition, systematic and planned training is provided for young employees, part-timers, managers, and executives. This includes intensive courses such as the Hamagin Management School, which is aimed at developing the leadership and management skills essential for driving forward the entire organization. Higashi-Nippon Bank revised its training system in FY 2017, improving the training offered for each course and rank in order to strengthen sales and management skills. It is also enhancing customer protection and compliance training to firmly establish an ethos of legal compliance and to develop bank-wide awareness of these issues.
TOPIC
The Bank of Yokohama will open an Accommodation typed raining facility on the upper floor of the Kawasaki Branch during fiscal 2020 as part of its 100th anniversary project. Taking advantage of its location between Tokyo and Yokohama, the facility will be used as a training facility that can be shared within the Group. The aim is to expand the scope of training and to increase the effectiveness of education, as well as to foster a sense of unity in the corporate culture.

Male employees are encouraged to take childcare leave
We also encourage men to take childcare leave in order to further enhance their work-life balance. At Bank of Yokohama, we are encouraging male employees whose spouse is expecting a baby to participate in child-rearing by holding seminars on parenting taught by outside instructors, with the aim of achieving 100% uptake of childcare leave by the end of fiscal 2020.

We value opportunities for dialogue with shareholders and investors. We have therefore established policies on system development and initiatives to promote constructive dialogue, and strive to actively communicate and improve internal systems.
In FY 2019, we held a briefing for institutional investors after announcing financial results (full-year and interim results). The videos for the briefing are available on our website.
In order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection, we decided to hold the May 2020 briefing after the announcement of these financial results by telephone conference, and from March 2020 onward we will no longer hold in-person individual meetings and small-scale meetings in Japan and abroad, but are further expanding the provision of information via the Internet, including telephone and online briefings.
The representative director reports the opinions of shareholders and investors expressed in these dialogues to the board of directors and the management team and shares them with them in a timely manner for reference in management.
We strive to make the annual general shareholders meeting held in late June every year easy for shareholders to understand, for example by showing videos on sustainability initiatives and by presenting business reports. At the 4th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 19, 2020 at the Hamagin Hall Viamare, a video of the business report to be screened on the day of the meeting was distributed on the Company’s website in advance of the meeting in order to enable shareholders to exercise their voting rights in advance via the Internet or in writing, and views of the meeting were distributed immediately after the meeting.
We will continue to hold dialogues with shareholders and investors and endeavor to clearly explain the Group’s businesses and financial situation.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2020
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, in accordance with the Enforcement Regulation for the Banking Act, and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorporated and operates. As permitted by the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, amounts less than one million yen have been omitted. As a result, the totals do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts. Yen amounts, other than per share amounts, have been rounded down to millions of yen. Yen per share amounts have been rounded down to two decimal places.
The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥108.83 to U.S. $1, the rate of exchange at March 31, 2020. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Principles of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its consolidated subsidiaries and its associates accounted for by the equity method.
The number of consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 were 13 and15, respectively.
Yokohama Operation Service Co., Ltd. and Hamagin Business Operations Center Co., Ltd. were excluded from the scope of consolidation as the liquidation completed during the year ended March 31, 2020.
The number of associates accounted for by the equity method as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 were 4 and 1, respectively.
PT Bank Resona Perdania, PT Resona Indonesia Finance, and StormHarbour Japan Ltd. were newly added as equity method investees from the year ended March 31, 2020 due to acquisition of shares.
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.
The balance sheet dates of the consolidated subsidiaries are the same as the balance sheet date of the Company.
The consolidated financial statements do not include the accounts of four subsidiaries in 2020, and five subsidiaries in 2019, because the total assets, total income, net income, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income of these entities would not have had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in the unconsolidated subsidiaries and associates to which the equity method accounting is not applied are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material.
All significant intercompany balances, transactions, and unrealized profits included in assets have been eliminated in consolidation.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition is amortized over a period of 5 to 10 years.
b. Trading-Purpose Transactions — “Transactions for trading purposes” (for the purpose of capturing gains arising from short-term changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, or market prices of securities and other market-related indices or from arbitrage opportunities) are included in “Trading assets” and “Trading liabilities” on a trade-date basis. Trading securities and monetary claims bought for trading purposes recorded in these accounts are stated at fair value and trading-related financial derivatives are stated at the amounts that would be settled if they were terminated at the end of the fiscal year.
Profits and losses on transactions for trading purposes are shown as “Trading income” or “Trading expenses” on a trade-date basis.
c. Securities — Securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management’s intent, as follows:
(1)Held-to-maturity debt securities, which are expected to be held to maturity with a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity,

are reported at amortized cost computed using the straight-line method.

(2)Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of equity. Securities whose fair values cannot be reliably determined are stated at cost determined by the moving-average method.
For other-than-temporary declines in fair value, securities are reduced to net realizable value by a charge to income.
d. Property, Plant and Equipment — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment owned by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries is computed mainly using the straight-line method.
The range of useful lives is from 2 to 60 years for buildings and from 2 to 20 years for equipment.
Depreciation of leased property and equipment owned by consolidated subsidiaries is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease periods.
e. Software — Cost of computer software obtained for internal use is amortized principally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years.
f. Long-Lived Assets — The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition.
g. Revaluation Reserve for Land — Under the “Law of Land Revaluation,” The Bank of Yokohama, Ltd. (“BOY”) elected a one-time revaluation of its own-use land to a value based on real estate appraisal information as of March 31, 1998.
The resulting revaluation reserve for land represents unrealized appreciation of land and is stated, net of income taxes, as a component of equity. There was no effect on the consolidated statement of income. Continuous readjustment is not permitted, unless the land value subsequently declines significantly, such that the amount of the decline in value should be removed from the revaluation reserve for land account and related deferred tax liabilities.
The carrying amount of the land after the above one-time revaluation exceeded the market value by ¥36,241 million ($ 333,009 thousand) and ¥36,405 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
h. Deferred Charges — Bond issue expenses are recognized as expense when incurred.
i. Allowance for Loan Losses — Major consolidated subsidiaries provide an allowance for loan losses, which is determined based on management’s judgment and an assessment of future losses based on major consolidated subsidiary’s self-assessment systems. These systems reflect past experience of credit losses, possible credit losses, business and economic conditions, the character, quality and performance of the portfolio, the value of collateral or guarantees, and other pertinent indicators.
Major consolidated subsidiaries have implemented a self-assessment system to determine its asset quality. The quality of all loans is assessed by branches and the credit supervisory division with a subsequent audit by the asset review and inspection division, which is independent from the operating divisions, in accordance with major consolidated subsidiary’s policy and guidelines for the self- assessment of asset quality.
Major consolidated subsidiaries have established a credit rating system under which its customers are classified into five categories. The credit rating system is used in the self-assessment of asset quality. All loans are classified into five categories for self-assessment purposes: “normal,” “in need of caution,” “possible bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “legal bankruptcy.”
The allowance for loan losses is calculated based on the actual historical loss ratio for “normal” and “in need of caution” categories; the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans; and other factors of solvency, including future cash flows for other categories. For claims to borrowers whose loans are classified as “possible bankruptcy” or “restructured loans” over a certain amount, for which future cash flows could be reasonably estimated, an allowance is provided for the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contracted interest rate and the carrying value of the claims (the “DCF method”). Also, for claims for which allowance has been provided based on the DCF method in previous fiscal years, an allowance is provided based on the DCF method.
For collateralized or guaranteed claims to borrowers who are in the “virtual bankruptcy” or “legal bankruptcy” category, the amount exceeding the estimated value of collateral or guarantees has been deducted as deemed uncollectible directly from those claims. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the deducted amounts were ¥ 36,874 million ($338,826 thousand) and ¥33,122 million, respectively.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Concordia Financial Group, Ltd. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2020
Other consolidated subsidiaries maintain allowances for possible loan losses that are provided as deemed necessary to cover expected losses based on their own experience.
(Additional Information)
The Group assumes that the Novel Coronavirus Infectious Diseases will have a significant impact for the first half of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 and will gradually ease toward the second half of the fiscal year. Therefore, the impact on the business performance of the Group’s borrowers is generally temporary, and the Group does not expect to incur a large amount of credit losses. However, the Group determines the borrower classification based on the impact on the cash flows of the borrowers. This assumption is uncertain, and actual credit losses may exceed the expected credit losses if the borrowers’ business performance deteriorates due to sluggish consumer spending or stagnant production activities.
j. Provision for Bonuses — Provision for bonuses is provided in the amount of the estimated bonuses that are attributable to each fiscal year.
k. Provision for Directors’ Bonuses — Provision for directors’ bonuses is provided in the amount of the estimated bonuses that are attributable to each fiscal year.
l. Provision for share-based compensation — Provision for share-based compensation is provided in the amount of the estimated payment based on the stock compensation system for directors, etc. of the Company and major consolidated subsidiaries that are attributable to each fiscal year.
m.Provision for Reimbursement of Deposits — Provision for reimbursement of deposits that were derecognized as liabilities under certain conditions is provided for possible losses on future claims of withdrawal based on historical reimbursement experience.
n. Provision for Contingent Losses — Provision for contingent losses is provided for contingent losses not covered by other provisions in an amount deemed necessary based on estimated losses in the future.
o. Reserve under Special Laws — Reserve under special laws is provided for contingent liabilities from brokering of security transactions in accordance with Section 1 of Article 46-5 of the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
p. Retirement and Pension Plans — Major consolidated subsidiaries have contributory funded defined benefit pension plans, lump- sum payment plans, and defined contribution pension plans for employees. Other consolidated subsidiaries have lump-sum payment plans, and some of these subsidiaries have defined contribution pension plans.
Major consolidated subsidiaries accounted for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 15 years within the average remaining service period. The discount rate is determined using a single weighted-average discount rate reflecting the estimated timing and amount of benefit payment.
q. Stock Options — Compensation expenses for employee stock options are recognized based on the fair value at the date of grant and over the vesting period as consideration for receiving goods or services in accordance with Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 8, “Accounting Standard for Stock Options”. Stock options granted to nonemployees are accounted for based on the fair value of either the stock option or the goods or services received. In the balance sheet, the stock option is presented as subscription rights to shares as a separate component of equity until exercised.
r. Leases — Finance leases that are deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as lease receivables, and finance leases that are not deemed to transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are recognized as investments in lease.
Lease revenue and lease costs are recognized over the lease period.
s. Income Taxes — The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences.

CONCORDIA Financial Group 80

t. Translation of Foreign Currencies — Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and accounts of overseas branches held by the Group are translated at exchange rates prevailing as of the balance sheet date.
u. Derivatives and Hedging Activities — Derivative financial instruments are classified and accounted for as follows: (a) all derivatives, except those entered into for hedging purposes, are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value with gains or losses on derivative transactions recognized in the statement of income or (b) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of a high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, the gains or losses on the derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions (deferral hedge accounting).
Consolidated banking subsidiaries apply deferral hedge accounting based on the rules of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 24 for interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk from various financial assets and liabilities as a whole. Under these rules, the effectiveness of a fair value hedge is assessed by an identified group of hedge deposits, loans, and similar instruments and by a corresponding group of hedging instruments, such as interest rate swaps in the same maturity category. Also, under these rules, the effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed based on the correlation between a base interest rate index of the hedged cash flow and that of the hedging instrument.
Consolidated banking subsidiaries apply deferral hedge accounting based on the rules of the JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No. 25 for currency swaps and funding swaps used for the purpose of currency exchange.
v. Cash and Cash Equivalents — For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents represent cash and due from the Bank of Japan.
w. Cash Dividends — Cash dividends charged to retained earnings are dividends paid during the year and represent year-end dividends for the preceding year and interim dividends for the current year.
x. Per Share Information — Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits.
Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted net income per share of common stock assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants.
Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective fiscal years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year.

z. Additional Information
(Stock compensation system that utilizes trusts) (1) Outline of Transactions
The Company introduced a stock compensation system that utilizes trusts (the “System”) for the purpose of sharing interests with its shareholders, and boosting the motivation to promote the sustainable growth of the Company group as a whole and to enhance corporate value over the medium to long term.
The System applies to the directors (excluding outside directors and non-executive directors) and the executive officers of the Company and major consolidated subsidiaries. In the System, the Company entrusts the trust bank with cash to the extent approved by resolution at the general meeting of shareholders of the Company, combined with the cash contributed by the subsidiaries to the extent approved by resolution at the general meeting of shareholders of the subsidiaries, and creates the trust in which the beneficiaries are directors, etc. who satisfy the beneficiary requirements. The trust acquires shares of the Company from the stock market by using the cash entrusted as the source of financing.
During the trust period, beneficiaries receive: a certain number of points that are awarded in accordance with the respective stock-granting rules of each companies; shares of the Company that are granted in the number accounting for a certain ratio of the number of such points; and cash in the amount equivalent to the conversion value of shares of the Company corresponding to the number of remaining points after the conversion of the shares in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement.
Under the System, two types of trusts are created. One type is the trust which executes the granting or payment (the “Granting, etc.”) of shares of the Company and cash in the amount equivalent to the conversion value of the Company shares (the “Shares of the Company, etc.”) after the retirement of directors, etc. according to their respective job positions, and the other type is the trust which executes the Granting, etc. of the Shares of the Company, etc. after the end of the medium-term management plan period according to the extent to which performance targets of the medium-term management plan have been fulfilled.
(2) Shares of the Company Residing in the Trust
Shares of the Company residing in the trust are recognized as treasury shares in equity at the carrying amounts in the trust. The carrying amounts of such treasury shares as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, were ¥1,107 million ($10,177 thousand) for 2,626 thousand shares and ¥531 million for 927 thousand shares, respectively.
(Gains and losses on cancellation of investment trusts)
Previously, gains on cancellation of investment trusts were presented as “Interest and dividends on securities” in “Interest income,” and losses on cancellation of investment trusts were presented as “Other operating expenses” for individual issues. However, with the revision of disclosures under the Banking Act, all gains and losses on cancellation of the issues are aggregated, and the gains on cancellation of investment trusts are presented as “Interest and dividends on securities” in “Interest income” or the losses on cancellation of investment trusts are presented as “Other operating expenses” from the current fiscal year.
In the consolidated statement of income for the previous fiscal year, losses on cancellation of investment trusts were included in “Other operating expenses” of ¥2,462 million. However, due to the above change, the total amount of “Other operating expenses” was changed from ¥39,367 million to ¥36,904 million, and the total amount of “Interest and dividends on securities” in “Interest income” was changed from ¥29,961 million to ¥27,498 million.

        “Past due loans”, include loans classified as “possible bankruptcy” and “virtual bankruptcy” under the Group’s self-assessment guidelines. Interest receivables on loans in these categories are not accrued as accruals for accounting purposes. The loans and bills discounted include “loans to borrowers in bankruptcy” totaling ¥ 3,396 million ($31,209 thousand) and ¥3,907 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as well as “past due loans” totaling ¥ 178,869 million ($1,643,569 thousand) and ¥164,757 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition to “past due loans” certain other loans classified as “in need of caution” under the Group’s self-assessment guidelines include “accruing loans contractually past due for three months or more.” “Accruing loans contractually past due for three months or more” are loans on which the principal and/or interest is three months or more past due, but exclude “loans to borrowers in bankruptcy” or “past due loans.” The balances of “accruing loans contractually past due for three months or more” as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, were ¥ 3,795 million ($34,872 thousand) and ¥4,026 million, respectively.
“Restructured loans” are loans for which BOY, The Higashi-Nippon Bank Ltd. (“HNB”) and its subsidiaries have restructured lending conditions, such as by a reduction of the original interest rate, forbearance of interest payments, principal repayments, or renunciation of claims to support the borrowers’ reorganization, but exclude “loans to borrowers in bankruptcy,” “past due loans,” and “accruing loans contractually past due for three months or more.” The outstanding balances of “restructured loans” as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, were ¥ 13,914 million ($127,859 thousand) and ¥12,811 million, respectively.
The allowance for loan losses is not deducted from the amounts of loans shown in the above three paragraphs.
Contracts of overdraft facilities and loan commitment limits are contracts under which the Group lends to customers up to the prescribed limits in response to customer applications for loans as long as there is no violation of any condition in the contracts. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts of unused commitments were ¥ 2,316,865 million ($21,288,851 thousand) and ¥2,281,540 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts of unused commitments whose remaining contract terms were within one year were ¥ 1,474,309 million ($13,546,903 thousand) and ¥1,523,069 million, respectively.
As many of these commitments expire without being drawn down, the unused amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement. Most of these contracts have conditions whereby the Group can refuse customer applications for loans or decrease the contract limits for certain reasons (e.g., changes in financial situation and deterioration in customers’ creditworthiness). At the inception of the contracts, the Group obtains real estate, securities, or other assets as collateral if considered to be necessary. Subsequently, the Group performs periodic reviews of the customers’ business results based on internal rules and takes necessary measures to reconsider conditions in the contracts and/or require additional collateral and guarantees.
Discounting bills are treated as secured lending transactions. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Group has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge bills discounted and foreign exchange bills bought, and their total face value was ¥39,437 million ($362,377 thousand) and ¥47,385 million, respectively.

   Major consolidated subsidiaries have defined benefit corporate pension plans, lump-sum payment plans, and defined contribution pension plans for their employees. In addition, it is possible for major consolidated subsidiaries to pay additional retirement benefits.
Major consolidated subsidiaries contribute to a retirement benefit trust to fund defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump- sum payment plans.
Other consolidated subsidiaries have lump-sum payment plans, and some of these subsidiaries have defined contribution pension plans. These subsidiaries recorded their net defined benefit liability at the amount that would be required if employees retired at each balance sheet date (the “simplified method”).
In the above schedule, the amount of retirement benefit plans is calculated by applying the simplified method for other consolidated subsidiaries.

18. EQUITY
Japanese banks are subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”) and the Banking Act. The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:
a. Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the stockholders meeting. Additionally, for companies that meet certain criteria including (1) having a Board of Directors, (2) having independent auditors, (3) having an Audit & Supervisory Board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than the normal two-year term by its articles of incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria.
The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends-in-kind (noncash assets) to stockholders subject to certain limitations and additional requirements.
Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the Board of Directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act and the Banking Act provide certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares.
b. Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve, and Surplus
The Banking Act requires that an amount equal to 20% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the total of the aggregate amount of the legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 100% of capital stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal retained earnings may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that capital stock, legal retained earnings, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus, and other retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the stockholders.

Similar to other market transactions, derivative transactions are subject to a variety of risks, including market, credit, and liquidity. Among those risks, the Group emphasizes establishing a risk management structure to understand and manage market risk and credit risk.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries hold lease receivables and installment receivables. These financial instruments are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates and credit risk.
(3) Risk Management for Financial Instruments
(a) Credit risk management
Under the consensus that credit risk is the risk with most influence on the Group’s financial stability, the Company has established a “Credit Policy” and takes every initiative to optimize its credit portfolio management and credit control of individual accounts.
In addition, the Company has developed an “Internal Credit Rating System” and a “Self-Assessment System” to categorize the credibility of debtors and individual loan projects from an independent point of view.
The Company monitors the credit risk management situation of the Group and the credit concentration risk of the whole our group. The Company provides guidance and advice as needed.
(b) Market risk management (foreign exchange risk and interest risk)
It is a fundamental policy of the Company to enter into market transactions that appropriately meet customers’ needs, which have been increasingly diversified due to the development of financial engineering (such as the emergence of various derivative transactions), as well as in transactions that enhance the profitability of the Group.
Management obtains the information related to the characteristic of the subsidiaries’ market risks for the risk evaluation and decision. Those actions are for monitoring whether the subsidiaries undertake appropriate risks with its financial strength and the returns are appropriate for those risks.
The status of compliance with various risk limits and profit and loss situation of the market business are directly reported to management on a daily basis. Those are based on the reports from the risk management post of the subsidiary. And those report the situation of the market risk in ALM and risk management meeting held every month.
Each bank of the Group separates the market operations into trading operations and banking operations. Each bank of the Group’s trading operations include profit-generating trading transactions that take advantage of short-term fluctuations and differences in value among markets in indices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and market quotations of financial instruments. The trading operations also deal with transactions for the purpose of mitigating possible losses incurred from the above-mentioned transactions. The financial instruments that are allowed to be dealt with in the trading operations include Japanese government bonds (“JGBs”), JGB futures, interest rate swaps, and interest rate futures. Operations other than trading operations are defined as banking operations. The trading operations are carried out in a rigid manner in compliance with each bank of the Group’s internal rules on definition of trading transactions, authorities for fair value calculation, and its methods.
The Group currently utilizes various effective measurement methods suitable for operational features and investment policies, in addition to Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) and Basis Point Value, to quantify market risk.
The Group performs quantitative analysis on market risks relating to all financial instruments in principle, using mainly VaR. In calculating VaR, the Company uses the historical simulation method (confidence interval: 99.9%, observation period: 1,250 days). As for holding periods, the Group has set 10 days for financial instruments for trading purposes and periods considered appropriate (primarily from one month to one year, based on the position settlement periods and other factors) for financial instruments for nontrading purposes (those for banking operations).
The aggregate amount of the market risks (estimated loss amount) of the Group’s trading business was ¥24 million ($221 thousand) and ¥31 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate amount of the market risks of the banking business, excluding market risks of unlisted equity securities and other financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably determined, stood at ¥150,598 million ($1,383,791 thousand) and ¥136,102 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. It should be noted that the aggregate amounts of market risks represent a simple sum of amounts of each market risk categorized by risk type.
It should be noted that VaR measures the amount of market risk at certain probability levels statistically calculated based on historical market fluctuations, and therefore, there may be cases where market risks cannot be captured in such situations where market conditions are changing dramatically beyond what was experienced historically.

  27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
(1) Group Policies for Financial Instruments
The Group engages in banking as its mainstay business, as well as securities, leasing, conducting survey research and other information services, venture capital, and other financial service businesses. As the Group positions services exclusively for local small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals as its core business, it is a fundamental policy of the Group to aim to minimize any adverse effects of economic fluctuations and the changing market environment and to provide financial services reliably. Under this policy, the Group endeavors to maintain sound management by continuously identifying, assessing, monitoring, and controlling the various risks inherent in financial instruments that correspond to the strategic goals of the Company, including medium-term management plans and management policies.
(2) Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments
The financial assets of the Group, which mainly consist of loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and personal housing loans, are exposed to customer credit risk. Securities mainly consist of debt securities, equity securities, and investment trusts, and are accounted for as trading securities, held-to-maturity securities, and available-for-sale securities. These securities are exposed to issuers’ credit risk and the risk of market price fluctuations.
The financial liabilities of the Group are mainly personal deposits, which consist of liquidity deposits and fixed deposits. These deposits are exposed to liquidity risk, such as losses generated by unexpected withdrawals.
There are certain mismatches in interest rates and contract periods between financial assets, such as loans, and financial liabilities, such as deposits, that are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. However, a part of this risk is mitigated by using interest-rate swap derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to foreign exchange risk that affects those values with changes of foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses swaps, futures, forward and option contracts, and other similar types of contracts based on either interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or securities prices. These financial instruments are used in trading activities to generate trading revenues and fee income and are also used in Asset and Liability Management (“ALM”) activities to control exposure to fluctuations in such market rates or prices.
The Group uses derivatives to provide customers with risk-hedging methods, to complement their ALM activities, to hedge market risks, and to strengthen earnings. The Group carefully studies the risks involved with derivative transactions and maintains a policy of limiting the volume of the risks within a range that it is capable of controlling based on its financial strength.
Derivatives used for hedging purposes are recorded on the basis of hedge accounting in accordance with the Japanese accounting standard for financial instruments. Such derivatives are interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward exchange contracts that are utilized to control the risks from loans and bills discounted, bonds, foreign currency monetary claims and debt, and equity. The Group reviews the effectiveness of hedging activities using the methods permitted under the accounting standards.

(c) Liquidity risk management
Managing liquidity risk is recognized as a top-priority issue for the Group. Each bank of the Group closely stipulates its internal regulations and the methods of liquidity risk management to be used in day-to-day operations, as well as appropriate countermeasures to be taken in case of concern or in critical situations regarding liquidity risk.
Risk supervisory department directly reports the status of compliance with various risk limits to management on a daily basis. Those are based on the reports from the risk management post of the subsidiaries. The situation of the liquidity risk and the situation of the fund raising are reported in ALM and risk management meeting held every month.
In case of concern or in critical situations related to liquidity risk for the subsidiary, the Company will take necessary actions for those issues. The crisis committee will order to set the task force in the subsidiary if the committee concludes it is necessary based on the reports from the subsidiary.
(4) Supplementary Explanation on Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments are based on their market prices and, in cases where market prices are not readily available, reasonably calculated prices. Such prices have been calculated using certain assumptions and these prices may differ if calculated based on different assumptions.
(5) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, other rational valuation techniques are used instead.

*1 Allowances for loan losses relevant to loans and bills discounted have been deducted.
*2 Derivative instruments include derivative transactions, both in trading assets and liabilities and other assets and liabilities. Derivative instruments
are presented net of assets and liabilities associated with derivative transactions.

Assets
(1) Cash and Due from Banks
The book values of due from banks with no maturities approximate fair value. For due from banks with maturities, the book values approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(2) Call Loans and Bills Bought
The book values of call loans and bills bought approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(3) Securities
The fair values of marketable equity securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for equity instruments. Fair values of bonds are measured at the reference statistical price of the Japan Securities Dealers Association or the quoted price obtained from financial institutions. Fair values of investment trusts are measured at the quoted price.
The fair values of private placements with floating interest rates approximate their book values as long as customers’ credit risks have not changed significantly after issuance because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rates. The fair values of private placements with fixed interest rates are determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate that consists of the risk-free rate and the credit risk premium that corresponds to the internal credit rating.
(4) Loans and Bills Discounted
The book values of loans and bills discounted with floating interest rates approximate fair value as long as customers’ credit risks have not changed significantly after lending because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rates.
The fair values of loans and bills discounted with fixed interest rates are mainly determined by discounting the future cash flows at rates that consist of the risk-free rate and the credit risk premium that corresponds to the internal credit rating. The book values of loans and bills discounted with maturities less than one year approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
For loans to customers deemed as “legal bankruptcy,” “virtual bankruptcy,” and “possible bankruptcy,” an allowance for credit losses is provided based on the DCF method or based on amounts expected to be collected through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees. The book value, net of the reserve, as of the consolidated balance sheet date is a reasonable estimate of the fair values of those loans.
The book values of loans and bills discounted that do not have fixed maturities due to loan characteristics, such as limited loan amounts within the value of pledged assets, approximate fair value due to their expected repayment periods and interest rate conditions.
Liabilities
(1) Deposits and (2) Negotiable certificates of deposit
The fair values of demand deposits are recognized as payment at the date of the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows grouped by product and by the remaining duration at the rates that would be applied for similar new contracts. The book values of the deposits with maturities less than one year approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities.
(3) Call Money and Bills Sold and (4) Payables under securities lending transactions
The book values of call money and bills sold and payables under securities lending transactions approximate fair value because they have short maturities of one year or less.
(5) Borrowed Money
The book value of borrowed money with floating interest rates approximates fair value because the market rates are promptly reflected in the floating interest rate and the credit risks of the Group have not changed significantly after borrowing. The fair value of borrowed money with fixed interest rates is determined by discounting future cash flows at the rate that would be applied for similar new contracts. The book value of borrowed money with maturity of less than one year approximates fair value because of its short maturity period.
Derivatives
The fair values of derivative instruments are measured at the market price or determined using the discounted cash flow method or option-pricing model.
(b)Consolidated balance sheet amount of financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably determined

Under the ASBJ Statement No. 17, “Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” and ASBJ Guidance No. 20, “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Segment Information Disclosures,” an entity is required to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available, and such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decisionmaker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally, segment information is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.
The above interest rate swaps with special hedging treatment that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expense or income. In addition, the fair value of such interest rate swaps in Note 27 is included in the hedged items (i.e., loans and bills discounted).

The components of other comprehensive income for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, consisted of the following:

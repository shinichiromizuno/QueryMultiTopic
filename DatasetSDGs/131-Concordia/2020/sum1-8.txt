Vision
In Kanagawa and Tokyo, where Corporate customers are at various stages of growth, we will contribute in the development of our customers’ businesses as an indispensable financial group in the region by providing optimal solutions through business evaluation, leveraging the customer base built up over the years.
Medium-Term Management Plan Strategy
We will assist with financing and strengthen our Group-wide solutions provision system. In addition to establishing and strengthening direct sales functions from headquarters to customers, we established the Solutions Sales Department in April 2019 at the headquarters of the Bank of Yokohama to team up with corporations and individuals to solve customer problems. Higashi- Nippon Bank is also increasing the number of solution sales staff at its headquarters.
We are also providing new solutions such as personnel placement as well as developing Internet services for corporations with work area consultation and information provision functions.
 Increased Sophistication and Diversification of Solution Sales
We contribute to the revitalization and healthy development of the local economy by supporting the growth and revitalization of local small and medium-sized enterprises and by helping to increase the corporate value of core companies in the region.
Startup Growth Maturity Transformation
In addition to ordinary loans, we also provide capital loans, which are long-term stable funds, and funds in cooperation with Yokohama Capital (a subsidiary of the Bank of Yokohama) and external institutions to provide a variety of funding options, as well as propose appropriate solutions to support corporate growth.
     Objectives of the Medium-Term Management Plan and Solution Delivery System
In addition to making the most of the functions of the Group’s companies, we are also expanding the appointment of professional personnel and partnerships with outside experts. In addition, our branch managers are strengthening top sales.

Expanded Partnerships
As a regional financial institution, we actively support local companies in their efforts to promote SDGs management and to help build a sustainable society through their core businesses.
The Bank of Yokohama promotes SDGs in the region in cooperation with local governments in Kanagawa Prefecture and Yokohama City, both of which have been selected as SDGs future cities. In December 2018, we signed a partnership agreement with Kanagawa Prefecture to promote the SDGs, and we are implementing a variety of joint measures, including holding SDGs seminars for small and medium-sized enterprises.
In addition, we offer the SDGs Friends Loan, a program that enables small and medium-sized business owners to identify the relevance of their management philosophies and plans to the SDGs goals, the actions they will take to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs through their businesses, and the impact they will have on society, through dialogue with corporate managers. Approximately 1,800 companies (as of March 31, 2020) have used the service since it was launched in October 2019.
The Hamagin Research Institute, one of our group companies, regularly introduces SDGs management in a booklet issued to its member companies and holds SDGs seminars, inviting experts to speak to promote the penetration of the SDGs in the community.

  COVID-19-related support
for companies
To support customers suffering losses through, or affected by, COVID-19, we are implementing a range of measures not only to provide financing support but also capital support and core business support with an eye on post- COVID scenarios to meet customer needs and problems.
Rapid Cash-Flow Support
In principle, the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank remain open at all branches in principle, even during the state of emergency, and have established a dedicated service desk and toll-free number for consultation on new loans, changes in terms and conditions, and other matters related to cash-flow.
The Bank of Yokohama is working to provide quick and detailed cash-flow support through the COVID-19 Emergency Fund, a proprietary loan that partially expands the decision-making authority of branch managers. For our large corporate customers, we work closely with the Chiba Bank, signatory to the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership Agreement, to quickly syndicate loans and provide funds.
Higashi-Nippon Bank supports customers’ cash flow stabilization with a special loan fund that utilizes the Bank of Japan’s ‘Special Operations for Corporate Financial Assistance for COVID-19’.
Cooperation with Local Governments and Credit Guarantee Associations
In cooperation with local governments and credit guarantee associations, we are actively involved in institutional financing, including essentially interest-free loans. At the Bank of Yokohama, we have established a one-stop system through which customers can apply for loans as well as request certifications and guarantees from credit guarantee associations. These operations are carried out by local governments through the bank. We also dispatch bank staff to credit guarantee associations and support the digitization of guarantee operations to ensure a speedy supply of funds.
Equity Finance
The Bank of Yokohama has established a crisis response framework for the Business Equity Loan, a capital loan that enables borrowed money to be treated as capital for credit examination in response to losses in equity capital due to temporary deficits resulting from the effects of COVID-19. In addition to improving balance sheets by capitalizing loans, the Bank has extended the maximum repayment period from 10 to 15 years for lump-sum repayment, providing customers with longer-term, stable funding.
We also provide capital support to meet the various needs of our customers, such as arranging hybrid loans where credit rating agencies evaluate a certain percentage of the funding amount as capital.
Issue of Subordinate Corporate Bonds
The Company will issue unsecured corporate bonds (subordinated corporate bonds) with a prepayment clause in the form of a public offering that limits the use of funds to provide cash flow support to customers affected by COVID-19. Funds raised by subordinated bonds will be provided as a subordinated loan to the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank and will be used to provide loans to customers affected by COVID-19 to support their cash flow.
Supporting Customers’ Overseas Business
Within the context of diversification of customers’ overseas business, we are utilizing Bank of Yokohama overseas offices, and overseas bank networks provided by the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank, to support overseas expansion, expansion of overseas sales channels, inbound response support, etc.
In Asia, we have further expanded our network supporting trading partners through our investment in Bank Resona Perdania in Indonesia.
We have also begun to provide financial support to our customers through our overseas offices and those of Chiba Bank, our partner in the Chiba-Yokohama Partnership.
  We aim to grow overseas business income by accumulating
overseas assets through support for corporate business growth
and increased investment capabilities. We plan to roughly double
our overseas assets to over 400 billion yen by FY 2021 by
extending cross-border loans from Japan(*), expanding our
overseas network to facilitate lending to customers’ local entities,
and collaborating with other regional financial institutions.
(*) This is a method of direct financing from Japan to a customer’s local entity overseas.

Endorsement of the Kanagawa Zero Plastic Trash Declaration
The Bank of Yokohama supports the Kanagawa Zero Plastic Litter Declaration that Kanagawa Prefecture, an SDGs future city, has established to eliminate plastic waste and supports efforts to tackle microplastic issues.
To commemorate the expansion of the use of the SDGs Friends Loan supporting SDGs management initiatives by local companies, we donated 5 million yen to the Kanagawa Coastal Beautification Foundation Public Interest Foundation Corporation The donation is used for coastal cleanup and coastal beautification awareness in an effort to solve the microplastic problem.
Environmental protection and social contributions through investment
The Bank of Yokohama invests in Sustainability Bonds issued by the Railway Construction and Transport Facilities Development Support Agency Independent Administration Corporation to reduce the environmental impact and improve transportation infrastructure essential to local life, and also invests in Social Bonds (JICA bonds) issued by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Independent Administration Corporation. The funds raised by JICA bonds will be used for the resolution of social issues in developing countries and for the sound development of the Japanese and international economy through Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects funded by JICA.
Environmental protection and social contributions through loans
The Bank of Yokohama, in cooperation with the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, has provided SDGs Social Loans to Pacifico Yokohama (official title: Yokohama International Peace Conference Center), one of the largest MICE complexes in Japan, for the large-scale renovation of the facility. The projects covered by the loan have been assessed by an external evaluator in accordance with the Social Bond Principles published by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and other principles for social bonds, including the achievement of a sustainable environment.
Hamagin Forest
The Bank of Yokohama supports the Kanagawa 50-Year Reforestation Plan to pass on the rich blessings of the forests of Kanagawa Prefecture to the next generation, and uses CSR Environment Private Bonds donations as a Forest Revitalization Partner working on reforestation. As part of this activity, we acquired naming rights to the forest owned by the prefecture on the banks of Lake Tanzawa and named it Hamagin Forest.
Environmental considerations in corporate activities
Marine conservation efforts through the company cafeteria
The Bank of Yokohama is the first bank in Japan to offer a menu of Sustainable Seafood (*) in its headquarters employee cafeteria. Incorporating sustainable marine products into the company cafeteria menu encourages each employee to change his or her food awareness and behavior.
(*) Sustainable seafood is not over-fished and is caught in a way that is environmentally friendly. There are two types of fisheries products - fish caught in the wild in consideration of marine resources and the environment and farmed fish raised in a way that minimizes their impact on the environment. Both require certification by an inspection organization (e.g. MSC or ASC certification).
‘Plastic-free’ and ‘paperless’ efforts
With ‘plastic-free’ in mind, the Bank of Yokohama and Higashi-Nippon Bank have switched to the environmentally friendly Limex material for the bags used in branches to hold documents and other items, and for fans distributed in branches during the Cool Biz period. We also use LIMEX for our employee business cards and our leaflets to shareholders in consideration of the environmental issues facing the world, such as deforestation and water shortages.

Addressing Climate Change (Tackling TCFD Recommendations)
The Concordia Financial Group endorses the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Information Disclosure (TCFD)(*) and will work to enhance disclosure of information on climate change as recommended by the TCFD and take appropriate action.
(*)TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures): A privately-led task force established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in December 2015 to encourage companies to disclose climate-related information
lWe established the Group SDGs Committee, chaired by the President of the company, to centrally manage the formulation and progress of policies on climate change initiatives.
lWe will establish a Group SDGs policy and formulate action plans concerning risks and opportunities for social issues including climate change, and report regularly to Directors’ meetings.
We have identified the Group’s Materiality on social issues including climate change.
We will work on the management of these assets and analyze the impact of physical risks and transition risks.
Based on the IEA 2°C Scenario and IEA Decision Policy Scenario (4°C Scenario) for transition risk as scenarios that might impact the management of the Group and based on IPCC’s RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios for physical risk, we will initiatives concerning the evaluation of risks and opportunities. (*1, 2)
l The ratio of carbon-related assets (electricity, energy etc.) to loans(*) is 0.3%.
lWe are working to construct a management system for credit risk, risk related to the Group’s tangible fixed assets,
operational risk etc. based on the impact of climate change risks on the Group’s loans.
lRecognizing the risks due to climate change, we will introduce policies for business related to coal-fired power generation, deforestation, and palm oil plantations, and work to limit the increase in carbon-related assets.
lThese risks will be managed within a comprehensive risk management framework, with an eye to the degree of impact and probability of climate change risks (physical risks and transition risks).
Policy for Specific Sectors
The Concordia Financial Group has a Sector Policy to ensure that loans and other financing are carefully judged to reduce or avoid the environmental and social impacts of investments and loans that are likely to contribute to negative environmental and social impacts.
1 Coal-fired power generation business
We will not, in principle, engage in new investments in or loans for coal-fired power generation projects that are likely to have a negative impact on the environment. However, when considering exceptional measures, we will carefully consider each project’s background and characteristics, such as power generation efficiency and performance, impact on the environment, and impact on local communities, with reference to international guidelines etc.
2 Cluster bomb manufacturing business
New investments in and loans to companies that manufacture cluster munitions are prohibited, regardless of the use of the funds.
3 Palm oil plantation development business
From the perspectives of conservation of forest resources and biodiversity and protection of human rights, we prohibit new investments and loans for those developments of palm oil plantations that may involve human rights violations such as illegal logging and child labor. In addition, investments and loans for palm oil plantation development will be made with careful attention to the status of certification by the RSPO(*1), the international certification for sustainable palm oil, as well as consideration for local communities and the environment.
4 Deforestation projects
We make new investments and loans for forest harvesting projects with great care, taking into account whether they have received international
certifications (FSC(*2), PEFC(*3) etc.) and the consideration given to local communities and the environment.
(*1) RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil): An organization that develops globally trusted certification standards to promote sustainable palm oil production and use
(*2) FSC (Forest Stewardship Council): A non-profit organization that operates an international forest certification system based on the principle of appropriate, socially beneficial, and
economically sustainable forest management from the perspective of environmental protection
(*3) PEFC (Forest Certification Program): An international umbrella organization that promotes examination of forest certification systems that have been individually developed in each
country based on the Intergovernmental Process for Sustainable Forest Management, which covers 85% of the world’s forests, and that promotes mutual recognition of these systems

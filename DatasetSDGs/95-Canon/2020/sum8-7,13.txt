realized in the smallest installation space for a model in its class. This not only makes it easy to select the installation site, but also reduces installation time and costs. The system is automatically switched to standby mode during intervals between examinations, reducing standby power consumption. In addition, the optimal running of the magnet cooling system helps significantly reduce power consumption during a non-operational state. These functions allow running costs to be reduced without the operator’s involvement. Compared with the previous model, annual electric power consumption is reduced by up to 34%, while lifecycle CO2 emissions are reduced by 181 tons. These and other improvements not only raise quality standards at the medical frontline but also contribute significantly to environmental progress.

Contributing to CO2 Reduction Across the Whole of Society
In addition to reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions through hardware measures, we are deploying IT solutions to improve the efficiency of work operations, reduce the movements of people and objects, and realize savings in the consumption of resources and energy. This also promotes CO2 reduction in the office and in society as a whole. For example, the computerization of paper documents not only allows more efficient document management, but also contributes to savings in paper resources used and storage space required, enabling customer enterprises to reduce resource consumption and CO2 emissions. By delivering to society a range of IT solutions in addition to the hardware-based CO2 reductions, Canon will continue contributing to reducing CO2 emissions not only in its own operations but also in society as a whole, moving thus toward the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050.
Helping Customers Reduce Their Environmental Impact
Using the Carbon Offset Program (Japan) Canon promotes initiatives that help customers reduce their CO2 emissions.
To enable customers to select products with lower CO2 emissions, we strive to disclose relevant information and are also in the process of obtaining carbon footprint (CFP) certification under the Sustainable Management Promotion Organization (SuMPO)’s CFP communication program.
Additionally, by utilizing the Carbon Offset Program making use of CFP* promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, we have been able to realize products with practically zero lifecycle CO2 emissions. With some of these products, such as the imageRUNNER ADVANCE series and the imagePRESS production printers, customers can report to the authorities, based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures (Japan), that they do not produce the CO2 emissions that would ordinarily be expected from use of the products.
Carbon offsets linked to customer demand from when we began using this system in 2014 until 2019 totaled 31,484 t-CO2.

CO2 Reduction Through Initiatives at Operational Sites
Canon created the Energy Cost Reduction Working Group in 2014 as a horizontally integrated organization to take Group-wide action on reducing energy consumption. In an approach whose key concept is the 5Gs*, the group has worked to reduce energy consumption by undertaking a thorough-going review of operating conditions at production facilities, for instance by cutting out excess use of pressurized air and cooling water and adjusting air conditioner settings. Measures that prove effective are adopted for horizontal rollout to Japan and overseas production sites. Meanwhile, staff from a dedicated department at Head Office carry out energy-efficiency diagnosis on visits to production sites and suppliers all over the world. There, they check the operating status and settings of production equipment and then use their observations to make improvements to the operating efficiency of facilities and equipment and provide staff with relevant on-site training. Since the launch of this initiative, it has resulted in a Group-wide energy saving of 125,390 kL (crude oil equivalent).
System of Energy Cost Reduction Working Group
* The 5Gs is an operational improvement methodology for problem- solving. It adds theory “genri” and principle “gensoku,” which are the foundation of decision making, to the well-known 3Gs—visit the actual site “genba” in person and recognize the actual facts “genjitsu” through the actual parts or things “genbutsu.” The 5Gs takes its name from the five Japanese terms, all of which start with the letter g.
One example of this involves Oita Canon Materials, a domestic subsidiary engaged in production. The company turned its attention to the energy wasted while equipment is not in operation and responded with systematic energy- saving activities coordinated between its manufacturing, technology, and facility departments. Through the combination of a range of improvement measures, it achieved a yearly CO2 reduction of 300 tons. Meanwhile, one of our overseas production companies, Canon Vietnam, is progressing with energy-saving activities at its three plants in Vietnam based on collaboration between two departments. They have managed to reduce air-conditioning load by introducing air conditioning incorporating ceiling fans, installing ice heat storage tanks, switching to LED lighting, and reducing heat emission from production facilities. This and a range of other measures has achieved a yearly CO2 reduction of around 2,000 tons. We are producing steadily growing results by rolling out a variety of initiatives of this kind at operational sites in Japan and overseas.
In 2019, thanks to a rigorous program of energy conservation measures across operational sites in Japan and overseas, led by the activities of the Energy Cost Reduction Working Group, we achieved a year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 50 kt-CO2 to 1,041 kt-CO2.
A reduction of approximately 13% was achieved in CO2 generated in association with production activities (equipment and facilities, etc.). However, due to the fixed amounts of CO2 generated independently of production volume (air-conditioning, lighting, etc.), this was not enough to absorb fluctuations in sales and the amount generated per unit of consolidated sales increased slightly.

this electric power, generation from renewable sources accounted for around 80%. Going forward, we will continue to promote the use of renewable energies based on deploying the right resource in the right place from the viewpoint of economic efficiency.
CO2 Reduction in Logistics
In order to reduce CO2 emissions from the logistics process, Canon has undertaken several initiatives: modal shifts that utilize transport modes with a lower environmental impact, improving loading efficiency by downsizing of products and packaging, diversion or direct-shipment from production sites, and shortening routes by consolidating distribution centers. In addition to these initiatives, to further improve transport efficiency, instead of the traditional one-way transport of containers with cargo, we have been actively pursuing Container Round Use (CRU), which includes not just containers within the Canon Group, but also containers imported by other companies for us to export. We are working with carriers and container transporters to expand the initiative. Also, in our overseas sites such as Vietnam, we have been promoting the same initiative.
Overview of Container Round UseStart of Kiyohara Industrial Park Smart Energy Project Involving Collaboration between Five Companies
In a joint project with Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., and
three other enterprises*, Canon has launched
the Kiyohara Industrial Park Smart Energy
Project, which aims to realize major energy savings. The Kiyohara Industrial Park, located in Utsunomiya City, Tochigi Prefecture, is the location for Japan’s first multi-plant integrated energy-saving project, which has introduced shared use of electric power and heat (steam and hot water) between a number of business sites with differing levels of demand. The aim is to realize benefits that would not be possible at a single business site operating in isolation—an energy saving of approximately 20%, a reduction in CO2 emissions, and improved corporate resilience.

Use of Renewable Energy
As of the end of 2020, Canon aims to derive from renewable sources at least 300MWh of the energy it uses at sites in Japan, and at least 85,000MWh of the energy it uses at sites outside Japan. We are currently working to expand the use of renewable energy, especially in Europe, while keeping regional renewable energy uptake status and economic efficiency under consideration. Canon Production Printing in the Netherlands is engaged in the introduction and operation of a geothermal HVAC system that uses the temperature differential with groundwater to power heating and cooling systems.
As a result of these initiatives adapted to local conditions, total renewable energy consumption by Canon Group companies worldwide in 2019 was 80,647MWh. Canon Group companies in Europe sourced about 33% of total energy needs from electric power. Of

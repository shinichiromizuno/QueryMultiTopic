Initiatives for Realizing a Low-Carbon Society
Canon tracks CO2 emissions throughout the product lifecycle (materials procurement, activities at operational sites, distribution, and customer use) and works to reduce emissions at each stage.
In the materials procurement and customer use stages, we strive to reduce CO2 emissions through effective product development (including making products smaller and lighter, using recycled materials, and using energy-saving designs). And, in the activities at operational sites and distribution stages, we strive to reduce CO2 emissions in activities at operational sites and in the distribution process.
CO2 Reduction in Product Development
Energy-Saving Office Equipment
For its office multifunction devices (MFD) and laser printers, Canon uses energy-saving technologies, including on- demand fixing and induction heating (IH) fixing to reduce the amount of electricity needed during operation.

imageRUNNER ADVANCE with the earlier model).

products. For example, we have begun employing low-
melt-point toner in new products, enabling fixing at lower
temperatures than traditional toner. In the imageRUNNER 60 ADVANCE C5500 series of office multifunction devices (MFD),
we reduced standby power consumption with a newly 40 developed main controller and operating power consumption
with a newly developed toner with optimized melt properties. 20 Through such measures as lowering products’ typical energy consumption (TEC) rating, we achieved about 47% lower 0 CO2 emissions during use than with the previous model, and

achieved a cumulative energy savings of 31,359GWh
(equivalent to a reduction of 15,417,000 tons of CO2).

efficiency and reduced energy consumption by making improvements to the manufacturing process and to equipment, allowing an increased number of layers to be produced per batch.
We are also continually working to optimize facilities operations. We optimized refrigeration
at our Ayase site and temperature and humidity management in the production area of Taiwan Canon, allowing more efficient use of energy.
We are constantly expanding energy-saving initiatives that prove effective at one site to other sites within the Canon Group.
In addition, we are promoting green building initiatives at our sales offices. Canon Canada’s new head office has improved energy efficiency thanks to the use of highly energy-efficient devices such as lighting and blinds that adjust automatically depending on the amount of external light.
As a result, total greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 were 1,118,721 tons, down approximately 3.9% compared to 2015.

Initiatives to Improve Energy Efficiency at Operational Sites
Canon’s development, manufacturing, and facilities and environment divisions are working together to improve energy efficiency and lower the company’s CO2 emissions.
In particular, we are strengthening cooperation with products operations to eliminate wastage and optimize production processes and facility operation while maintaining the required quality of products and parts.
For example, in the manufacture of fluoride crystals by Canon Optron Inc., we improved production

* Canon’s calculation of total greenhouse gas emissions
Calculation of energy-derived greenhouse gas CO2, and the non-energy derived greenhouse gases, PFCs, HFCs, SF6, N2O, methane, and NF3. Through 2014, conversion to CO2 is made using annual coefficients for each region. Coefficients supplied by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment and the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan are used for site activities in Japan, and coefficients supplied by the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used for site activities in regions outside Japan. From 2015, CO2 conversion coefficients from the Electric Power Council for a Low Carbon Society are used, and where coefficients are not provided by electric power companies, publicly provided coefficients by region are used. As there is a delay between compilation and disclosure of data, CO2 conversion coefficients are adjusted retroactively.
Note: Sales outlets (worldwide) of marketing companies included in data count have been expanded starting in 2013.

Contributing to Increased Use of Renewable Energy
Use of Renewable Energy Suited to Regional Characteristics
To increase the use of renewable energy, which is a SDG target, preparation of infrastructure suited to regional characteristics is under way.
Canon aims through the end of 2020 to derive from renewable sources at least 130MWh of
the energy it uses at sites in Japan, and at least 85,000MWh of the energy it uses at sites outside Japan.
We are currently working to expand the use
of renewable energy, especially in Europe, while keeping regional renewable energy uptake status and economic feasibility under consideration. For example, three main sites of Axis Communications AB (Sweden) and three group companies of
Océ purchase nearly 100% of their energy from renewable sources.

CO2 Reduction in Logistics
In order to reduce CO2 emissions from product distribution, Canon has undertaken several initiatives: modal shifts that utilize delivery methods with a lower environmental impact, improving capacity-related efficiency by reducing the size of products and packaging, changing shipping routes to make them more direct from production sites, and shortening routes by consolidating logistics warehouses.
In addition to these initiatives, to further improve distribution efficiency, instead of the traditional one- way ocean freight containers, we have been actively pursuing Container Round Use, which includes not just containers within the Canon Group, but also cooperation with other companies, using containers imported by them for export by us. By working with shipping companies and carriers to expand the initiative in regions where it is needed, we achieved a reduction of about 2,200 containers in Japan.
We are now working to adopt this initiative at our overseas sites, and have already expanded it to China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia.
Overview of Container Round Use
other products, previously transported their own parts and materials, but by operating trucks jointly, they are increasing shipping efficiency. For example, by having trucks arranged by Oita Canon Materials carry parts from Oita Canon’s suppliers, the number of trips decreased and CO2 emissions were reduced by 130 tons per year.
In 2016, CO2 emissions from logistics amounted to 292,000 tons, a decrease of 21,000 tons compared to 2015.

Supporting Reductions in Customers’ Environmental Impact (Using Carbon Offset System) (Initiatives in Japan) Canon promotes initiatives that help customers reduce their CO2 emissions.
So that customers can select the products with the lowest CO2 emissions, we have worked to disclose relevant information and obtain carbon footprint (CFP) certification under the Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry’s CFP communication program.
In addition, by utilizing the Carbon Offset Program making use of CFP promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, we have been able to realize products with practically zero lifecycle CO2 emissions. When using these products, customers can report to the authorities, based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, that they do not produce the CO2 emissions that would ordinarily be expected from use of the products.
We are working to expand our lineup of zero-emissions products. In 2016, we added

In the case of the imagePRESS C65, one unit
serves to offset lifecycle CO2 emissions of 4,800kg- CO2. For this reason, the “adjusted emissions,” which subtract this amount from the 2,700kg CO2 per
unit of emissions from use, can be reported to the authorities as a net zero.
It has also become possible to use carbon offsets with printed matter produced by production printers.

Response to Large-Scale Natural Disasters
Product Use
(Disaster Monitoring with Network Camera) Because Taiwan is plagued nearly every year by flooding caused by powerful typhoons and heavy rain, causing crop damage and posing a danger to people, a Hydrological Conditions Instant Video Surveillance System has been introduced. Surveillance cameras were installed along the southwestern coastal areas to monitor flood-warning levels and automatically sound alarms as the possibility of a flood increases.

For the Earth Contributing to the Realization of a Circular Economy Working to Maximize Resource Efficiency
Pursuing Product-to-Product Recycling
Issues and Approaches
For humans to continue sustainable consumption
and production, we must address the issues of limited natural resources and waste generated when using these resources. To do so, it is necessary to realize
a recycling-oriented society in which resources are used and reused in an efficient manner. In Europe, for example, deliberations are proceeding on the creation of a circular economy.
Canon is continuing initiatives to make products smaller and lighter, to reuse and recycle products, and to improve resource efficiency. We are also working
to reduce waste at operational sites. In particular, as a product initiative Canon is pursuing “product-to-product recycling” as a way of recycling and reusing resources.
These initiatives provide a framework that encourages resources to be circulated continuously, rather than only once. By establishing a framework that involves recycling resources from product to product, we aim for the continued, long-term reuse of resources.
Guided by this aim, we are carrying out initiatives in the remanufacturing of MFD for offices, a process that takes used products and turns them into products with the same level of quality as brand-new items, as well as in closed-loop recycling of toner cartridges.

Pursuit of Product-to-Product Resource Recycling
Canon carries out remanufacturing, which takes used office MFD and turns them into products with the same level of quality as brand-new items.

 In the remanufacturing process, MFD are disassembled
to the component level and cleaned using optimal 30,000
technologies. Deteriorated and worn components are
replaced in accordance with strict reproduction standards. 20,241 The used devices are then put through a production and 20,000
inspection process on par with lines for products made using
entirely new components, thereby sufficiently confirming
quality and reliability. The remanufactured products are 10,000
ready to be shipped after this process is completed. 5,837 7,277

In addition, we conduct closed-loop recycling in which 3,384 5,047 we extract plastic materials from used toner cartridges and 0 2,453
use them as materials for new ones. 2012 2013
In the past five years of implementing these initiatives, we used 19,350 tons of plastic extracted from used products as materials for new products and reused 14,853 tons of products and components. Going forward, we will continue to reduce the amount of resources we use through the pursuit of product-to-product recycling.

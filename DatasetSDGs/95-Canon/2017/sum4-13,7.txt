For the Earth Contributing to the Realization of a Low-Carbon Society
Toward a Next Stage for Further Reductions in CO2 Emissions throughout Product Lifecycle. Supporting Customers’ Low-Carbon Activities through Energy- Efficient Technologies and Carbon Offsets
Issues and Approaches
Adopted at the Conference of Parties 21 (COP21) held in December 2015, the Paris Agreement, which promises to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, went into effect in November 2016. At the Marrakech Climate Change Conference (COP22), each participating country decided to finalize important rules for carrying out the Paris Agreement by 2018.
Amid these kinds of global trends, detailed policies are being formulated so that each country is able to reach their established targets. These policies will include the establishment of specific targets for the industrial sector as well as the strengthening of regulations on energy efficiency.
To realize a low-carbon society and to pursue become completely carbon free, it is important for corporations to improve the efficiency of their activities throughout the entire product lifecycle.
In addition to initiatives at its production sites,
Canon is working to improve CO2 efficiency throughout the entire product lifecycle, from use of raw materials, operational site activities, and distribution to product use, disposal, and recycling. In the lifecycle, as CO2 emissions during product use has relatively a large portion and customers are demanding greater energy efficiency, we are working hard to make our products more energy efficient during product use. Additionally, we are utilizing a carbon-offset program in Japan to assist our customers in their low-carbon activities.

Expanding Carbon Offsets to the imagePRESS Series
With regard to energy savings for office equipment, we have used energy-saving technologies. These include on- demand and IH fixing technologies, which reduce standby power consumption. As a result, we have achieved cumulative energy savings of 31,359 GWh between 2008 and 2016 (equivalent to a reduction of 15,417,000 tons of CO2).
Along with promoting the development of such energy- saving technologies, we are making use of a carbon-offset program promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan to support our customers in reducing CO2 emissions during product use.
In addition to the Refreshed series of remanufactured multifunction devices (MFDs) and the imageRUNNER ADVANCE series of office MFDs, we expanded the range of products eligible for carbon offset in 2016 to include the imagePRESS series of production printers.
In the case of the imagePRESS C65, capable of printing high-resolution pamphlets, we have offset 4,800 kg of lifecycle CO2 emissions per product in response to the request of customers.
By transferring the amount of offset CO2 to our customers, we have eliminated CO2 emissions per product during product use (2,700 kg/CO2) as 0. This transfer also allows customers to report these reductions to authorized ministries in accordance with the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures.
Furthermore, customers are now able to offset CO2 emissions of printed items created with imagePRESS.

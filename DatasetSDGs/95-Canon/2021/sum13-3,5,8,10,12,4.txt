 Basic Approach
Continually passing on the spirit of “Respect for humanity” that has been a hallmark of Canon since our foundation in 1937, we adopted the corporate philosophy kyosei as the cornerstone of our business activities in 1988 in line with the global development of our business. Kyosei is the aspiration to create a
religion or culture, live and work together for the common good.
The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected everyone’s lives along with economic activity, strengthening the demands across society for safety and security both at work and at home. With the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), companies are expected to create the scientific and technological innovations to help realize a society in which everyone can play an active role.
Besides business activities, Canon’s response to this situation is to focus on implementing a range of multifaceted corporate citizenship initiatives to help people and society. A core aim in playing our role as a good corporate citizen is to ensure Canon’s continued growth and development as an enterprise. In addition, we hope to contribute to achieving the SDGs through this approach.

Under “Responding to People and Society as a Good Corporate Citizen,” we have identified the three areas of “Human Rights and Labor,” “Product Responsibility” and “Social Contribution” as the material basis for Canon Group business activities. We believe it is important to contribute to the continued development
activities to the societal changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and various other factors, and in the way that we strive to meet the expectations and demands of stakeholders.

We also have programs in place to support the health of employees.

The fact that the top item of interest in this section of the stakeholder survey was “Respect for basic human rights, prevention of discrimination and harassment” shows that this aspect of our activities remains in the spotlight.

Product Responsibility
For manufacturers, quality issues that affect customer safety can have a significant impact on business, including negative business performance due to brand erosion and loss of customer trust. Conversely, our recipe for strong enterprise growth is to supply products that meet customer needs, offer high quality and added value, and are easy to use, while also constantly working to develop innovative technologies for our time.
Canon’s basic quality concept is to ensure that customers have “no claim, no trouble,” and we work hard to ensure “Canon Quality” throughout the entire Group. In line with this creed, we created a quality management system that follows the requirements of international standards, and we strive to improve quality across the entire product lifecycle, from

Contributing to solutions to local issues not only helps to enhance
the sustainable development of society.

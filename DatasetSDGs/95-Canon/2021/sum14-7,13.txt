 Initiatives for a Low-Carbon Society
Canon seeks to continuously fulfil its environmental targets, and beyond that to contribute to the global goal of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions. Accordingly, we use technology to quantify CO2 emissions for the entire product lifecycle (from raw materials procurement and parts manufacture by suppliers through operational site activities and logistics to customer use) and take steps to reduce it at each stage.
Environmentally Conscious Designs for Office Equipment
The multifunction office device imageRUNNER ADVANCE DX C5750i pursues energy-efficient design through features such as on-demand fixing technology, a high-performance main controller, and toner with optimal melt characteristics. These features enable it to achieve an approximately 47% reduction in CO2 emissions during customer use compared to the previous model. It thus manages to combine improved functionality with reduced CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the A4 monochrome laser multifunction device imageCLASS MF448dw achieves compact dimensions, with a height approximately 15% lower than the previous model at 392 mm, and reduced power consumption during sleep mode to approximately 0.9W. As well as contributing to space saving in the office environment and other settings, it also realizes increased energy efficiency.

Environmentally Conscious Designs for Medical Equipment
Vantage Elan/NX Edition is Canon Medical Systems’ new 1.5-T (Tesla) MRI system, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) functions and boasting the smallest installation space requirement for a model in its class. The design of the 1.5-T MRI system is the company’s first to eliminate the need for a separate computer room. With a footprint approximately 29% smaller than the previous model, it reduces installation time and costs. The system is automatically switched to standby mode during intervals between examinations, reducing maximum power consumption by 50% compared to the previous model. These and other features not only reduce costs but also contribute to energy saving.

Helping Customers Reduce Their Environmental Impact
Using the Carbon Offset Program
Canon promotes initiatives that help customers reduce their CO2 emissions.
To enable customers to select products with lower CO2 emissions, we strive to disclose relevant information. We have also obtained Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP) certification under the Sustainable Management Promotion Organization (SuMPO)’s CFP Communication Program.
making use of CFP* promoted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, we have been able to realize products with practically zero lifecycle CO2 emissions. With some of these products, such as the imageRUNNER ADVANCE series and imagePRESS production printers, customers can report to the authorities, based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures (Japan), that they do not produce the CO2 emissions that would ordinarily be expected from use of the products.
Carbon offsets linked to customer demand from when we began using this system in 2014 until 2020 totaled 38,649 t-CO2.

CO2 Reduction Through Initiatives at Operational Sites
Canon created the Energy Cost Reduction Working Group in 2014 as a horizontally integrated organization to take Group-wide action on reducing energy consumption. The group has worked to reduce energy consumption by undertaking a thorough-going review of operating conditions at production sites, for instance by cutting out excess use of pressurized air and cooling water and adjusting air conditioner settings. Measures that prove

 In 2020, thanks to a continuous program of energy conservation measures across operational sites, driven by the activities of the Energy Cost Reduction Working Group and other initiatives, we achieved a year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 10% to 940 kt-CO2. The special measures and facility closures associated with COVID-19 also contributed to the decrease. We also achieved a continuing reduction in the CO2 generated in association with production activities (equipment and facilities, etc.). However, due to the fixed amounts of CO2 generated independently of production, this was not enough to absorb fluctuations in sales and the amount generated per unit of consolidated sales increased slightly.

Effective Energy Utilization Through Joint Project with Outside Operators
In a joint undertaking with Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., and three other enterprises*, Canon has launched a smart energy project which realizes major energy savings. Centered on the Kiyohara Smart Energy Center and related facilities established within the Kiyohara Industrial Park in Utsunomiya City, Tochigi Prefecture, the Kiyohara Industrial Park Smart Energy Project is a multi-plant integrated energy-saving project. This means that, by introducing shared use of electric power and heat (steam and hot water) between a number of business sites with differing levels of demand, it realizes benefits not possible at a single business site operating in isolation. In 2020, the project posted reductions per base unit of 20% in energy consumption and 15% in CO2 emissions volume. This initiative was recognized in the Cogeneration Awards 2020, sponsored by the Advanced Cogeneration and Energy Utilization Center JAPAN, with the award of the Chairman’s Prize, the highest award in the Industrial Section.

CO2 Reduction in Logistics
Canon works with manufacturing and sales companies in Japan and overseas to reduce logistics-related CO2 emissions, seeking to realize low environmental burden in transportation operations at all stages from production to sales, and within each country and region as well as international shipments. For those international shipments, which account for approximately 60% of all transport, we are making improvements that include reducing distances and increasing load efficiency. We are also promoting ‘container round use,’ which aims to ensure that the containers used for import and
transport. To improve loading efficiency and then to reduce the number of containers, we are working to design products and outer carton to best fit the container size.

   In addition to reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions through hardware measures, we are deploying IT solutions to improve the efficiency of work operations, reduce the movements of people and objects, and realize resource and energy savings. This also promotes CO2 reduction in society as a whole. For example, operations previously performed by personnel can be taken over by image recognition, sensing, artificial intelligence, allowing staff reductions and eliminating the need for physical movement of objects, which in turn increases operational efficiency, realizes high performance, and reduces CO2 emissions. By delivering to society a range of IT solutions Canon will continue contributing to reducing CO2 emissions not only in its own operations but also in society as a whole.Canon Sustainability Report 2021 56

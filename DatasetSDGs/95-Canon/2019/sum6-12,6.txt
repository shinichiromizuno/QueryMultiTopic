Resource Recycling at Canon
Canon pursues product-to-product recycling—in other words, recycling used products into new ones. In particular, we have emphasized such initiatives as closed-loop recycling of toner cartridges and the remanufacturing of office multifunction devices—collecting them post-use and making them into products with good-as-new quality. Currently, Canon has five sites conducting recycling,
in Japan, Europe (two sites), the United States, and China. We are continuing initiatives aimed at circulating resources within the same regions where they are consumed.
In the last five years, we have taken 23,342 tons of plastics from used products for recycling as raw materials, and another 15,941 tons of products and parts were reused directly.

State-of-the-Art Automated Recycling Plant Built at Canon Eco Technology Park
In February 2018, we opened the Canon Eco Technology Park. Based on a “clean and silent” design concept which overturns the traditional image of recycling operations, the facility features advanced systems to boost recycling efficiency further. The Canon Automated Recycling System for Toner Cartridges (CARS-T) is a process whereby used toner cartridges are crushed and the materials automatically separated for recycling of the main component, high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). The sorting purity of the recycled plastic reaches 99% or greater* with the intensive use of various separation technologies at the different stages of the process. With the Canon Automated Recycling System for Ink Cartridges (CARS-I), a camera-based automatic sorting process is used on the used ink cartridges.
The process line is automated, yielding an integrated process for the recycling of ink cartridges from disassembly and pulverization to washing. Separated materials are reused for ink cartridge components, materials for pallets used in logistics, or in stationery products. Any resources that cannot be recycled through product-to-product recycling are diverted to material recycling or thermal recovery processes to help maximize resource efficiency.

Product Development Aimed at Efficient Use of Resources
Recycling-Conscious Design
There is an emerging global trend toward the recycling and reusing of resources due to concerns about natural resource depletion. Canon gives careful consideration to collection and recycling of end-of-life products from the design and development stage, through the use of Lifecycle Assessments (LCA) and the Product Assessment System.
To assist these efforts in the design stage we formulated the Environmentally Conscious Design Guidance, which covers an array of considerations, including product-related environmental laws and regulations, Green Public Procurement standards, and environmental label standards in the countries where we sell our products.
The Environmentally Conscious Design Guidance contains a wide variety of design guidelines relating to such matters as recycling-conscious design by making products longer-lived, and easier to maintain, ease of disassembly, ease of sorting materials following disassembly, and information disclosure.
Designing Smaller and Lighter Products
Canon strives to make its products smaller and lighter to help reduce the consumption of resources in the form of raw materials.
In the PIXMA series of inkjet printers, optimization of the internal mechanical layout and the continuation of other downsizing technologies enable the new TS8200 series model, launched in 2018, to achieve approximately 35% compacter dimensions than the previous MG7100 series model (2013). We are also moving ahead with compact and lightweight design in the imagePROGRAF series of large-format inkjet printers. In the new TM-305 model (2018), a redesign of the printer’s internal parts layout succeeds in reducing weight by approximately 13% compared to the previous iPF785 model (2014).
In the SLR camera, meanwhile, the optical design of super-telephoto, large-diameter lens models for professional use are completely retooled, while the adoption of an electric focusing ring optimizes the mechanical structure. The EF400mm f/2.8L IS III USM model realizes high resolution at the same time as reducing weight by a substantial 25% or greater compared to the previous EF400mm f/2.8L IS II USM model.

Remanufacturing of Multifunction Devices
Canon remanufactures used multifunction devices.
We collect used devices and break them down into parts, which are washed and cleaned using optimal techniques. Following strict reuse standards, we replace any parts that show wear or deterioration. The production line and inspection processes used are on a par with those for devices made only with new parts. When a remanufactured device is shipped, it is guaranteed to offer the same level of quality as a new product.
We market remanufactured devices from the imageRUNNER ADVANCE series under the Refreshed series brand in Japan and under the EQ80 series brand in Europe. To take the example of the imageRUNNER ADVANCE 6265-R, a remanufactured monochrome multifunction device, reused parts account for 86.6% of its gross weight.

Toner Cartridge Closed-Loop Recycling
In 1990, Canon launched its Toner Cartridge Collection and Recycling Program, the first such program in the industry. The program is continuing operating today.
Returned used toner cartridges are brought to Canon recycling sites, where they are sorted by model and the reusable parts are picked out. Washing and maintenance are performed as needed, and the parts are then reused in new products. Parts that cannot be reused are crushed and separated by material using physical characteristics such as electrostatic properties and specific gravity.
The primary material of toner cartridges is the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) used primarily for the housing. HIPS can be used repeatedly to make new toner cartridges a unique feature of Canon’s closed-loop recycling process.
We conduct used toner cartridge collection in 23 countries and regions (with a cumulative collection volume of about 408,000 tons as of the end of 2018) for recycling at four sites*, in Japan, the United States, France, and China (recycling in the same region where the product is used).
Thanks to our recycling initiatives, as of 2018 we have achieved a cumulative reduction in the use of new resources of approximately 285,000 tons.

Collection and Recycling of Ink Cartridges
Canon has been collecting and recycling used ink cartridges since 1996. As of the end of 2018, Canon’s collecting program was operational in 35 countries and regions worldwide, and the total volume of cartridges that had been collected up to the end of 2018 reached 2,241 tons.
In Japan, Canon is part of the Ink Cartridge Satogaeri (Homecoming) Project, a joint program by printer manufacturers to collect cartridges via boxes placed in post offices, libraries, and other local government facilities. Schools also collect cartridges through activities related to the Bellmark Campaign.
Meanwhile, in response to growing public concern over plastic contamination of the oceans, we have begun a campaign to reduce the use of disposable plastics, for instance in the straws and cups issued at staff canteens and elsewhere. Measures include switching to substitute materials and encouraging staff to bring their own multi-use utensils.
In 2018, we worked at all operational sites to reduce waste generation and promote internal recycling. However, due partly to the effect of a change in waste treatment methods at some sites, total waste generation increased by 4,937 tons year on year to 117,787 tons.
Outside Japan, we place cartridge collection boxes in

Initiatives to Reduce Waste
at Operational Sites
Reducing Waste
Canon is working hard to reduce the amount of waste it generates. Efforts include increasing recycling through sorting and collection and minimizing initial waste generation.
In particular, we have sought to determine which factors most significantly affect waste generation for each division and each production process. Based on these findings, by an actual versus forecast comparison, we have implemented a number of ongoing initiatives to curb waste generation.

Initiatives Related to In-House Waste Recycling and Outside Resource Recovery
Canon actively works to reduce the amount of waste originating from its operations and to reuse or recycle waste where possible, appropriately disposing of any waste that can be neither reused nor recycled in accordance with the law.
Our various operational sites employ a range of in-house recycling schemes, including reprocessing waste plastic from injection molding or recycling it for other items.
Even in the case of waste that must be sent outside the company, we make sure it does not enter landfills*. Rather, we contract with companies that reprocess waste into materials. In 2018, contracted companies processed 114,817 tons of waste from Canon back into materials.
* Except for some general waste generated by business activities that is disposed of under government oversight.

Adapting to Regulations on the Import of Waste Plastics and Similar Materials Spread Widely in Asia In January 2018, China introduced a ban on the import of waste plastics and used paper under the National Sword policy. Subsequently, moves to adopt the import ban have spread to southeast Asian nations, notably Malaysia and Thailand. To curtail as far as possible the generation of waste plastics, used paper, and other waste materials outsourced, Canon works with production sites to further improve the accuracy of separation processes and to expand in-house recycling through in-process recycling measures. We will also be making efforts to improve material yield so as to reduce material wastage as part of initiatives across the whole of the supply chain.
Aiming for Sustainable Water Resources
Water Risk in Regions Where Canon Production Sites Are Located
Canon assesses locations to confirm available water intake volume before establishing operational sites and facilities. We use the AQUEDUCT water-risk mapping tool provided by the World Resources Institute* for quantitative evaluation and reconfirmation of water risk in regions where production sites are located.

Reducing Water Usage
Canon collects water data by intake source (public water system, industrial water system, or groundwater) and manages water resources carefully so as not to exceed intake limits for the different regions in which it operates. We also set and manage targets for the volume of water used in production, and constantly strive to reduce water usage by improving production processes and raising water-usage efficiency at each operating site.
Water Recycling at Production Sites
Canon promotes the recycling of water resources. The Kitsuki Plant of Oita Canon Materials Inc. is located on Beppu Bay, home to precious natural resources and habitats. In consideration of the impact on the ecosystem, the plant employs a closed wastewater system that discharges nothing but rainwater.
In 2018, we worked at all operational sites to reduce water consumption and promote recycling. Nevertheless, total water consumption showed a slight year-on-year increase of 19 TCM to 9,725 TCM.

Target 6.3: Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
Canon’s Approach to Managing Chemical Substances
Canon strictly manages chemical substances in products as well as those used in manufacturing processes.
Our basic approach to management involves confirming products do not contain regulated chemical substances that exceed the prescribed standard and production sites do not emit regulated chemical substances that exceed the prescribed standard.
Management of Chemical Substances in Products
Canon has built a Group-wide environmental assurance system for managing chemical substances in products. Taking the laws and major environmental-labeling requirements around the world into consideration,
we established in-house standards in line with the most stringent regulations in the world.
Specifically, our management system classifies chemical substances into three categories: “prohibited substances,” which cannot be used in products; “use-restricted substances,” for which we are working to find alternatives by specific deadlines; and, “controlled substances,” the amount of which should be monitored.
Compliance with Additional Restriction of Substances Under the European Union’s RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) Directive Following the amendment of the European Union’s RoHS Directive, from July 22, 2019, the use of 4 phthalates
(DEHP, BBP, DBP, DIBP) will be restricted in electrical and electronic equipment sold on the EU market. These substances are in general use as plasticizers for improved flexibility and moldability, for instance in the covering of electric power cables.
As part of its Green Procurement system, Canon has identified products containing the phthalates and has been preparing for the new regulation by working with parts suppliers on evaluations and studies and investigation of alternatives. These activities mean that customers will be able to continue using our products with complete confidence after the amendment of the RoHS Directive.
The phthalates are known to have the property of migration, which means that matter can be transferred to other products on contact. Canon is responding by ensuring compliance with industry guidelines throughout the supply chain.
Proactive Contribution to International Standards for Transmitting Information on Chemical Substances
To manage chemical substances appropriately, it is important to share information on the chemical substances contained in materials, parts, and products accurately and efficiently along the supply chain from upstream to downstream, and to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.
In the past, companies each employed their own survey formats to request the suppliers for the information about chemical substances in products,
83 Canon Sustainability Report 2019

        Management Basic Information Value Creation Business Strategy Management CSR Reporting Third-Party
Strategy
which meant that suppliers were requested to respond to their customers multiple times in different formats even with regard to the same parts or chemicals.
This situation incurred substantial burden on and costs to the entire supply chain. Furthermore, using such a variety of survey formats gave rise to concerns about the decreased reliability of data as it was communicated across the supply chain.
Amid such circumstances, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan) decided to sponsor chemSHERPA (chemical information SHaring and Exchange under Reporting PArtnership in supply chain) as a common platform for sharing information, facilitating the seamless transmission of information between companies to confirm compliance with regulations on chemical substances in products.
Applying the IEC62474* international standard,
the chemSHERPA data scheme enables the management of compliance verifications for chemical substance regulations for each material and part. It is expected to enable more effective verifications as well, since revisions to regulations are updated in a timely manner.
Having previously collected and managed information on chemical substances contained in products in line with IEC62474, Canon completed the introduction of chemSHERPA in 2017. Since its introduction by Canon, around 99% of survey replies have been made through chemSHERPA. This has led to increased workplace efficiency. Some suppliers have also adopted pre-filled survey replies that contain some of the required information. This shift to a more standardized approach contributes further to operational efficiency.
Meanwhile, for suppliers who have difficulty with the reply process, guide manuals in Japanese, English and Chinese have been prepared to promote the progressive global adoption of chemSHERPA.
* IEC62474: Material Declaration for Products of and for the Electrotechnical Industry. International standards issued by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) in March 2012 aiming to streamline the material declarations on chemical substances and compositions contained in the products of the electro- technical industry in the global supply chain.
Managing Chemical Substances Used in Manufacturing Processes
The chemical substances handled during manufacturing at Canon include “controlled chemical substances” regulated in terms of safety such as negative impact on human health, the environment, and flammable risk. Canon separates these substances into three categories: A) Prohibited substances; B) Emission reduction substances; and C) Regulated substances. In turn, effective measures are in place for each category.
Prohibited substances are defined as those prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Stockholm Convention, the Montreal Protocol and the Convention
Foundation Opinion / Assurance
concerning Safety in the Use of Asbestos, as well as specified greenhouse gases (PFC/HFC/SF6), other soil and groundwater pollutants, and substances that significantly impact people’s health.
Greenhouse gases other than PFC/HFC/SF6, greenhouse gases identified by the IPCC as having global warming potential (GWP), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other substances specified by Canon are designated as emission reduction substances.
Regulated substances are chemical substances with defined compliance requirements, including compliance with reference values and the ascertainment of usage and storage quantities.
Reducing Use and Emissions of Controlled Chemical Substances
Canon engages in various initiatives at its operational sites to reduce emissions of controlled chemical substances, including reducing the consumption and re-use of them through improvement of production processes.
Total emissions of controlled chemical substances in 2018 amounted to 587 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 16 tons, which was achieved through activities to reduce chemical substances used in the production process and measures to promote re-use.

Reducing Emissions into the Atmosphere and Waterways and Preventing Pollution
Canon alleviates the environmental impact of its operational sites by reducing emissions of NOX*1 and SOX*2, which are major causes of air pollution and acid rain; reducing discharges of phosphates and nitrogen compounds, which cause the eutrophication of water environments; and, reducing BOD*3 and SS*4, which indicate an environmental impact in water areas.
To prevent air pollution, when installing or updating equipment that uses fuel, we opt for fuels that minimize generation of air pollutants (such as sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide and soot), and have banned the use of heavy oil in principle.
Furthermore, we have designated ozone-depleting substances and persistent organic pollutants cited in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants as banned substances.
With regard to wastewater, each operational site sets standard values based on local laws and regulations. Also, control values are set at 80% of the standard values as management standards at each site.
we regularly check the status of compliance with management standards.
*1 Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
A major cause of air pollution, acid rain and photochemical smog, NOx is generated when the nitrogen in fuels is oxidized or when nitrogen in the atmosphere is oxidized during high-temperature combustion.
*2 Sulfur oxides (SOx)
A major cause of air pollution and acid rain, SOx is generated when fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, are burned.
*3 Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
BOD is the amount of oxygen consumed when microorganisms degrade organic matter in water. Larger figure shows worse water quality.
*4 Suspended solids (SS)
A collective term used for substances of less than 2mm in diameter that float in the air and do not dissolve.
Status of Soil and Groundwater Clean-up Activities*
Soil and Groundwater Remediation Status
Canon places high priority on soil and groundwater protection. In line with this, we established the Canon Group’s Basic Policy on Soil and Groundwater Pollution and implement comprehensive measures based on it. In the unlikely event that soil or groundwater pollution is found at one of our operational sites, cleanup and remedial actions are carried out in close accordance with all relevant laws.
Also, our standard when acquiring new land is to conduct a preliminary soil examination and carry out any other necessary procedures, such as soil remediation, before making the purchase. We also monitor the chemical substances used at each site, remaining fully aware of the national and regional standards where each site is located in order to implement countermeasures according to the situation at each location.
Going forward, we will continue with the above initiatives and carry out monitoring and reporting of operational sites with completed remediation in a timely manner.
PCB Waste Management
In accordance with relevant laws, Canon strictly manages polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), which damages living organisms and the environment.
As of December 2018, 13 operational sites were storing PCB waste. In terms of highly concentrated PCB waste, there are 5 capacitors and transformers and 1,922 fluorescent ballasts in storage.
This PCB waste is processed sequentially by Japan Environmental Storage & Safety Corporation (JESCO).

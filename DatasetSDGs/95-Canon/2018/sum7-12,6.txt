    Contributing to a Circular Economy
Canon’s Approach to Achieve
a Circular Economy
To ensure more efficient use of limited resources and reduce waste, Canon is making products smaller and lighter, and reusing and recycling materials as much as possible. We also strive to reduce water consumption and the generation of waste from manufacturing at our operational sites.
Canon pursues product-to-product recycling—in other words, recycling used products into new ones. In particular, we have emphasized such initiatives as closed-loop recycling of toner cartridges and the remanufacturing of office multifunction devices—collecting them post-use and making them into essentially new products. Currently, Canon has five sites conducting recycling, in Japan, Europe (two sites), the United States, and China. We are continuing initiatives aimed at circulating resources within the same regions where they are consumed.
In the last five years, we have taken 19,658 tons of plastics from used products for recycling as raw materials, and another 14,353 tons of products and parts were reused directly.
State-of-the-Art Automated Recycling Plant Built at Canon Eco Technology Park
In 2017, we completed the Canon Eco Technology Park. Equipped with automated recycling systems based on a “clean and silent” design concept, this facility overturns the traditional image of recycling operations. It features advanced systems to boost recycling efficiency, creating a clean environment on a par with an office. In the Canon Automated Recycling System for Toner Cartridges (CARS-T), used toner cartridges are crushed and the materials are automatically separated. It is a system that can recycle plastic with sorting purity of 99% or greater (According to Canon sorting methods). With the Canon Automated Recycling System for Ink Cartridges (CARS-I), a camera-based automatic sorting process is used on the used ink cartridges. The process line is automated, yielding an integrated process for the recycling of ink cartridges from disassembly and pulverization to washing. Separated materials are reused for ink cartridge components, materials for pallets used in logistics, construction materials, or in stationery products. Any resources that cannot be recycled through product-to-product recycling are diverted to material recycling or thermal recovery processes to help maximize resource efficiency.

which covers an array of considerations, including product- related environmental laws and regulations, Green Public Procurement standards, and environmental label standards in the countries where we sell our products.
The Environmentally Conscious Design Guidance contains design guidelines relating to such matters as reduced use of materials by making products lighter, smaller, longer-lived, and easier to maintain, ease of disassembly, ease of sorting materials following disassembly, and information disclosure.
Remanufacturing of Multifunction Devices
Canon remanufactures used multifunction devices.
In remanufacturing, we collect used devices and break
them down into parts, which are washed and cleaned using optimal techniques to meet rigid standards. Following strict reuse standards, we replace any parts that show wear or deterioration. The production line and inspection processes used are on a par with those for devices made only with new parts. When a remanufactured device is shipped, it is guaranteed to offer the same level of quality and reliability as a new product.
In Japan, we sell remanufactured devices from the imageRUNNER ADVANCE series as the Refreshed series. The imageRUNNER ADVANCE 6065-R, a remanufactured monochrome multifunction device, contains reused parts accounting for 80.9% of its gross weight.
Toner Cartridge Closed-Loop Recycling
In 1990, Canon launched its Toner Cartridge Collection and Recycling Program, the first such program in the industry. The program is continuing operating today.
Returned used toner cartridges are brought to Canon recycling sites, where they are sorted by model on the recycling line. Reusable parts are picked up prior to crushing. Washing and maintenance are performed as needed, and the parts are reused in new products. Parts that cannot be reused are crushed and separated by material using physical characteristics such as electrostatic properties and specific gravity.
The primary material of toner cartridges is the high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) used primarily for the housing. HIPS can be used repeatedly to make new toner cartridges a unique feature of Canon’s closed-loop recycling process.
We conduct used toner cartridge collection in 23 countries and regions (with a cumulative collection volume of about 394,000 tons as of the end of 2017) for recycling at four sites*, in Japan, the United States, France, and China (recycling in the same region where the product is used).

 Product Development Initiatives Aimed at Efficient Use of Resources
Recycling-Conscious Design
There is an emerging global trend toward the recycling and reusing of resources due to concerns about natural resource depletion. Canon gives careful consideration to collection and recycling of end-of-life products from the design and development stage, through the use of Lifecycle Assessments (LCA) and the Product Assessment System.
Specifically, to assist these efforts in the design stage we formulated the Environmentally Conscious Design Guidance,

Collection and Recycling of Ink Cartridges
■ Worldwide Collection
Canon has been collecting and recycling used ink cartridges since 1996. As of the end of March 2018, Canon’s collecting program was operational in 35 countries and regions worldwide, and the total volume of cartridges that had been collected up to the end of 2017 reached 2,095 tons.
In Japan, Canon is part of the Ink Cartridge Satogaeri (Homecoming) Project, a joint program by printer manufacturers to collect cartridges via boxes placed in post offices, libraries, and other local government facilities. Schools also collect cartridges through activities related to the Bellmark Campaign.
Outside Japan, we place cartridge collection boxes in large retail stores, affiliate sales outlets, shopping malls, companies, schools, libraries, train stations, Canon service stores, Canon showrooms, and other locations, depending on the circumstances in each country or region.

Even in the case of waste that must be sent outside the company, we make sure it does not enter landfills*. Rather, we contract with companies that reprocess waste into materials. In 2017, contracted companies processed 98,999 tons of waste from Canon back into materials.
* Except for some general waste generated by business activities that is disposed of under government oversight.
Aiming for Sustainable Water Resources
Water Risk in Regions Where Canon Production Sites Are Located
Canon assesses locations to confirm available water intake volume before establishing operational sites and facilities. We use the AQUEDUCT water-risk mapping tool provided by the World Resources Institute* for quantitative evaluation and reconfirmation of water risk in regions where production sites are located.
The results of our evaluations show that no regions where Canon has production sites are considered to be extremely high risk.
* World Resources Institute: WRI is an independent institute based in the United States that conducts policy research and provides technical assistance concerning environmental and development issues around the world.
Water risk (quantitative) in regions containing major production sites
Canon Components reduced liquid waste generation by about 5%, or roughly 250t, by cutting the frequency of initial make-up of planting bath to restrict sludge production due to developer fluid, and by installing equipment to concentrate waste liquids from cleaning processes.
Total waste generation in 2017 amounted to 101,879 tons. The increase compared with 2016 was minimal despite the addition of Canon Medical Systems and business expansion. Waste generated per unit of sales fell to 2.45 t/¥100 million due to waste-reduction initiatives across sites.

Initiatives to Reduce Waste at Operational Sites
Reducing Waste
Canon is working hard to reduce the amount of waste it generates. Efforts include increasing recycling through sorting and collection and minimizing initial waste generation.
In particular, we have sought to determine which factors most significantly affect waste generation for each division and each production process. Based on these findings, we have implemented a number of ongoing initiatives to curb waste generation.

Reducing Water Usage
Canon collects water data by intake source (public water system, industrial water system, or groundwater) and manages water resources carefully so as not to exceed intake limits for the different regions in which it operates. We also set and manage targets for the volume of water used in production, and constantly strive to reduce water usage by improving production processes and raising water-usage efficiency at each operating site.
Water Recycling at Production Sites
Canon promotes the recycling of water resources. The Kitsuki Plant of Oita Canon Materials Inc. is located on Beppu Bay, home to precious natural resources and habitats. In consideration of the impact on the ecosystem, the plant employs a closed wastewater system that discharges nothing but rainwater.
Closed wastewater system
At Canon Opto (Malaysia), wastewater from production processes is collected and re-used in a cooling tower. Upgrades to the recovery plant in 2016 and 2017 increased water recycling capacity. This cut consumption of non-recycled water by the cooling tower in 2017 by roughly 25% compared with 2016.
Water recycling at Canon Opto (Malaysia)
A rainwater reuse system was installed at Canon Canada’s new headquarters completed in 2016. Rainwater is collected from the roof of the building and stored underground in a 45,000m3-capacity tank. The collected water is used for toilets and on-site irrigation.
In 2017, although the addition of Canon Medical Systems to the Canon Group and business expansion led to higher water usage, increases were minimized by raising water-usage efficiency at sites. Total water usage was 9,706 TCM* and water usage per unit of sales fell to 0.24 TCM/¥100 million.

Eliminating Hazardous Substances and Preventing Pollution
Management Third-Party Structure Opinion / Assurance
      Canon thoroughly manages chemical substances in products and those used in manufacturing processes to prevent environmental pollution and adverse effects on people’s health.

  Eliminating hazardous substances and preventing pollution
    Target 12.4
 Target 6.3
  Target 12.4: Achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all waste throughout the product lifecycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release into air, water, and soil
Target 6.3: Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
Canon’s Approach to Managing
Chemical Substances
Canon strictly manages chemical substances in products as well as those used in manufacturing processes. Our basic approach to management involves confirming products do not contain regulated chemical substances that exceed the prescribed standard and production sites do not emit regulated chemical substances that exceed the prescribed standard.
Management of Chemical Substances
in Products
Canon has built a Group-wide environmental assurance system for managing chemical substances in products. Taking the laws and major environmental-labeling requirements around the world into consideration, we established in-house standards in line with the most stringent regulations in the world. Specifically, our management system classifies chemical substances into three categories: “prohibited substances,” which cannot be used in products; “use-restricted substances,” for which we are working to find alternatives by specific deadlines; and, “controlled substances,” the amount of which should be monitored.
Understanding the Latest Information
on Chemical Substances in Products
and Taking Preemptive Action
Research and studies are being carried out around the world on the impact risk of chemical substances on the environment and people’s health. Europe, in particular, has taken the lead in expanding its regulations.
Canon strives to grasp new regulatory trends at an early stage and take action, ensuring that it provides products that are safe for the environment and people in every country and region where Canon products are used.
Proactive Contribution to International Standards for Transmitting Information
on Chemical Substances
To manage chemical substances appropriately, it is important to share information on the chemical substances contained in materials, parts, and products accurately and efficiently along the supply chain from upstream to downstream, and to ensure compliance with all regulations.
In the past, companies each employed their own survey formats to request the suppliers for the information about chemical substances in products, which meant responding to questions multiple times in different formats even with regard to the same parts or chemicals. This situation incurred substantial burden on and costs to the entire supply chain. Furthermore, using such a variety of survey formats gave rise to concerns about the decreased reliability of data as it was communicated across the supply chain.
Amid such circumstances, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan) decided to sponsor chemSHERPA (chemical information SHaring and Exchange under Reporting PArtnership in supply chain) as a common platform for sharing information, facilitating the smooth transmission of information between companies to confirm compliance with regulations on chemical substances in products. Canon has been proactively involved as a member company supporting the scheme.

Canon Sustainability Report 2018 60

Applying the IEC62474* international standard, the chemSHERPA data scheme enables the management of compliance checks for chemical substance regulations for each material and part. It is expected to enable more accurate checks as well, since revisions to regulations are updated in a timely manner.
As having previously surveyed and managed the information on chemical substances contained in products as outlined in this scheme, Canon introduced and began using chemSHERPA in 2017.
Since its introduction by Canon, around 90% of survey replies have been based on chemSHERPA. Some suppliers have also adopted pre-filled survey replies that contain some of the required information. This shift to a more standardized approach is helping to make operations more efficient.
We continue to promote the adoption of the new data platform by providing support to suppliers preparing to make the shift, such as by explaining how to reply to surveys.
* IEC62474: Material Declaration for Products of and for the Electrotechnical Industry. International standards issued by the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) in March 2012 aiming to streamline the material declarations on chemical substances and compositions contained in the products of the electrotechnical industry in the global supply chain.
Managing Chemical Substances Used
in Manufacturing Processes
The chemical substances handled during manufacturing at Canon include “controlled chemical substances” regulated in terms of adverse effect on the environment, human health and safety, and so forth. Canon separates these substances into three categories: A) Prohibited substances; B) Emission reduction substances; and C) Regulated substances. In turn, effective measures are in place for each category.
Prohibited substances are defined as those prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Stockholm Convention, the Montreal Protocol and the Convention concerning Safety in the Use of Asbestos, as well as specified greenhouse gases (PFC/HFC/SF6), other soil and groundwater pollutants, and substances that significantly impact people’s health.
Greenhouse gases other than PFC/HFC/SF6, greenhouse gases identified by the IPCC as having global warming potential (GWP), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other substances specified by Canon are designated as emission reduction substances.
Regulated substances are chemical substances with defined compliance requirements, including compliance with reference values and the ascertainment of usage and storage quantities.
Reducing Use and Emissions of Controlled Chemical Substances
Canon engages in various initiatives at its operational sites to reduce emissions of controlled chemical substances, including reducing the consumption or re-use of chemical substances through improvement of production processes.
Canon Dalian is trying to re-use or recycle solvents to help reduce VOC emissions. In 2017, the company posted a year-on-year reduction of 30% in VOC usage based on efforts to expand the types of solvents that could be re-used or recycled and related processes.
Canon Vietnam has cut its chemical usage by 7.0 tons via in-house manufacture of production tools for modifying amounts of coating oils or grease used in assembly processes (cutting oil usage by 4.4% and grease usage by 2.2%), alongside measures to improve coating operations and reduce the number of areas requiring coating.
Total emissions of controlled chemical substances in 2017 amounted to 603 tons. The increase compared with 2016 was minimal despite the addition of Canon Medical Systems and business expansion. Emissions per unit of sales improved to 0.0148 t/¥100 million due to a range of emissions-reduction initiatives at sites.

Reducing Emissions into the Atmosphere
and Waterways and Preventing Pollution
Canon alleviates the environmental impact of its operational sites by reducing emissions of NOx*1 and SOx*2, which are major causes of air pollution and acid rain; reducing discharges of phosphates and nitrogen compounds, which cause the eutrophication of water environments; and, reducing BOD*3 and SS*4 indexes, which have an environmental impact on water environments.
To prevent air pollution, when installing or updating equipment that uses fuel, we opt for fuels that do not generate air pollutants (such as sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide and soot), and have banned the use of heavy oil in principle.
Furthermore, we have designated ozone-depleting substances and persistent organic pollutants cited in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants as banned substances.
With regard to wastewater, each operational site sets its own levels based on those stipulated in local laws and regulations. We have 80% as an internal management value for these items, and we regularly check the status of compliance with management standards.
As a result of these initiatives, Canon’s emissions or discharges from its operational sites in 2017 again did not exceed established standards.
*1 Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
A major cause of air pollution, acid rain and photochemical smog, NOx is generated when the nitrogen in fuels is oxidized or when nitrogen in the atmosphere is oxidized during high-temperature combustion.
*2 Sulfur oxides (SOx)
A major cause of air pollution and acid rain, SOx is generated when fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, are burned.
*3 Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
BOD is the amount of oxygen consumed when microorganisms degrade organic matter in water.
*4 Suspended solids (SS)

Soil and Groundwater Remediation Status
Canon places high priority on soil and groundwater protection. In line with this, we established the Canon Group’s Basic Policy on Soil and Groundwater Pollution and implement comprehensive measures based on it. In the unlikely event that soil or groundwater pollution is found at one of our operational sites, cleanup and remedial actions are carried out in close accordance with all relevant laws. In 2017, cleanups were completed at Canon’s Meguro and Kanuma sites in Japan, and the related regulatory filings were made.
Also, our standard when acquiring new land is to conduct a preliminary soil examination and carry out any other necessary procedures, such as soil remediation, before making the purchase. We also monitor the chemical substances used at each site, remaining fully aware of the national and regional standards where each site is located in order to implement countermeasures according to the situation at each location.
Going forward, we will continue with the above initiatives and carry out monitoring and reporting of operational sites with completed remediation in a timely manner.
PCB Waste Management
In accordance with relevant laws, Canon strictly manages polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), which damages living organisms and the environment.
As of December 2017, 14 operational sites were storing PCB waste. In terms of highly concentrated PCB waste, there are 22 capacitors and transformers and 1,922 fluorescent ballasts in storage.
This PCB waste is processed sequentially by the Japan Environmental Storage & Safety Corporation (JESCO).

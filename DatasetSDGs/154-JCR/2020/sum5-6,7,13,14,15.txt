        JCR has been taking a wide range of steps to mitigate its environmental impact, including reducing CO2 emissions and effectively using water resources. For example, we have worked to transition to LED lighting at all company facilities and shift all our company cars, including those used at plants and the Research Institute, to hybrid cars and electric vehicles. In addition, we have promoted measures such as reducing water use at manufacturing sites, along with adopting single-use bioreactors to ensure the efficient use of manufacturing facilities.
In 2015, we introduced electric vehicles as a means of transportation between sites, in conjunction with installing power feed systems at our headquarters as well as at plants and the Research Institute. Currently, hybrid cars account for around half of the vehicles used in JCRâ€™s business activities. Going forward, we will gradually phase in electric vehicles as public charging stations become more widely available. In 2016, we installed a solar power generation system at our Research Institute (in Nishi-ku, Kobe). Moreover, we have taken steps to improve energy

         JCR has seen an uptrend in total energy use (electricity, gas) as its business results have grown. In the Research Division, total energy use has increased with the opening of the Clinical Trial Material Manufacturing Center (CTMC) and Cell Processing Center (CPC) in 2016. In the Production Division, total energy use has remained mostly flat, mainly owing to the installation of highly energy-efficient equipment and changes in how we use energy.
CO2 emissions from business activities in FY2019 were 426 tons.

Water Resources
We have managed to either reduce or maintain the use of water resources, despite growth in our business results. The main reasons have been reductions in the amount of water used in research and production processes and efforts such as promoting the recovery and reuse of exhaust steam. All water used in research and production activities has been treated appropriately.

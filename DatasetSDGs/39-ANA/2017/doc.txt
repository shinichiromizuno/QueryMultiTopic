ANA HOLDINGS INC.
ANA’s predecessor was founded as Japan’s first private airline company in 1952. Ten years later in 1962, we became the launch customer for the YS-11, the first postwar, domestically made aircraft. We used this aircraft to fulfill the important mission of trans- porting the Olympic torch for the Games of the XVIII Olympiad, which took place in Tokyo in 1964. In this manner, ANA grew together with postwar Japan.
Under the restrictive industry policy regulating the air transportation industry that was imple- mented in 1970 and 1972, ANA focused pre- dominately on domestic flights. However, we were able to operate an international charter flight between Tokyo and Hong Kong in 1971. The aggregate total of passengers that have flown ANA reached 100 million in 1976. It was also during this time that airlines began per- forming large-scale transportation operations, leading us to introduce Boeing 747-SR super- jumbo jets, which were ANA’s first jumbo jets.
Entering into the era of full-fledged competi- tion between airlines in Japan, we were able to achieve our long-deferred dream—the historic beginning of regular international flight operations between Tokyo and Guam—on March 3, 1986. The Tokyo–Los Angeles route and the Tokyo–Washington route were estab- lished in the same year, and our network continued to grow in the years that followed with, for example, the launch of the Tokyo– New York route in 1991.

     ANA became the ninth member to join Star Alliance, the world’s first and largest global airline alliance, in 1999. We continued to improve customer convenience and grow our International Business thereafter. Overcoming the event risks that materialized on a global scale around this time, the International Business posted a profit for the first time in fiscal year 2004.
The airline industry reached a major turning point in the 2010s, prompting the ANA Group to shift to a holding company structure in fiscal year 2013 in order to facilitate swift and autonomous Group management. We con- tinue to take on endeavors and challenges with the aim of becoming the world’s leading airline group in customer satisfaction and value creation.

  Commitment Embodied in the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy —Updated Version—
  Review of Fiscal Year 2016
I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all of our stakeholders’ continued interest in and support for the ANA Group.
In fiscal year 2016, we posted performance that was favorable for the first year of the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy, achieving a record high for operating income for the second consecutive year.
On the business front, the International Passenger Business—the ANA Group’s main growth driver—made major contributions to performance. Throughout the fiscal year, we proceeded to commence service on new routes, namely the Narita–Wuhan, Narita–Phnom Penh, and Narita– Mexico City routes. We also increased the frequency of flights and switched to larger aircraft on existing routes to expand operations. It was in fiscal year 2014 that we began bolstering our international network of flights out of Haneda Airport, and over the three-year period leading up to the end of fiscal year 2016, available seat-kilometers (ASKs), which represents the production capacity of ANA brand flights, has increased by approximately 45% as a result. At the same time, revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) has risen by roughly 49%, demonstrating that we have been success- ful in incorporating demand as we expand our business.
One of the major proponents of this growth is the com- position of the Group’s fleet. The Boeing 787 series, for example, is a mainstay of our fleet. Since fiscal year 2015, we have been introducing Boeing 787-9s, which feature increased seat numbers, for use mainly on mid- and long- distance routes. These aircraft enable us to operate flights to medium-sized cities, which would not be feasible with large-scale aircraft, and thereby explore new markets. In addition, they have enhanced our ability to select the most appropriately sized aircraft from among multiple options based on the demand anticipated on each route. This is a major strength of the ANA Group. Furthermore, we have endeavored to expand our network and increase overseas sales by engaging in joint ventures and offering code-share flights together with overseas airlines. These and other strategies have made large contributions to the improve- ment of profitability in the Air Transportation business.
In the Domestic Passenger Business, passenger demand was down primarily during the first half of the fiscal year due to the impacts of the April 2016 Kumamoto earth- quakes. We sought to address this situation by matching supply to demand while implementing flexible fare measures to stimulate increases in demand. As a result, the Domestic Passenger Business was able to achieve a year-on-year increase in sales on a single-quarter basis during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the improvement of profitability is our priority in the International Cargo Business, and this focus led to our controlling freighter capacity during the second half of the fiscal year. In this manner, we strived to develop a business portfolio for each field of the Air Transportation business in order to achieve even higher levels of profitability.
In terms of expenses, the Company has been advanc- ing Cost Restructuring Initiatives for six years, and these initiatives have resulted in cumulative total cost reductions of ¥138.0 billion. Unit cost for the Air Transportation busi- ness (ANA brand) in fiscal year 2016 was roughly 10% lower than in fiscal year 2010 as a result.
Looking at finances, the Company’s credit ratings from Japanese ratings institutions improved for the second con- secutive year. In addition, the shareholders’ equity ratio reached the optimal level that has been our ongoing target. Our policy going forward will be to maintain financial sound- ness while allocating management resources with emphasis placed on both growth investments and shareholder returns.
Prioritization of Solidifying Management
Platform in Fiscal Years 2017–2018
Although performance was firm, the global economy is plagued by a rising sense of uncertainty due to the continu- ally opaque nature of political trends, especially those in Europe and the United States, as well as growing geopoliti- cal risks. Japan as well is being faced by new challenges in the forms of an aging population, declining birth rate, and a tight supply–demand balance in the labor market. The airline industry, meanwhile, is witnessing change as col- laboration picks up between U.S. and Asian airlines, altering the existing framework of alliances.

ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Message from Management
The brand power we have cultivated to date will serve as the fuel that moves us forward as we grow into
a strong corporate group capable of winning out against international competition.
The ANA Group sees various opportunities in this busi- ness environment, including the growing demand from inbound travelers, the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, and increase in slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports. Given the volatile change seen in this environ- ment, we have chosen to position the two-year period beginning with fiscal year 2017 as a period for solidifying our management platform. Our first priority in achieving this solidification will be to conduct a comprehensive review for safety and the quality of our services. At the same time, we will seek to secure sufficient human resources for supporting future growth, specifically those in operating divisions, in order to enhance front-line capabilities. (For details, please refer to the “FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy— Updated version—” section on pages 24–29.)
Another measure prescribed for this period is the con- solidation of Peach Aviation Limited. This measure is designed to contribute to the advancement of efforts to expand airline business domains, one of the strategic themes of the current group corporate strategy, by growing the Group’s LCC Business. Over the foreseeable future, we plan to maintain the independence of management at Vanilla Air Inc. and Peach and support the growth of these compa- nies. However, we will also consider the possibility of opti- mizing our portfolio to facilitate the future development of the Air Transportation business.
Strategy for Creating Value Leading Up
to Fiscal Year 2020
After solidifying our management portfolio over the two- year period beginning with fiscal year 2017, we plan to start once again deploying growth strategies centered on the International Business. One of our value creation tar- gets for fiscal year 2020 is operating income of ¥200.0 billion. To better guide us toward achieving this goal, we plan to establish a new medium-term corporate strategy for the period mainly spanning fiscal years 2018 to 2020.
The first step of this strategy will be to further expand the global network for the ANA brand in order to develop ANA into a full service carrier recognized as a top-tier global airline. Efforts on this front include actively deploying fuel- efficient aircraft in our fleet and taking other steps to practice consideration for our impact on the environment while enhancing products and services to heighten ANA’s brand power. Moreover, we will enhance a resort strategy in fiscal year 2019 when we become the first Japanese airline to introduce Airbus A380s into our fleet.
At the same time, Vanilla Air and Peach will be expand- ing the number of LCC brand flights centered on domestic and resort routes. Areas of particular focus will include establishing routes out of regional Japanese cities to take advantage of latent demand for leisure trips and other travel among people in Japan. We will also step up efforts to cater to inbound demand. Additionally, the possibility of setting up mid-distance LCC routes is being examined to bolster medium-term earnings.
We are also looking to develop future revenue sources in non-airline businesses. To this end, we are combining our existing customer bases with information and communica- tion technologies to establish new business models while seeking to take advantage of open innovation in other ways. ANA X Inc., a new Group company opened its doors in December 2016. The goal of this company is to give rise to a new business model that utilizes the ANA economic

   sphere, which is formed by customer data gathered through ANA Card, ANA Mileage Club, and other services. We will thereby evolve our marketing practices with a focus on the customer base that ANA has cultivated thus far to generate synergies with the Air Transportation business, seeking to link these efforts to improved corporate value for the Group.
The current environment continues to warrant caution with regard to changes both inside and outside of Japan.
However, by furnishing accurate responses to such changes, we will seize hold of opportunities for propelling the ANA Group toward the next stage. In this undertaking, the brand power we have cultivated to date will serve as the fuel that moves us forward as we grow into a strong corpo- rate group capable of winning out against competition from around the world.
Pursuit of Sustainable Growth for the Group
  ANA Group Value Creation Cycle
I would now like to take some time to explain the Group’s policies with an eye to the period beyond fiscal year 2020.
It was in April 2013 when the Company transitioned to the holding company structure. Under this structure, core company ANA, and other operating companies are working relentlessly to pursue their own growth scenarios in order to move us forward toward the goals of our current corpo- rate strategy.
Over the long term, we would like to achieve sustainable growth by living up to the expectations of our stakeholders, which we will accomplish by creating economic and social value through the Group’s businesses. To move us toward this goal, we are developing a value creation cycle that
will serve as a framework for facilitating the ongoing rein- forcement of the Group’s unique brand power and the improvement of corporate value. (For details, please refer to the “The ANA Group Value Creation Cycle” section on pages 10 –11.)
Investments in Safety and Human
Resources
Viewed from a long-term perspective, it is clear that safety and human resources will be of the utmost importance to the Group. Accordingly, these resources have been posi- tioned as core elements of our management platform as well as sources of competitiveness in the current corporate strategy, and we are pursuing improvements.
In regard to safety, I regret having to report that, during fiscal year 2016, some issues arose that certainly gave concern to passengers on our flights as well as to other related parties. These issues included malfunctions of Boeing 787 engine parts and a failure to adhere to operating procedures at airport security checkpoints. In response to these incidents, I once again instructed Group companies to take to heart the fact that safety is absolutely essential to our management platform and to engage in operations in accordance with this recognition. Moreover, I mentioned the extreme importance of safety several times to the 2,799 new employees joining the Group in fiscal year 2017 during the Group welcoming ceremony. Aircraft operations are not the only area in which we are expected to guarantee safety. Quite the contrary, there is a need for us to redouble safety measures across the Group and with regard to such areas as food safety and information security.

ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Message from Management
Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business. As the leader of the ANA Group, I have reasserted my devotion to placing safety as our top priority going forward and to making sure that we spare no expense and do everything in our power to ensure the utmost levels of safety.
Turning to human resources, the wellspring of our com- petitiveness, efforts to secure a stable supply of human resources for advancing our growth strategies are becoming more important than ever in the midst of the aging popula- tion and the declining birth rate in Japan.
As one facet of our efforts with this regard, we are focused on encouraging women’s participation in the work- place, a stance that has earned the Company inclusion in the Nadeshiko Brand selection compiled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange a total of three times in the past. Furthermore, ANA has set targets for the number of female officers and the ratio of female managers. On April 1, 2017, the ratio of female managers was 13.3%, roughly 3.5 percentage points higher than five years earlier. We have also expressed our endorsement of the Women’s Empowerment Principles and plan to take part in initiatives for promoting gender equality that are led by corporate managers and that are being sponsored by the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and UN Women.
Furthermore, ANA has introduced a performance evalu- ation system that positions “work-style reform” as a priority task, and all officers and managers have set personal commitments accordingly. As we move on to the next growth stage, we will not allow ourselves to be satisfied simply by improvements to employee retention rates. Rather, we aim to go a step further to boost the productiv- ity of each employee and create new value in order to ensure the maximum results from our initiatives. We will also strive to grow into an organization that fosters diverse perspectives, sensibilities, and values. In addition, the Company will act in its capacity as a signatory to the
UNGC to contribute to the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Initiatives of the ANA Group
The ANA Group has defined the material issues (materiality) that it needs to prioritize in creating value. These issues have been incorporated into the current corporate strategy.
Environmental issues are important and relate to all stakeholders. To help preserve the environment, we are actively deploying fuel-efficient aircraft in our fleet as part of our growth strategies for the Air Transportation business. Our environmental preservation goals extend beyond simply preventing increases in CO2 emissions; we are formulating long-term fleet development plans that incorporate the various risks (e.g., environmental taxes and noise pollution issues) with the potential to emerge as we expand our net- work going forward.
As part of our efforts to contribute to the vitalization of local communities, the LCC Business strives to create new demand in Japan’s air travel market and leverages the unique strengths of each of our LCC brands. These strengths include the ability to provide service on routes that are not operated under the ANA brand and to cater to inbound travelers from Asia. In addition, we have been implementing the Tastes of JAPAN by ANA project since fall 2013. Through this project, we incorporate local specialty products from across Japan into our in-flight and airport services in order to solicit the appeal of Japan to travelers both from within the country and from abroad. In addition, we are concluding comprehensive partnership agreements with municipal governments to allow for Groupwide contri- butions to be made in areas such as sightseeing, culture, sports, and overseas exchanges. These initiatives contribute to accomplishment of the government target of making Japan into a tourism-oriented country. The ANA Group aims to continue helping to realize medium-to-long-term growth in inbound travel demand.

   We are also providing universal services which are meant to enable us to accommodate a more diverse range of customers from across the globe as we expand the International Business. In addition, these services help us contribute to the realization of a symbiotic society while improving our long-term competitiveness. Examples of our efforts to cater to customer diversity include enhancing our ability to accommodate customers in terms of both facilities and services in airports and on planes. A more specific example would be the acquisition of halal certification for in-flight meal factories. These efforts help differentiate ANA as a full service carrier from major carriers from the neigh- boring region of Asia.
Through these efforts, we have managed to achieve the world’s highest 5-Star rating in the World Airline Rating, compiled by U.K.-based rating company SKYTRAX, for five consecutive years, most recently being assigned this rating in March 2017. Our devotion to addressing material environ- mental and social issues in our business was no doubt a contributor to this accomplishment.
Enhancement of Holding Company Functions to Facilitate Aggressive and Speedy Management
Corporate governance will be a theme of crucial importance toward ensuring that we can implement our corporate strat- egy and improve corporate value. Moreover, we recognize that the benefits of our growth strategies can be augmented through “aggressive and speedy management.” It was based on these realizations that we chose to revise how authority was delegated in order to enhance corporate governance with the aim of enabling the Group to better exercise its comprehensive capabilities. The new standards for delegation of authority applied from fiscal year 2016 entailed reassigning authority for decisions about several matters important to operational execution that had previ- ously been made by the Board of Directors to the Group Management Committee. Through this move, we sought to
improve upon the Groupwide strategy formulation function of the Board of Directors while also reinforcing its ability to provide supervisory functions. The resulting management structure is anticipated to contribute to heightened levels of Group competitiveness.
In addition, we have administered surveys to all directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members in order to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Several concrete improvement measures have been imple- mented based on the findings of these activities, such as allowing for more discussion to be held at stages prior to the formulation of corporate strategies.
Since formulating the Fundamental Policy on Corporate Governance in November 2015, we have made it a point to ensure that our decisions are both swift and bold. There is no end goal for our efforts to create a corporate governance system that is suited to the holding company structure. Rather, we will go about building such a system by identify- ing those practices that should be continued and the new measures that should be implemented to consistently create economic and social value.
The Tokyo 2020 Games will provide an unprecedented opportunity to solicit the appeal of Japan to the world. Leading up to this event, the airline industry will also enter into a new chapter with the planned increase in slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports. As the leader of the ANA Group, I will take the steering yoke as we chart a course toward our goal of becoming the world’s leading airline group with an eye to the future that will lie before us once this has been achieved. The ANA Group is united in this pursuit.

Positioning of Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018
Solidify management platform, transition to stage of further business expansion
The business environment is currently undergoing rapid change in Japan and overseas. Out of consideration for these changes, we have positioned fiscal years 2017 and 2018 as representing a period for prioritiz-
ing the solidification of our management platform to prepare for a transition to a stage of further
business expansion with eyes to fiscal year 2020.
Our first priority toward achieving this goal will be a comprehensive review for safety and the quality of our services. We will spare no expense and do everything in our power to install higher degrees of safety into our management platform while maintaining a keen focus on basic quality.
The Company will also actively invest in the human resources that are the wellspring of its competi- tiveness. In addition, having consolidated Peach Aviation Limited into the Group, we will take advan- tage of this opportunity to optimize our portfolio consisting of ANA, a full service carrier (FSC), and the Group’s Low Cost Carrier (LCC) Business.
 Sustainable Growth
   The basic strategies of the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy, which was established in January 2016, will continue to be implemented as we seek to become a strong corporate group capable of effectively responding to changes in the global business environment and pursue sustainable growth.

 Air Transportation Business (ANA Brand)
Implement measures based on each business strategy
   Given that distribution of the current daytime slots at Haneda has been fixed, the pace of capacity growth in the International Passenger Business will be mild over the next two years. Nevertheless, we will continue to capture demand and enhance yield management by taking advantage of the competitive edge granted by our position as the carrier with the largest international route network out of Haneda while utilizing our route network out of Narita.
Improvements to products and services will be made through the introduction of Boeing 787-9s on routes to Asia and Honolulu. In addition, we will advance a resort strategy in con- junction with the deployment of Airbus A380s on routes to Honolulu from spring 2019.
In the Domestic Passenger Business, the Airbus A321s that joined our fleet during the second half of fiscal year 2016 will be utilized when implementing the “Dynamic Fleet Assign Model” in order to optimize supply to demand. At the same time, we will promote usage of domestic routes among new customer groups, including inbound travelers to Japan and millennials, to reinforce Group revenue platforms.
Our focus in the International Cargo Business will be to opti- mize our freighter capacity based on the market’s overall supply and demand balance. Furthermore, we will seek to heighten prof- itability through cross-border e-commerce businesses targeting China, an area in which we anticipate market growth going forward.

ANA HOLDINGS INC.
An additional investment conducted in Peach Aviation Limited during April 2017 increased the ANA HOLDINGS’ stake in this company to 67.0%. Capitalizing on this investment, we will further enhance the corporate value of the Group by incorporating the growth of our LCC Business.
The total number of available seats from all airlines is increas- ing in the principal region of Asia, and the number of these seats provided by LCCs has quadrupled, representing more than 20% of all available seats in 2016, much higher than the figure of 10% in 2008. In this manner, the presence of LCCs has been growing rapidly in Asia.
The ANA Group has been a major proponent behind the growth of the LCC market in Japan. As a result, we currently boast a strong position in this market, with Vanilla Air and Peach holding a combined share of 52% among Japanese LCCs in fiscal year 2016. With networks currently connected to China, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, Vanilla Air and Peach are gaining recognition as Japanese LCCs in the Asian market. Future LCC Business initiatives will include broadening the range of areas in which these companies provide their services, such as by establishing routes out of regional Japanese cities. Through these initiatives, we will expand airline business domains through a Groupwide effort.
  
 FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy—Updated Version—
Cost Management Policy
Focus on balance between “investment in safety and human resources” and “implementation of further cost management”
   While pursuing top-line growth for the entire Group, we will also continue to practice cost management.
The Company has been advancing Cost Restructuring Initiatives for six years, and these efforts have resulted in a unit cost for fiscal year 2016 that is more than 10% lower when com- pared to that of fiscal year 2010.
Taking advantage of the characteristics of the holding com- pany structure, in fiscal year 2016 we began transitioning toward a bottom-up-style framework in which each Group company practices autonomy in pursuing cost reduction. Furthermore, the implementation of more rigorous progress management practices based on key performance indicators (KPIs) has helped to entrench cost management as an integral part of the Group’s overall corporate culture.
Emphasis will be placed on strategic investments in safety and human resources going forward. We therefore anticipate a temporary increase in costs, mainly maintenance and personnel expenses, in the near future. However, we will pursue reducing unit costs by implementing labor-saving initiatives over the medium term. These initiatives will be prefaced on the assump- tion that productivity will be improved through work-style reform and other measures implemented by Group companies.
Always ensuring that our cost levels are appropriate going forward, we will continue to elevate cost competitiveness on a Groupwide basis.

 Value Creation Targets
Optimize business portfolio, achieve the value creation goals outlined in the current corporate strategy
   The ANA Group entered into a growth stage in fiscal year 2014, enabling it to consistently meet its income targets. Although fiscal years 2017 and 2018 have been designated a period for prioritiz- ing the solidification of our management platform, the momentum behind our performance growth will remain unchanged. The Company therefore projects higher sales and income in the first of these two years. Moreover, we will continue to pursue the value creation goals defined in the current corporate strategy on through fiscal year 2020.
We also plan to establish a new medium-term corporate strat- egy for the three-year period spanning from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2020. Guided by our strategies, we will boldly implement business model reforms, unfettered by past conventions, to optimize our business portfolio and improve profitability.

 FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy—Updated Version—
Management Resources Allocation
Continue growth investment for future improvements in profitability while considering further shareholder returns
   In terms of our financial platform, the Company’s credit ratings from major Japanese ratings institutions improved for the second consecutive year. The shareholders’ equity ratio was approx. 40% on March 31, 2017, and has reached the level we deem as most ideal. Going forward, we will work to maintain financial soundness.
In regard to the future allocation of management resources, it is now possible for us to emphasize both growth investments and shareholder returns.
Proactive growth investments will be continued with a focus on aircraft. We remain committed to taking advantage of the growth opportunities placed before the Group’s businesses, and there will be no change to our intent to increase profits going forward.
When announcing the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy in January 2016, we had set forth our policy of continuing to issue stable dividends, with the assumption that dividends would be ¥5 per share. For fiscal year 2016, we issued dividend payments of ¥6 per share, an increase of ¥1 per share above this level. We currently plan for dividend payments of ¥6 per share for fiscal year 2017 as well. We will also consider the possibility of making further shareholder returns through dividend increases and share buybacks based on free cash flow levels and other factors.

Opportunities and Risks Recognized by the ANA Group
Opportunities and Risk in Relation to Strategies
  The ANA Group is being presented with many business opportuni- ties that can be exploited in achieving future growth, including the slot expansion at Tokyo metropolitan area airports to take place in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 as well as anticipation surrounding measures for stimulating inbound travel demand and initiatives for supporting the develop- ment of a Japan brand.
Expand Airline Business Domains Major Initiative 1
However, we also cannot deny the presence of risks that threaten to adversely impact global air transportation demand, such as those arising from uncertainty regarding domestic and overseas political and economic trends.
The ANA Group aims to maintain an accurate understanding of the opportunities and risks pertaining to its strategies. This understanding will thereby enable the Group to pursue sustainable growth through aggressive and speedy management and a resil- ient corporate constitution allowing for effective responses to changes in the global business environment.

 Identification of Materiality
The ANA Group has identified material issues (materiality) based on its Mission Statement, medium-term corporate strategy, and strengths (see figure 1). We set forth the three issues of the envi- ronment, diversity & inclusion, and vitalization of local communities around the end of fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2016, we further investigated these issues, holding discussions with relevant nongovernmental and non-profit organizations and experts based on global trends as part of this process (see figure 2).
The upcoming Tokyo 2020 Games is drawing international attention to how Japanese companies approach human rights, reminding us of the importance of addressing human rights issues and causing us to redouble our efforts in this regard. In addition, the economic growth of Asia is fueling the global expansion of the airline business. Seeing in this trend an opportunity to contribute to the vitalization of local communities in overseas regions served by our flights, we have been incorporating this undertaking into our activi- ties (see figure 3).

With the utmost emphasis on safety and quality, ANA will extend its network to all corners of the globe to grow into an airline that customers continue to choose.

ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Greetings, my name is Yuji Hirako, and I assumed the position of President & Chief Executive Officer of ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. (ANA), in April 2017.
ANA first took to the skies in 1952 with only two helicopters. Today, 65 years later, we have grown into an airline group with annual sales of around ¥1,700.0 billion. Also, while we previously grew our business based on the foundation provided by domestic flights, it is now international flights that are driving our growth as we further expand our network. With the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 in sight, government-spearheaded initiatives are being advanced with the aim of making Japan into a tourism- oriented country and promoting the vitalization of local communities. These initiatives are anticipated to stimulate further growth in demand for inbound travel to Japan. At the same time, we are looking forward to an increase in slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports. ANA truly has many business opportunities ahead of it. With eyes to the future beyond these opportunities, I am committed to exercising leadership to grow into an airline that customers continue to choose. We are pursuing this goal while placing the utmost emphasis on the safety of our flights and on the quality of our products and services.
Since assuming the position of president, I have made a point of visiting airports and other sites of front-line operations whenever
possible in order to speak directly to employees. It is my regretful duty to inform you that, during fiscal year 2016, incidents involving a system malfunction occurred that were no doubt a cause of great distress for our customers. Heinrich’s Law states that, in a work- place, for every major accident there are 29 accidents that cause minor injuries and 300 accidents that cause no injuries. This law cautions us to not become so preoccupied with the major incidents to the point that we lose sight of the smaller incidents that result in major incidents. Accordingly, we must identify the shared root causes of such incidents in order to prevent reoccurrence of both major and minor incidents. I therefore value the ideas and sugges- tions received through engagement with front-line employees. By generating a cycle in which this input is used to pursue improve- ments in operating practices and quality, I hope to achieve even higher levels of safety.
I find myself constantly reminding employees that ANA’s strength resides on the front-lines. If we are to continue evolving as airline professionals that provide services in which customers give us their time and we transport them to new locations, it will be crucial for us to transform our accumulated insight and experience from internalized tacit knowledge into functional and shareable explicit knowledge. This knowledge should then be passed on to new generations of employees as we build upon our professional skills and techniques. Through this process, employees should

  grow more receptive and thus become able to make new discover- ies and uncover new ideas in the course of their work and reflect these in their actions.
Under the current corporate strategy, we are moving ahead with our Dual Hub Network Strategy, which entails leveraging the unique strengths of both Haneda Airport and Narita Airport to develop the International Business. In conjunction with this strategy, we are actively introducing Boeing 787-9s equipped with full-flat seats for business class into our fleet. At the same time, we are enacting plans to make ANA the airline customers choose for resort routes. These plans include the deployment of Airbus A380s on such routes in spring 2019. We also aim to foster increased recog- nition of the ANA brand around the world in order to strengthen our ability to draw customers from overseas. ANA will also extend its network to all corners of the globe and supply services that only ANA can in order to grow into the world’s leading airline group.
Looking forward, we are planning to introduce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) into our fleet. As the launch customer for this aircraft, we will be the first in the world to put it into commercial operation. The MRJ is a marvel of Japanese technology, and its addition to our fleet will surely elevate the efficiency of the operation of our domestic network, which forms the foundation for ANA’s business. As it enhances its network with this powerful new asset, ANA will endeavor to promote the vitalization of local communities while also contributing to society as an eco-friendly airline.
In the future, ANA will continue to live up to every expectation of its customers while pursuing impeccable quality in all areas of service, from prior to departure to after arrival at the destination. We will also strive to consistently respond to the diversifying needs of customers. In this manner, we will deliver a customer experience that guarantees passengers are always happy with their choice to fly ANA. Moving forward, we will continue to provide safe, comfort- able air transportation while maintaining the world’s highest rating for service.

   Growth Strategies and Materiality

  Air Transportation
  International Passenger Business
Aggressively expand network to drive the ANA Group’s growth
 Performance in Fiscal Year 2016
In fiscal year 2016, the International Passenger Business achieved passenger numbers that exceeded its increase in capacity. This feat was made possible by broadening the range of demand this busi- ness is able to incorporate through the expansion of its network, which was accomplished by commencing service on new routes and increasing flights on existing routes, and by introducing Boeing 787s and stepping up overseas sales.
As part of its efforts to expand its network, ANA strengthened its Asian network by launching the Narita–Wuhan route in April 2016 and the Narita–Phnom Penh route, the only direct flight between Japan and Phnom Penh, in September of this year. ANA also made efforts to capture business travel demand by establish- ing the Haneda–New York, the Haneda–Chicago, and the Haneda– Kuala Lumpur routes effective October 2016. In addition, ANA created the Narita–Mexico City route in February 2017 in a move to capture demand for business travel to Central and South America, where Japanese companies are making significant inroads. At the same time, we moved ahead with the Dual Hub Network Strategy, which entails leveraging the unique strengths of Haneda Airport, which boasts superior accessibility from Tokyo and a robust net- work of domestic flights, and Narita Airport, which allows for flex- ible adjustment of timetables. Other initiatives included increasing the number of flights on the Narita–Ho Chi Minh City route and introducing code-share flights based on business and capital part- nership agreements with Vietnam Airlines in an effort to provide greater convenience for connecting passengers between North
America and Asia and to capture robust demand for inbound travel to Japan.
Initiatives for products and services in fiscal year 2016 included the introduction of full-flat business class seats and premium econ- omy services on all European and North American routes (excluding Honolulu) and certain Asian routes. We also held events and con- ducted promotional campaigns in overseas markets, which contrib- uted to a steady rise in the recognition of the ANA brand and consequently drove a rise in inbound travelers to Japan and pas- sengers connecting on international flights.
Due to the above, available seat-kilometers (ASKs) in the International Passenger Business increased 9.9% year on year and revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) rose 12.2%. Unit prices were impacted by yen appreciation and a reduction in fuel surcharge revenues. However, operating revenues were up 0.2% year on year, to ¥516.7 billion, due to meticulous yield control.

   Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
The pace of capacity growth slowed slightly following the expan- sion of slots at Haneda Airport in fiscal year 2014. Nevertheless, we are pushing ahead with growth strategies while leveraging the competitiveness realized by network expansions implemented to date.
In terms of our route network, we are planning to increase flights on the Haneda–Jakarta route in August 2017 and on the Narita–Los Angeles route in October of the same year. We will also be enhancing the Dual Hub Network Strategy in the Tokyo metro- politan area by creating timetables that are highly convenient for customers at Narita Airport and Haneda Airport. This undertaking will include the effective utilization of late night and early morning slots at Haneda Airport.
ANA will also continue enhancing product and service offer- ings. We intend to introduce Boeing 787-9s on the Narita–Honolulu route and Asian routes, including the Haneda–Kuala Lumpur and the Haneda–Manila routes in order to provide ANA BUSINESS STAGGERED full-flat seat and PREMIUM ECONOMY services. In this manner, we are enhancing the services that we provide as a full service carrier (FSC).
In overseas markets, ANA strives to raise its recognition and stimulate demand for travel to Japan. As one facet of these efforts,
we continue to implement promotional campaigns designed to solicit the appeal of the ANA brand and of Japan itself in light of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.
We also plan to move ahead with our resort strategy by accel- erating preparations for the introduction of Airbus A380s on Honolulu routes in 2019.
Through these initiatives, we will target year-on-year increases of 7.7% in ASKs and 8.3% in RPKs along with a rise of 10.5% in operating revenues, to ¥571.0 billion.

 Controlling of CO2 Emissions from Introduction of Fuel-Efficient Aircraft
 Approximately 98% of the CO2 emitted by the ANA Group is attributable to fossil fuels used for aircraft operation. The most effective means of reducing fuel usage and consequently controlling CO2 emissions is to introduce fuel-efficient aircraft into our fleet. Our flagship medium-body aircraft, the Boeing 787, uses roughly 20% less fuel than the Boeing 767, for example*1.
ANA considers its impact on the environment when formulating long- term fleet plans. Accordingly, we intend to increase the portion of our fleet that is accounted for by fuel-efficient aircraft to around 75% by the end of fiscal year 2020, which will be significantly higher than the level of 35% at the end of fiscal year 2010*2. Replacing aircraft in our fleet in accordance with this plan will not only improve fuel efficiency, but also contribute to heightened competitiveness for the ANA brand through enhanced product and service offerings.

 Domestic Passenger Business
Continue optimizing supply to demand and maintain market share, to establish a stable earnings platform
 Performance in Fiscal Year 2016
In the Domestic Passenger Business, we were able to achieve a year-on-year increase in passenger numbers by implementing flexible fare measures matched to demand trends. This increase was realized despite the impact of the Kumamoto earthquakes that occurred in April 2016, the typhoons that began in July, and the heavy snowfall that was seen in December.
Four Airbus A321s were introduced in fiscal year 2016, facilitat- ing efforts to implement the “Dynamic Fleet Assign Model,” which involves strategically deploying aircraft based on demand trends. We continued to match supply to demand throughout the year even while addressing the various issues that occurred, including natural disasters and malfunctions of Boeing 787 engine parts.
In terms of the route network, ANA established the Haneda– Miyako route and resumed service on the Kansai–Miyako route beginning with the summer timetable. In addition, we operated late-night flights on the Haneda–Okinawa route for a limited period during the summer and continued seasonal flights on certain routes, among other efforts to capture demand.
On the sales and marketing front, in addition to Tabiwari Time Sales, efforts were made to increase sales by offering fare adjust- ments based on the number of open seats on certain routes begin- ning in October 2016.
As for services, we refurbished the departure counter at Domestic Terminal No. 2 of Haneda Airport in April 2016 and revamped the website (ANA SKY WEB) and mobile site (ANA SKY
MOBILE) for our domestic reservations system in September, improving visibility and operability. Furthermore, it was made pos- sible to pay for the ANA Wi-Fi Service with ANA Mileage on domes- tic flights in December 2016. Also, the number of channels on the ANA SKY LIVE TV Service was increased in efforts to enhance in-flight entertainment.
As a result of these efforts, we were able to achieve a 0.7% increase in RPKs in the Domestic Passenger Business while con- trolling ASKs, making for a decrease of 0.6%. Operating revenues were down 1.1% year on year, to ¥678.3 billion, as competition and other factors caused the unit price to drop below the levels seen in the previous fiscal year.

   Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
In fiscal year 2017, travel by inbound visitors within Japan is expected to increase. This positive trend will be seen despite a decrease in the overall population of Japan and an anticipated increase in competition, including that with rival transportation methods.
Under these circumstances, ANA will seek to improve unit revenues while refining the “Dynamic Fleet Assign Model” to opti- mize supply to demand by diversifying its fleet lineup through means such as the introduction of Airbus A321neo aircraft, we will strive to maintain our domestic market share and establish stable revenue platforms in accordance with the current corporate strategy.
In terms of our route network, we aim to bolster our network in line with passenger demand. One initiative to this end was com- mencing service on the Chubu–Miyako route in June 2017.
In regard to services, ANA will work to steadily capture demand for inbound travel to Japan by increasing the recognition of the ANA Discover JAPAN Fare for inbound visitors. Other initiatives will include efforts to recover demand following from the impacts of the previous fiscal year’s Kumamoto earthquakes. In addition, we will carefully review the level of various Tabiwari discounts based on demand in order to continue stimulating demand through promotional fares.
Furthermore, a new ANA SUITE LOUNGE, ANA’s finest lounges for premium members, is scheduled to be established for use by
passengers on domestic flights at New Chitose Airport in September 2017. By enhancing the services we offer to Premium Class customers, we will raise the value of ANA as an FSC.
Through these initiatives, we aim to limit the year-on-year decrease in ASKs to 1.1% while achieving a 1.8% increase in RPKs as well as growth of 0.4% in operating revenues, to ¥681.0 billion.
   Vitalization of Local Communities through Stimulation of Inbound Travel Demand
  In February 2012, ANA launched the IS JAPAN COOL? website for overseas cus- tomers, which is designed to offer an in-depth look at the attractive qualities of Japanese culture and Japan’s distinctive cities from our unique vantage point. Another website, ANA EXPERIENCE JAPAN, which was established in November 2015, is aimed at overseas customers interested in Japan and provides a platform for seamlessly supplying information on the appeal of Japan as well as of particular regions along with other sightseeing information. Furthermore, ANA offers the ANA Discover JAPAN Fare, which enables visitors from abroad to travel throughout Japan with greater ease. We have been bolstering sales of tickets utilizing this and other promotional fares in an active drive to capture overseas demand.
As a result of these initiatives, inbound travelers to Japan accounted for approx- imately 3% of all passengers on domestic flights in fiscal year 2016, indicating a steady increase.

   Air Transportation
  Cargo and Mail Business
Fully utilize competitiveness born out of optimized network to improve profitability
 Performance in Fiscal Year 2016
In the Domestic Cargo Business, cargo volume was down year on year due to the sluggish overall demand for domestic cargo transportation seen through fiscal year 2016 as well as a reduc- tion in perishable cargo handled out of Hokkaido resulted from poor weather. We sought to improve revenues by raising unit prices and offering chartered cargo flights. However, operating revenues decreased 2.8% year on year, to ¥30.8 billion, regard- less of these efforts.
In the International Cargo Business, cargo capacity increased in the market overall during the first half of the fiscal year, however, demand was sluggish mainly for import and export cargo transpor- tation. Amid these conditions, we actively endeavored to grow volumes of trilateral cargo transportation from China and other parts of Asia to North America as well as cargo transportation within Asia.
Overall demand began recovering during the second half of the fiscal year. Against this backdrop, ANA sought to capture demand related to electronic components, semiconductors, and automobile parts destined for China and other parts of Asia from Japan as well as demand for apparel and electronic components bound for North America from China. For freighters, we revised our route network, decreasing available ton-kilometers (ATKs) by 12.4% in comparison
Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
In the Domestic Cargo Business, overall trends in demand for domestic cargo are sluggish, and cargo transportation capacity is expected to decrease as we shift to the operation of smaller air- craft. Under these circumstances, we will utilize our sales reserva- tion system and ANA’s extensive passenger flight route network to steadily capture demand.
In the International Cargo Business, demand for cargo trans- portation from Japan recovered in the second half of fiscal year 2016, and similar levels of demand are expected to continue. We will actively cater to demand for shipments from Japan to China, other parts of Asia, North America, and Europe, particularly with regard to automotive parts.
to the second half of the previous fiscal year in order to bring supply in line with demand.
Due to the above, total ATKs for belly space and freighters rose 9.0% year on year while revenue ton-kilometers (RTKs) were up 17.5%. Although unit price increased in the second half of the fiscal year, operating revenues were down 17.7%, to ¥93.3 billion. Factors behind this decrease included yen appreciation, a decline in fuel surcharge revenues, and the fact that the revenues from the abolishment of the International Cargo Agency Commission were offset by expenses.
Performance of the International Cargo Business
(Index) Fiscal year 2013 = 100

In our freighter operations, we will also pursue a year-on-year reduction in ATKs of approximately 10% by flexibly revising our route network. The end goal of this move will be to improve profit- ability through an increased ability to respond to demand fluctua- tions. At the same time, we will build upon our collaborative relationship with Overseas Courier Service Co., Ltd., to reinforce cross-border e-commerce operations and other distribution ser- vices in Asia.
As a result of the above initiatives, we are projecting a 5.0% year-on-year increase in total operating revenues from Cargo and Mail from both Domestic and International Cargo businesses, which is forecast to come to ¥139.0 billion in fiscal year 2017.

Create new demand and capture inbound travel demand to drive the growth of Japan’s LCC market
 Performance in Fiscal Year 2016
Vanilla Air Inc. established international routes including the Kansai–Taipei (Taoyuan) route in April 2016, the Taipei (Taoyuan)– Ho Chi Minh City route and the Okinawa–Taipei (Taoyuan) route in September, and the Narita–Cebu route in December. New domestic routes included the Narita–Hakodate route and the Narita–Kansai route established in February 2017 and the Kansai–Hakodate route and Kansai–Amami Oshima route launched in March. As a result of actively opening new routes in this manner, Vanilla Air’s network consisted of 7 domestic routes and 7 international routes on March 31, 2017, and it was operating these routes with 12 Airbus A320-200s.
In fiscal year 2016, the balance between supply and demand was disrupted on the Narita–Taiwan route and the Narita–Hong Kong route as a result of entry into the market and increases in the flights offered by other LCCs. We responded to this situation with flexible fare measures to secure a sufficient market share for inter- national flights while stepping up initiatives for taking advantage of the robust demand for domestic flights. These initiatives helped us maximize total revenues from domestic and international routes. Furthermore, Vanilla Air became a member of Value Alliance, an alliance of eight LCCs from Asia and Oceania that was established
Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
Vanilla Air will practice more rigorous yield control and otherwise increase the profitability of existing routes and enhance its network out of Narita Airport. In addition, this company will examine means of utilizing Value Alliance to strengthen its international route net- work and explore possible high-margin domestic leisure travel routes. Vanilla Air’s fleet development plan for fiscal year 2017 calls for it to introduce three Airbus A320-200s for a total of 15 aircraft.
Having been consolidated into the ANA Group, Peach Aviation Limited will accelerate its growth, utilizing late night and early morn- ing slots at Haneda Airport and domestic hubs to enhance its route network. In addition, Peach will begin utilizing Sendai Airport in
in May 2016. Through this alliance, from November 2016, it became possible for passengers to make combined bookings via Vanilla Air’s website for connecting flights operated by Scoot Pte Ltd., a member of Value Alliance.
As a result of these initiatives, ASKs in the LCC Business increased 24.4% year on year and RPKs were up 25.2%, while the load factor increased from the previous fiscal year to the high level of 85.8%.

Growth Strategies and Materiality

   Airline Related
  Continue expanding and diversifying revenue domains
Performance in Fiscal Year 2016 and Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
In fiscal year 2016, operating revenues in the Airline Related business were ¥264.4 billion, up 14.0% year on year, due to increased contracting of airport ground handling services primarily at Haneda Airport and Kansai Airport. Meanwhile, operating income of ¥8.3 billion was recorded, compared with an operating loss of ¥4.2 billion in fiscal year 2015, when a one-time write-off of the unamor- tized balance of goodwill associated with a U.S. pilot training company was conducted.
In fiscal year 2017, increases in flights by foreign airlines are expected, which will enable us to contribute to Group revenues through contracts to provide passenger and cargo handling ground support services and to supply in-flight meals for these airlines. Meanwhile, aircraft maintenance company MRO Japan Co., Ltd., will speed up preparations for the start of operations in Naha during fiscal year 2018. Going forward, the Airline Related business will continue to expand and diversify its revenue domains by developing its airline support operations.
As a result of these efforts, this segment is anticipated to post operating revenues of ¥274.0 billion in fiscal year 2017, up 3.6% year on year, and operating income of ¥9.0 billion, up 8.3%.
Travel Services
Stimulate inbound travel demand to increase revenues
Performance in Fiscal Year 2016 and Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
In domestic travel services, sales for Tabisaku dynamic packages were up due to the offering of the Kyushu Fukko Wari discount campaign and other factors. However, operating revenues were down due to factors including the impacts of the Kumamoto earthquakes on sales of mainstay ANA Sky Holiday travel packages.
In overseas travel services, sales of our mainstay ANA Hallo Tour travel packages were firm, particularly those for travel to Hawaii and Oceania. Regardless, operating revenues were down due to the impacts of terrorist attacks in Europe.
As a result of the above, operating revenues from the Travel Services business in fiscal year 2016 fell to ¥160.6 billion, down 4.0% year on year, and operating income decreased to ¥3.7 billion, down 12.8%.
In fiscal year 2017, we will work to ensure sales of existing travel packages while expanding our lineup of high-value-added travel products and resort packages. In addition, we will bolster product competitiveness by allowing for Internet reservations to be made. Furthermore, sales systems compatible with multiple languages will be utilized to steadily incorporate inbound travel demand and raise revenues.
Through these initiatives, in fiscal year 2017 we expect to achieve a 5.8% year-on-year increase in operating revenues, to ¥170.0 billion, and a 20.3% jump in operating income, to ¥4.5 billion.

   Proactively expand operations in growth fields
Performance in Fiscal Year 2016 and Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2017
In the retail business, ANA DUTY FREE SHOP and ANA FESTA airport shops achieved strong sales amid changes in the purchasing behavior of inbound travelers resulted from the strong yen and a hike in custom taxes by China. This outcome was largely due to an increase in passengers on international services and the enhancement of our lineups of products matched to the chang- ing preferences of inbound travelers. In the food business, revenues from fresh foods were solid while sales of processed foods declined. Meanwhile, semiconductor-related orders were down in the aerospace & electronics business.
As a result, for fiscal year 2016 operating revenues in the Trade and Retail business decreased 2.5% year on year, to ¥136.7 billion, and operating income fell 17.5%, to ¥4.3 billion.

   Initiatives planned for fiscal year 2017 include stepping up usage of customer data to reinforce airport and Internet sales and other core operations in the retail business. Also, we will expand our market share for mainstay bananas in the food business while increasing the ratio of overseas sales through exports of Japanese food products and processed agricultural and fishery produce.
Furthermore, the ANA Group will pursue higher revenues by flexibly responding to changing consumer tastes along with the expansion of cross-border e-commerce operations and the commencement of full-fledged participation in the operation of city-type duty-free stores.
As a result of these initiatives, we forecast fiscal year 2017 operating revenues of ¥146.0 billion, up 6.8% year on year, in this segment and operating income of ¥4.5 billion, an increase of 2.6%.

 Consolidation of Peach Aviation Limited
 Soaring toward the Growth Stage in the LCC Business by Enhancing the Group’s Comprehensive Capabilities
The LCC Business will be crucial to efforts to “expand airline business domains,” one of the main initiatives of the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy.
Peach Aviation Limited was established in February 2011 and took to the skies out of Kansai Airport as Japan’s first LCC.
Performance at this company has grown steadily since its establishment. Recently, ANA HOLDINGS acquired addi- tional shares of stock in Peach, and this company was consequently converted into a consolidated subsidiary.
In this special feature, we will explain the goal behind consolidating Peach and our plans for future business portfolio development while also taking
a look at the current situation surrounding
Peach and its business.

  Message from ANA HOLDINGS INC. Purpose of Consolidation of Peach
Peach commenced flights on the Osaka (Kansai)–Sapporo (New Chitose) and Osaka (Kansai)–Fukuoka routes in March 2012. While increasing its brand recognition in the Kansai area, Peach has been catering to demand that differs from that served by the ANA brand, thereby heightening performance and gradually expanding the scale of its operations. As a result, Peach was able to achieve profitability in fiscal year 2013, and earn total profits that exceeded aggregate loss in fiscal year 2015.
By increasing its investment, ANA HOLDINGS hopes to support the growth of Peach as it pursues further development in the period of its “second founding,” which began in fiscal year 2016. With ANA, Vanilla Air, and now Peach, the Group operates three airline brands, through which it aims to further expand airline business domains. Looking ahead, Peach will cater to a wide spectrum of demand, from business travel to leisure travel, with its distinctive low-cost operating system as an LCC, while addressing demand for inbound travel, which is expected to grow in the future.

Unique Positioning of Three Airline Brands
With newly consolidated Peach, we plan to foster intra-Group coordination in various areas of operation and to reflect this coordination in the network development and marketing activities of each company.
The operations of both Vanilla Air and Peach will be expanded while maintaining a clear division between the management of these companies. Striving to operate businesses that are closely linked to customers’ lives, these two companies will deploy community-rooted services as Japanese LCCs to continue uncovering latent demand. Moreover, the operational quality fostered by ANA and the cost control measures of LCCs will be shared to enhance the Group’s comprehensive capabilities. At the same time, we will step up coordination for promoting safety.
The establishment of mid-distance LCC routes will also be examined as a possible option in our quest to grow top-line earnings.
The ANA Group aims to steadily improve profitability by optimizing its airline business portfolio, including the ANA brand.

    Peach is cruising toward its goal of becoming a “bridge for Asia.”
Message from Peach Aviation Limited
Peach’s Corporate Philosophy and Brand Concept
First spreading its wings in March 2012, Peach is Japan’s first LCC. We also pride ourselves on being an airline based on a completely new concept.
Guided by the concept of functioning as a “flying train,” we base our operations out of Kansai Airport, capitalizing on the fact that it is closer to Asia than the Tokyo metropolitan area, and are rapidly developing routes founded on this unique business model.
Six years have passed since the birth of Peach. However, these six years have been nothing more than our preparing for full-fledged takeoff. Looking ahead, Peach will take a step ahead of the price competition, and will embrace the slogan “from price competition to value creation” in order to differentiate the experience of flying Peach beyond the conventional framework of airlines and continue to cultivate demand in the ever-growing Asian market.
What Peach is aiming for is to become a “bridge for Asia.” It is our dream to enable everyone to travel around Japan and Asia casually and at modest fares and to create a world filled with happiness and warm smiles by bringing people together.
Peach’s Customers
The majority of Peach’s customers are women, and a large portion of our customers are in their 20s and 30s. On international routes, over 70% of passengers are non-Japanese, demonstrating that the casual travel style proposed by Peach is gaining traction in other Asian countries.
Passengers flying Peach primarily do so for leisure trips or to visit relatives, but we are also seeing customers that use our services for completely new types of travel. These customers include university students taking daytrips overseas, parents working away from their families who return home to Sapporo from the Kansai region on a weekly basis, groups of Taiwanese youth who fly from Taipei to Okinawa to get their hair done, and couples in a long- distance relationship that frequently visit each other.
By offering affordable fares, Peach encourages customers to use airplanes more often in their daily lives, thereby cultivating a new type of air travel demand that differs from that targeted by conventional airlines. We believe that there is still significant room to increase overall demand, and are committed to growing the market on into the future.

   Peach’s Business
As of July 31, 2017, Peach operated 25 routes (13 international routes and 12 domestic routes) primarily out of Kansai Airport and Okinawa (Naha) Airport. In fiscal year 2016, Peach became the first Japanese LCC to open routes to Shanghai (the Kansai–Shanghai (Pu Dong) and Haneda–Shanghai (Pu Dong) routes) as well as to Bangkok (the Naha–Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi) route). As a result, this company was able to serve 5,130,000 passengers in fiscal year 2016.
Peach is planning further expansion of its domestic and international servies, and is scheduled to increase flights out of Sendai in September 2017 and out of New Chitose in fiscal year 2018, thereby utilizing them as additional primary airports.
Peach’s goal is to go beyond simply transporting customers to their destination in order to function as an engine driving the vitalization of local communities. We believe it is possible to contribute to the ongoing energization of the regions connected by our network through collaboration with local stakeholders (municipal governments, industries, airports, providers of non-air transportation to and from airports, and airlines) to uncover the appeal of these regions. As we first commenced initiatives based on this collaborative model in the Kansai region, we refer to this
model as the “Kansai model.” Initiatives using the Kansai model are currently under way in Okinawa, and we plan to introduce this model into the Tohoku region, Hokkaido, and other regions across Japan going forward. Through such collaboration with local communities, we aim to vitalize industries in a manner that is fundamentally different from the temporary tourism booms previously targeted by such initiatives.
Peach’s policy for the future is to discover latent demand by further analyzing customer needs to propose new types of travel. Safety will continue to be our top priority as we seek to accomplish this task. Peach is cruising toward its goal of becoming a “bridge for Asia.” We hope you will look forward to the saga of Peach as we move forward on this journey.

 Basic Approach
With the conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 2015 at the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Japanese government set its own targets related to the reduction of green- house gas emissions. In addition, following decisions at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Assembly in 2016, from 2021, carbon neutral growth, with no increase in CO2 emissions from international aviation, has become an interna- tional pledge. Accordingly, airlines are increasingly aware of CO2 emission reductions.
In 1998, the ANA Group established the ANA Group Environmental Principles, and we have worked to reduce the envi- ronmental burden in accordance with “ANA FLY ECO 2020,” a medium- to long-term environmental plan from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2020.
Now, to demonstrate in Japan and overseas our quest to become a leading eco-friendly airline group, we formulated the ANA Group Environmental Policies in June 2017.
activities to reduce environmental burden. In particular, we have positioned the controlling of CO2 emissions from flight operations as our most important issue. The Group will pursue the creation of both economic and social value through controlling fuel expenses and reducing environmental burden.

ANA Group, recognizing the global environmental issues, including climate change and the conservation of biodiversity, as a quintessential management task, aims to be an “Environmental Leading Airline Group” through all engaged activities.
1. We will precisely grasp and analyze the impact of our business activities on the environment, and disclose it to society.
2. We will promote environmental preservation in line with social needs that go above and beyond the pertinent laws and regulations, through widespread conversations with stakeholders.
3. We will promote measures to reduce the environmental impact in all related businesses and operations, and we actively pursue possibilities of new technologies and services for this purpose.
4. We will constantly pay close attention to the environmental consideration of supply-chains, and promote the environment-conscious procurement.
5. We will intensify the “3R” (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) activities and waste management in an effort to contribute to the creation of a recycling society.
6. We will encourage our workforce to engage in environmental preservation activities, raising each and every employee’s awareness and consciousness.

   Initiatives to Control CO2 Emissions
From fiscal year 2016, we are classifying greenhouse gas emissions as scope 1, 2, and 3 in accordance with the standards of the Act on the Rational Use of Energy, and we are disclosing that informa- tion with the accuracy verified by a third party. In addition, we reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which has the objective of meeting the requests of investors for disclosure of information related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and we received a B rating (industry average: C rating).
Flight Operation Initiatives
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was adopted at the ICAO General Assembly in 2016, and is a growth scheme for international airlines that is not accompanied by increases in CO2 emissions from 2021. To control emissions, there will be a need for technical innovation related aircraft, improvements in operations, use of bio jet fuel, and utiliza- tion of emissions credits. The ANA Group has started preparations for CORSIA.
With the expansion of our international network, we have launched the Fuel Efficiency Project, under which we have imple- mented such measures as introducing fuel-efficient aircraft, revising flight methods, and cleaning engines to improve fuel efficiency as well as making progress clearly visible and thereby further mobilizing employees toward our goals. Consequently, by the end of fiscal year 2016 we had achieved the initial target of reducing fuel consumption by 42,000 kl.
 
The use of bio jet fuel is the focus of research and development initiatives in countries around the world, and preparations for the introduction of this fuel are under way. In Japan, the Committee for the Study of a Process Leading to Introduction of Bio Jet Fuel for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 has been estab- lished.

Certified Eco-First Company
In 2008, ANA became the first company in the airline industry and the transport industry to be certified by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment as an Eco-First company. This accomplishment was a reflection of the Ministry’s high evaluation of the com- pany’s stance toward emphasizing environmental initiatives and social responsibility.
In addition, we endorse the principles of the “COOL CHOICE”
Ground Operations Initiatives
Utilizing energy management standards that we formulated indepen- dently, we have taken steps to reduce energy use at all worksites. As a result, we have been successful in reducing energy usage by more than 1% each year, which is the goal described in the Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy. Since fiscal year 2016, the Company has been listed on the website of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as an S-rank company for exhibiting energy conservation excellence due to its ability to reduce energy consumption by more than 1% a year on average over the past five years. Currently, to advance consideration of greenhouse gas reduction measures for all Group companies in light with the Paris Agreement, we are taking steps to make key environmental/energy data clearly visible.
Also, targeting the achievement of a resource recycling-oriented society, we are advancing “3R” (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) activities for industrial waste. In particular, taking a rigorous approach to the management of industrial waste, we have moved forward with the introduction of the “e-Waste Management System,” which was installed at 111 worksites in fiscal year 2016.

This program focused on human rights risks present in the Group’s business activities. Over a one-month period, 92.7% of employees completed this program.
Stakeholder Engagement Programs
In May 2017, the Company participated in stakeholder engagement programs on human rights held in Thailand and Malaysia, both countries that ANA flies to, continuing the tradition of the engage- ment activities that took place in Japan in February and December 2015. These programs provided opportunities to develop an under- standing of the issues faced by local and migrant workers as well as the initiatives of government agencies, labor unions, and nongov- ernmental organizations (NGOs) for addressing these issues.

Improvement of customers’ safety and security and convenience from before boarding to after deplaning

    Facility Legacy of Diversity
Facility-related initiatives for responding to the needs of diverse customers include the use of plastic wheelchairs “morph” that help passengers move easily around check-in areas, through security checkpoints, and onboard aircraft. The ANA Group has also intro- duced passenger boarding bridge adaptors for turbo-prop aircraft to allow for comfortable boarding and deplaning by all customers, even on rainy, windy, or snowy days. Furthermore, electronic com- munication support boards that are compatible with 17 languages

Service Legacy of Diversity
The ANA Group strives to contribute to increases in receptiveness toward various senses of value in order to enhance its services to ensure that all customers can enjoy travel in their own unique way.
To this end, we conduct learning courses designed to foster understanding among employees with regard to the need to remove implicit barriers to access by differently abled individuals. These courses encourage employees to actively seek out means of

These ongoing efforts to remove access barriers in airports, onboard aircraft, and during boarding resulted in ANA and ANA WINGS CO., LTD., receiving the 10th Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Award for Barrier-Free Design Contributor. In addition, the departure counter at Haneda Airport Terminal 2 was recognized in the Good Design Award 2016 program after adopting universal design concepts.

In addition to discussion ses- sions between members of front-line staff responsible for training and external experts, we also invite NPOs, university representa- tives, and Paralympians on an ongoing basis to conduct lectures on removing implicit access barriers. Through these efforts, the ANA Group aims to cultivate human resources that can drive the movement to make Japan an implicit barrier-free society for all.
      Transformation into an Airline Group Supportive of the LGBT Community
In April 2015, the Group formulated the ANA Group Diversity & Inclusion Declaration, inspiring us to address issues faced by mem- bers of the LGBT community.
In fiscal year 2016, we changed restroom displays at ANA lounges to be more welcoming to LGBT customers at Haneda, Narita, and other airports. ANA also revised various products and services from the perspective of LGBT inclusion such as by enabling same-sex partners to be listed as family members and benefit receivers for the ANA Card Family Mile service, one of ANA’s mileage services.

    Utilization of Air Transportation Services
Since September 2013, ANA has been implementing the Tastes of JAPAN by ANA project. Under the themes of food, sake, sweets, and culture, the project is featuring three prefectures every three months, until all 47 prefectures are covered over a period of approximately four years. (As of July 2017, 44 prefectures had been covered.)
The ANA Group is taking wide-ranging steps to communicate the appeal of Japan’s prefectures to customers in Japan and over- seas. For example, the Group is incorporating items such as food and desserts that use local specialties into ANA services (in-flight, lounges, airport shops, e-commerce sites, etc.), and the Group is introducing the culture and tourism resources of each region through a variety of in-house media.
Collaboration with Municipal Governments
To vitalize local communities and resolve social issues, the Company is moving ahead with the conclusion of comprehensive partnership agreements with municipal governments. These agree- ments extend over a wide range of areas, including tourism, culture, sports, expansion of population movement (promoting migration), countermeasures to the trend toward fewer children, the promotion of career opportunities for women, cooperation with overseas businesses, the establishment of safe and secure communities, and support during times of disaster. As of July 2017, we had concluded agreements with five prefectures (Mie, Shizuoka, Hokkaido, Kochi, and Tokushima), and we are working to vitalize local communities by leveraging our diverse network as an airline group.
Resolving Social Issues through Tourism
ANA has been selected as official sponsor of the 2017 International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, which is organized by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Together with UNWTO, ANA seeks for resolving a range of issues through tourism, including expansion of employment, the elimination of poverty, effective use of resources, and environmental conservation. In the course of these initiatives, the ONSEN & Gastronomy Tourism Association has been established with cooperation of the Japan Travel and Tourism Association, and ARI as a core member, provides tourists with the opportunity to experience Japan’s Onsen (hot springs), thereby promoting vitalization of communications among regions and long-stay tourism.

Preserving Biodiversity through Cooperative Initiatives with Regions and Other Companies
 Over a 13-year period starting in 2004, the ANA Group has worked together with 18 companies* from both inside and outside Okinawa on the Team Tyura Sango project, which is advancing initiatives for reviving the coral reefs, which are an important tourism resource.
With the development of coral revival techniques by local parties and the support of government entities, such as the Ministry of the Environment, Okinawa Prefecture, and Onna Village, approximately 7,000 heads of coral have been planted to date, contributing to the revival of the coral. As a result, the project was given the Minister’s Prize, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (fisheries and environmental conserva- tion category) at the 32nd National Meeting for the Healty Ocean in 2012, and first prize, the Environment Minister’s Award, in the 3rd Good Life Awards in 2015. * As of July 2017

 Developing a Next-Generation Education Program to Increase Interest in Aviation
 To introduce children to the work of the ANA Group, we are implementing the Aviation Classroom throughout Japan. In fiscal year 2016, the depart- ment in charge of CSR held the classroom eight times, and approximately 350 children participated. We communicated the importance of having dreams and continuing to work hard to achieve them.
From the second half of fiscal year 2017, as one part of career educa- tion for fifth and sixth grade elementary school students, we plan to offer a new program, “ANA Blue Academy.” This program will aim to develop think- ing skills by teaching about the work of airlines. Moving forward, we will offer this program in all 47 prefectures and work to contribute to the education of the next generation, which will take over industries and communities.
Ongoing Support for Recovery from Disaster Damage
The ANA Group implements aggressive support initiatives in the event of a natural disaster, which can cause significant damage to regional econo- mies. For example, we provide free air tickets to emergency support orga- nizations, and Group employees provide hot baths for people in disaster-stricken areas. To address the lengthening time required for the recovery of the region affected by the Kumamoto earthquakes in April 2016, in cooperation with Japan Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, we launched the Disaster Recovery Leader Connect Program in June 2017. With the objective of sharing experience and know-how through direct connections with recovery leaders, such as Hanshin / Awaji, Chuetsu, and Tohoku, we will support the air travel of approximately 100 recovery leaders over four years.

The ANA Group is participating in the Book & Toy Library 100 Project, which is being operated by the Tokyo Toy Museum and Bridge Asia Japan, an authorized NPO. Over three years, this project will donate books and toys to 100 elementary schools in Myanmar.
In January 2016, we delivered approximately 250 picture books and approximately 20 toys made with timber from forest-thinning at ANA Hearty Forest in Minami-sanriku. To date, we have made donations to 20 schools. Through this project, we will continue to implement activities that foster creativity and increase interest in learning.
Preserving Tourism Resources in Cambodia
As the world’s first official supporter of UNESCO, we are promoting educa- tional activities related to world heritage and other matters. With the launch of the Narita–Phnom Penh route in September 2016, we are supporting the Angkor Wat site preservation and restoration activities implemented by Sophia University as a supporter of the restoration of the Angkor Wat Western Causeway.
The ANA Group will contribute to the preservation of tourism resources and to the development of human resources through mobility support between Japan and Phnom Penh for the restoration activities, which have a target completion date of 2020, cooperation for events related to site preservation activities, and the introduction of activities in in-house media, such as ANA’s in-flight magazine, WING SPAN.
Limiting Food Waste in Singapore
Approximately 800 million people around the world do not have enough to eat, while, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 1.3 billion tons of food are thrown away each year.
From October 2016, ANA’s Singapore branch / airport office and the Asia / Oceania Office have worked in cooperation with the catering com- pany that handles in-flight meal preparation and loading and unloading, as well as related government offices. We are working in cooperation with Food BANK, a Singapore NGO, to accept food that would otherwise be thrown away and deliver it to people in need. For example, in-flight snacks that were not used on a flight but can still be stored for a fixed period of time are donated to a local childcare center. In these ways, the Group is working to limit food waste.

ParticipationintheBlueNumberInitiative bluenumber
In January 2017, the ANA Group became the first Japanese company to take part in the Blue Number Initiative, a global initiative developed by the Blue Number Foundation, which is headquartered in New York, with the aim of building ethical food supply chain platforms.
Concern is growing around the world for food safety and traceability, environmental preservation, and respect for human rights during food production processes. Amidst this trend, the ANA Group aims to use the platform provided by this initiative going forward to enhance its food supply chain management practices as they pertain to in-flight meals and other food-related areas of its operations. We thereby hope to provide customers with safe and trustworthy food while also offering support to food producers across Japan.
   Creation of an Inclusive Society
Collaboration with the Japan Blind Football Association
ANA concluded a partnership agreement with the Japan Blind Football Association in June 2016. Through this partnership, we have created a training program for employ- ees that uses blind soccer as a venue for cultivating internal understanding regarding diversity. In addition, we are also a partner to the Japan Blind Football Association’s sports class activities that entail dispatching instructors to give blind soccer lessons to elementary and junior high school students. In this capacity, we help encourage children to be understanding toward differently abled individuals, practice compassion, and always be cooperative.

High Expectations for ANA Contributions
When I look at ANA, I see a company that stands ahead of its peers in its devotion to sustain- ability. This devotion is visible in efforts such as ANA’s participation in the Blue Number Initiative for achieving food and other products’ supply chain traceability and ANA’s strides in promoting human rights and diversity.
The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is also seeking to ensure the success of the Tokyo 2020 Games from an environmental perspective, as indicated by its establishment of the Tokyo 2020 Games Sustainability Plan and the Tokyo 2020 Games Sustainable Sourcing Code. Similar consideration is being given to labor and human rights.
The world currently has its eyes on Tokyo, where the games will be held, and on Japanese companies. It is therefore my hope that ANA can come to be recognized as a leading company in the area of sustainability.

  Foundation Supporting Value Creation

 Safety
Safety is the foundation of ANA Group management, and maintaining safety is the unequivocal mission of every business in the Group.
■ Approach to Safety
Safety is the unequivocal value at the foundation of the ANA Group’s business activities and is the foundation of everything we do. We strive to ensure safe aircraft operations as a matter of course. We are also pursuing a variety of other forms of safety in the Group’s businesses, including the safety and security aspects of food services, cargo, and information.
The Group provides safety, which we must ensure as a company, and security, which is created as a result of providing customer safety. In this way, we ultimately enhance the trust of
society, which is earned through the accumulation of our steadfast daily efforts on the safety and security fronts.
The ANA Group’s safe operations are supported by mutual cooperation in an environment of mutual understanding and trust among a variety of occupational categories. We display the ANA Group Safety Principles and Course of ANA Group Safety Action, which are pledges shared by all ANA Group employees, at every workplace. They are the foundation for the activities of each individual employee.
     ANA Group Safety Principles
Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business.
Safety is assured by an integrated management system and mutual respect.
Safety is enhanced through individual performance and dedication.
■ Developing Human Resources Who Pass Down and Enhance Safety Culture
Course of ANA Group Safety Action
1 Strictly observe rules & regulations, and all actions will be grounded on safety. 2 As a professional, place safety as the #1 priority while keeping your health in mind. 3 Address any questions and sincerely accept the opinions of others.
4 Information will be accurately reported and shared in a timely manner.
5 Continuous self-improvement for prevention and avoiding re-occurrence.
6 Lessons learned from experiences and increased skills for risk awareness.
 The ANA Group is implementing safety tour events to preserve the memory of past air accidents and hijacking incidents and to support the objective of continuing to pursue safety by approaching safety matters sincerely. For these events, the president and other officers visit workplaces in Japan and overseas and engage in dialogue with our employees as well as with the officers and employees of subcontractors.
In addition, 10 years have passed since we opened the ANA Group Safety Education Center (ASEC), which was established for the study of past accidents and human error and to increase
Emergency evacuation training to learn
about assistance for necessary rescue activities in an emergency on board
safety awareness through such means as exhibitions of airframes involved in accidents and the use of video. At this facility, we continue to implement safety education for all Group employees.
To preserve the memory of such incidents as the Shizukuishi accident, which occurred on July 30, 1971, and a hijacking that occurred on July 23, 1999, each year we position July as a month for promoting aviation safety and strengthening aviation security. Activities include talks given by outside lecturers and initiatives to further increase safety at each workplace.

  ■ Framework for Maintaining Safety
In the ANA Group’s medium-term target for safety for FY2016–20, the four axes of safety risk management are operations, customers, employees (front-line), and security. In addition, in regard to these activities, we aim to work not only with the implementation of measures after an incident but also with occurrence prevention (using past incidents to prevent incidents of the same kind from arising) and prediction (using past experience to predict future incidents and prevent them).
Rather than focus on individual events, the Group is advancing prevention activities to establish countermeasures based on the analysis of causes using past data and on risk assessment. In addition, we are building a plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle through monitoring of the effects of countermeasures implemented with the use of various indicators and through on-site audits. As the safety promotion system’s highest decision-making body, the Group Comprehensive Safety Promotion Committee meets each month for reports and deliberations. The committee makes decisions on countermeasures and reviews results, and every fiscal year it confirms the degree of achievement of safety goals.
■ The Role of a Leading Airline Group
ANA periodically sponsors Japan InfoShare, a meeting with nearly all scheduled airlines, including airlines within the Group and domestic code-share companies. At this meeting, we actively exchange and share information regarding safety in a manner that transcends the boundaries of companies and groups.
In September 2016, ANA participated as host for Asia Pacific Aviation Safety Seminar 2016, an international meeting of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), which is Asia’s version of the IATA. Information related to safety was shared and discussed by a total of 160 participants, including not only airlines in the Asia–Pacific region but also civil aviation authorities and aviation-related manufacturers.
In addition, ANA also participated in the development of Airport Low-level Wind Information (ALWIN), which was jointly developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Japan Meteorological Agency and was placed into operation in April 2017. The ANA Group is contributing to airline safety by accurately observing and communicating the state of low-level wind that is invisible to the eye when aircraft land.
At the end of fiscal year 2016, the Group underwent a certification renewal inspection under the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program, which confirms the effective functioning of the safety management systems of airlines, and received the new certificate from IATA in May 2017.

■ Preserving the Memory of Past Accidents—Visiting the Shizukuishi Memorial Forest
   In 2017, it is 46 years since the Shizukuishi accident, in which an ANA aircraft and a Japan Self-Defense Force aircraft collided and crashed, and 51 years since the accident offshore Matsuyama and the accident offshore Haneda. Each of these accidents resulted in the deaths of passengers and crew members. In 1972, the year after the Shizukuishi accident, a memorial monument was built near the top of the mountain. Since that time, a “memorial forest” has gradually been established and been maintained through the efforts of local communities. Each year, many related parties, such as ANA Group managers, employees, and labor unions, participate in cleaning activities together with local communities.
The majority of officers and employees do not have direct knowledge from the time of the accident, and in this setting we are expressing our gratitude to local communities, sharing with all Group employees our prayers for the victims, and renewing our recognition of the importance for safety.
■ Safety Principles Handed Down On a Global Level
   ANA Group managers visit a memorial site (July 2016)
Visit to Shizukuishi Town Hall
 Through safety tour events, ANA Group managers directly communicate and share the importance of safety with local staff in Japan and overseas.
At airports of our international network, there are growing opportunities to consign work to local companies. As there are naturally differences among values and cultures, it is extremely important that we share the ANA Group Safety Principles and Course of ANA Group Safety Action, as well as their importance. Accordingly, managers visit workplaces, including those of subcontractors, as often as possible. Through dialogue with staff members who work hard each day as professionals, we actively recognize favorable examples of safety initiatives. In addition, we promote cooperation with local branches, airports, and subcontractors. In these ways, we are working to foster the spread of the ANA Group Safety Principles on a global level.

 Statement Regarding a Flight Pushing Back with an Exceeding Capacity
In regard to ANA256 from Fukuoka to Tokyo (Haneda) on September 30, 2016, which started operation with capacity exceeded, ANA received a severe warning, or administrative guidance, from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) on October 11, 2016.
We once again offer our sincerest apologies to customers and other related parties for causing significant worry and trouble.
To prevent the reoccurrence of such an incident, we have analyzed the causes, formulated and steadily implemented reoccurrence prevention measures, and strengthened our security management system.
1) Causes and Background of This Event
This event happened due to the occurrence of multiple problems, as outlined below.
      Check-in procedures
Security checkpoint
Onboard
    Two passengers (A and B) simultane- ously downloaded to their mobile phones a barcode that was for use in boarding procedures by passenger A.
* In downloading the barcode, it is necessary to input information that is known only by the person who followed the reservation / purchase procedures.
A A
B A
An error alarm occurred when passenger B touched the bar- code to the terminal at the checkpoint after A. B was allowed to pass due to a mistake in the confirmation method by the attendant.
A
A
    Cause
Back- ground
Mistaken simultaneous download of a barcode
Incorrect response to Inappropriate procedure for the error display responding to the error display
Attendants had become used to read errors as they occurred frequently. Issues with the IT-based self-boarding model
No confirmation required that all passengers were in their seats prior to departure
  In regard to this matter, we received directions from MLIT for improvement of the following three points.
2) Reevaluation of Processes / Systems at Each Stage
 1 Reevaluation of system for check-in procedure confirmation process at the security checkpoint, and formulation of reliable countermeasures 2 Reevaluation of boarding procedure confirmation process at the boarding gate, and formulation of reliable countermeasures
3 Formulation of a reliable method for ascertaining boarded passengers and their number onboard
  We launched an urgent project led by ANA’s Senior Executive Vice President and Representative Director, who is in charge of the operation division. Based on analysis and verification of the causes of the incident, we thoroughly considered and formulated measures to prevent reoccurrence.
    Security checkpoint
Groupwide training • ANA’s president, vice president, and other related officers made on-site visits to the operation division. • Direct dialogue with Group employees has been repeatedly implemented to strengthen safety.
Boarding gate
Onboard
   • Reevaluated security checkpoint layout
• Installed covers on barcode readers at the security
checkpoints in certain airports
• Implemented issuance of “security check verification”
and confirmation by checkpoint attendants
• Reevaluated procedures for error displays
• Strengthened gate passage confirmation
• Implemented the issuance of a “boarding guidance form”
at the gate delivered by hand by an attendant
• Updated procedures so that departure takes place after confirmation that all passen- gers are in their seats
Due to the implementation of the above countermeasures, there has been no incident of this type since October 2016.
3) Looking Ahead
The move toward self-service for a variety of procedures through the use of IT leads to increased passenger convenience and the provision of stress- free service. It also facilitates increased efficiency in personnel allocation and time-saving, thereby increasing management efficiency. However, it is all the more necessary to thoroughly verify risks arising due to the move toward self-service and to establish countermeasures in advance, as well as to establish easy-to-understand services for passengers who are not accustomed to these boarding and other procedures. Moving forward, we will continue working steadily to achieve safety and on-time operation so that passengers can board with peace of mind.
Boarding gate
Following passenger B, A touched the barcode to the terminal at the boarding gate, resulting in an error warning. The identity of the person was confirmed in accor- dance with procedures, and A was allowed onto the aircraft. B boarded the aircraft without completing the boarding procedures.
A A
Passenger B’s reservation was canceled due to incomplete boarding procedures and the seat was provided to another stand-by passenger. The fact that the number of passengers was one over capacity was discovered only after the aircraft left the apron, and accordingly the aircraft turned back immediately.

  Deepening the Practice of ANA’s Way
The ANA’s Way AWARDS system has the objective of strengthening the framework for the provision of praise. Through this award system, which screens all Group employees working in Japan and overseas and makes commendations, we are sharing favorable examples from worksites throughout the Group.
In addition, the Group employee awareness survey (ANA’s Way Survey) aims to bolster the practice of ANA’s Way through the regular observation, analysis, and improvement of such items as thoughts and attitudes toward work and workplace satisfaction. In fiscal year 2016, the Company held the 14th survey for employees of 44 Group companies, including employees hired overseas, and approximately 35,400 people responded (response rate: 96.8%).
Moreover, we have introduced the ANA’s Way Implementation Evaluation System as our human resources evaluation system.
The objectives of this system are to further enhance the sharing of objectives and values, to help employees to understand the type of professional development they should aim for, and to advance realization of the Management Vision.

Support for the Success of Women at the Group and
Global Level
In February 2017, the ANA Group signed the CEO Statement for Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs). This initiative, which is promoted by the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and UN Women, bolsters gender equality in high-level corporate leader- ship. The Company cooperated in the test operation of the WEPs GAP Analysis Tool, a self-assessment tool intended to foster understanding of WEPs.
In addition, the Group is working to support the success of women on a Groupwide basis through ongoing network building and information exchange through ANA-WINDS, which is com- posed of female managers among the Group. The establishment of environments that draw on diverse viewpoints, sensibilities, and values to foster continued success has been positioned as a management issue, especially for ANA, where women account for more than half of the employees. Accordingly, ANA has formu- lated numerical targets in such areas as the number of female offi- cers and the ratio of female managers.
ANA’s Numerical Targets (by the end of fiscal year 2020)
Initiatives for the Employment of People with Disabilities
Aiming to establish workplace environments that make it easy to work, regardless of challenges, the Group is promoting the adop- tion within the Group of the 36K-Employee Kickoff approach to the employment of people with disabilities and working to system- atically expand employment of people with disabilities. In March 2017, the ANA Group (12 qualified Group companies) was awarded the highest level of Gold in the ACCESS 2017 Index of the Accessibility Consortium of
Enterprises (ACE), a general incorpo- rated association. This index evaluates the initiatives of companies related to the employment of people with disabilities.
LGBT Initiatives
The ANA Group is working to promote diversity among customers and within the Group, to advance understanding of LGBT issues. In fiscal year 2016, we established the ANA Group LGBT Hotline, which is for the exclusive use of employees. The hotline is provid- ing consultation services so that all of our diverse employees can work to their full potential. In response
to this initiative, the ANA Group secured the highest level of Gold in the PRIDE Index from work with Pride*, which is Japan’s first index that evaluates LGBT- related initiatives.
* work with Pride: A private voluntary organization that supports the promotion and establishment of diversity management related to sexual minorities, such as LGBT individuals.

This leads to the further enhancement of personal lives through the effective use of time and to work innovation based on new concepts.
Furthermore, as one facet of measures to establish a corpo- rate culture in which employees can be active at each stage, tar- geting the implementation of “flexible working styles that are not limited by time or place,” we introduced trials of a telecommuting system from 2009, and from January 2017 we expanded the eli- gible people and the number of days permitted. In these ways, we are aggressively enhancing the work environment.

■ ANA Group Health Management Declaration
In accordance with the idea that “securing the safety and health of employees and establishing a comfortable workplace environment are the foundation of business activities,” in April 2016 we announced the ANA Group Health Management Declaration.
A Chief Wellness Officer, who has responsibility for promoting Group health management, has been appointed from among the Company’s directors. In addition, a Wellness Leader with respon- sibility for administration has been appointed at each Group com- pany. In this way, we have established a promotion system.
Under this declaration, the Group will conduct focused initia- tives to strengthen employee health management, disease pre- vention, mental healthcare, and safety and health activities. In addition, we have established indicators regarding lifestyle-related diseases and are working to track progress. Furthermore, in addi- tion to the establishment of a health management system, includ- ing stress checks under a comprehensive Group system, we also have expanded disease countermeasures for women.
Consequently, in February 2017 the Company was certified by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as 2017 Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization, large enterprise category (White 500), which is awarded to companies that are implementing especially strong health and productivity management.

  ■ Securing and Developing Human Resources for the Future
 In international business, the Group is working to expand its network and accelerate global business development initiatives. In these endeavors, we consider human resources an important asset for the Group, and are working to steadily secure and develop human resources who will support quality and business operations, including the pilots and cabin attendants who work in front-line divisions.
Example of Policies for Securing and Developing Human Resources
In consolidating the training facilities that had previously been in separate locations, the Group will create an environment that facilitates efficient training that unites all employees related to operations, from departure to arrival of aircraft.
In addition, we plan to open certain training facilities that had
previously not been open to the public.

 ■ Process of Nominating Director Candidates and Selection and Term Policies
  The Company has established the Personnel Advisory Committee, which is membered by a majority of outside directors, as an advisory body to the Board of Directors to ensure transparency and impartiality of decision-making with regard to selecting director candidates. This committee consists of three outside directors and one internal direc- tor, for a total of four members, and provides prudent suggestions to the Board of Directors with regard to the selection of director candi- dates based on discussions among committee members.
Directors are selected from candidates inside and outside of the Company that have the potential to contribute to improvements with regard to appropriate policy-making, decision-making, and oversight befitting an airline group operating diverse, global businesses centered on the Air Transportation business. Potential candidates are honest in character and possess extensive experience, broad insight, and highly specialized expertise. The selection is made within the scope of relevant laws such as the Civil Aeronautics Act and regardless of factors such as gender or nationality. The articles of incorporation deem the term of directors as lasting until the closure of the final Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders related to the last fiscal year to end within a
period of one year from their appointment. This provision is meant to prevent issues impeding the reappointment of directors.
Directors
In addition to the chairman, who chairs the Board of Directors; the president, who is the highest authority for business execution; and the CFO, internal directors are selected from candidates that include the president and CEO of ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. (ANA), the core company of the Group; corporate executive officers responsible for managing overall Group operations; and Group companies’ direc- tors that are familiar with Group businesses.
Outside Directors
Several outside directors are selected from among candidates that possess a practical viewpoint based on their vast experience in cor- porate management or from among candidates that have a global or community-oriented viewpoint owing to a high level of knowledge about social and economic trends. Candidates are also to be inde- pendent from the Company.
■ Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member Remuneration
 The basic policies used in the determination of remuneration of direc- tors of the Company are as follows.
The Board of Directors decides on director remuneration, taking into account reports by the Remuneration Advisory Committee. The total amount of director remuneration shall be within the scope of the amount approved at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. The Remuneration Advisory Committee, an advisory body to the Board of Directors with outside directors and outside experts
comprising a majority of the members, establishes the Company’s remuneration system and standards for director remuneration based on other companies’ levels as researched by an external institution upon the Company’s request.
In addition to a fixed basic remuneration, the remuneration for directors (excluding outside directors) consists of a performance- linked bonus and long-term incentive share remuneration plan as a means of providing healthy incentives for pursuing sustainable growth for the Company.

Reinforcement of Corporate Governance
■ Initiatives for Reinforcing Corporate Governance Systems 2013 Shifted to the holding company structure
2015 Established Fundamental Policy on Corporate Governance
The Company is in compliance with all principles of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code (as of June 30, 2017). The Fundamental Policy on Corporate Governance was established in November 2015.
2016 Revised Authority of Board of Directors and Group Management Committee
In April 2016, the scope of authority for the Board of Directors and the Group Management Committee was revised to ensure that the Group can compete sufficiently in this fierce, competitive environment by making swift and bold decisions.
Specifically, we revised standards for introducing proposals to transfer a large portion of authority from the Board of Directors to the Group Management Committee. Transferred authority included that for decisions related to important business execution matters requiring swift decisions, such as those pertaining to selecting investment candidates and executing investment. Meanwhile, it was decided to enhance the Companywide strategy drafting functions of the Board of Directors while fleshing out the standards dictating when the Group Management Committee should report to the Board of Directors to strengthen the supervision function.
By implementing these changes in authority, we will strengthen the supervision function of the Board of Directors and realize aggressive and speedy management.

■ Analysis and Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
1. Method of Evaluation
The Company recognizes that it is important for the Board of Directors to constantly undergo self-evaluation, through which it should look for new solutions while always thinking of how to be a more ideal body and achieve better corporate governance. Accordingly, at least once a year the Company analyzes, evaluates, and discusses the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors in order to pursue improve- ments in effectiveness.
Recent initiatives include a survey administered to all directors and all Audit & Supervisory Board members in December 2016, which was focused on issues identified during the process of analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in fiscal year 2015. The results of this survey were reported to the Board of Directors in March 2017, contributing to effective self-evaluation.
2. Results of the Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Based on the analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors conducted in fiscal year 2015, we have been promoting more extensive discussions on subjects such as the business environ- ment prior to meetings of the Board of Directors in order to allow for more in-depth discussion when formulating management strategies. In addition, we have altered the standards for the delegation of authority in order to secure sufficient time for discussion at meetings of the Board of Directors (see page 76). Steps were also taken to facilitate understanding regarding the Group’s core business, including provid- ing a wide range of opportunities for explanations on management strategies to be received from the presidents of major subsidiaries.
It was confirmed through a survey that these initiatives have contributed to improvements in the support provided to outside direc- tors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members. The Company has assessed that the Board of Directors is functioning adequately and that it has secured an appropriate level of effectiveness in decision-making on important management matters and in properly overseeing business execution.
Meanwhile, the Company identified improvements that will need to be pursued to realize the further reinforcement of the Board of Directors’ oversight functions. These improvements include longer and more extensive discussions on the Group’s policies, including long-term management visions. We will formulate measures for real- izing these improvements in order to address the issues faced by the Board of Directors.
These analyses and evaluations will continue to be carried out going forward in order to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.

ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Shinichiro Ito
Outside Director ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Izumi Kobayashi
  Four years have passed since ANA HOLDINGS adopted the holding company structure. We arranged for
a discussion to be held between two directors that have been involved in the management of the Company since the time of this transition. During this discussion, they shared opinions about the successes of
the ANA Group to date as well as the path it should follow in improving corporate value going forward.
Initiatives for Strengthening Corporate Governance
Ito | Facilitating more active discussions among the Board of Directors is an important task to be addressed in strengthening corporate governance. It seems to me as though significant improvement has been seen on this front, as indicated by the various steps taken to enhance the materials necessary for carrying out discussions at Board meetings. What are your opinions with regard to the current state of corporate governance? Also, what areas do you see in need of additional improvement?
Kobayashi | Compared to when I first became an outside director four years ago, the nature of discussions at meetings of the Board of Directors has changed substantially. Directors are now very proactive in voicing opinions regarding fields other than their area of responsibility, leading to more active discussions overall. In addition, the delegation of certain decision-making authorities has streamlined the formulaic approval procedures that had previously been thrust upon the Board, enabling us to devote more time to developing an understanding of the Company’s corporate strategy and the Group's businesses. As such, it is now easier for outside directors to formulate an understanding of the Group as a whole.
Ito | We have been seeking to comply with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code since fiscal year 2015. I recall the ongoing process of examination and discussion that took place inside the Company and among the Board of Directors that was part of this undertaking.
Japan’s Corporate Governance Code is merely one of many tools. It is our job to use these tools for the improvement of the Company. (Ito)
Kobayashi | Investors do not simply check to see if a company is in compliance with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, and it cannot be guaranteed that compliance with the code will always be beneficial to the management of the Company. It is therefore important to explain these facts to stakeholders and to develop unique and suitable governance systems.
Ito | Japan’s Corporate Governance Code is merely one of many tools. It is our job to use these tools for the improvement of the Company. Moreover, even if we build the strongest of corporate governance systems, these systems will be pointless if they are not implemented in the spirit of raising the corporate value of the Group.

It is crucial for all Group employees to
have an effective understanding of corporate governance. (Kobayashi)
| In order for managers to implement corporate governance systems in this spirit, it is crucial for all Group employees to have an effective understanding of corporate governance. It is for this reason that it might be beneficial to create a governance system that allows employees to voice opinions directly to management.
Kobayashi

 Role of the Holding Company Structure
Ito | Four years have passed since we adopted the holding company structure. The transition to this structure was initially aimed at realizing swifter management and more empowered Group companies. Although I think that there is still room for improvement with regard to management speed, I feel as though we have made progress in empowering Group companies. Employees are now more mindful of consolidated performance as we have introduced systems for reflecting this performance into the compensation and delegated certain responsibilities to Group companies.
Kobayashi | The Group’s business has grown much more diverse over the past four years, but no one can deny that ANA is still an exceptionally large presence in the Group’s business portfolio. The recent consolidation of Peach Aviation Limited cast light on the need to optimize the Company’s business portfolio from a wide range of perspectives that is not limited to sales and employee numbers. The Comapny should pursue improvements in efficiency in terms of both businesses and finances by leveraging the strengths of the holding company structure while also steadily working toward a balanced allocation of employees on a Groupwide basis. The value of this structure could be seen as its ability to realize such improvements.
Ito | It is crucial that we strive to optimize our business portfolio now, when performance is firm. Moreover, it is important for the holding company structure to be utilized in a manner that makes everyone in the Group feel the benefits of this structure.
Kobayashi | The potential for changes in the business environment to materially impact performance in the future is a reality of being an airline group that must be considered. However, this risk can be hedged against by creating a structure in which the performance of other businesses can compensate for declines in the performance of the Air Transportation business.
Long-Term Improvement of Corporate Value
Ito | At the ANA Group, we place emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns in our business activities to facilitate the pursuit of sustainable growth. For example, we have set the goal of achieving a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2020. Initiatives aimed at achieving this goal include introducing fuel-efficient aircraft and supporting research of bio jet fuel.
Kobayashi | In the past, it has been common for Japanese companies to view the “E” and “S” elements of ESG as separate from their business, choosing to address these elements through
CSR activities. The Company’s efforts to incorporate ESG into its business put it a step ahead of other companies. Moreover, it would seem that the Company’s framework for linking initiatives related to the “E” and “S” elements, such as measures for addressing fuel consumption issues, to improvements in corporate value are clear and easy to explain to external stakeholders. Supporting local communities, for example, may not directly impact business, but it has the potential to help attract a larger number of customers through good branding. In this manner, the “E” and “S” elements can be seen as tied to sustainable business growth, and efforts can therefore be powerful assets for use in pursuing medium-to-long- term improvements in corporate value.
Diversity of the services offered to customers will be essential for future growth. (Kobayashi)
Ito | The importance of providing service that is accommodating to senior citizens and differently abled customers and of employing universal airport and aircraft facilities is also apparent. This need is currently being addressed by an internal Group project team. Furthermore, I am confident that encouraging women’s participation in the workplace and otherwise promoting diversity based on a broad definition will, in the end, contribute to higher corporate value for the Group.
Kobayashi | LCCs are growing their presence in the market by taking advantage of their greatest asset, their low price. Diversity will no doubt be an important asset as full service carriers seek to differentiate themselves from competitors amid the rise of LCCs. As the ANA Group develops its operations on a global scale, it will be absolutely essential for steps to be taken to ensure that the services provided by the airline business can be used by customers in various countries as well as by differently abled individuals and senior citizens. The provision of halal in-flight meals is just one example of possible steps. Diversity of the services offered to customers will be essential for future growth.
Also, the Group employs numerous women to work as cabin attendants and airport staff. Given that human resources are invaluable assets to companies, it is important to think seriously about how each and every employee will be able to develop their career within the Group over the long term.
   We strive to optimize our business portfolio now, when performance is firm. (Ito)

Preserve and Enhance Corporate Value by Taking Advantage of the Group’s Business Strengths
We are addressing materiality for the ANA Group and society, while incorporating input from stakeholders, to realize sustainable growth.
Basic Approach to CSR
In 2008, the ANA Group joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), an undertaking that companies and other organizations take part in voluntarily to help build a global framework for achieving sustainable growth. With the hosting of the Rugby World Cup 2019 and the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, Japanese companies will draw greater international attention going forward. The ANA Group remains commit- ted to advancing global CSR activities to create economic and social value, while identifying opportunities and risks we face through communication with domestic and overseas stakeholders.

The SDGs are a set of clearly defined global goals to be accomplished by 2030 in order to contribute to increased sustainability for society. Companies are expected to join the effort to achieve these goals.
CSR Promotion System
Based on the ANA Group CSR Regulations, the CSR, Risk Management, and Compliance Promotion Committee has been estab- lished. This committee, which operates under the guidance of the president and is membered by full-time directors and full-time Audit & Supervisory Board members, is tasked with establishing core policies, examining important matters, formulating proposals, and implementing activities related to CSR.

CSR Promotion Officer, and CSR Promotion Leaders are assigned at each Group company and department. These individuals promote CSR activities in their organization. Moreover, the Company practices engage- ment with domestic and overseas NGOs / NPOs, the UNGC, interna- tional institutions, and other stakeholders that are well-versed in social issues. This engagement helps us maintain an understanding of society’s expectations and desires for the Group to be reflected in our activities.

Social Responsibility Guidelines
The Social Responsibility Guidelines were established to serve as a code of conduct that all Group executives and employees must observe and consequently contribute to the reinforcement of founda- tions for Groupwide CSR management. The Group seeks to cultivate understanding and entrench awareness with regard to the guidelines among employees. Briefing materials, training tools, and employee awareness surveys are used for this purpose.
The ANA’s Way AWARDS—Excellence in Social Responsibility Award is presented to business sites that have engaged in activities making significant contributions to the improvement of corporate value for the Group. These activities could have helped resolve a social issue, been based on a new idea unbound by preconceived notions, or exhibited excellence in another way. By presenting these awards, we aim to further promote CSR activities.
Promotion of CSR throughout the Supply Chain
The ANA Group believes it is important to promote CSR measures not just in its own business activities but also throughout the entire supply chain, which includes suppliers, manufacturers, and subcontractors. To facilitate these efforts, we have established the ANA Group Purchasing Policy by referencing international social responsibility guidelines, such as ISO 26000. Based on this policy, we formulated the Supplier Management Policy and CSR Guidelines, which we share with business partners.
In fiscal year 2016, CSR monitoring surveys based on the CSR Guidelines were carried out at 170 business partners to promote CSR throughout the supply chain.

Compliance
Preserve Corporate Value by Enhancing Internal Systems and Further Entrench Mission Statement
The ANA Group is taking steps to minimize exposure to legal risks and prevent occurrences that could diminish corporate value by enhancing its compliance promotion system and continually conducting education and awareness-raising activities on a Groupwide basis.
Compliance Promotion System
Based on the ANA Group Compliance Regulations, the ANA Group promotes compliance initiatives with laws and regulations as well as other standards in its business activities. CSR Promotion Leaders are the driving force behind this compliance promotion system.
Major Initiatives
Fair Trade Initiatives
The Group recognizes the serious risks that may materialize in the event of a violation of the competition laws of the countries in which it operates, and is implementing measures to address these risks. Currently, we have Internal Rules for Competition Law Compliance in place and distribute the ANA Group Cartel Prevention Handbook, which provides commentary on these rules through specific case studies, to relevant departments. We also provide periodic education and e-learning programs for affiliates.
In addition, the Group has established the ANA Group Anti- Bribery Rules to address the anti-bribery laws of various countries and supplies employees with the ANA Group Anti-Bribery Handbook, which offers commentary on these rules through specific case studies, and training is provided on these rules.
Compliance with Various Laws
The Group must conduct fair competition and transactions in accor- dance with various laws and regulations related to sales and market- ing and various other areas. Accordingly, the Company provides seminars on the Act Against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, the Act Against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc. to Subcontractors, and contract affairs to help compli- ance staff master the appropriate knowledge.
At the same time, the Company conducts training and aware- ness-raising activities with regard to a range of laws and regulations that include legislation related to air transport and labor laws. These activities include holding seminars and issuing email magazines for Group companies.
Coordination with Overseas Branches
The Company has clearly identified venues for communicating between the Legal & Insurance department and overseas branches
In addition, the Company has secured clearly identified venues with the Legal & Insurance department and Group companies in order to establish a system that facilitates mutual communication.
and is stepping up measures to minimize exposure to legal risks on a global level and prevent occurrences that could diminish corporate value. Furthermore, the Company seeks to foster a mind-set focused on legal compliance, not only in Japan but among all Group execu- tives and employees, including those working overseas. To this end, we hold legal compliance seminars at overseas branches.
Implementation of Internal Reporting System
The Company has set out Group regulations concerning the handling of internal reporting as subordinate rules to the ANA Group Compliance Regulations. An internal reporting venue has been estab- lished within the Group, and we have also implemented a system that includes outsourcing reporting system processes to an external law firm. These reporting systems are available to all Group executives and employees responsible for operations, including temporary per- sonnel. The privacy of the caller and other relevant parties is pro- tected, and the Group assures that no punitive measures will be taken against those that seek consultation or cooperate in confirming facts.
Information is provided on these reporting systems via posters displayed within Group premises as well as through a dedicated website on the Group intranet.
Protection of Intellectual Property
The ANA Group works to upgrade its system for creating, protecting, and using intellectual property as well as for respecting the intellec- tual property rights of other companies and preventing infringements. We have clearly identified a contact venue within the Group for consultation and support on matters related to intellectual property, and the Company disseminates information through distribution of an internal newsletter and other media for the edification of all Group executives and employees.

 Competition Law and Anti-Bribery Law Seminars at Overseas Branches
Seminars were held at overseas branches on competition laws and anti-bribery laws in light of the recent trend toward government agencies around the world more strictly enforc- ing these laws to prevent actions impeding fair competition.
These seminars employed case studies that presented situations similar to those found at each business site based on the ANA Group Cartel Prevention Handbook and the ANA Group Anti-Bribery Handbook.
Held 4 seminars at overseas branches
   Investigations of Circumstances Surrounding Compliance at Group Companies
Seminar at an overseas branch
 Investigations of circumstances surrounding compliance at Group companies are conducted once each year. These investigations consist of self-checks on the degree to which compliance was practiced with regard to relevant laws and regulations as well as examinations of issues pertaining to each Group company and to the entire Group. Follow-up activities were conducted as necessary based on the findings to address any issues identified.

The ANA Group’s Risk Management
The ANA Group takes a two-pronged approach toward managing risk comprised of risk management measures conducted from a preven- tive perspective and crisis management in the event of materialization of a risk. Given the Group’s role as a provider of social infrastructure, business continuity management and information security are areas of particular importance. We prioritize initiatives in these areas accordingly.
Risk Management from a Preventive Perspective
Each Group company implements autonomous risk management activities that include identifying risks, analyzing and evaluating these risks, formulating and implementing countermeasures, and monitoring the results of these activities.
The Group companies confirm and evaluate the progress, effec- tiveness, and level of achievement of the measures taken with respect to significant risks identified in each organization. The Company also takes the lead in implementing measures to address issues faced by the entire Group and confirms progress through the CSR, Risk Management, and Compliance Promotion Committee.
Crisis Management in the Event of Materialization of a Risk
The ANA Group has constructed a crisis management system based on detailed manuals in order to minimize damage and ensure safe and reliable future operations by investigating the causes of crises.
The Emergency Response Manual (ERM) sets out responses to incidents with a direct impact on operation of the ANA Group’s aircraft including accidents and hijacks, and the Crisis Management Manual (CMM) provides responses to other crises including system failures, information leaks, and risks from external sources.
facilitate risk management activities. The role of CSR Promotion Leaders is to promote risk management in each Group company and department by executing risk countermeasures according to plans and to take swift action while contacting the secretariat in the event of a crisis.
Business Continuity Management (BCP)
The ANA Group has prepared a business continuity plan (BCP) that details policies and procedures for responding to large-scale natural disasters, such as an earthquake directly under the Tokyo metropoli- tan area or in the Nankai Trough. The provisions of this plan include measures for ensuring the safety of customers and all ANA Group officers and employees, minimizing the impacts on Group manage- ment and on society as a whole, and resuming normal operation as quickly as possible.
To better ensure business continuity, we have reinforced our communications network by deploying disaster prevention radio systems and satellite phones. In addition, we regularly hold safety confirmation registration drills as well as equipment operation drills at backup facilities.
Security Trade Control
The parts, chemicals, apparatuses, and other articles necessary for aircraft maintenance are exported to overseas airports and aircraft maintenance centers. Certain articles employ technologies that could be adapted to create weapons. Accordingly, we practice rigorous security trade control* of exported articles.
A stringent security trade control structure is maintained through once-annual audits and trainings. These activities target divisions that are considered exporters for being directly involved in exporting as well as divisions that are not considered exporters but are still involved due to handling customs clearance and other transportation- related processes.
* Security trade control is a term that refers to all regulations placed on exports from Japan by the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act.

Information Security
To preserve information assets, such as the personal information of customers, the ANA Group implements measures in compliance with technical standards, including ISO 27001 and other global standard guidelines, as well as various laws and regulations.
To ensure effective information security, the Group conducts annual Control Self Assessments (CSA) of the status of compliance with the ANA Group Information Security Management Regulations at
all Group companies and departments. The Group also consistently implements awareness-raising activities to firmly entrench information security rules throughout the organization.
Steps were also taken to increase our resilience to ever diversi- fying cyberattacks. In addition to reinforcing network monitoring precautions, awareness was promoted by regularly sending emails simulating targeted email attacks to all Group officers and employees.
 Major Initiatives in Fiscal Year 2016
 ERM and CMM Drills
Conducted 2 group drills
 Each year, regular exercises and drills are performed based on scenarios contained in the ERM and CMM crisis response manuals to promote readi- ness to address accidents, hijacks, and various other crises. These practical exercises and drills adopt an input-response format to contribute to more effective crisis management systems on a Groupwide basis.
  Equipment Operation Drills at Backup Facilities
ERM drill
Conducted 1 joint drill and 6 trainings
 Backup facilities have been established for use in the event that the ANA Group’s flight control facilities are rendered unusable due to a major disaster, such as an earthquake directly under the Tokyo metropolitan area, or some other incident. Regular joint drills and trainings are carried out at these backup facilities to improve flight control skills and to ensure that the equip- ment and software at these facilities are always up to date.
Compliance with Personal Information Protection Regulations
In fiscal year 2016, the Company revised its privacy policy and various other internal regulations to comply with Japan’s revised Act on the Protection of Personal Information (enacted on May 30, 2017) as well as similar overseas laws and regulations.
In addition, an e-learning program was instituted targeting all ANA Group officers and employees to instill a deeper understanding of how the revised Act on the Protection of Personal Information had changed and to foster awareness regarding proper handling of personal information.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Economic Conditions
General Economic Overview
In fiscal year 2016, the Japanese economy continued to experi- ence a gradual recovery, with consumer spending generally picking up in conjunction with ongoing improvements in corporate earn- ings and the job environment.
There are concerns about the risk of a downturn in the economy, including the threats of a potential slump in overseas economic conditions and terrorism and conflict in Europe and the Middle East. Nonetheless, the economic outlook for fiscal year 2017 is for a gradual recovery driven by improvements in the job market and income levels and the benefits of various government policies.
Fuel Price Trends
The Dubai crude oil price remained around $40 per barrel during the first half of the fiscal year, a level lower than that seen in the same period of the previous fiscal year. However, this price rose slightly during the second half and climbed above the price com- pared to the same period of last year. In light of the prolonged global crude oil supply glut, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed on concrete measures for reducing production around the end of November 2016. As a result, the Dubai crude oil price climbed to around $50 per barrel in December. Accordingly, the price was $51.2 per barrel as of March 31, 2017, with an average price for the fiscal year of $46.7 per barrel.
The market price of Singapore kerosene tracked the price of crude oil and ended at $61.9 per barrel as of March 31, 2017, with an average price for the fiscal year of $58.0 per barrel.
Foreign Exchange Market
The value of the yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar fluctuated greatly due to the influence of factors including the public vote in the United Kingdom in June 2016 that led to its decision to leave the European Union as well as the November presidential election in the United States. In addition, December 2016 saw the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank decide to raise interest rates for the first time in a year. Now, many expect that the gap between the interest rates of Japan and the United States will widen going forward. As a result, the yen was weaker in the second half of the fiscal year than it was in the first half. Consequently, the exchange rate ended the fiscal year at ¥111.4 per U.S. dollar and the average exchange rate for fiscal year 2016 was ¥108.4 per U.S. dollar.
Air Transport Traffic Trends
In 2016, the number of passengers on scheduled international flights of airline companies that are members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) increased by 8.0% compared with the previous year, to approximately 1,560 million. Passengers on scheduled domestic flights increased by 6.3%, to approximately 2,240 million. Moreover, scheduled global air cargo volume increased by 3.9%. (Source: IATA World Air Transport Statistics, 2017)
90 ANA HOLDINGS INC.
In fiscal year 2016, in terms of air transport traffic in Japan,
the number of passengers on trunk routes* increased by 1.9% from the previous fiscal year, to 42.30 million, while the number
of passengers on local routes* increased by 2.3%, to 55.82 million. In total, the number of passengers increased by 2.1%, to 98.12 million. The volume of domestic cargo decreased by 0.9%, to
0.90 million tons. The number of passengers carried by Japanese airlines on international routes increased by 11.7%, to 21.05 million. The volume of international cargo handled by Japanese airlines increased by 14.9%, to 1.59 million tons. (Source: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism preliminary report)
* Trunk routes refer to routes connecting Sapporo (New Chitose), Tokyo (Haneda), Tokyo (Narita), Osaka (Itami), Osaka (Kansai), Fukuoka, and Okinawa (Naha) airports with one another. Local routes refer to all other routes.

 Performance for Fiscal Year 2016
Overview of the ANA Group
The ANA Group, or “the Group,” comprises the holding company, ANA HOLDINGS INC.; 120 subsidiaries, including ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD., and 45 affiliates; and 63 consolidated subsid- iaries and 17 equity-method subsidiaries and affiliates as of March 31, 2017. Also, the Group had 39,243 employees as of March 31, 2017, up 2,970 year on year.
During fiscal year 2016, the major initiatives of the FY2016–20 ANA Group Corporate Strategy—“expand airline business domains” and “create new businesses and accelerate growth of existing businesses”—formed the backbone of our strategies. Accordingly, we practiced “aggressive and speedy management” for making simple and timely decisions regarding new invest- ments, the creation of innovations, and strategic investments.
Review of Operating Segments
Consolidated Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses, and Operating Income
Operating revenues in fiscal year 2016 decreased by 1.4%, or ¥25.9 billion, year on year, to ¥1,765.2 billion. Reasons for this decrease included a decline in fuel surcharge revenue caused by falling crude oil prices and a reduction in the yen-equivalent value of foreign currency-denominated revenues associated with the strong yen.
Operation-linked expenses increased in conjunction with the expansion of the Group’s business. Conversely, there was a decline in fuel expenses as a result of crude oil price and foreign exchange market fluctuations, and we engaged in exhaustive, Groupwide cost management initiatives. Accordingly, operating expenses decreased by 2.1%, or ¥35.0 billion, to ¥1,619.7 billion. Consequently, operating income increased by 6.7%, or ¥9.0 billion, to ¥145.5 billion.
 The Group’s reportable segments have been defined as “Air Transportation,” “Airline Related,” “Travel Services,” and “Trade and Retail.”

In the Air Transportation business, segment operating revenues decreased by 1.1%, or ¥16.8 billion, year on year, to ¥1,536.3 billion, due to the impacts of crude oil price and foreign exchange market fluctuations. There was an increase in expenses in conjunc- tion with the expansion of the Group’s business. However, there was also a decline in fuel expenses following market price fluctua- tions, and we benefited from exhaustive cost management initia- tives. Due to the above, operating income decreased by 0.2%, or ¥0.2 billion, to ¥139.5 billion. Results by business are as follows.

In the International Passenger Business, the Group sought to expand its network of flights in and out of Tokyo metropolitan area airports based on the Dual Hub Network Strategy. The Narita– Wuhan route was established in April 2016 and the Narita–Phnom Penh route, the only direct flight from Japan, was launched in September of the same year. ANA also commenced service on the Haneda–New York, the Haneda–Chicago, and the Haneda–Kuala Lumpur routes effective from October 2016 in order to utilize the convenience of Haneda Airport to incorporate demand for busi- ness travel. In addition, ANA increased flights on the Narita–Ho Chi Minh City route while introducing code-share flights with Vietnam

 Airlines in an effort to capture demand for inbound travel to Japan and from passengers connecting on flights between North America and Asia. Furthermore, the Narita–Mexico City route, a direct flight from Japan to Mexico, where Japanese companies are making significant inroads, was established in February 2017.
Strong demand for business travel from Japan continued throughout the fiscal year, and we were successful in incorporating demand for inbound travel to Japan as well as demand for interna- tional flights connecting through Japan. As a result, available seat-kilometers (ASKs) increased by 9.9% year on year, revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) rose by 12.2%, and load factor was up by 1.5 percentage points, at 75.8%. Furthermore, the number of passengers increased by 11.6%, to 9.11 million, and unit price decreased by 10.2%, to ¥56,669, following lower fuel surcharges and the impacts of yen appreciation. Consequently, operating revenues in the International Passenger Business grew by 0.2% year on year, to ¥516.7 billion.
In the Domestic Passenger Business, guided by the “Dynamic Fleet Assign Model,” which entails flexibly selecting the optimal aircraft size based on demand trends, Airbus A321-200s were introduced in November 2016, enabling us to better optimize supply to demand.
In regard to its route network, ANA established the Haneda– Miyako route and resumed service on the Kansai–Miyako route beginning with the summer timetable. In addition, late-night flights were operated on the Haneda–Okinawa route and flights were also increased on certain other routes for a limited period during the high-demand summer. Although demand declined due to the impacts of the Kumamoto earthquakes that occurred in April 2016. We sought to effectively set the level of Tabiwari discounts, a type of promotional fare, while discerning demand trends. Due to the above, ASKs decreased by 0.6% year on year and RPKs increased by 1.4%. Meanwhile, load factor was up by 1.3 percentage points, to 66.0%. The number of passengers rose by 0.7%, to 42.96 million, while unit price was down by 1.8%, to ¥15,787, following competition with rivals. As a result, operating revenues from the Domestic Passenger Business declined by 1.1%, to ¥678.3 billion.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis
In the International Cargo Business, the Group utilized its passen- ger aircraft network while also reorganizing its freighter network
to more efficiently incorporate demand. Overall cargo shipment volumes were low during the first half of the fiscal year. In the second half, however, demand recovered and grew for transporta- tion of electronic components, semiconductors, and automobile parts destined for China and other parts of Asia from Japan as well as demand for transportation of apparel and electronic compo- nents bound for North America from China. Our ability to capture
a wide range of demand for import, export, and trilateral cargo transportation led available ton-kilometers (ATKs) to increase by 9.0% year on year and revenue ton-kilometers (RTKs) to rise by 17.5%. Cargo volume was up by 17.7%, to 0.95 million tons, and unit price declined by 30.0%, to ¥98, due to yen appreciation, the impacts of competition with other airlines, and the fact that the expenses from the abolition of International Cargo Agency Commission were offset by related revenues*. As a result,
Cargo and Mail Business Results
(Fiscal Year)
Cargo and mail services revenues (¥ Billions)
operating revenues from the International Cargo Business decreased by 17.7%, to ¥93.3 billion.
In the Domestic Cargo Business, we sought to take full advan- tage of demand by scheduling additional services for high-demand periods. However, overall demand was sluggish throughout the fiscal year and operations were also impacted by unseasonable weather, causing a decline of 3.4% in cargo volume, to 0.45 million tons. Meanwhile, unit price rose by 0.6%, to ¥68, but operating revenues decreased by 2.8%, to ¥30.8 billion.
In the Mail Business, international operating revenues decreased by 27.0%, to ¥4.8 billion, while domestic operating revenues were down by 6.8%, to ¥3.4 billion.
As a result, total operating revenues from Cargo and Mail decreased by 14.8% year on year, to ¥132.4 billion.
* The abolition of International Cargo Agency Commission resulted in a year-on-year decrease of approximately ¥17.0 billion in operating revenues. (Operating expenses decreased by the same amount.)

 Operating Expenses
Operating expenses in the Air Transportation business decreased by 1.2%, or ¥16.6 billion, year on year, to ¥1,396.8 billion. Specific expense amounts and reasons for year-on-year changes are described below.
<Aircraft Leasing Fees>
Aircraft leasing fees increased by 4.5%, or ¥4.3 billion, year on year, to ¥100.0 billion. The number of leased aircraft in service increased by four from the end of previous fiscal year, to 63 at the end of this fiscal year.
<Depreciation and Amortization>
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 1.4%, or ¥1.8 billion, year on year, to ¥133.8 billion. This increase was largely attributable to the fact that the number of Group-owned aircraft on March 31, 2017, increased by seven compared with the end of the previous fiscal year, to 205.
<Aircraft Maintenance>
Aircraft maintenance expenses increased by 1.5%, or ¥1.7 billion, year on year, to ¥112.4 billion. Although yen appreciation helped to control increases in expenses, aircraft maintenance expenses rose due to an increase of replacing aircraft parts and performing engine maintenance.
<Personnel>
Personnel expenses increased by 3.5%, or ¥6.2 billion, year on year, to ¥185.4 billion, following a rise in the number of employees in conjunction with the expansion of business scale.
<Sales Commissions and Promotion>
Sales commissions and promotion expenses decreased by 12.5%, or ¥13.2 billion, year on year, to ¥92.7 billion. Although expenses related to sales commissions and product planning rose centered on the International Passenger Business, overall sales commis- sions and promotion expenses were down because of the abolition of International Cargo Agency Commission in the International Cargo Business (which also lowered operating revenues by the same amount).
<Contracts>
Contracts expenses increased by 8.2%, or ¥15.1 billion, year on year, to ¥201.3 billion. This increase was mainly due to a rise in outsourcing of operations to organizations outside the Group and higher internal transactions between reportable segments in conjunction with business scale expansion.
<Others>
Others increased by 1.0%, or ¥1.8 billion, year on year, to ¥182.7 billion. This increase can be attributed to a rise in expenses related to airport lounges and in-flight services resulted from higher passenger numbers on international flights amidst efforts to enhance service quality.

  Fuel and fuel tax expenses decreased by 10.7%, or ¥32.6 billion, year on year, to ¥273.6 billion, and accounted for 19.6% of seg- ment operating expenses, compared with 21.7% in the previous fiscal year. The main components of the decrease of ¥32.6 billion were price factors (including hedging) resulting in a decrease of around ¥44.0 billion and consumption volume factors resulting in an increase of around ¥11.5 billion.
Fuel consumption volume increased due to the expansion of operations on international services. The ANA Group is working
to control the increase in fuel consumption volume through con- tinuous fuel conservation efforts, including actively introducing fuel-efficient aircraft and such measures as adopting more efficient flight operation methods. In fiscal year 2016, measures to reduce jet fuel taxes were carried over from the previous fiscal year.
<Landing and Navigation Fees>
The number of flights decreased by 0.2% year on year for passen- ger aircraft on domestic operations, increased by 8.7% for passen- ger aircraft on international operations, and rose by 0.5% for freighters on cargo operations, excluding Vanilla Air flights. Landing and navigation fees were down by 1.7%, or ¥2.0 billion, to ¥114.5 billion, due primarily to the use of smaller aircraft on domestic operations, and the fact that yen appreciation helped to limit increases in expenses on international operations.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Airline Related business
Segment operating revenues in fiscal year 2016 rose by 14.0%,
or ¥32.5 billion, year on year, to ¥264.4 billion. This rise was due
in part to increased contracts for airport ground support work (boarding procedures, baggage handling, and others) at Haneda and Kansai airports. Operating income of ¥8.3 billion was recorded, in comparison to operating loss of ¥4.2 billion in fiscal year 2015, due to the absence of a one-time write-off of the unamortized balance of goodwill (approximately ¥10.0 billion) recorded at
the time of acquisition of stock in now-consolidated subsidiary Pan Am Holdings, Inc., recorded in the previous fiscal year.
Trade and Retail business
In the retail business, ANA DUTY FREE SHOP and ANA FESTA airport shops achieved solid sales. In the food business, sales were up for bananas, a mainstay product in this business, while sales of nuts, dried fruits, and other processed foods declined. Semiconductor-related orders were down in the aerospace & electronics business.
As a result, for fiscal year 2016 segment operating revenues decreased by 2.5%, or ¥3.5 billion, year on year, to ¥136.7 billion, and operating income declined by 17.5%, or ¥0.9 billion, to ¥4.3 billion.

          In domestic travel services, operating revenues decreased by 4.0%, or ¥5.4 billion, year on year, to ¥130.8 billion. Sales of Tabisaku dynamic packages were up, but overall revenues declined due to a decrease in sales of mainstay ANA Sky Holiday travel packages resulted from the impacts of the Kumamoto earthquakes.
In overseas travel services, operating revenues were down by 6.9%, or ¥1.4 billion, year on year, to ¥19.1 billion. For our main- stay ANA Hallo Tour travel packages, sales of products to Hawaii and Oceania were firm. However, those to Europe decreased significantly as a result of the lingering impacts of terrorist attacks in this region.
As a result, segment operating revenues decreased by 4.0%, or ¥6.7 billion, year on year, to ¥160.6 billion, and operating income was down by 12.8%, or ¥0.5 billion, to ¥3.7 billion.

 Non-Operating Income / Expenses
Net non-operating expenses totaled ¥6.0 billion, compared with net non-operating expenses of ¥5.3 billion in the previous fiscal year. Although there was an increase in equity in earnings of unconsoli- dated subsidiaries and affiliates and a decrease in interest expenses, interest income and dividend income were down. In addition, the amount of ¥5.4 billion recorded as special dividends in fiscal year 2015 also had an impact on year-on-year comparisons.
Cash Flows
Fundamental Approach
The ANA Group’s fundamental approach to cash management is to conduct continuous investments strategically to strengthen its competitiveness over the medium to long term while maintaining financial soundness.
Capital expenditures are ordinarily kept within the scope of cash flows from operating activities, including repayment of lease obliga- tions, to generate free cash flow, which enables us to increase shareholders’ equity and control total interest-bearing debt.
The Group’s primary means of raising funds are borrowings from banks and issuing bonds. The Group has also concluded commitment lines totaling ¥150.6 billion with leading domestic financial institutions to ensure reliable access to working capital in case of emergencies. All of the commitment lines were unused as of the end of March 2017.
In terms of investment in aircraft—our primary assets—the Group is able to take advantage of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)’s guarantee system.
Overview of Fiscal Year 2016
The Group recorded positive free cash flow of ¥42.4 billion, which was the sum of cash flows from operating activities and investing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled ¥3.3 billion. As a result, cash and cash equivalents increased by ¥43.9 billion from April 1, 2016, to ¥309.0 billion as of March 31, 2017.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
As a result of adjustments to the ¥139.4 billion in income before income taxes for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization, notes and accounts payable and notes and accounts receivable, and income taxes paid, net cash provided by operating activities was ¥237.0 billion, down by ¥26.7 billion year on year. The primary reason behind this decrease was that income taxes paid increased to ¥75.7 billion, up from ¥44.1 billion in fiscal

Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled expenditures of ¥194.6 billion, up ¥120.2 billion year on year. Uses of cash included payment for purchases of property and equipment totaling ¥224.8 billion resulting from payments upon delivery of aircraft and other assets such as spare parts and advance payments for aircraft to be purchased. In addition, payment for purchases of intangible assets, including investment in software, used cash of ¥29.5 billion. Conversely, proceeds from sales of property and equip- ment, which included aircraft, totaled ¥68.1 billion. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to ¥197.3 billion when excluding cash movements resulting in net proceeds of ¥2.6 billion from the acquisition and sale of periodic and negotiable deposits of more than three months.

Fundamental Approach to Aircraft Procurement
Aircraft are major investments that are used over the long term for more than 10 years. Decisions regarding the selection of aircraft types suited to routes and networks and the pursuit of the best fleet composition are among the most important issues for airline management.
The ANA Group’s fleet strategy is based on three basic policies: strengthening cost competitiveness by introducing fuel-efficient aircraft, optimizing supply to demand by increasing the ratios of narrow- and medium-body aircraft, and enhancing productivity by integrating aircraft types.
Fundamentally, the Group purchases and owns strategic aircraft it intends to use over the medium to long term. Also, we employ operating leases to procure aircraft to use over the short term or for capacity adjustment. The Group may also utilize sale and lease-back as a means of diversifying corporate financing meth- ods. In these and other ways, the Group constantly pursuits to select the most economical aircraft procurement method.

 Aircraft Procured in Fiscal Year 2016
Based on the aforementioned fleet strategy, the number of aircraft in service increased by 11 compared with March 31, 2016, to 268 as of March 31, 2017. During the fiscal year, the Group purchased 17 new aircraft, consisting of 10 Boeing 787-9s, one Boeing 787-8, four Airbus A321-200s, and two Airbus A320-200neos.
Changes in the Number of Aircraft in Service in Fiscal Year 2016
Conversely, the Group sold 16 aircraft during the fiscal year, including one Boeing 787-9, one Boeing 787-8, four Boeing 777-200s, one Boeing 767-300, two Boeing 737-700s, three Boeing 737-500s, and four Airbus A321-200s. Of these aircraft, six were leased back. The table below shows changes in the number of aircraft in service.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial Position
Assets
Total assets increased by ¥85.6 billion compared with March 31, 2016, to ¥2,314.4 billion, as of March 31, 2017.
Total current assets amounted to ¥666.7 billion on March 31, 2017, up ¥35.5 billion from a year earlier. Cash and deposits increased by ¥5.5 billion, to ¥60.8 billion, and marketable securities increased by ¥35.5 billion, to ¥257.9 billion. As a result, liquidity on hand from cash on hand and in banks and marketable securities increased by ¥41.1 billion, to ¥318.7 billion.
Total non-current assets at the end of the fiscal year stood at ¥1,647.1 billion, up ¥50.0 billion from a year earlier. This rise was primarily a result of an increase in property and equipment stemming from the acquisition of aircraft as well as an increase in investments in securities associated with investment in Vietnam Airlines.
Liabilities
Total liabilities decreased by ¥43.6 billion compared with the end of the previous fiscal year, to ¥1,390.2 billion, as of March 31, 2017.
Total current liabilities totaled ¥572.6 billion at the end of the fiscal year, a decrease of ¥12.8 billion from a year earlier. This decrease was largely attributable to a decline in accrued income taxes.
Total long-term liabilities amounted to ¥817.5 billion on March 31, 2017, a decrease of ¥30.8 billion from a year earlier. This result was primarily due to declines in long-term loans and liability for retirement benefits.
Interest-bearing debt, including finance lease obligations, increased by ¥25.9 billion, to ¥729.8 billion. The debt/equity ratio declined from 0.9 times to 0.8 times. The debt/equity ratio including off-balanced lease obligations decreased from 1.0 times to 0.8 times.

Total net assets increased by ¥129.2 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year, to ¥924.1 billion, as of March 31, 2017.
Shareholders’ equity increased by ¥82.8 billion from March 31, 2016, to ¥933.1 billion as of March 31, 2017, due in part to retained earnings rising to ¥334.8 billion, an increase of ¥81.3 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, after the recording of net income attributable to owners of the parent.
Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased ¥46.3 billion, to ¥14.0 billion. Factors behind this outcome included a decrease in deferred loss on hedging instruments.
As a result, total shareholders’ equity increased by ¥129.2 billion from the previous fiscal year-end, coming to ¥919.1 billion at the end of the fiscal year. The shareholders’ equity ratio increased 4.3 percentage points, to 39.7%.

 Retirement Benefit Obligation
The ANA Group’s defined benefit plans consist of welfare pension fund plans, defined benefit corporate pension plans, and lump-sum retirement benefit plans. In addition, the Group has adopted defined contribution pension plans. Certain employees are entitled to additional benefits upon retirement.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries adopting defined-benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum retirement benefit plans use a simplified method for calculating retirement benefit expenses and liabilities.
Group had a hedge ratio for U.S. dollar fuel payments of approxi- mately 50% for fiscal year 2017, approximately 25% for fiscal year 2018, and approximately 10% for fiscal year 2019.
<Fuel Expense Sensitivity>
Fuel expense sensitivity to fluctuations in crude oil prices for fiscal year 2017 is as follows (calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year, excluding hedging):
• Fuel expenses:
Approximately ¥3.2 billion per year
(change of US$1/bbl of crude oil, ANA brand only)
<Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity>
Operating income sensitivity to foreign exchange rate movements for fiscal year 2017 is as follows (calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year, including hedging*):
• Operating income:
A decrease of approximately ¥0.5 billion per year (¥1 depreciation versus US$1*, ANA brand only)
* Assumptions: The foreign currency hedge ratio for fuel expenses was approximately 50% at the beginning of the fiscal year. For foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a depreciation similar to a ¥1 deprecia- tion versus US$1 is assumed.
Allocation of Profits
Basic Policy on Allocation of Profits
Shareholder returns are an important management priority for the Company.
The Company intends to bolster shareholder returns while maintaining financial soundness. This goal will be accomplished as we secure the funds needed to conduct growth investments, such as in aircraft, to support future business development. The possi- bility of making further shareholder returns through dividend increases and share buybacks will be examined on an ongoing basis while considering the appropriate level for free cash flow.
Dividends for Fiscal Year 2016 and Plans for Fiscal Year 2017
For fiscal year 2016, the Company paid cash dividends of ¥6.00 per share, ¥1.00 more than in the previous fiscal year, as initially planned, after due consideration of factors including results for the fiscal year, financial conditions, and the future outlook for the business environment.
For fiscal year 2017, the Company expects to pay cash divi- dends of ¥6.00 per share, the same as in fiscal year 2016, based on its earnings forecast announced on April 28, 2017.

                    The ANA Group has been pursuing and conducting optimal hedge transactions that reduce the impact of volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates in order to control the risk of fluctuation in earnings. The objective of this hedging is to stabilize profitability, not just to equalize expenses, because recent business expan- sion—mainly in international operations—had led to increases in fuel surcharge and foreign currency revenues.
For fuel, the Group conducts fuel hedging three years in advance of the applicable period after considering fuel surcharge revenues. As of March 31, 2017, the Group had a hedge ratio of approximately 30% for fiscal year 2017, approximately 20% for fiscal year 2018, and approximately 5% for fiscal year 2019.
For foreign exchange, the Group hedges U.S. dollar payments for fuel expenses three years in advance and U.S. dollar payments associated with capital expenditures for aircraft and other items five years in advance of the payment periods. The Group considers the balance of foreign currency revenues, revenues linked to foreign exchange market fluctuations, and foreign currency expenses with respect to U.S. dollar payments and uses forward exchange agreements to hedge any portion of foreign currency expenses in excess of foreign currency revenues. As of March 31, 2017, the

 Operating Risks
The following risks could have a significant effect on the judgment of investors in the ANA Group, or “the Group.” Further, the forward- looking statements in the following section are the Group’s judgments as of March 31, 2017.
 (1) Risk of Economic Recession
The airline industry is susceptible to the effects of economic trends, and if the domestic or global economy is sluggish, this may cause decline of demand for air travel due to deterioration in personal consumption and corporate earnings.
International operations (passenger and cargo) depend on overseas markets, especially China, other parts of Asia, and North America, and economic conditions in these regions could lead to a decline in the passenger and cargo volume or a fall in the unit price.
(2) Risks Related to the Group’s Management Strategy
1. Risks Related to the Group’s Fleet Strategy
In the Air Transportation business, the Group is pursuing a fleet strategy centered on introducing highly economical aircraft, integrating aircraft types, and better optimizing supply to demand. This strategy involves ordering aircraft from The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S., Bombardier Inc., and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Delays in delivery from any of those four companies for financial or other reasons could create obstacles to the Group’s operations.
In addition, elements of the fleet strategy could prove ineffective or their expected benefits could diminish significantly due to the factors given below.
1) Dependence on The Boeing Company
In accordance with the above fleet strategy, the Group has ordered a large number of aircraft from The Boeing Company (Boeing). Therefore, should financial or other issues render Boeing unable to fulfill its agreements with the group or companies such as those that maintain Boeing products, the Group would be unable to acquire or maintain aircraft in accordance with its fleet strategy. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s operations.
2) Delay of Aircraft Development Plans by Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation
The Group has decided to introduce the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) that Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation is developing, with delivery scheduled for midway through fiscal year 2020. Delivery delays could create obstacles to the Group’s operations.
2. Risks Related to Airport Slots
The Group has made various investments and operational changes to take advantage of significant business opportunities created by the expansion of slots at Haneda and Narita airports. Around fiscal year 2020, slots are expected to increase from 447
thousand to 486 thousand per year at Haneda Airport, and from 300 thousand to 340 thousand at Narita Airport. However, if the number or the timing of the allocation of slots at the two Tokyo metropolitan area airports (Haneda and Narita) differs from the Group’s projections, it could affect achievement of the targets of the Group’s corporate strategy.
3. Risks Related to the LCC Business
In the LCC business, the Group might not obtain the desired results from entering the LCC business if it fails to achieve the objective of creating new passenger demand, or if competition intensifies with domestic or overseas LCCs. Additionally, flight crew shortages and outflows of flight crew personnel to other airlines could preclude the execution of the Group’s corporate strategy. Furthermore, customers could turn away from LCCs as a result of accidents and other safety incidents caused by LCCs, including those overseas.
4. Risks Related to Investments
The Group may enter new businesses and invest in or acquire other companies to further expand its business in growth areas. These investments and other initiatives may not produce the intended effects. Moreover, if the interests of equity investors do not align, the joint venture may not operate in the manner the Group considers appropriate. If joint venture operations deterio- rate, the Group may be exposed to an economic burden. In addition, equity investors other than the Group may experience poor financial results or withdraw from the business.
The Group may also expand into foreign countries, and enter into businesses with remote relation to the airline business. These initiatives may incur unforeseen detriments.
(3) Risks Related to Crude Oil Price Fluctuations
Jet fuel is a crude oil derivative and its price tracks the price of crude oil. Variance that exceeds the Group estimates for factors that affect the price of crude oil, including political instability in oil-producing nations, increased demand for crude oil due to rapid economic growth in emerging countries, reductions in oil stockpiles or reserves, speculative investment in crude oil, and natural disasters can affect the Group’s performance as follows.
1. Risk of Increase in Crude Oil Prices
Generally, an increase in the price of crude oil causes an increase in the price of jet fuel, which imposes substantial additional costs on the Group. Accordingly, to control the risk of fluctuations in the price of jet fuel and to stabilize operating income, the Group hedges risks using crude oil and jet fuel commodity derivatives in planned, continuous hedging
102 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

 transactions for specific periods of time. In the event that crude oil prices rise over a short period, there are limitations to the Group’s ability to offset increases in crude oil prices through ongoing cost reductions as well as raising fares and charges. For these reasons, the Group may be unable to avoid the influence of a sharp increase in crude oil prices completely, depending on factors such as hedging positions.
2. Risk of Sudden Decrease in Crude Oil Prices
The Group hedges against changes in the price of crude oil. Therefore, a sudden decrease in oil prices may not directly contribute to earnings because, in addition to decreases in or expiration of fuel surcharges, hedge positions and other market conditions may preclude the immediate reflection of a sudden drop in crude oil prices in results.
(4) Risks Related to Pandemic Illnesses Including New Strains of Influenza
All of the Group’s businesses including but not limited to its international routes are exposed to the risk of a decline in demand due to the outbreak and spread of major illnesses including new strains of influenza. The spread of disease and the harm it may cause, including reduced desire to travel by air among customers due to rumors, could affect the Group’s performance by causing the number of passengers on the Group’s domestic and international routes to drop sharply.
Furthermore, more employees and contractors than expected could fall ill due to the spread of highly contagious new strains of influenza and other diseases, or due to increased virulence caused by changes in its profile, which could affect the continuity of the Group’s business.
(5) Risks Related to Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations
The Group’s expenditures in foreign currencies are greater than its revenues in foreign currencies. Therefore, depreciation of the yen affects the Group’s profits. Accordingly, to the greatest extent possible, foreign currency taken in as revenue is used to pay expenses denominated in the same foreign currency to minimize the impact on operating income from the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In addition, the Group uses forward exchange agreements and currency options for a portion of the foreign currency needed for its purchases of aircraft and jet fuel to stabilize and control payment amounts on a yen conversion basis. However, there are limits to the extent to which the Group can reduce and offset costs by adjusting fares and charges should costs increase due to the rapid depreciation of the yen in the foreign exchange market over a short period of time. Accordingly, such an occurrence could, depending on hedge positions and other factors, affect Group income and expendi- tures. Conversely, if the yen should appreciate rapidly in the foreign exchange market over a short period of time, depending
upon hedge positions and other factors, this may preclude immediate reflection in lower jet fuel costs and impact the Group’s ability to enjoy the benefits from appreciation of the yen.
(6) Risks Related to the International Situation
The Group currently operates international routes, primarily to North America, Europe, China, and other parts of Asia. Going forward, incidents including political instability, international conflicts, large-scale terrorist attacks, or deterioration in diplo- matic relations with countries where the Group operates and has offices and other bases could affect the Group’s performance due to the accompanying decrease in demand for travel on these international routes.
(7) Risks Related to Statutory Regulations
As an airline operator, the Group undertakes operations based on the stipulations of statutory regulations relating to airline opera- tions. The Group is required to conduct passenger and cargo operations on international routes in accordance with the stipula- tions of international agreements, including treaties, bilateral agreements, and the decisions of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Group’s fares, airspace, operating schedule, and safety management are subject to a variety of constraints due to these regulations. Further, the Group’s operations are constrained by the Japanese Antitrust Law and similar laws and regulations in other countries with regard to the pricing of fares and charges.
(8) Risks Related to Litigation
The Group could be subject to various lawsuits in connection with its business activities, which could affect the Group’s perfor- mance. Moreover, the following may result in lawsuits or other legal action in the future, which could result in similar investiga- tions in other countries and regions.
Upon overall consideration of various circumstances, the Company reached a plea bargain agreement with regard to the investigation being conducted by the United States Department of Justice into price adjustments relating to international air cargo and passenger transport services. However, no claim amount has been specified with regard to the class action related to air passenger transport, and it is therefore difficult to provide details or give a detailed analysis at this time.
(9) Risks Related to Public-Sector Fees
Public-sector fees include jet fuel taxes, landing fees, and fees for the use of navigational facilities. The Japanese government is currently implementing temporary measures to reduce jet fuel taxes and landing fees but could scale back or terminate these measures in the future, which could affect the Group’s performance.

 Operating Risks
(10) Risks Related to Environmental Regulations
In recent years, numerous Japanese and overseas statutory environmental protection regulations have been introduced or strengthened with regard to such issues as noise, aircraft emis- sions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, use of environmentally polluting substances and their disposal, and energy use at major offices. Compliance with such statutory regulations imposes a considerable economic burden on the Group and business activities may be constrained or additional significant expenses incurred if new regulations are introduced, such as a globally shared environmental tax related to an international greenhouse gas emissions credit trading scheme planned for implementation toward 2021.
(11) Risks Related to the Business Environment of the Airline Industry
There could be material changes in the current competitive and business environment within Japan, such as changes in aviation policy or regional policy, as well as changes in the standing of competitors due to mergers or capital tie-ups stemming from bankruptcies and other factors. These changes could affect the Group’s performance.
(12) Risks Related to Competition
The possibility of future increases in costs related to the Group’s operations due to such factors as jet fuel expenses, financing cost, and responses to environmental regulations cannot be ruled out. If such costs increase, in order to secure income, it will be necessary for the Group to cut costs through such means as reducing indirect fixed costs, and to pass on costs through higher fares and charges. However, because the Group is in competition with other airlines and LCCs in Japan and overseas as well as with alternative modes of transportation, such as the Shinkansen, on certain routes, passing on costs could diminish competitiveness. Further, price competition with competitors greatly restricts the passing on of costs that could affect the Group’s performance.
(13) Risks Related to Ineffective Strategic Alliances
The Group belongs to the Star Alliance. Based on antitrust immunity (ATI) approval, joint venture operations are introduced in collaboration with United Airlines in the network between Asia and the United States, and with Lufthansa and Lufthansa group companies Swiss International Air Lines, Austrian Airlines, and Lufthansa Cargo AG. in the network between Japan and Europe. The Group has also entered into individual agreements, mainly in Asia, that go beyond the frameworks of these alliances.
However, the benefits of Star Alliance membership might diminish if the alliance is broken up by antitrust laws in various countries; an alliance partner withdraws from the Star Alliance or
changes its business policies; another alliance group becomes more competitive; bilateral alliances between member companies end; an alliance partner performs poorly, restructures, or becomes less creditworthy; or restrictions on alliance activities are tight- ened due to external factors. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s performance.
(14) Risks Related to Flight Operations
1. Aircraft Accidents
An aircraft accident involving a flight operated by the Group or a code-share partner could cause a drop in customer confidence and impair the Group’s public reputation, creating a medium- to long-term downturn in demand that could significantly affect the Group’s performance. On January 19, 2017, an aircraft on ANA flight 1831, which is operated by ANA WINGS CO., LTD., out of New Chitose Airport, overran the runway. MLIT’s Transport Safety Board is now determining the cause of this incident, with announcements of the final results of the investigation planned in the future.
Major accidents suffered by other airlines could similarly lead to a reduction in aviation demand that could affect the Group’s performance. An aircraft accident would give rise to significant expenses including compensation for damages and the repair or replacement of aircraft, but aviation insurance would not cover all such direct expenses.
2. Technical Circular Directives
If an issue arises that significantly compromises the safety of an aircraft, MLIT by law issues a technical circular directive. In some cases, all aircraft of the same model might be grounded until the measures to improve the airworthiness of the aircraft and equip- ment have been implemented as directed. Even when the law does not require a directive to be issued, in some cases when safety cannot be confirmed from a technical perspective, opera- tion of the same model might be voluntarily suspended and inspections and other maintenance activities may be performed. The occurrence of such a situation could affect the Group’s safety credibility or performance.
Of particular note, the Group has been consolidating its fleet around the Boeing 787 and other new models. The discovery of a design flaw or technical issue with new aircraft upon which the Group depends could profoundly affect the Group’s performance.
(15) Risks Related to Unauthorized Disclosure of Customer Information and Other Data
The Group holds a large amount of information relating to custom- ers, such as that pertaining to the approximately 31.01 million members (as of the end of March 2017) of the ANA Mileage Club. The Personal Information Protection Law of Japan and similar laws in countries overseas require proper management of such personal information. The Group has established a privacy policy, apprised customers of the Group’s stance regarding the handling of
104 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

 personal information, and established measures to counter any foreseeable contingency to ensure information security, including in its IT systems. In addition, work procedures and information systems are continuously monitored and revised to eliminate any potential security gaps. Despite these precautions, the occurrence of a major leak of personal information caused by unauthorized access, an error in conducting business, or some other factor could carry significant costs, in terms of both compensation and loss of public confidence, which could affect the Group’s performance.
(16) Risks Related to Disasters
The extended closure or operational restriction of airports or flight path restrictions due to disasters including an earthquake, a tsunami, a flood, a typhoon, heavy snow, a volcanic eruption, an infectious disease, a strike, or a riot could impact flight operations using affected airports and routes or result in signifi- cantly reduced demand for air transportation, which could affect the Group’s performance.
In particular, the Group’s data center is located in the Tokyo metropolitan area, while the operational control for all of the Group’s domestic and international flights is conducted at Haneda Airport and most of the Group’s passengers use Tokyo metropoli- tan area airports. As a result, a major disaster, such as an earth- quake or a typhoon; a disaster at the abovementioned facilities, such as a fire; or a strike that closes the airports or limits their access could lead to a long-term shutdown of the Group’s infor- mation systems, operational control functions, or its operations themselves that could significantly affect the Group’s performance.
(17) Risks Related to Revenue and Expense Structure
Expenses that are largely unaffected by passenger load factors, including fixed costs such as aircraft expenses, along with fuel expenses and landing and navigation fees which are largely determined by the type of aircraft, account for a significant proportion of the Group’s costs, which limits the Group’s ability to immediately change the scale of its operations in response to changes in economic conditions. Therefore, decreases in the number of passengers or volume of cargo could have a large impact on the Group’s revenue and expenses.
Moreover, a significant decrease in demand during the summer could affect the Group’s performance for that fiscal year because passenger service sales typically increase during summer.
(18) Risks Related to IT Systems
The Group is highly dependent on information systems for such critical functions as customer service and operational management. A major disruption of one of those systems or of telecommunica- tions networks caused by natural disasters, accidents, computer viruses or unauthorized access, power supply constraints,
large-scale power outages, or system failures or malfunctions would make it difficult to maintain customer service and opera- tions and would result in a loss of public confidence, which could affect the Group’s performance. Further, the Group’s information systems are also used by its partner airlines so there is a possibil- ity that the impact of systems failure would not be limited to
the Group.
(19) Risks Related to Personnel and Labor
Many Group employees belong to labor unions. Events including a collective strike by Group employees could have an effect on the Group’s aircraft operation.
(20) Risk of Inability to Secure Required Personnel
The start of the LCC business and other factors have increased demand for flight crews and other personnel. A certain period of time is required to cultivate and train flight crews and other personnel. Inability to secure the required number of competent flight crews and other personnel in a timely manner could affect the Group’s performance. In addition, a change of the supply- demand balance in labor markets could lead to personnel short- ages in airport handling and other operations, as well as a sharp increase in wage levels.
(21) Financial Risks
1. Increase in the Cost of Financing
The Group raises funds to acquire aircraft primarily through bank loans and bond issuances. However, the cost of financing could increase due to deteriorating conditions in the airline industry, the turmoil in capital and financial markets, changes in the tax system, changes in the government’s interest rate policy, changes to the guarantee systems at governmental financial institutions, or a downgrade of the Company’s credit rating that makes it difficult or impossible to finance on terms advantageous to the Group. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s performance.
2. Risks Related to Asset Impairment or Other Issues
The Group owns extensive property and equipment as a function of its businesses. If the profitability of various operations deterio- rates, or a decision is made to sell an asset, the Group may be required to recognize asset impairment losses or loss on sales
of property and equipment in the future.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2017
1. Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its consol- idated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made in the 2016 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2017.
2. Translation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen and, solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan, have been translated into United States dollars at the rate of ¥112.19 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2017. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the amounts shown could be converted into United States dollars at that or any other rate. Translations of United States dollars are rounded down to the nearest thousand and, therefore, the totals shown in tables do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017, include the accounts of the Company and its 63 (62 in 2016) significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”).
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.
Investments in 17 (18 in 2016) unconsolidated subsidiaries and significant affiliates are accounted for by the equity method.
The difference between the cost and the underlying net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 10 years.
Investments in 85 (82 in 2016) subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Group is also eliminated.
Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made on consolidation.
(b) Foreign currency translation
All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differences arising from the translation are included in the consolidated statement of income.
The balance sheet accounts of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments in net assets.
   112 ANA HOLDINGS INC.

  (c) Marketable securities and investment securities
Marketable securities and investment securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Under the accounting standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at cost, determined by the moving-average method. See Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” for additional information.
(d) Allowance for doubtful accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is stated in amounts considered to be appropriate based on the Group’s past credit loss experi- ence and an evaluation of potential losses in the receivables outstanding.
(e) Inventories
Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries, and are stated at cost, principally determined by the moving-average method. The net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when their net realizable value declines. See Note 21 “Supplementary information for the consolidated statement of income” for additional information.
(f) Property and equipment (excluding leased assets)
Property and equipment, excluding leased assets, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on the estimated useful lives. Major assets are depreciated by the following method:
Buildings ............................ Straight-line method Aircraft ............................... Straight-line method
The Company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives for major property and equipment, based upon the Company’s estimate of durability:
Buildings ............................ 3–50 years Aircraft ............................... 9–20 years
Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred.
The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assets of the Group are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets determined to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. See Note 20 “Impairment loss” for additional information.
(g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets)
Intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software.
(h) Retirement benefits
The retirement benefit plans of the Group cover substantially all employees other than directors and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the Company and subsidiaries.
The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments.
The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans.
The Company accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within net assets (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects, and are recognized in profit or loss over the average remaining service years of employees.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
114 ANA HOLDINGS INC.
(i) Income taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences. See Note 9 “Income taxes” for additional information.
(j) Leases
Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of the contract as the useful life.
(k) Derivatives
The Group uses derivatives, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity options and swaps, to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Group does not use derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to income, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses.
(l) Revenue recognition
Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are provided.
(m) Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and exposed to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents include time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit, all of which mature or become due within three months of the date of acquisition. See Note 19 “Supplementary cash flow information” for additional information.
(n) Transactions of delivering the Company’s own stock to employees, etc., through trusts
The Company has been conducting transactions of delivering its own stock to the Employee Stock Ownership Group through trusts for the benefit of its employees.
(1) Transaction outline
The Company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Plan” (the “Plan”) on July 12, 2013 as an incentive for the Group’s employees to work in unison to overcome the current harsh business environment and achieve further growth, and as a measure to advance employee welfare. The aim of the Plan is to promote the employees’ asset building by encouraging stock acquisition and holding through the expansion of the “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association,” “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Association” and “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS TRADING CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association” (the “Stock Ownership Association”).
The Plan is an incentive plan for all employees who participate in the Stock Ownership Association. Under the Plan, the “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOT”), which was established to transfer the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, will acquire a portion of the Company’s shares in a single purchase and sell them to the Stock Ownership Association over a certain period of time. If a gain on sale of shares is then accumulated within the ESOT through the sale of the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association by the termination of the trust, it will be distributed to the Group employees who meet the benefi- ciary requirements (all individuals who have participated in the Stock Ownership Association during the trust period, including retirees) as residual assets.
The Company guarantees the borrowings for the ESOT’s acquisition of the Company’s shares, and repays any borrowings outstanding at the termination of the trust pursuant to the guarantee agreement.
(2) Accounting method for transactions of delivering the Company’s own stock through trusts
The Company has adopted the “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc. through Trusts” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 30 issued on March 26, 2015). In accor- dance with PITF No. 30, upon transfer of treasury stock to the employee stock ownership trust (the “Trust”) by the entity, any differ- ence between the book value and fair value of the treasury stock is recorded in capital surplus. At year-end, the Company shall record (1) the Company stock held by the Trust as treasury stock in net assets, (2) all other assets and liabilities of the Trust on a line-by-line basis, and (3) a liability/asset for the net of (i) any gain or loss on delivery of the stock by the Trust to the employee shareholding association, (ii) dividends received from the entity for the stock held by the Trust, and (iii) any expenses relating to the Trust.

  (3) Matters concerning the Company’s own stock held by trusts
The book value of the Company’s own stock held by trusts was ¥1,346 million ($11,997 thousand) as of March 31, 2017 and ¥2,433 million as of March 31, 2016, and is recorded as treasury stock in net assets.
The number of shares held by the ESOT as of March 31, 2017 was 6,379 thousand, the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was 8,493 thousand, the number of shares as of March 31, 2016 was 11,531 thousand, and the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was 13,352 thousand. For the purpose of calculating per share infor- mation, the number of shares at the end of the fiscal year and the average number of shares during the fiscal year are included in treasury stock.
(o) Share remuneration plan for directors
The Company has been conducting transactions of delivering its own stock through a trust as a share remuneration plan (the “Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors”) in order to improve its operating performance, increase its corporate value and raise the directors’ awareness of shareholder-oriented management.
(1) Transaction outline
Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors is a system in which funds are contributed by the Company, and shares acquired are distrib- uted to the Company’s directors in accordance with to the Company’s operating performance, etc.
(2) The Company’s own stock remaining in the trust
The Company’s own stock remaining in the trust is recorded at the book value (excluding associated expenses) of the trust and is reflected as treasury stock in net assets. The book value is 429 million yen for the previous fiscal year and 417 million yen for the current fiscal year. The number of shares is 1,357 thousand shares for the previous fiscal year and 1,318 thousand shares for the current fiscal year.
(p) Changes in accounting policies
Application of Practical Solution on a change in depreciation method due to Tax Reform 2016
In accordance with the revision to the Corporation Tax Act, certain consolidated subsidiaries within Japan apply “Practical Solution on a Change in Depreciation Method due to Tax Reform 2016” (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 32 of June 17, 2016) as of April 1, 2016, and changed the depreciation method for buildings and accompanying facilities and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method. The impact of these changes on the profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 is immaterial.

     The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries adopt defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans, i.e., welfare pension fund plans, defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum payment plans. Premium severance pay may be paid at the time of retirement of eligible employees in certain cases.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries adopting defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum payment plans use a simplified method for calculating retirement benefit expenses and liabilities.

(2) Method of determining the expected rate of return on plan assets
The expected return on assets has been estimated based on the anticipated allocation to each asset class and the expected long-term returns on assets held in each category.
(h) Assumptions used for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are set forth as follows:
Discount rates
Expected rates of return on plan assets
2016 0.1 – 1.2% 1.5 – 5.5%
 2017
 0.1 – 1.2%
1.5 – 3.0%
     (i) Defined contribution pension plans
The contributions to the defined contribution pension plans of the Company and certain subsidiaries were ¥3,995 million ($35,609 thousand) and ¥3,787 million for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
8. Asset retirement obligations
(a) Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
(1) Overview of asset retirement obligations
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and certain other offices. As the Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations.
(2) Calculation of asset retirement obligations
The Group estimates the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculates the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%.
 The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Yen (Millions)

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for land and office at airport facilities, includ- ing Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the above airports are considered to be critical infra- structure, it is beyond the control of the Company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities.

   9. Income taxes
The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggre- gate, resulted in normal effective statutory tax rates of approximately 30.86% and 33.06% for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Group files a tax return under the consolidated corporate-tax system, which allows companies to base tax payments on the combined profits or losses of the parent company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.
The tax effects of significant temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Supplementary information for the consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the year ended March 31, 2017 consisted of
the following:
(a) Dividends
Under the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”), the appropriation of unappropriated retained earnings of the Company with respect to a financial period is made by resolution of the Company’s shareholders at a general meeting to be held subsequent to the close of the financial period and the accounts for that period do not therefore reflect such appropriation.

This is because the Company’s shares held by the ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust, subsidiaries and affiliates are recognized as treasury stock.
The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.

   14. Financial instruments and related disclosures Overview
(a) Group policy for financial instruments
The Group limits its fund management to short-term time deposits and raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions, including banks. The Group uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risks described below and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
(b) Types of financial instruments and related risk
Trade receivables (notes and accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers.
Marketable securities and investment securities are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed mainly of the shares of other companies with which the group has business relationships.
Substantially all trade payables have payment due dates within one year.
Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments, and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term interest-bearing debt at variable rates, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as hedging instruments. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses.
For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from the receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk of the commodity prices of fuel and stabilize operating profit.
1) Management of Credit Risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers)
The Group manages its credit risk from receivables on the basis of internal guidelines, which include monitoring of payment term and balances of major customers by each business administration department to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage.
As for derivatives, the Group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with sound credit profiles.
2) Management of Market Risks (fluctuation risks of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates)
In order to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks, the Group principally utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receiv- ables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks of the debts, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions.
As for marketable securities and investment securities, the Group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment.
There are internal management regulations for derivative transactions which set forth transaction authority and limits on transaction amounts.
The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, the Group reports plans and results of methods and ratios for offsetting risks at the quarterly meetings of the Board of Directors.
3) Management of Liquidity Risks Related to Financing (risks that the Group cannot meet the due dates of payables)
The Group manages liquidity risks by establishing a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds that are necessary for the operation of the Group over a certain period of time, in accordance with the Group’s business operating plan and budget.
(c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price avail- able, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value estimates. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives presented in Note 15 “Derivatives and hedging activities” are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions.

Notes:
1. Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions
Assets
(a) Cash and deposits
The carrying values of cash and deposits approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
(b) Notes and accounts receivable
The carrying values of notes and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of their short maturities.

  (c) Marketable securities and investment securities
The fair values of marketable and investment securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for the equity instruments, and at the quoted price obtained from the financial institution for certain debt instruments. The information on the fair values of marketable and investment securities by classification is included in Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Liabilities
(a) Notes and accounts payable
The carrying values of notes and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
(b) Short-term loans
The carrying values of short-term loans approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
(c) Bonds
The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is measured at the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk.
(d) Long-term loans
The fair values of long-term loans are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the debt at the Group’s assumed corporate borrowing rate.

   15. Derivatives and hedging activities
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and jet fuel prices. In order to manage these risks, the Group utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transac- tions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the Group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to their outstanding debt. In addition, the Group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to the jet fuel prices. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, are generally monitored by management on a quarterly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically.
The Group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments; however, it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, as the majority of the counterparties are interna- tionally recognized financial institutions.
Summarized below are the notional amounts and the estimated fair values of the derivative financial instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 for which hedged accounting has been applied.

16. Segment information
(a) Description of reportable segments
 132 ANA HOLDINGS INC.
The reportable segments of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource allocation and to assess performance.
The Group’s reportable segments are categorized under “Air Transportation,” “Airline Related,” “Travel Services” and “Trade and Retail.”
The “Air Transportation” segment conducts domestic and international passenger operations, cargo and mail operations and other trans- portation services. The “Airline Related” segment conducts air transportation related operations, such as airport passenger and ground handling services and maintenance services. The “Travel Services” segment conducts operations centering on the development and sales of travel plans. It also conducts planning and sales of branded travel packages using air transportation. The “Trade and Retail” segment conducts mainly import and export operations of goods related to air transportation and is involved in in-store and non-store retailing.
(b) Methods of measurement for the amounts of sales, profit (loss), assets and other items for each reportable segment
The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 3 “Summary of significant accounting policies.”
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss. Intersegment sales and transfers are based on current market prices.

        Notes:
1. “Other” refers to all business segments that are not included in reportable segments, such as facility management, business support and other operations.
2. Adjustments are as follows:
(a) Adjustments to segment profit are mainly the elimination of intersegment transactions of ¥(5,461) million and corporate expenses of ¥(6,376) million.
(b) Adjustments to segment assets are long-term investments (investment securities and stocks of subsidiaries and affiliates) in consolidated subsidiaries of ¥133,933
million and eliminations of intersegment transactions of ¥(192,009) million.
(c) Adjustments to increase in property and equipment and intangible assets are mainly by the elimination of intersegment transactions.
3. Segment profit is reconciled to operating income on the consolidated statement of
income.

(Share consolidation and change to the number of shares constituting one share unit)
The Company’s Board of Directors, at its meeting on May 17, 2017, resolved to submit a proposal for share consolidation, and to change the number of shares constituting one share unit, to the 72nd Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on June 23, 2017. This proposal was subsequently approved by the shareholders.

As the Company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Company changed its share unit from 1,000 shares to 100 shares. In conjunction with that decision, the Company decided to consolidate its common stock at the ratio of 1 share for every 10 shares.
(2) Details of the share consolidation
(a) Type of shares subject to consolidation:
Common shares
(b) Method and ratio of the consolidation

(c) Share reduction resulting from the consolidation
Total number of outstanding shares before consolidation Share decrease due to the consolidation
Shares outstanding after the consolidation
(d) Treatment of any fraction less than one share
3,516,425,257 shares 3,164,782,732 shares 351,642,525 shares
If the share consolidation results in fractional shares of less than one share unit, such shares shall be subject to a bulk sale in accor- dance with the provisions of the Companies Act. The proceeds shall be distributed to the target shareholders in proportion to their respective holdings.
(3) Details of the change in number of shares constituting one share unit
As of October 1, 2017, the number of the Company’s shares that constitute one trading unit is scheduled to be changed from 1,000 to 100.
(4) Schedules of the share consolidation and the change in number of shares constituting one share unit
The date of resolution by the Company’s Board of Directors: May 17, 2017
The date of resolution by the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders: June 23, 2017
The date of the share consolidation and the change in number of shares constituting one share unit: October 1, 2017

  Glossary
   Passenger Business Terms
Available Seat-Kilometers (ASKs)
A unit of passenger transport capacity, analo- gous to “production capacity.” Total number of seats x Transport distance (kilometers).
Revenue Passenger-Kilometers (RPKs)
Total distance flown by revenue-paying pas- sengers aboard aircraft. Revenue-paying pas- sengers x Transport distance (kilometers).
Load Factor
Indicates the seat occupancy ratio (status of seat sales) as the ratio of revenue passenger- kilometers to available seat-kilometers. Revenue passenger-kilometers / Available seat-kilometers.
Yield
Unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer. Revenues / Revenue passenger-kilometers.
Unit Revenues
Quantitatively measures revenue management performance by showing unit revenues per available seat-kilometer (Revenues / Available seat-kilometers). Calculated as yield (Revenues / Revenue passenger-kilometers) x load factor (Revenue passenger-kilometers / Available seat-kilometers).
Unit Cost
Indicates cost per unit in the airline industry. Calculated as cost per available seat-kilometer.
Revenue Management
This management technique maximizes rev- enues by enabling the best mix of revenue- paying passengers through yield management that involves optimum seat sales in terms of optimum timing and price based on network and fare strategy.
Optimizing Supply to Demand
Involves flexibly controlling production capacity (available seat-kilometers) according to demand trends in ways such as increasing or decreas- ing the frequencies on routes and adjusting aircraft size.
Cargo Business Terms
Available Ton-Kilometers (ATKs)
A unit of cargo transport capacity expressed as “production capacity.” Total cargo capacity (tons) x Transport distance (kilometers).
Revenue Ton-Kilometers (RTKs)
Total distance carried by each revenue-paying cargo aboard aircraft. Revenue-paying cargo (tons) x Transport distance (kilometers).
Freighter
Dedicated cargo aircraft. Seats are removed from the cabin space where passengers would normally sit, and the space is filled with contain- ers or palletized cargo.
Belly
The space below the cabin on passenger aircraft that is used to transport cargo.
Okinawa Cargo Hub & Network
The ANA Group’s unique cargo network. With Okinawa (Naha) Airport as an international cargo hub, the network uses late-night con- necting flights in a hub and spoke system servicing major Asian cities.
Airline Industry and Company Terms
IATA
The International Air Transport Association. Founded in 1945 by airlines operating flights primarily on international routes, functions include managing arrival and departure slots at airports and settling receivables and payables among airline companies. More than 270 airlines are IATA members.
ICAO
The International Civil Aviation Organization. A specialized agency of the United Nations cre- ated in 1944 to promote the safe and orderly development of international civil aviation. More than 190 countries are ICAO members.
Star Alliance
Established in 1997, Star Alliance was the first and is the world’s largest airline alliance. ANA became a member in October 1999. As of July 2017, 28 airlines from around the world, includ- ing regional airlines, are members.
Code-Sharing
A system in which airline alliance partners allow each other to add their own flight numbers on other partners’ scheduled flights. The frequent result is that multiple companies sell seats on one flight. Also known as jointly operated flights.
Antitrust Immunity (ATI)
Granting of advance approval for immunity from competition laws when airlines operating inter- national routes cooperate on planning routes, setting fares, conducting marketing activities,
or other areas, so that the airlines are not in violation of the competition laws of such coun- tries. In Japan, the United States, and South Korea, the relevant department of transportation grants ATI based on an application (in countries other than these three, it is common for a bureau such as a fair trade commission to be in charge), but in the European Union the business itself performs a self-assessment based on the law. ATI approval is generally based on the two conditions that the parties do not have the power to control the market and approval will increase user convenience.
Joint Venture
A joint business in the international airline industry between two or more airlines. Restrictions such as bilateral air agreements between countries and caps on foreign capital investments still exist in the international airline industry. Therefore, airlines form ATI-based joint ventures, instead of the commonly known methods used in other industries such as capital tie-ups and M&As, etc. By forming joint ventures, airlines in the same global alliance are able to offer travelers a broader, more flexible network along with less expensive fares, thus strengthening their competitiveness against other alliances (or joint ventures).
Full Service Carrier (FSC)
An airline company that serves a wide range of markets based on a route network that includes code-sharing connecting demand. FSCs offer multiple classes of seats and provide in-flight food and beverages that are included in advance in the fare paid. FSCs are also called network carriers or legacy carriers when com- pared with low cost carriers (LCCs).
Low Cost Carrier (LCC)
An airline that provides air transportation ser- vices at low fares based on a low-cost system that includes using a single type of aircraft, charging for in-flight services, and simplifying sales. Fundamentally, LCCs operate frequent short- and medium-haul point-to-point flights (flights between two locations).
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Business
A business that is contracted to provide aircraft maintenance services using its own mainte- nance crew and other personnel, along with dedicated facilities. Services include the mainte- nance, repair, and overhaul of aircraft and other equipment owned by airlines.
Dual Hub Network Strategy
A strategy for using the two largest airports in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Haneda and Narita) for different yet complementary strategic aims and functions. At Haneda, which offers excellent access from central Tokyo, the strategy targets overall air travel demand in the Tokyo metropoli- tan area, including the outskirts of Tokyo, as well as demand for connecting flights from various Japanese cities to international routes that harness ANA’s existing domestic network. Meanwhile, at Narita the strategy aims to cap- ture transit demand for travel between third countries via Narita, focusing on Trans-Pacific travel between North America and Asia/China. This will be accomplished by upgrading and expanding the international network and enhancing connecting flights by setting efficient flight schedules.

 Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report contains statements based on the ANA Group’s current plans, estimates, strategies, and beliefs; all statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements represent the judgments and hypotheses of the Group’s management based on currently available information. Air transportation, the Group’s core business, involves government-mandated costs that are beyond the Company’s control, such as airport utilization fees and fuel taxes.
In addition, conditions in the markets served by the ANA Group are subject to significant fluctuations. Factors that could affect actual results include, but are not limited to, economic trends, sharp changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and disasters.
Due to these risks and uncertainties, the Group’s future performance may differ significantly from the contents of this annual report. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the forward-looking statements in this annual report will prove to be accurate.

Fiscal 2018 in Review
First, I want to thank you, our customers and stakeholders, for your support of the ANA Group. Fiscal 2018 saw groupwide operating revenues surpassing ¥2 trillion for the first time. Operating
income marked a new high for the fourth consecutive year. These results are largely due to the posi- tive performance in our mainstay Air Transportation Business. The ANA International Passenger Business has made steady progress in building demand, supported by our superior and growing network of routes from/to Haneda Airport. The ANA Domestic Passenger Business has pursued higher unit prices through the introduction of a new fare structure. Our LCC Business has continued to make progress in the lead-up to the Peach Aviation Limited and Vanilla Air Inc. merger. We have followed through with plans to invest in safety, quality and services, as well as human resources, to solidify our management platform for future business growth.
In the peak summer season, we conducted planned flight cancellations primarily on our domestic routes. These cancellations were part of our response to engine issues with Boeing 787 aircraft, or B787. Though it was a difficult decision, safety is always our top priority. We took receipt of upgraded and improved parts from the manufacturer beginning January 2019 to implement a permanent resolu- tion to this technical issue. Engine part replacements have proceeded on schedule. From the begin- ning of fiscal 2020, all B787s should be in operation and playing a well-secured role in our business.

Overview by Business Segment
Extending Airline Business Domains to Create Greater
Corporate Value
Though the ANA international business drives growth for our Group, the voyage has not always been smooth. In March 1986, ANA launched our first regular international flight operations. These flights ran at a loss for the first 17 years, leading to a number of internal calls for ANA to withdraw from interna- tional routes. We reached a turning point in 1999, when we joined Star Alliance. This was the moment that began our journey toward expertise in a working partnership with overseas partner airlines for increased revenues. This alliance also entailed adopting the Passenger Revenue Optimization System (PROS). Then, our International Passenger Business posted a profit for the first time in fiscal 2004. Our second turning point came in fiscal 2014 as we expanded our international route network. We were one of the first to leverage the new B787 worldwide, adding several new destinations, mostly along medium- and long-range routes. By leveraging this state-of-the-art aircraft, its greater fuel efficiency and comfort, we took a first-mover advantage and differentiated ourselves. ANA created a competitive advantage. Looking back on the five years between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2018, we see that ANA’s International Passenger Business available seat-kilometers (ASK) grew by 1.6 times.
This growth paralleled revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK) demand, which grew 1.7 times over the same period.
In March 2012, Peach Aviation became the first LCC to offer services in Japan. Peach has estab- lished routes across Japan and Asia promoting a core concept of being a “flying train,” introducing a greater number of customers to the joy of traveling through the skies at reasonable prices. Peach Aviation provides its own contribution to regional revitalization through building new demand separate from the ANA brand. This contribution includes opening routes that connect cities outside of the Tokyo metropolitan area with airports overseas. By the end of October 2019, Peach Aviation will merge with Vanilla Air, the number two LCC of the Group and a Narita-based operator of domestic and international routes. This merger is our bid into the mid-range markets in Asia.
Our ANA brand and LCC performance is already beginning to show positive results in this core Air Transportation Business. Average operating income for the last three fiscal years (FY2016 to FY2018, consolidated) has reached nearly ¥158 billion, with average net income of approximately ¥118 billion. When compared to our performance in fiscal 2013, before expansion of ANA’s international network, operating income jumped about ¥100 billion, showing a steady rise in the level of corporate value generated by the Group.
Fiscal 2019: A Year of Finishing Touches Ahead of Growth in
Fiscal 2020
Looking overseas, we see several airline groups that have secured higher profitability than the ANA Group and which have become a familiar part of the lives of many. We also see powerful LCCs that have captured and expanded service routes across several markets in Europe, North America, and Asia, all over the span of less than ten years. The ANA Group has bolstered our presence in Asia, pushed by a strong tailwind of growing inbound tourists to Japan. Even so, we feel we must continue to press ahead by forging a presence capable of going toe-to-toe with even the most iconic global airline groups.
In fiscal 2020, Tokyo metropolitan area airports will expand slots further. The same year will see the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Even as these will be major business opportunities for the Group, we must pursue further growth to survive the accelerating wave of overseas airlines making headway in Japanese routes. To achieve this growth, we will be putting the finishing touches on safety, quality and services during fiscal 2019 ahead of growth in fiscal 2020. Though we will enter a phase of aircraft and human resources-related expenses ahead of sustainable growth, these expenses are a necessary part of building a groundwork for the future. Our plan is to implement these measures and achieve an operating income of at least ¥200 billion in fiscal 2020. I firmly believe we can achieve our management vision by consolidating the strength of our Group employees, making further expansions of our network in the Tokyo metropolitan area airports.

FY2019–2022 ANA Group Corporate Strategy Update
We will publish an updated version of our FY2018–2022 ANA Group Corporate Strategy in the second half of fiscal 2019. Other industries, such as the finance and automotive sectors, have faced disruptive changes breaking down their existing growth models as lifestyles and consumption habits change. Those of us in the airline business must continue to pursue greater value as we consider whether we can grow under the same business model for the next ten or 20 years by leveraging our existing management infrastructure. Beyond our network expansion in fiscal 2020, we intend to offer our view of company management, working to meet the expectations of our investors with respect to future strategic direction, dividend policies, and the use of capital.
Safety and Human Resources: The Foundation of Our Group
Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business. These words are part of our Group Safety Principles and all who serve in the ANA Group are asked to remember these principles every day.
At our yearly new hire orientation ceremony, I make sure to talk about past aircraft accidents. Today, almost no officers or employees, myself included, have experienced a loss-of-life accident in the Group. Safety is the foundation of our business, and our duty. Although building experience is important, the one thing we must never experience is an aircraft accident. Therefore, we must take the lessons learned from past accidents and the importance of safety, passing this knowledge to the next generation. And what is truly the key resource of our Group that underpins this safety?
That resource is our people. Today is a time of human resources diversity. Females, males, senior citizens, international citizens, LGBT persons, persons with disabilities, and more all make up the workforce. In fiscal 2018, the Group conducted our employee awareness survey (ANA’s Way Survey) twice. We have introduced a mechanism linking the results of this survey to the evaluation of management-track personnel and senior management at each Group company. Under the ANA Group Health Management Declaration, we will continue to cultivate a company culture that allows employees to have a vibrant work life, coming together in unity to ensure customer satisfaction.
I believe that this fusion of hard-working, ambitious human resources and mindfulness toward safety plants the seeds for sustainable Group growth. In April 2019, we began operations at ANA Group Training Center, ANA Blue Base. Trainees will gain knowledge about past accidents and learn about human error. ANA Blue Base also features learning facilities that provide employees with les- sons they can apply in their daily activities. The facility leverages the latest technologies to help firmly entrench a culture of safety, serving as a platform for cultivating human resources capable of compet- ing on the global stage.
Rationale for Group Promotion of ESG Management
For us to become an airline group contributing to society on a global scale, we must become indis- pensable to, and grow along with, the people of the world. As a world-wide organization, we consider our coexistence with the natural environment both over the long term and on a global scale. We also monitor social issues, including climate change, food supply, resources, disparity, and education. In my observation of Group history, I have noted that the world has cultures and trade practices vastly different from those in Japan. At the same time, I learned the need to consider environments and societies where we serve to ensure the smooth continuity of our business. As we expand throughout diverse regions of the world, we must incorporate this perspective of existing and growing with soci- ety into our business strategy. This perspective has led us to pursue ESG management.
In October 2018, we were the first airline in the world to issue Green Bonds. In May 2019, we were the first Social Bond issuer as a non-financial company in Japan. While we pursue our corporate strategy, we procure capital through means focused on the environment and society. Our pursuit is

not simply for economic value. We conduct proactive management with an eye toward balance between social and economic values, leading to sustainable growth and, by extension, contribution to the achievement of the SDGs.
In March 2019, we became the first Japanese airline company to express support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Corporate information disclosure is becoming more critical. First, we will set long-term ESG-related targets during fiscal 2019. We will also make processes toward goal achievement easier to track and conduct regular evaluations of our progress.
Improving Governance and Demonstrating the Functions of a
Holding Company Structure
The finishing touches we will perform in fiscal 2019 will not be limited to preparing for the expansion of our ANA international network. We will also seek to establish an infrastructure within which we can strategically allocate management resources and advance business portfolios across the entire Group from the vantage point of ANA HOLDINGS INC.
In fiscal 2013, the ANA Group transitioned to a holding company structure in response to our oper- ating environment. This structure has served to advance our corporate strategy, focusing on our Air Transportation Business. Though our first task is to grow our business in the Tokyo metropolitan area airports, I feel we can build a foundation from which we can generate reliable value even outside our airline business. To achieve this growth, we will create a more well-defined structure in which indi- vidual companies like ANA and Peach Aviation can execute their own strategies under the business portfolio definitions established by ANA HOLDINGS. Though it goes without saying, we move forward on the assumption that we will achieve plan targets based on our corporate strategy. However, it is also very important to allocate management resources in balance between social and economic value. Governance plays a critical role in this process. We believe that in respecting management autonomy, that group companies should be given the authority and responsibility for their businesses. At the same time, we believe in providing a strong group oversight function through a holding com- pany structure.
To ensure this balance, we continue to enhance the effectiveness of and improve our board of directors. These initiatives to bolster the board’s oversight function have included changes to the board’s authority and large-scale transfers of decision-making authority to the Group Management Committee. Most recently, our board of directors has received presentations from major Group com- panies related to our corporate strategy, discussed medium- and long-term issues in our Air Transportation Business, and held direct discussions among directors and teams working in the front lines. These and other measures advance our agenda. We have also discussed several issues beyond the scope of matters included in our corporate governance report. These issues include the study of plans related to succession candidates and cross-shareholdings. We continued to incorpo- rate the PDCA cycle in management. Moreover, we strive to ensure transparency and fairness in our management. Our Personnel Advisory Committee and Remuneration Advisory Committee each sup- port the board of directors in an advisory capacity, and each committee consists of a majority of outside directors.
As we advance these various initiatives, we steadily raise awareness among members of the board, leading to more lively discussions. We continue to adapt to the changing environment around us, and we will pursue qualitative enhancement of governance, practicing management that contrib- utes to creation of corporate value.

Discussion: Strengthening Governance for Further Corporate Value Growth
Looking to the Future
Forty years ago, when I was just a new hire at ANA, I submitted my dream to our internal corporate newsletter. I wrote, “Even though ANA may only be a domestic airline today, someday we will expand internationally, and maybe even offer space travel in the future.” Today, ANA operates 172 of daily international passenger flights (as of August 1, 2019). And, our eyes are already set on the stars, as we sow the seeds of future businesses. Forty years from now, I imagine that the wings of ANA will extend to the stars as a matter of course.
Though our Group had once sought to be the No.1 airline in Asia, I want to raise our sites to oper- ate on a global scale. Through the expertise and brand power we have grown over the last nearly 60 years, and through the hospitality that is a particular strength of airlines in Japan, we will shine bright on the world stage, uncovering value that has lain dormant until now. Advances in innovation, includ- ing AI, will allow us to exercise speedy management. Setting our goals and working hard every day will enable us to certainly fulfill our dreams. As the head of the management team, I will spare no effort in leading our Group toward becoming an airline group that is indispensable to the people of the world.
I ask for your continued support of the ANA Group.

 ANA Group’s Strengths, Built Over a Rich History
1952–
Starting with just two
helicopters
ANA’s predecessor was founded as Japan’s first private airline company in 1952. Ten years later, in 1962, we became the launch customer for the YS-11, the first domestically produced aircraft in the postwar era. We used this aircraft to fulfill the important mis- sion of transporting the Olympic torch for the Games of the XVIII Olympiad, which took place in Tokyo in 1964. In this manner, ANA grew together with postwar Japan.
1970–
Introduction of jet and
wide-body aircraft
ANA focused predominately on domestic flights due to restrictive government poli- cies, although we operated an international charter between Tokyo and Hong Kong in 1971. In 1976, we reached the milestone of a cumulative 100 million passengers. This was also the era in which we adopted the Boeing 747-SR, our first jumbo jet.
1986–
Regular operation of
international flights
Entering the era of full-fledged competition between airlines in Japan, we finally achieved our dream to begin regular interna- tional flight operations, starting with the Tokyo–Guam route, introduced on March 3, 1986. We introduced Tokyo–Los Angeles and Tokyo–Washington routes in the same year. As our network continued to grow, we introduced many other routes, including Tokyo–New York in 1991.
1999–
2013–
Bold advance on to the
global stage
To improve competitiveness on the global stage, the Group transitioned to a holding company structure allowing independent Group management beginning in fiscal 2013. We will continue to achieve sustain- able growth in 2020 and beyond, becoming the world’s leading airline group in cus- tomer satisfaction and value creation.

  Expansion of overseas
network
ANA became the ninth member to join Star Alliance, the world’s first and largest global airline alliance, in 1999. We continued to improve customer convenience and grow our International Business thereafter. Overcoming the event risks that material- ized on a global scale around this time, the International Business posted a profit for the first time in fiscal 2004.

The ANA Group Value Creation Process
We strive to create both social value and economic value by maximizing the four strengths of the ANA Group through a solid foundation of safety and our human resources, the driver of our busi- ness. Our efforts are based on the opportunities, risks, and the ANA Group issues arising in response to medium- and long-term megatrends.
This process is the core strategic engine behind not only the achievement of our Management Vision but also our contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through sustain- able gains in corporate value.

The ANA Group is presented with many business opportunities that can be exploited in achieving future growth, including the slot expansion at Tokyo metropolitan area airports to take place in light of the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as anticipation surrounding measures for stimu- lating inbound travel demand and initiatives for supporting the development of a Japan brand.
At the same time, we must anticipate risks that may impact air transportation demand adversely, including domestic and inter- national politics, economic trends, and more.
The ANA Group aims to gain an accurate understanding of the surrounding opportunities and risks, adapting this understanding into our strategies. In so doing, we will build a resilient corporate constitution capable of responding to changes in the global business environment through aggressive and speedy management.
The ANA Group adopted a holding company structure in fiscal 2013. Since fiscal 2014, we have been managing ANA interna- tional business growth. Peach Aviation Limited and Vanilla Air Inc. have been creating new demand also. We have pursued a growth strategy through both the ANA and LCC brands. At the same time, we launched an initiative in fiscal 2017 to solidify our man- agement platform in response to a tight labor market in Japan and other environmental changes.
At present, we are executing our FY2018–2022 ANA Group Corporate Strategy in pursuit of future sustainable growth. In January 2019, we published the ANA Group Corporate Strategy Update (FY2019–2020) in accordance with this strategy, as we continue to invest in safety, quality and services and human resources to improve basic quality.
See the following for more about the FY2018–2022 ANA Group Corporate Strategy (including financing strategies).

Expand Capacity in FY2020 According to Plans Outlined in Corporate Strategy
 Our current corporate strategy stands on three strategic pillars. We see the fiscal 2020 expansion in slots at Haneda Airport as a tremendous business opportunity, and we intend to execute our plan according to the themes for each phase.
At the same time, recent macro environmental issues have caused concern over uncertainties in global politics and econom- ics. In terms of the business environment, demand for inbound travel to Japan continues to be firm. However, Asian carriers and
other overseas airlines are expanding the capacity of their Japan routes. Further, we must deal with an issue unique to the ANA Group, namely the engine issues of the Boeing 787s.
Given this environment, we plan to put the finishing touches on Safety, Quality and Services heading toward fiscal 2020. Having perfected these areas, we will then materialize growth moving forward.
* FY2018–2022 ANA Group Corporate Strategy, formulated in February 2018
International Passenger Business: We intend to expand our business in the Tokyo metropolitan area, leveraging opportunities at Narita Airport in fiscal 2019 and at Haneda Airport in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2019, we expect ASK to grow approximately 8% year on year. This figure should rise in excess of 20% year on year for fiscal 2020, representing 1.35 times growth compared to fiscal 2017.
Domestic Passenger Business: We intend to utilize smaller aircraft in optimizing supply to demand, while at the same time strengthening products and services to improve profitability further. ASK through fiscal 2020 should remain generally level with fiscal 2017 results.
International Cargo Business: During the year, we adopted wide-body freighters and leveraged alliances with other freighter companies to bolster hub functions in the Tokyo metropolitan area. We are looking to optimize the scale of our Okinawa hub network, balancing supply and demand. We expect to grow our International Cargo Business capacity in step with our International Passenger Business.

Leverage New Aircraft to Expand Group Revenues and Profits
As part of our fiscal 2019 business plan, we will introduce Narita– Perth service in September and Narita–Chennai service in October. Here, ANA will enjoy a first-mover advantage in develop- ing new demand.
Further, our Narita–Singapore and Narita–Bangkok routes introduced Boeing 787-10 service, offering state-of-the-art wide- body aircraft. In so doing, we will expand supply while maintain- ing comfort for the major routes in Asia, which feature strong demand for connections to North America. At the same time, we also intend to capture higher unit price demand.

Capture Air Travel Demand (Japan–Philippines)
ANA HOLDINGS will invest US$95 million in PAL Holdings Inc. PAL Holdings is the parent of Philippine Airlines Inc., a code share and mileage partner with ANA. This is another step forward in expanding our strategic alliances. As with Vietnam Airlines, with whom we concluded an operating and equity partnership in 2016, we are creating stronger win-win relationships with major airlines in Asia.
These new routes, state-of-the-art aircraft, and strategic alli- ances will expand ANA’s coverage throughout Asia / Oceania, raising our competitive advantage.
[Network Strategy]
Airbus A380 Aircraft:
On May 24, 2019, we began Airbus A380 service on our Narita– Honolulu route. In July, we introduced a second aircraft to the route, operating a total of 10 flights per week on A380 aircraft. The fiscal 2018 load factor for ANA Tokyo–Honolulu routes (from/ to Haneda and Narita) was approximately 91%, including non- revenue passengers. We have continued to experience steady demand for the service during fiscal 2019. ANA introduced ultra- wide body aircraft as a game changer in advancing our Hawaii Strategy and capturing wider customer segments.

We also intend to actively pursue a variety of products, including oversize items, hazardous materi- als, special items, and other items.

Secure Aircraft and Pilots in Stable Manner to Support Future Growth
 We plan to complete the centralization of flight operations between Peach Aviation Limited and Vanilla Air Inc. by the end of October 2019. In fiscal 2019, total capacity for the two airlines will rise marginally year on year; however, we expect fiscal 2020 ASK to be about 1.3 times more than fiscal 2017.
In March 2019, Vanilla Air employees began transferring to Peach Aviation. In addition, we are both converting aircraft and transferring flight operations for Vanilla routes gradually to Peach. Once the merger is complete, we plan to expand our routes based in Kansai and Narita airports, entering the mid-range

In the future, we will be able to capture demand across a wider range of prices, expanding routes under an integrated brand. Our aim is to generate higher efficiencies, while becoming the leading LCC in Asia.

By the end of fiscal 2020, we forecast a total of around 320 air- craft. We intend to follow our plan in securing the aircraft neces- sary for executing our future strategy.
Pilot Resources:
The three ANA brand airlines (ANA, ANA WINGS CO., LTD., and Air Japan Co., Ltd.) are currently developing pilots based on long-term staffing plans looking ahead 10 years. Our policy is to secure and develop a stable base of personnel.
Our LCC Business has a pressing need for pilots. Here, we have implemented captain promotion training for first officers, initiating in-house development beginning in fiscal 2019. Our merger in this business will deliver results that include improved labor utilization and more efficient training.

Graph 1 below shows ASK and group employee numbers, excluding LCC operations. Compared to the fiscal 2017 results, our plan for fiscal 2020 calls for a 19% increase in ASK for the combined ANA domestic and international operations.
On the other hand, we must secure enough pilots and flight attendants to match ASK. We expect to increase personnel as a whole by approximately 10%. Over the past several years, we
have been hiring personnel ahead of capacity increase. However, fiscal 2020 will be a stage of productivity improvement in response to significant growth in the scope of our business.
Our unit cost in this context should begin improving in fiscal 2020. In the future, we will use AI and IoT for automation and detailed cost management.
The results of our strategies to date have increased profit levels steadily over the past several years. Having expanded our inter- national network, our operating income averaged approximately ¥158 billion and net income averaged approximately ¥118 billion between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2018.
We will use fiscal 2019 as a period to complete the finishing touches prior to fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2020, we will leverage expanded slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports into greater
revenues. Our goals for fiscal 2020 are operating income of more than ¥200 billion and net income of more than ¥120 billion.
We plan to introduce a rolling update to the ANA Group Corporate Strategy through the second half of fiscal 2019, assuming the allocation of slots at Haneda Airport will be clarified by then. The ANA Group is creating value worthy of the world’s leading airline group, steadily increasing profitability as we respond flexibly to any change in our environment.

 Special Feature
 The ANA Hawaii Strategy
 Akihiko Miura
Executive Vice President, Member of the Board ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD.
From ANA Corporate Planning
As the largest international network carrier in Japan, ANA is seeking to further embed our dual hub network strategy, leveraging each function provided by the Haneda and Narita airports. To date, we have grown our network through a focus on routes having a strong demand for business travel. More recently, we have incorporated the Airbus A380 into our Narita–Honolulu route as part of our Hawaii Strategy. Here, our aim is to capture more demand in resort-destination travel.
     The ANA Hawaii Strategy uses ultra-wide body aircraft as a game changer to capture wider customer segments and further raise the competitive posture of our international network.
On May 24, 2019, we put the long-awaited Airbus A380 into service for Narita–Honolulu.
In July, we introduced a second A380 to the route, operating a total of 10 flights per week using this aircraft. In this feature, ANA executive officers in key divisions discuss the objectives and impact of our
Hawaii Strategy.
Objective
Leverage overwhelming seat capacity to grow our share of the Japan–Hawaii market
Hawaii holds a special meaning as a resort destination for Japanese travelers, enjoying stable, long-term demand. While ANA has been using mid-body aircraft for Honolulu flights, we have recently introduced ultra-wide body aircraft as part of a major reinvention of the ANA business model for this resort destination, which includes innovative services for our customers.
With the introduction of the Airbus A380, we have significantly expanded capacity aimed at growing the ANA seat share for our Hawaii routes, which was less competitive compared to other carriers. In conjunction with the slot expansion at Tokyo metropolitan area airports in fiscal 2020, we plan to increase the dominance of the ANA international network even further as we pursue our growth strategy.
Objective
Utilize expansive cabin space to provide new products and services
Our newly introduced Airbus A380 fea- tures a total of 520 seats, offering a platform for services that take advantage of the expansive interior. ANA is rolling out new in-flight services not possible until now.
The new Airbus A380 configuration allows ANA to offer new products and services, including a first-class cabin, ANA COUCHii couch seats, and new in-flight services available only on the Hawaii route. Now, ANA targets custom- ers that we could not reach in the past, expanding our coverage of demand. What we learn from rolling out these new products and services will also be quite useful in improving ANA customer satis- faction in the future.
Objective
Contribute to social initiatives, including regional economic growth and environmental conservation activities
We call our Airbus A380 the Flying Honu, meaning a flying sea turtle. Sea turtles are sacred creatures to the Hawaiians, and locals have been active in programs to save these animals and other endan- gered species.
While the ANA Group contributes to the regional economy of Hawaii through our new ultra-wide body aircraft, we also create opportunities to focus on the area’s natural environment, communicat- ing the beautiful nature of Hawaii to future generations and contributing to the environmental conservation of a resort destination beloved by all.

Value Creation Under the ANA Group Corporate Strategy—Creation of Economic Value—
From ANA Marketing
The ANA Honolulu route has enjoyed stable demand even around the time of the Lehman Shock in 2008, recording high load factors over the long-term. More recently, we have intro- duced the Airbus A380 to the route as a game changer in our Hawaii Strategy. We expect to see more than a 1.4-times increase in our Honolulu route seating for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Moving forward, we will create more options in our group sales strategy, including school excursions and other group travel, as well as selling tour packages through travel agents.
The Hawaii route is popular across a broad range of custom- ers, such as wealthy travelers and families. To meet the needs of a diverse customer base, we plan to offer new products and services, as well as provide different price ranges according to seat availability. This approach should allow us to capture demand on a sustained basis. Our new ANA Traveler’s brand is one example of an ANA Group product for which we have created a broad lineup of options, utilizing plentiful seating and new classes for families, honeymooners, and many more customer segments. This fiscal year, we will sponsor the local ANA Honolulu Music Week. This event encourages cultural and edu- cational interchange, while also providing yet another reason to enjoy Hawaii. We believe this event will expand and create new customers for travel from Japan to the islands.
We are expanding opportunities for ANA Mileage Club mem- bers to use their award tickets and improve mileage services in Hawaii. These services increase convenience and foster higher levels of customer satisfaction. Examples include reservations for Premium Economy seating, mileage upgrades, and optional tours paid using mileage with award tickets, as well as the ANA Express Bus (free of charge) and the Mahalo Lounge benefits

available locally for mileage members. Expanded services go beyond in-flight perks. Customers can enjoy other ANA-only services during their stay in Hawaii, with a growing lineup of mile- age partner shops and restaurants.
Increasing availability for the Hawaii route through the intro- ducing of the Airbus A380 was just a start. By adding new prod- ucts and services, as well as offering more opportunities to use mileage and improving leisure travel packages, we aim to build the competitive posture of the ANA network as a whole, while growing group revenues. Look for more exciting things to come from our Hawaii Strategy.

* Daily averages (round-trip basis, includes non-revenue passengers)
The ANA Honolulu route serves a variety of customer needs, including honeymooners, couples, travel with friends and family, and more. The ANA Group carefully considers in-flight products and services for our customers, planning and developing uniquely ANA style offerings in line with concept keywords a little luxury, fun and excitement, and new discoveries.
From Narita to Honolulu, ANA flies the world’s largest aircraft, the Airbus A380, decorated with a special livery selected by the general public. The aircraft interior features a design and special lighting evoking scenes from Hawaii. From the instant customers board, they feel as if they have been transported to a luxury resort.
This flight offers First Class service (a first for this route) to meet the needs of customers looking for an elevated Hawaii travel experience. First Class accommodations include an ame- nity kit developed through a first-ever collaboration between an airlines and Globe-Trotter of the UK. Business Class has pair-seat arrangements, allowing customers to sit next to travel partners. Meanwhile, Premium Economy offers a first-for-ANA custom-meal service for the class to provide a thoughtful touch for a little luxury. Economy Class meals are a special ANA collaboration with the popular restaurant, bills. The rear area of Economy Class offers ANA COUCHii couch seating, the first of its type by a Japanese airline and a new idea in the shape of Hawaii travel. In addition, every class has its own bar counter and a multi-purpose room for breastfeeding, diaper changing, freshening up, changing, or other needs. In all, the Narita–Honolulu flight provides unprec- edented comfort for customers in-flight.
At the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, ANA has installed our first-ever overseas lounge where customers can relax while waiting for their flight. Every detail of customer convenience has

We will continue to focus passionately on customer experience in the future, using these and other initiatives to make ANA syn- onymous with Hawaii. I encourage you to look ahead to even more exciting developments from ANA. We are waiting for you on board the Flying Honu.

“Go for it!”
In this spirit of encouraging action, ANA is preparing for growth in fiscal 2020.
Yuji Hirako
Member of the Board of Directors, ANA HOLDINGS INC.
President & Chief Executive Officer, ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD.
Air Transportation Business operating revenues for fiscal 2018 amounted to ¥1,814.4 billion, up 4.8% year on year. Operating income rose 2.3%, to ¥160.5 billion. This positive performance was mainly due to our capturing strong demand within the ANA international business for passenger and cargo service. For fiscal 2019, we expect to grow top-line revenues mainly through our international business supported by our efforts to complete finishing touches on safety, quality and services.
International Passenger Business
Pursuing a Deeper Dual Hub Network Strategy and Hawaii Strategy to Strengthen Network Competitive Advantage
   International Passenger Business operating revenues for fiscal 2018 rose 9.1% year on year, to ¥651.5 billion. Passengers rose 3.6% year on year, to 10.09 million, surpassing the 10 million mark for the first time ever. These results reflected the expansion of our ANA network during fiscal 2018, including increasing the Haneda–Bangkok service to five round trips daily (June 2018) and launching a new Haneda–Vienna service (February 2019). Leveraging the competitive advantage we created through our Tokyo metropolitan area airport network, we have been able to capture higher-priced business travel demand out of Japan, as well as strong demand for inbound travel.
Our fiscal 2019 plan calls for International Passenger Business operating revenues of ¥707 billion, an 8.5% increase over fiscal 2018. We plan to continue our focus on business and inbound demand, while pursuing nonstop service from Narita Airport to as-yet unserved markets. In September and October, we plan to begin Narita–Perth service and Narita–Chennai service, respec- tively. These flights will heighten the ANA presence in the Asia / Oceania market.
In May, we began adding the Flying Honu Airbus A380 aircraft to the Narita–Honolulu route to capture demand between Japan and Hawaii in a stable manner throughout the year. We plan to bolster the competitive advantage of the ANA network by raising what had been a relatively low resort route seat share. At the same time, we intend to enclose customers through more oppor- tunities to use mileage award tickets.
Further, ANA began adding state-of-the-art wide-body Boeing 787-10 aircraft into service on Narita–Singapore and Narita– Bangkok routes to capture as much demand as possible for connections to North America.
Coinciding with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, our fiscal 2020 plan calls for us to increase capacity significantly with the slot expansion at Haneda airport. We will continue to increase top-line revenue for International Passenger Business as a driver of growth for the ANA Group.

        I always tell our employees to “Go for it!” stressing the importance of trial-and-error and taking action to put ideas in practice. I ask them to find issues and take solutions-oriented action to improve the front-line skills that ANA values so highly and to drive the engine that generates new concepts and ideas.
The ANA Group has made fiscal 2019 a year to complete the finishing touches on safety, quality and services.
Safety is the foundation of our business. We demand that every employee embrace a spirit of personal accountability and take self-directed action. Through front-line skills and digital technologies, we are raising the level for quality and service. The ANA Group was selected as a Competitive IT Strategy Company 2019 and for the newly established DX Grand Prix. We will
continue to listen to feedback from our customers as clues lead- ing to future innovations. Looking ahead to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, our Group is aiming to provide world-class inclusive and universal services through initiatives in both facilities and services.
We chose a sea turtle livery for the Airbus A380 that we intro- duced to our Hawaii route in May. This livery represents our desire to help conserve the environment by protecting species such as sea turtles. We are working toward unprecedented quality in anticipation of customers from all across the world visiting Japan in 2020. At the same time, we are accelerating environmental conservation activities. These are two ways in which we are striving to be an airline that makes a positive contribution to society.

Optimizing Supply to Demand for Aircraft and Schedules, Revising Fare Structures to Build a Stable Revenue Platform
Cargo and Mail Business
New Products Using Wide-Body Freighters and Flexible Supply Control Using Wide-Body Freighters in Pursuit of Improved Profitability
    Our Domestic Passenger Business recorded fiscal 2018 operat- ing revenues of ¥696.6 billion (1.0% year-on-year increase), sup- ported by 44.32 million passengers (0.4% increase). In fiscal 2018, ANA converted the Nagoya (Chubu)–Miyako and Fukuoka– Ishigaki routes from summer-only to full-year service, expanding access to southern islands in Okinawa such as Ishigaki and Miyako from major corners of Japan via nonstop service. The objective here is to capture a greater share of high-priced leisure travel demand. Despite the impact of successive natural disas- ters and planned flight cancellations due to maintenance of Rolls- Royce engines, ANA captured strong business and leisure demand, as well as demand for Japanese travel among inbound tourists. In October, ANA unveiled a simpler fare lineup, allowed reservations and ticket sales up to 355 days prior to departure, and introduced other fare structure innovations.
We plan for fiscal 2019 Domestic Passenger Business operating revenues of ¥705 billion, which will be a 1.2% increase over fiscal 2018. We forecast continued strong demand for air travel in fiscal 2019 in response to business and leisure demand, as well as more chances for leisure for employees due to the advancement of work- style reform and major long holidays in connection with the change in era (new Japanese emperor). The ANA Group will take advan- tage of a diverse fleet to set optimal schedules and otherwise optimize supply to demand, supporting and increasing profitability.
As one fiscal 2019 initiative, ANA increased the number of Narita–Nagoya (Chubu) flights to three round trips daily in May. Making the Narita airport international-domestic connection more convenient will allow us to capture a greater share of regional leisure travel and demand for inbound tourists. Further, we intend to recover steadily from the contraction in operations scope caused by planned flight cancellations in the prior fiscal year. At the same time, we will take advantage of the impact of fare struc- ture reforms for flexible yield management, introducing even more improvements to unit revenues.
During the fiscal year, ANA added other customer conve- niences and comforts as a full-service carrier. These measures included introducing the ANA Baggage Drop, a self-serve, auto- mated baggage drop service at the Naha Airport (Okinawa) and installing new touch panel personal monitor-equipped seats in the major aircraft used in our domestic fleet (Boeing 777-200, Boeing 787-8).
Performance of the Domestic Passenger Business
■Revenues ■ ASK ■ RPK (Index) Fiscal 2015 = 100
Fiscal 2018 cargo volume underperformed the prior fiscal year, mainly due to the impact of U.S.–China trade friction in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a decreased demand for cargo to/from China. However, operating revenues were higher year on year, driven by stronger yield management and airline charters (cargo charter flights using aircraft owned by other companies). For fiscal 2019, we plan for ¥169 billion in operating revenues, which represents a 5.1% year-on-year increase.
During fiscal 2019, we intend to introduce Boeing 777-F air- craft in July and capture demand for new products, including oversize cargo and special items. By expanding available capac- ity on Japan–North America routes—a bottleneck to date—we will be able to capture more trilateral cargo demand between Asia and North America. Despite a slowdown in demand, we forecast continued strong demand for automobile-related cargo and high-tech cargo associated with the spread of AI, IoT, robots, and other next-generation technologies. We will ascertain demand trends and adjust available capacity flexibly as necessary in our pursuit of even greater revenues.

 Operations and Equity Alliance with PAL Holdings
ANA HOLDINGS INC. acquired 9.5% of the outstanding shares of PAL Holdings for US$95 million (approximately ¥10.5 billion). PAL Holdings is the parent company of Philippine Airlines, the largest carrier in the Philippines. Even among the high-growth countries of Asia, the Philippines has maintained a remarkably high economic growth rate and strong expecta- tions for growth in demand for air travel. Under this operations and equity alliance, ANA HOLDINGS INC. will assign directors to PAL Holdings, expanding code share flights and mutual airport operations contract services toward building an even stronger relationship.
Together with the operations and equity alliance formed in 2016 with Vietnam Airlines, we plan to deepen our strategic alliances with other airlines, secure competitive advantage in Asia / Oceania, and expand our revenue base.
   LCC Business
Increase Utilization of Aircraft and Crew via Merger, Creating a New Air Transportation Pillar Second Only to the ANA Brand
The ANA Group began preparations for the Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air merger in fiscal 2018. At the same time, we began planning for LCC network expansion as we streamline the routes of both companies. Peach Aviation introduced service between Okinawa (Naha)–Kaohsiung and Osaka (Kansai)–Kushiro, while Vanilla Air launched Narita–Ishigaki and Okinawa (Naha)– Ishigaki routes.
Our fiscal 2019 plan calls for LCC Business operating revenues of ¥102 billion, representing an increase of 9.0% compared to fiscal 2018. In April 2019, Peach Aviation will begin a Sapporo–Seoul service as we expand our LCC network and capture highly active inbound demand. At the same time, we intend to create new leisure travel demand. The aircraft and human resources of Vanilla Air will be transferred in stages to Peach Aviation in anticipation of a scheduled late-October cen- tralization of flight operations.
By improving utilization of aircraft and crew post-merger in fiscal 2020 and beyond, we expect to both expand our capacity and increase revenues. The strength of the Peach brand
developed to date will support stronger competitiveness in Asia, as the Group strives to become the leading LCC in Asia in terms of customer satisfaction and market share.

We have seen a rapid rise in corporate groups that compete in eco- nomic spheres using their own Big Data.

MRO Japan was established in 2015 as a specialist in aircraft Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO). In January 2019, the company moved offices to Okinawa. As overseas airlines contract low-cost MRO to various countries, MRO Japan provides heavy maintenance services, leveraging its superior technical capabilities. In this way, the company contributes to the Japanese airlines industry, as well as to regional and societal development.
Okinawa serves as a base to compete with overseas MRO contractors, given the popularity as a destination among numerous airlines, which allows to save air transportation costs. With demand for aircraft mainte- nance likely to grow in Asia, MRO Japan intends to take advantage of the geographic convenience of Okinawa, maximizing the company’s perfor- mance and supporting air travel safety.

ANA Business Jet was established in 2018 as a joint venture with Sojitz Corporation to arrange business jet charters. Many business leaders in Europe and the U.S. charter business jets to access cities not served by regular flights or to fly outside regular airline schedules. To secure busi- ness opportunities that may change moment-to-moment, more business leaders in Asia / Pacific are using business jets as a means to travel confidentially.
ANA Business Jet also plans to offer on-demand charters, using con- nections to the ANA international network and other travel means as a lever to become the preferred service provider for customers in Japan.

  Airline Related
For fiscal 2019, our Airline Related Business plans to generate ¥292 billion in operating revenues (0.3% increase) and ¥10.5 billion in operating income (20.3% decrease). As the number of visitors to Japan continues to increase, we anticipate more Japan routes among foreign carriers. We intend to boost revenues at airports in Japan where the ANA Group has already established networks. Here, we will contract services with other airlines, mainly for passenger and cargo ground handling services and in-flight meal production.
We intend to accelerate hiring and training in our airport han- dling companies, looking ahead to Haneda network expansion in fiscal 2020. Our aim will be to raise the support structure and quality of ANA Group flights.
Travel Services
Travel Services plans to generate fiscal 2019 operating revenues of ¥167 billion and operating income of ¥2.5 billion, representing increases of 10.8% and 312.5%, respectively. Under our new ANA Traveler’s brand, we intend to grow direct sales, sell Tabisaku dynamic packages, and otherwise strive to boost our ability to compete. As this segment offers products reflecting customer needs and improves communications in response to individual preferences, we also intend to focus on Hawaii routes and the newly adopted Airbus A380 aircraft, as well as the inbound demand that continues to grow each year.
Trade and Retail
Our fiscal 2019 plan for Trade and Retail calls for operating rev- enues of ¥165 billion (9.5% increase) and operating income of ¥5 billion (34.9% increase). Here, the segment will focus on stronger one-to-one marketing tailored to individual consumer needs and purchase history. The food business will strengthen revenue capacity through stable sourcing of its mainstay banana product, production cost reductions, and other means. In addition, the aerospace and electronics business will foster the newly estab- lished aircraft engine lease business into a core business driver. We intend to identify the most promising growth fields, exercising selection and concentration to strengthen existing businesses and create new businesses. At the same time, we also plan to secure greater revenue growth by generating and growing busi- nesses in global markets.

  Value Creation Under the ANA Group Corporate Strategy—Creation of Social Value—
Discussion: Future-Oriented ESG Management and Contributing to the SDGs through Corporate Activities
Shinya Katanozaka
ANA HOLDINGS INC. President & Chief Executive Officer
The ANA Group aims for sustainable growth through the simultaneous creation of social value and economic value. At the same time, interest is rising in ESG (environment, social, and governance) investment.
We invited Professor Norichika Kanie from Keio University Graduate School, and leading authority on research into the SDGs, to once again talk with Shinya Katanozaka, President & CEO of ANA HOLDINGS INC. This year, Messrs. Kanie and Katanozaka discussed co-existence and co-prosperity in future society (including contributions to the SDGs) and a deeper global-scale commitment to ESG management at ANA HOLDINGS.
 Universal service is another concept steadily gaining traction within the Group. For instance, we are widening our boarding gates for easier access to customers using wheelchairs and families with strollers. We have also upgraded our internet reser- vation system accessible for visually impaired persons. We plan to invest approximately ¥5 billion to improve facility accessibility. Promoting universal service allows any customer to use our busi- nesses with confidence, and that will bring us benefits as we make advancements in this area. I believe it is important to dis- cuss social value and economic value as a paired set in this way.
Kanie I have always said that there is no real sustainability without economic activity. Lately, I feel the reality of this statement even more. I feel very encouraged to know you have the same opinion as a top management.
Katanozaka One of the material issues with which we are engaged is regional revitalization. Revitalizing outlying regions by promoting tourism and increasing non-resident populations will lead us to profit as well. We have signed comprehensive partner- ship agreements with several prefectures in Japan. Our promo- tion of tourism and sales of local products revitalizes regional
 Developments since the Previous Year
Over the past year, I have sensed a significant rise in interest in the relationship between ESG investment and the SDGs. The Japanese government, banks, and securities firms have shown a more positive attitude toward stable investments from a long-term viewpoint. Even financial products targeting individual investors are focusing more on stable long-term returns as they live longer post-retirement.
Katanozaka In April of this year, I accompanied a Keidanren mission to New York and Washington, D.C. together with senior managers in banking and securities firms. We conducted semi- nars for investors and the most welcome message I received was about the importance of growing long-term profits and long-term value. I felt keenly the critical nature of ESG management and long-term investment. Motivated by this experience, we added a section about non-financial indicators to our earnings reports, where our IR materials had focused mainly on financial indicators in the past. As you can see, our annual report now contains more content about ESG management, our contribution to the SDGs, and our response to climate change than we have provided in prior years.

More entities in the financial sector are evaluating com- panies from the standpoint of ESG management and the contri- bution to the SDGs. This reflects an emphasis on investing in companies that one can trust over the long term.
Specific ANA Group Initiatives
Katanozaka The 2016 ICAO General Assembly adopted an international commitment to generate carbon-neutral growth (CNG 2020) with no increase in CO2 emissions after the year 2021. One of our most important initiatives is to control CO2 emissions from our aircraft. ANA is very proactive in adopting fuel-efficient aircraft and biojet fuel to replace fossil fuels. We are also cooperating in developing algae as a raw material for Japanese-produced biojet fuel. Preventing illegal wildlife trade and human trafficking via aircraft are two major issues we are tackling in the air travel industry. We are working closely with government agencies, NGOs, NPOs, and other companies in our industry to address these issues. On-site staff receive training on specific content to become more familiar and more well-versed in these matters.
Katanozaka
economies. We also work closely with local governments for disaster relief support, provide education to the next generation of citizens, and engage in other activities. More recently, we have launched projects utilizing the innovative technologies of Society 5.0*1. One such project involves the ANA Avatar*2 teleportation technology for education, medical treatment, welfare, and other means to resolve social issues in outlying regions. I want to emphasize that these kinds of regional revitalization initiatives are intertwined with value creation.
We still have many in management and front-line positions who equate ESG with social contribution. ESG is meant to raise corporate value and make a company more attractive to investors. We need to do a better job of communicating this. Last October, we became the first airline in the world to issue Green Bonds. We were recognized for the environmentally friendly stan- dards of construction in our new training center, which includes rooftop greening and solar power equipment among other facili- ties. This May, we issued Social Bonds to fund capital expendi- tures for universal service initiatives. I want to make sure investors are aware of our initiatives here.
Kanie I believe that linking benefits to society and to the future with corporate profits is highly important. Investors are also posi- tive about this approach, and I would like to see the ANA Group expand even further on initiatives to date.

Many regional governments are searching for good partners. I look forward to seeing more activities in the communi- ties the ANA Group serves.
Katanozaka I want to follow up on the food loss discussion from last year. Recently, we began a pre-order service for in-flight meals serving international business class customers. This ser- vice helps us meet passenger requests for in-flight meals. At the same time, we eliminate the need to load extra meals. This ser- vice improves customer satisfaction, while reducing costs and food loss.
I get the impression there are things you may be unconscious of or unaware of that may offer benefits to a variety of stakeholders. Employee awareness leads to more efficient operations and elimination of waste. I think this results in greater customer satisfaction as well.

Society 5.0: A human-centered society that balances economic advancement with the resolution of social problems by a system that highly integrates cyberspace and physical space. Society 5.0 was proposed in the 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan as a future society that Japan should aspire to. It follows the hunting society (Society 1.0), agricultural society (Society 2.0), industrial society (Society 3.0), and information society (Society 4.0).

Value Creation Under the ANA Group Corporate Strategy—Creation of Social Value—
Discussion: Future-Oriented ESG Management and Contributing to the SDGs through Corporate Activities
   Japanese-Style ESG Management
Katanozaka I believe there is a such thing as Japanese-style ESG management and contribution to the SDGs. In ancient times, Japanese used the phrase Sampo Yoshi, which means good for everyone. I think Japanese companies have always had a willingness to increase engagement while dealing with a variety of stakeholders.
Kanie I think we can add one more idea to this Sampo Yoshi that you mentioned when considering this current era and the dizzying pace of change. This idea is Mirai Yoshi (good for the future). There may have been a time when companies didn’t have to think so much about the future. But I think today, society is looking for Sampo Yoshi Plus One, which is good for everyone plus good for the future.
Katanozaka Here, we are adding a time axis to the concept. When Wangari Maathai won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004, she introduced the Japanese word mottainai (respect and gratitude for the resources around us) to the rest of the world. Similarly, I think we can introduce other words to the world that reflect Japanese-style customs and consciousness.
Kanie Even though the terms ESG and the SDGs are used in all manner of situations throughout Japan, it’s Europe and the Americas that are taking the lead globally. Japan must insinuate itself into the global decision-making process, playing the role in creating various standards.
Katanozaka When we talk about ESG and the SDGs, these concepts tend heavily toward Western standards and philoso- phies.
If Japan were to participate from the standards creation phase, these standards could also reflect traditional Japanese values.
Kanie The ANA Group is an airline group that conducts busi- ness globally. I expect to see the Group demonstrate initiative during the creation of global standards and indicators, taking the leadership to make ANA Group standards global standards.
Enhanced Information Disclosure and Future-Oriented Goals
Katanozaka From among your comments, the viewpoint of the future stands out as very important. I truly sense that the future is changing, even in terms of the course of typhoons and other changes in the climate. Climate change is shifting the location of industry, including the best regions to grow rice and fruit. Airline companies must also shift their business to meet future changes. I think the impact of climate change on corporate management will be significant.
Kanie Even the SDGs, such as Goal 1 (end poverty), are impacted by climate change. The effects of climate change can destroy houses through flooding or be a trigger that eliminates jobs, causing people to fall into poverty. Assuming that climate change and other elements combine to change the future, we must steer a proper course while looking ahead to what the world might be like 10 or 20 years from now.
Katanozaka We must look toward the future and tailor our approach to a new era, even for those initiatives we have been pursuing for some time. Soon, we plan to begin discussions about our management plans for fiscal 2020. One key phrase on which we intend to focus is what to do now for a world that will have changed in 10 years from now? From the early stages of our Group Management Committee, we have addressed the creation of social value. Even this topic has changed in nature over the years.
Kanie What had been supplementary topics have now become a central issue for management. We are now in an era in which management must consider the future in any decision making.
Katanozaka Although top management tends to be short-term oriented, the times demand a more long-term approach. Going forward, we will determine the ANA Group key performance indi- cators (KPIs) related to ESG and be more proactive in disclosing non-financial information. As one measure, we decided to declare our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in March of this year. I just mentioned the major impact that climate change will have on business. Our policy is to analyze the opportunities and risks for corporate strat- egy presented by climate change and to disclose the impact on our finances. As we provide more visibility to our environmental and social initiatives, as well as the related processes and results, we will rise in the estimation of our investors. And, while I don’t believe KPIs are something to change every year, we should review them as appropriate in the face of a rapidly changing world.
Kanie I believe it is effective to set major goals across a longer time frame. For example, where you want to be as a company by the year 2050. Declaring major goals communicates a stance and a vision of the future to stakeholders. People say that the SDGs emphasize qualitative targets, but I believe it is important to also set targets for goals that cannot be measured quantitatively.
Katanozaka Although our management plan includes feedback from the front lines of our organization, the main drivers are direc- tors and general managers who are at least in their 50s. However, we have started to solicit the opinions of a broad range of younger employees to define the ideal form of the ANA Group 20 and 30 years from now. This includes the young Generation Z employees who have just joined our company, millennials in their 30s, and employees in their 40s.
Kanie When a company’s organization and thinking becomes homogenized, so do its weak points. But diversity gives rise to a resilience capable of withstanding a one-point attack. This type of involvement raises awareness among the younger generation of employees. It also creates a positive cycle for a positive future.
Expectations for the ANA Group and the Resolve of Senior Management
Kanie I have high expectations for the ANA Group to participate and show leadership in the creation of global stan- dards and indicators. Through stronger sustainability initiatives, I believe your group can have a positive impact throughout your entire value chain, including your vendors. I am particularly excited to see your initiatives related to human rights and food loss make their way through the supply chain.
Katanozaka For fiscal 2019, we have set goals to communicate ESG management and the SDGs throughout the Group. However, out of the 17 goals of the SDGs, our current Group medium-term corporate strategy only addresses seven specific initiatives: gender equity, clean energy, decent work, industry innovation, reduced inequalities, sustainable communities, and climate action. I have stated in our Group Management Committee that we should take the time to create initiatives related to all 17 goals. I will move even further forward with ESG management and the SDGs in the same fashion as our current initiatives. It is important that we raise awareness to consider the future of the earth. The future of the earth is also the future of our company.

  Declaration of Our Support for TCFD
As of March 2019, the ANA Group has become the first airline group in Japan to declare support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We will ana- lyze the risks and opportunities that climate change brings to our business, reflecting this analysis in our corporate strategy and working to disclose more relevant information.
Evaluation by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
    Basic Approach
In response to the Paris Agreement signed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21), the Government of Japan set its own targets related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2020 and beyond.
The aviation industry is showing an increasing awareness about controlling CO2 emissions. Based on the resolutions of the 2016 General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), global airline companies have made an international commit- ment to generate carbon-neutral growth (CNG2020) in the year 2021 and beyond.
The ANA Group has created the ANA Group Environmental Principles and the ANA Group Environmental Policies. These principles and policies build on the ANA FLY ECO 2020 medium- to long-term environmental plan from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2020 and include initia- tives for becoming an environmental leading airline group and reducing environmental impact. We are also working to develop medium- to long-term targets for after 2020.
Evaluation by CDP seeks to disclose data and information about company strategy related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in response to stakeholders demands. As of 2016, the ANA Group has categorized its greenhouse gas emissions into Scope 1, 2, and 3 in accordance with the standards set by the Act on the Rational Use of Energy. This environmental data has been verified by third parties, and that verification has been disclosed. The Group’s rating in 2018 was B. (The industry average is C.)
Certified Eco-First Company
In 2008, ANA became the first-ever company in the airline and transport industry certified by the Minister of the Environment as an Eco-First Company. We received this honor in recognition of our commitment to social responsibility.
The ANA Group supported and began awareness activities for COOL CHOICE, a program led by the Ministry of the Environment to take measures against global warming. Further, we partici- pated in the Plastics Smart forum in 2018. This forum is another initiative of the Ministry of the Environment aiming to reduce marine plastic litter.

Implementation Structure
The Group CSR / Risk Management / Compliance Committee oversees two subcommit- tees dedicated to initiatives reducing our environmental impact: The Eco-First Subcommittee (dealing with aircraft flight operations), and the Ground Energy Subcommittee (dealing with ground operations).
The Eco-First Subcommittee seeks to control CO2 emissions from aircraft, while the Ground Energy Subcommittee seeks to reduce overall energy usage in Group facilities.

We have adopted an environmental data integrated manage- ment system called ANA Eiims, which has improved our accuracy in monitoring environmental data and analysis.
In addition, we promote 3R activities (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) for waste generated in-cabin, at the airport, and in our offices. At the same time, we have implemented proper management of industrial waste through the e-Waste Management industrial waste management system.

  Preserving the Environment and Ecologies: Signatory to the Buckingham Palace Declaration
In March 2018, ANA became the first Japanese airline to sign the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce, Buckingham Palace Declaration, a plan to eradicate illegal trade in wildlife recommended by IATA.
In December 2018, we conducted workshops for employees to raise awareness and study about wildlife trafficking, in cooperation with TRAFFIC*1, an NGO that surveys and monitors the wildlife trade at WWF Japan*2. We made an exclusive program for our employees, work- ing with ROUTES*3 and its instructor came to direct workshops.
We will continue to promote an understanding and
awareness of the illegal wildlife trade, sharing information in cooperation with related parties and promoting initiatives to conserve the environment and ecosystems in Japan and overseas.
*1 TRAFFIC: NGO that surveys and monitors wildlife trade. A joint venture between the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). TRAFFIC sponsors activities through a global network, mainly through bases in ten countries. https://www.trafficj.org/
*2 WWF: Environmental preservation public interest corporation located in approximately 100 countries (https://www.wwf.or.jp/eng/) WWF Japan adopts the nature-centric view that human beings exist as a part of greater nature. The organization works on issues within Japan and international issues related to Japan.
*3 ROUTES: Abbreviation of Reducing Opportunities for Unlawful Transport of Endangered Species. ROUTES is an international collaborative platform for dealing with criminal activities involving the illegal trade of wild animals. The organization implements a variety of programs, mainly in countries / regions where illegal transactions occur frequently.
  Introduction of Fuel-Efficient Aircraft
The ANA Group is making operations-related improvements to control CO2 emissions from our aircraft. One of our most effective measures is the introduction of fuel-efficient aircraft. As of March 31, 2019, 75.9% of the ANA Group fleet consists of fuel-efficient aircraft models such as Boeing 787 or Airbus A320neo / A321neo (69.5% in the previous fiscal year).
ICAO CORSIA Initiatives
The 2016 General Assembly of ICAO adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under CORSIA, global airline companies have made an international commitment to generate carbon-neutral growth (CNG2020) in the year 2021 and beyond. Airlines are required to report the amount of CO2 emissions to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport beginning in 2019. The ANA Group has established a mechanism for collecting and sending fuel consumption data from aircraft to a ground-based system in order to measure CO2 emissions. The use of biojet fuel and emis- sions credits are other initiatives we have adopted to reduce our environmental impact.
Introduction of Biojet Fuel
In January 2019, we purchased approximately 265 kl of biojet fuel manufactured and refined by World Energy at the San Francisco International Airport. This volume of biojet fuel can reduce CO2 emissions by nearly 150 tons compared to regular jet fuel (fossil fuel).
In June 2019, we made an agreement with LanzaTech of the United States to purchase biojet fuel. In Japan, we are a partici- pant in the Committee for the Study of a Process Leading to Introduction of Bio Jet Fuel for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo 2020. We are also working with government agencies, facilities, and other businesses in initiatives for the regular use of biojet fuel.

  Partnership with Local Governments
The ANA Group enters into partnership agreements with local governments in order to promote regional economic revitalization and resolution of social issues. As of July 2019, the ANA Group has signed agreements with nine prefectures (Mie, Shizuoka, Hokkaido, Kochi, Tokushima, Oita, Miyazaki, Miyagi, and Kagawa). We will continue to collaborate with them in a wide range of areas, such as tourism, culture, next-generation educa- tion, increasing non-resident populations, partnership with
overseas businesses, and support during disasters. The compre- hensive partnership agreement signed in April 2019 with Kagawa Prefecture includes a provision for promotion of innovation by use and application of leading-edge technology. We at the ANA Group are exploring the ways we can leverage the technological innovations we drive in a variety of fields, such as medicine, welfare, and tourism.
 Basic Approach
Japan is famous for its traditional culture and tourism attractions. On the other hand, Japan faces concerns about falling populations in rural areas and the gradual decline of traditional industries. The ANA Group works together with corporations, NGOs, NPOs, local gov- ernments, and others in order to bring in more inbound tourists to Japan and stimulate a flow of domestic travelers. We also seek to expand our sales channels within our Non-Air Businesses through stronger partnership with Group companies, contributing to a Regional Revitalization through Tourism Promotion. Through social contribution activities in the regions where we serve, we seek to build productive relationships with stakeholders and resolve social issues.
Implementation Structure
ANA Holdings supervises the Group’s regional revitalization while Tourism Development, Marketing and Sales of ANA, integrates initia- tives across the entire Group to maximize effectiveness. Tourism Development is the primary driver of the ANA Group Regional Revitalization Meeting, which strategically advances regional revitalization actions through tourism promotion.
Comprehensive partnership agreement with Kagawa Prefecture
Example of Innovative Technology: The AVATAR Cafe, where persons with disabilities operate robotic waitstaff remotely (e.g., from home or hospital) to serve customers
        Major Initiatives
Our Tastes of Japan by ANA program showcases food, drinks, and desserts featuring specialties from the various regions of Japan. Customers experiencing these delights onboard our aircraft or in our lounges may also find tourism information about the places where these specialties originated, providing an appealing glimpse into the regions of Japan. We develop our regional revitalization through our air transportation services, including travel campaigns to entice visitors to the various regions, leveraging in-flight media, and shipping regional special- ties via our cargo services. We are also working to gauge the needs of each region and appropriately leverage the specialties
Initiatives to Stimulate Inbound Demand
As part of regional revitalization through inbound tourism, the ANA Group launched the Japan Travel Planner website in April 2018, a travel information site for visitors to Japan. The website, linked seamlessly with the ANA flight booking site, entices visitors to the country’s various regions with information provided in 11 lan- guages. In October 2018, ANA Strategic Research Institute Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Co., Ltd., jointly founded the Regional Revitalization and Inbound Tourism Council. This council’s members include business operators and organizations connected to inbound business and regional revitalization, and as of July 2019 boasts membership from 42 companies and 23 local governments / auxiliary organizations. Participating companies
of our Group companies, including travel, advertising, logistics, research studies, training, and personnel dispatch, in regional revitalization initiatives.

Dialogue with Overseas ESG Investors
In July 2018, we met with Aviva Investors*1, a constituent member of the Advisory Council that governs the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB)*2. At the Aviva offices in London, we discussed their thoughts as institutional investors and how CHRB’s activities will develop in the future.
*1 Aviva Investors: An investment company within the Aviva Group. Aviva is a major insurance firm in the United Kingdom. The company provides services to external customers as well, with total assets under management of over £300 billion.
*2 CHRB: An international initiative evaluating and ranking corporations on their actions regarding human rights, linking these to investor activity in order to promote corporate initiatives dealing with human rights issues.
Discussion with Steve Waygood, Chief Responsible Investment Officer, Aviva Investors
   Basic Approach
The ANA Group is committed to upholding human rights in accordance with the global standards provided in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In April 2016, we established the ANA Group Policy on Human Rights. We based this policy on the International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and two International Covenants), the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We also encourage our contractors and suppliers to adopt similar policies.
We will continue human rights initiatives, recognizing that respect for human rights lies at the very foundations of the philosophy of the SDGs, which is to leave no one behind.
Implementation Structure
Our Chief CSR Promotion Officer serves as a supervisor in progress in policies and initiatives regarding human rights issues. These policies and initiatives are discussed in the Group CSR / Risk Management / Compliance Committee. Our initiatives for human rights advance in partnership with the CSR Promotion Leaders in each Group company and department.
Stakeholder Engagement
We engage actively with stakeholders to understand their expectations and demands, and to incorporate such into our initiatives.
Responding to Human Rights Issues Identified through Risk Assessments
In 2016, we conducted a review to identify potential risks to human rights related to business activities across ANA Group and at all locations where we serve. Our evaluation identified the following key issues for risk prevention.
Understanding the Workplace Environment of Foreign Workers in Japan
Following last year’s discussion with ground handling staff at airports, we secured the cooperation of our contractors and an independent third-party institution (Caux Round Table Japan*3) in fiscal 2018 to conduct interviews with non-Japanese workers in catering services.
Strengthening In-Flight Meal Supply Chain Management
We used our participation in the Bluenumber Initiative*4 (in 2017, ANA HOLDINGS was the first Japanese company to join) to register more than 200 partners and producers connected to the ingredients in our in-flight meals. We also conducted a test regis- tration of more than 2,000 articles. We seek to build a highly transparent food supply chain that includes respect for human rights and environmental conservation in the production process.
Preventing Human Trafficking via Air Transportation
In April 2019, we began a program to report potential cases of human trafficking found in-flight to ground facilities. We also conducted an e-learning course for all Group employees to pro- mote a better understanding to prevent human trafficking.
E-Learning Course about Human Trafficking
Anti-Bribery
We sponsored seminars at overseas Group branches on anti-bribery.

Communication with Our Employees
To deepen an understanding of respect for human rights among our employees, we conduct e-learning courses on Business and Human Rights for all Group employees. A full 94% of Group employees took the e-learning course during the three months period.
Influencing Business Partners
We inform all contractors and suppliers of the ANA Group Purchasing Guidelines. We work together to ensure their work- place environments uphold respect for human rights.
Disclosure of Appropriate Information (Report Disclosures)
In May 2018, we created and published a “Human Rights Report” to proactively disseminate information on respect for human rights. We are currently preparing to publish our fiscal 2019 edition.
Communication with Overseas Government Entities, NGOs, and NPOs
In June 2019, we observed work conditions in the fisheries indus- try in Thailand. We also engaged with international institutions, NGOs, NPOs, consumer groups, and others, exchanging ideas about human rights issues.
Regular Reviews with Human Rights Experts
The ANA Group holds advisory meetings with human rights experts on a regular basis. In September 2018, we invited two human rights experts from the Danish Center for Human Rights*5 and the Institute for Human Rights and Business*6 to evaluate the responses of the ANA Group to the advice received last year. The experts provided advice and reference cases about the need to broadly consider the groups and stakeholders that may be impacted by our activities in advancing future initiatives. These experts also advised us on the need to respond to issues related to non-Japanese national employees.
*3 Caux Round Table Japan: The Caux Round Table is a global network of business leaders working to realize a fair, free, and transparent society through business. *4 The Bluenumber Initiative is a global program to establish food supply chain platforms by Bluenumber Foundation.
    *5 The Danish Center for Human Rights was established by the Danish Parliament to gather information and develop tools related to human rights and business.

  Service Legacy of Diversity, Implementation of Barrier-Free Mindsets
 Basic Approach
As we approach the year 2020 and our customers continue to diversify globally, continuing to be chosen and trusted by customers will be crucial for the future of ANA Group growth. We believe our responsibility as a public transportation entity is to serve an inclusive society in which we can all move forward together. To create a sustainable society, the ANA Group respects the diversity of all customers. We will accelerate initiatives aimed at providing world-class inclusive and universal services.
Implementation Structure
We created a policy for inclusive and universal services to reflect our shared values. Under this policy, we carry out programs to improve our facilities and services.
We have implemented a range of initiatives to ensure that every employee embraces a barrier-free mindset in society and allow us to offer world-class inclusive and universal services. At the same time, we are working to create a framework that will allow our customers to use our services with peace of mind.
The ANA Group is working to foster people capable of leading the movement toward a barrier-free mindset within society.

Becoming an LGBT-Friendly Airline Group
Based on the April 2015 ANA Group Diversity and Inclusion Declaration, we work to deepen employee under- standing of LGBT issues, as well as endeavor to facilitate understanding and encourage an environment accepting of customer diversity and LGBT issues within our company. The ANA Group pursues initiatives toward an inclusive society, offering a comprehensive range of training and materials appropriate to LGBT issues for our employees. This training includes the ANA Group LGBT Booklet we distributed in June 2018.
The ANA Group was honored for the third successive year with the highest level of Gold in PRIDE Index 2018, an index that evaluates LGBT-related initiatives, by the volunteer work with Pride* organization.
 * work with Pride: A private voluntary organization that supports the promotion and establishment of diversity management related to sexual minorities, such as LGBT individuals.

Diversity and Inclusion
Creating a Legacy for 2020 and Beyond
The ANA Group aims to contribute to the revitalization of local communities and resolve social issues by connecting the world with all regions of Japan through our businesses, particularly through air transportation.
Looking to 2020 and beyond, we intend to become an airline group that provides the finest inclusive and universal services, leveraging diversity for continued sustainable growth as a presence leading the way to the creation of a society in which anyone can live with ease.

  From the Japan Blind Football Association
    HELLO BLUE, HELLO FUTURE—Let’s Make 2020 Our Runway
The Japan Blind Football Association signed a partnership agreement with ANA in June 2016 to pursue initiatives to create a society that encourages diversity. As part of these efforts, we have started Tomoni-Tsukuru together with the ANA Group. By playing soccer while wearing eye masks, participants experience a world without sight and all its difficulties. This allows participants to reach beyond an objective understanding of what it means to be disabled, experiencing and finding what’s important inside. This program is the first step in our vision of using blind-folded soccer to achieve a society in which those with disabilities mingle with those without disabilities as a matter of course. We look forward to creating a wave of social change together with the ANA Group.
The blue circle of the logo for HELLO BLUE, HELLO FUTURE represents our blue earth, the world. The ANA Group strives to provide world-leading universal services in order to form a bridge between diverse cus- tomers of differing cultures, languages, nationalities, ages, genders, and physical characteristics from around the world. We are embarking on a new journey to accomplish this goal.
Our Dreams for Universal Services
With 500 days until opening ceremonies of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, in March 2019 we produced a video introducing the progress of ANA’s universal services. The video presents our initiatives to create skies that value and welcome all people, where anyone can experience air travel comfortably and with peace of mind. The video expresses our desire to align ourselves with our customers to create new experiences and happiness together.
ANA is an official airline partner of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
Initiatives Toward an Integrated Society
In June 2019, we established ANA Blue Academy Tomoni- Tsukuru, a new education program for the next generation, targeting elementary and middle school students and their parents. In this program, which was jointly developed with the Japan Blind Football Association, employees of ANA Group companies and currently active blind football players serve as teachers. By experiencing blind football, participants learn how to consider other points of view when communicating and to understand the importance of empathy for their surroundings. These experiences help youth to think about an inclusive soci- ety in which it is easy for everyone to live together.
In fiscal 2019, we plan to expand this program to eight locations around Japan. The ANA Group supports the idea of connecting to tomorrow, one of the visions of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Through this program, we learn together with children, while creating the hopes and dreams of an interconnected world as defined in our mission statement and contributing to the achievement of the SDGs.

In April 2019, operation of an integrated training center for the ANA Group, ANA Blue Base, has started. With an area spanning more than 30,000 m2, this is one of the largest training facilities in Japan, combining the training and educational functions scat- tered around Haneda Airport into one. This new training center will allow the Group to cope with the increased training require- ments that accompany the expansion of our businesses.
Our policy is to offer state-of-the-art training equipment, an environment that fosters innovation, and facilities for training of all kinds. This policy improves the ability of ANA Blue Base to func- tion as a center for cultivating people who go out into the world, to communicate the safety culture that is the foundation of our business, and to improve quality and services.
In June 2020, we plan to open a general tour area on-site. This area will allow people to view an array of training facilities that utilize the latest digital devices and mobility equipment, and will offer tours that allow visitors to enjoy themselves while learning about the history of the ANA Group.

We chose the name ANA Blue Base by soliciting suggestions from ANA Group employees around the world. The word “Blue” reflects the ANA Group corporate color, and “Base” is our wish for ANA Blue Base to serve as a platform and center for the growth of every group employee.
Here, we provide training in all of the occupations associated with operating aircraft (flight crew, cabin attendants, aircraft mechanics, ground staff, ground handling staff, and freight staff), continually raising awareness and professional expertise. At ANA Blue Base, all employees learn Endeavor, one aspect of ANA’s Way. The facility serves as a base for the development of personnel who will create innovation and reform work styles.
Human resources are the most important capital a business has and are essential to achieving sustainable growth. In this facility, we pursue safety, as our business foundation, continually refining our heartfelt service, and living up to our motto of Anshin, Attaka, Akaruku- genki! as we seek to grow to be the world’s top airline group.

Today’s airline industry must address environmental changes, which include expanded slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports planned for fiscal 2020, helping meet government targets of 40 million foreign visitors to Japan, and contributing to the SDGs, which have been designed to solve social issues.
In response, the ANA Group is improving the quality of services that leverage our imagination, ability to act, innovative technologies, and open innovation. Further, we aim to achieve digital transformation (DX)* through work-style reform. In April 2019, we were selected as a Competitive Information Technology (IT) Strategy Company for a second consecutive year, recognized as a business that is making strategic use of IT. We were also awarded as the only DX Grand Prix winner, which is an award not restricted to the confines of any specific industry. The ANA Group will continue to utilize a combination of human resource development and digital technology to create new value for our customers, employees, and society, through which we aim to achieve sustainable growth.
* DX: The process of a company responding to rapid changes in the business environment creating products, services, and new business models based on customer and social needs through the use of data and digital technologies.

 2 Toward Simple & Smart Airport Operation
The needs of customers who use airlines are diversifying. More people stress the value of time and expect recognition of their individual requests. Accordingly, airlines must provide nuanced, high-quality services that are aligned with each customer.
Conversely, as the decline in working-age population makes it more difficult to secure necessary people in labor-intensive industries, busi- nesses must make workplaces more comfortable and easier for anyone to work in, with less people and effort.
To respond to these environmental changes, the ANA Group is re-examining the combinations and roles of people and technology in

every airport scenario. By offering “Simple & Smart” airport services and operations to customers and employees, we aim to maximize the value of the experience we offer each, while finding new innovative improvements in staff productivity.
Currently we have designated Kyushu Saga International Airport as an innovation model airport for testing, gathering, and connecting advanced technologies. We are conducting projects to evaluate and implement work-style reforms using new technologies. Based on the status of operations here, we will select and improve operational issues, rolling out new technologies to other airports.

A Platform for Achieving Sustainable Growth
—Actions for Safety and Human Resources—
1 Construction of a Digital Platform for Our Customers
At ANA, we divide the customer journey into 13 scenes ranging from reservations to arriving at the airport, entering the aircraft, and finally reaching the end of a trip. We aim to offer a seamless, stress-free experience that is consistent throughout these scenes in a one-to-one service that addresses the potential needs any of our customers may have.
In autumn 2018, we constructed the Customer Experience (CE) Platform. This is a digital platform that links customer information with operational information. By integrating multiple systems virtually, this platform allows customer information and operational information stored separately at each division to be aggregated across the entire company. In this way, information required at each stage can be accessed in a timely manner.
The services provided by the CE platform (digital) and by people (human resources) complement each other, allowing ANA to offer a more finely detailed service that maintains and improves customer satisfaction and the value of the experience we offer.

 In July 2019, ANA standardized data across the 13 scenes of the ANA CE and put in place an organization to promote MaaS, including scenes from before and after transport. We intend to create a seamless travel experience from the start of the journey to the destination. Our vision is for disparate transport operators to cross industry borders in cooperation, using digital technology to connect data and services.

  A Foundation for Ongoing Safety Adherence
The ANA Group has adopted a PDCA cycle for safety management not only for aircraft operation, but also for passengers, employees (front-lines), and security.
  An Unwavering Commitment
Safety is the absolute value underlying every ANA Group corpo- rate activity. Safety is the bedrock of everything we do. We strive to ensure safe aircraft operations as a matter of course. Our dedication to safety extends to every part of our group busi- nesses, including food services, cargo, and information. Our everyday efforts to improve safety, and conscientious response to customer expectations build confidence and trust with society.
An environment of mutual understanding and trust form rela- tionships among employees across various job descriptions to support safe aircraft operations and other aspects of the ANA Group business. In every workplace, we post the ANA Group Safety Principles and Course of ANA Group Safety Action, which are pledges shared by all ANA Group employees.
Four Axes of Safety Risk Management
The Group sets yearly quantitative targets for safety in these four areas. At the monthly Group Safety Promotion Committee, which holds final decision-making authority within our safety implementation structure, attendees report on high-risk events and issues, discuss countermeasures and risk reduction, and review safety targets and achievement rates for each fiscal year. These safety-related initiatives are compiled and presented in our annual Safety Report, which is published on the corporate website.
At the end of 2018, the ANA Group updated our IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), an audit by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) meant to check whether an airline’s safety management systems are functioning effectively. The Group received certification under the audit in May of 2019.

  (Report) FY2018 Safety Target Performance (ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD., ANA WINGS CO., LTD., and Air Japan Co., Ltd.)
In FY2018, we experienced one aircraft accident (June 6, 2018) and zero serious incidents.
Details on the aircraft incident are as follows.
June 6, 2018 Aircraft Incident
ANA Flight 834 to Narita Airport from Tan Son Nhat International Airport (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), operated by Air Japan Co., Ltd. The Boeing 767-300 executed a sudden brake during ground taxing before takeoff, injuring flight attendants aboard. Vietnam’s Civil Aviation Authority classified this event as an aircraft accident. After this event,
Air Japan launched an internal investigation committee. The committee findings prompted a number of measures, including warnings and presentation of precedent cases to flight crew and attendants. Note that the Vietnamese authorities issued a report in February 2019 after inquiry into the event. All actions and recommendations by those authorities have been completed at Air Japan.

Prevention: For a Stronger Safety Infrastructure
The FY2018–2022 ANA Group Medium-Term Safety Promotion Plan identifies prevention as a key component of safety risk management. Under this plan, we identify factors (hazards) that lead to risk and strengthen measures that reduce the severity of these factors.
Unsafe events do not simply happen out of the blue. There are reasons and precursors that can be foreseen through daily oper- ations. This foresight is made possible by setting safety perfor- mance indicators (SPI), which are used as management
indicators by a number of other firms such as IATA, Star Alliance, and other leading global companies.
The ANA Group began testing SPI implementation as of fiscal 2018, striving to evaluate relative safety in air transport and pro- vide more granular advance predictions using new SPIs. SPIs are also being used to help shed light on the work processes and expertise of skilled team members, spreading this knowledge to others and thereby strengthening preventative initiatives for developing a more robust foundation of safety and trust.

    Approach to Human Resources
The ANA Group considers human resources our greatest assets and the source of our ability to win against global competition. We aim to achieve continued, sustainable growth as a leading global airline group. One important component is our medium- term human resources strategy, built on the foundation of the ANA’s Way guidelines, work-style reforms, and health manage- ment. This human resources strategy consists of three key elements: Talent Management, Diversity & Inclusion and Globalization, and Innovation.
By maximizing the group employees’ potential, combining the power of people and the power of ICT to bring our comprehen- sive capabilities to bear, we will create new value for society through our businesses and secure our position as the world’s leading airline group.

Work-Style Reforms
At the ANA Group, we work hard to develop work-style reform that helps our diverse employee pool be healthy and enthusiastic in their work, allowing employees to improve their own abilities and achieve peak performance. In fiscal 2018, we shared processes for reform, which led to improvements in employee work styles and greater productivity.
We encourage telework and flexible work time systems, reduc- ing limitations on the place and time that people work and pro- moting a shift to more productive work styles. In conjunction, we have accelerated the process of making work more efficient through digital devices, RPA*, and other digital technologies.
We have also instilled kaizen (continuous improvement) activi- ties, originally advanced in our ANA operations department, our Headquarters department, and the Marketing & Sales Department. We have done this to establish kaizen as a style of working within the ANA Group. Nearly 3,000 initiatives were con- ducted to remove waste, unevenness, and overburden (muda, mura, muri) in our operations. Our employees are taking a bold, voluntary first step to create a comfortable office environment and an efficient work structure. We have also assigned a kaizen con- sultant role within the Company to help identify cross-functional issues for better quality and work efficiency. At the same time, we are fostering a pool of employees who evangelize kaizen within our organization.
Ikuboss Training
Every year since 2015, the ANA Group has held Ikuboss seminars. The Ikuboss program trains managers to support subordinates in their careers and lives for a better work-life balance, as well as to improve team performance, while also setting a personal example of balance in satisfaction from work and home life.
ANA Group Internal Nursery Schools
In August 2018, we opened the ‘OHANA Nursery School Naha in Okinawa after opening ‘OHANA Nursery School Haneda in April. Both serve as internal nurseries and were built in response to employee requests and proposals. These nursery schools provide monthly, regular care for dependents, as well as ad-hoc care for parents to discuss returning to work. These efforts to improve the work environment help Group employees feel secure in the knowledge they can pursue both career and family life.
As we continue to bring a better work-life balance and higher satisfaction to our employees, we are creating smart working styles and kaizen, which provide employees room to breathe physically and mentally. This room serves as fertile ground for the seeds of innovation, which leads to new aspirations and the creation of added value.

The ANA Group pursues organizational and human development, continuing to adopt initia- tives that pass on the Team Spirit and Challenge and Endeavor in the Group’s DNA handed down to us over the 60 years since our
founding. In parallel, we encourage proactive, self-starting action that breathes life and vibrancy into our organization.
The annual ANA’s Way Survey (employee awareness survey) is one tool we use to observe, analyze, and improve workplace attitudes and job satisfaction among our employees. A total of 40,177 people across the 46 ANA Group companies responded to the fiscal 2018 survey, representing a response rate of 96.5%.

          Basic Approach to CSR
The ANA Group’s CSR aims to fulfill its social responsibility by communicating with various stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, investors, business partners, national and local governments, local committees, etc.), allowing us to accurately identify social needs and take suitable measures towards them. Moreover, it aims to ensure the security interest of society as well as our own sustainable growth, thereby creating social and economic value concurrently in order to continue contributing to the creation of future society.
Based on this philosophy, the ANA Group pursues CSR according to the following tenets:

This committee, which operates under the guidance of the president, consists of the Chief CSR Promotion Officer (CCPO) as chair, ANA HOLDINGS and the group company directors, executive officers, and full-time Audit & Supervisory Board members of ANA HOLDINGS. The committee establishes core policies, formulates proposals, and deliberates matters related to CSR. After delibera- tions, important matters are elevated to the board of directors, the Audit & Supervisory Board, and the Group Management Committee, ensuring the smooth promotion of CSR within the group.
Based on these regulations, each group company has an appointed CSR Promotion Officer (CPO) as a supervisor of CSR promotion and CSR Promotion Leaders (CPLs) to lead their organization’s CSR activities.

In 2008, the ANA Group joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). The UNGC is a movement joined voluntarily by companies and organizations to build a global framework for achieving sustainable growth. We identify

Social Responsibility Guidelines
We established the Social Responsibility Guidelines to serve as a mandatory rule for group executives and employees. These guidelines reinforce the foundations of the ANA Group ESG man- agement. We also use these guidelines as a code of conduct to educate employees in contributing to a better, more sustainable society with honesty and integrity.
Self-check lists and employee satisfaction surveys confirm employee understanding and commitment, as well as check whether employees are practicing these guidelines.
Promotion of CSR throughout the Supply Chain
The ANA Group believes it is important to promote CSR mea- sures not just in our own business activities but also throughout the entire supply chain, which includes suppliers, manufacturers, and subcontractors. To facilitate these efforts, we have estab- lished the ANA Group Purchasing Guidelines by referencing international social responsibility guidelines, such as ISO 26000. Based on this policy, we share our Supplier Management Policy and CSR Guidelines with our business partners.
In fiscal 2018, we built a mechanism in conjunction with ESG management for the central management of transaction condi- tions between ANA and suppliers based on company identifica- tion codes. We also began third-party evaluations of ANA suppliers and other initiatives to strengthen our supply chain management.

Major Initiatives
The ANA Group’s Risk Management
The ANA Group takes a two-pronged approach toward managing risk comprised of risk management measures conducted from a preventive perspective and crisis management in the event of materialization of a risk. Given the Group’s role as a provider of social infrastructure, business continuity management and infor- mation security are areas of particular importance. We prioritize initiatives in these areas accordingly.
Risk Management from a Preventive Perspective
Each group company implements independent risk management activities that include identifying risks, analyzing and evaluating these risks, formulating and implementing countermeasures, and monitoring the results of these activities.
The group companies confirm and evaluate the progress, effectiveness, and level of achievement of the measures taken with respect to significant risks identified in each organization. The Company implements measures to address issues faced by the Group and confirms progress through the Group CSR / Risk Management / Compliance Committee.
Crisis Management in the Event of Materialization
of a Risk
The ANA Group has constructed a crisis management system based on detailed manuals in order to minimize damage and ensure safe and reliable future operations by investigating the causes of crises.
The Emergency Response Manual (ERM) sets out responses to incidents with a direct impact on the operation of the ANA Group’s aircraft including accidents and hijacking, and the Crisis Management Manual (CMM) provides responses to other crises including system failures, information leaks, and risks from external sources.
companies and divisions, and CPLs facilitate risk management activities. The role of CPLs is to promote risk management in each group company and department by executing risk countermeasures according to plans and to take swift action while contacting the secretariat in the event of a crisis.
Information Security
Recent cyberattacks via the internet have become more advanced across the globe. Today, cyberterrorism via computer viruses, large-scale information leakage incidents, business email fraud, and other vectors have become much more potent threats.
As a corporate group responsible for important air transporta- tion infrastructure, the ANA Group has created an information security management system based on the ANA Group Information Security Management Regulations. Through this system, we strive every day to improve information systems func- tions and take measures by defence in depth.
We also work with outside entities to train our security special- ists and actively participate in information sharing with other cor- porate groups. In this way, we are raising the level of our expertise, preparing against incidents, and structuring a prompt initial response system. Other measures include response exercises coordinated with each department as a means to minimize the impact of an incident. We communicate the importance of infor- mation security to employees by distributing an IT security system handbook and providing related e-learning courses. We also conduct seminars for overseas branches and group companies.
Security Export Control*
The ANA Group exports the parts, chemicals, apparatuses, and other articles necessary for aircraft maintenance to overseas airports and aircraft maintenance centers. Certain articles have the potential to be adapted to create weapons. Accordingly, we practice rigorous security export control of exported articles.
A stringent security export control structure is maintained through once-annual audits and trainings. These activities target divisions that are considered exporters for being directly involved in exporting as well as divisions that are involved due to handling customs clearance and other transportation-related processes.
* Security export control is a term that refers to all regulations placed on exports from Japan by the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act.

 Business Continuity Management Initiatives for Crisis Events: What We Learned from the Fiscal 2018 Natural Disasters
Fiscal 2018 was a year of numerous natural disasters in Japan. June saw the northern Osaka earthquakes, July, the heavy rains in western Japan, and in September, both Typhoon No. 21 and the Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake. These and other disasters caused significant damage in areas near airport facilities. The storm surge of Typhoon No. 21 in September resulted in flooding at the Kansai International Airport that caused major damage to the runway, power generation equipment, and other airport facili- ties. Many aircraft were unavailable for use for an extended period of time, interrupting customers and logistics. The
Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake, also in September, damaged airport facilities and caused power outages throughout Hokkaido.
The ANA Group has created overall group business continuity plan (BCP) during these times of disaster to meet our mission as a public transportation provider. One aim of this plan is to priori- tize safety while resuming aircraft operations as quickly as pos- sible. With this latest round of incidents, the ANA Group is striving to update our BCP measures in such event of a crisis, continuing to improve our capacity to respond at the front lines of our busi- nesses and train our people.

Typhoon No. 21 caused flooding of certain ground support equipment and several vehi- cles. We regret that we should have been much more aware of potential flooding since Typhoon No.21 was unusually large. We took this lesson to heart. As Typhoon No.24 approached, we moved ground support equipment and vehicles to Terminal 2, which is on ground seven meters higher than Terminal 1.
Communications over Wi-Fi and mobile phone continued to be difficult. Computers connected by LAN cable and fixed-line phones were still operable, which prompted us to review and update our BCP to use this older technology.

The Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake caused power outages across Hokkaido. Power around the airport recovered on the night after the earthquake, which allowed us to resume aircraft operations on the following day. However, traffic signals in Chitose City were not operating in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. The dangerous driving conditions caused Japan Railway and buses to cease service, making it difficult for many of our employees to report to work. We realized the need to plan a groupwide response if the same type of situation occurred in the Tokyo metropolitan area or other regions. We also recognized the critical need for backup emergency generators and wireless communica- tions devices, since our communications depend almost entirely on electricity.

Preserve Corporate Value by Enhancing Internal Systems and
Further Entrench Mission Statement
The ANA Group is taking steps to minimize exposure to legal risks and prevent incidents that could diminish corporate value.
Internal Reporting System
Founded on the ANA Group Rules for Handling Internal Reporting, we have established a point of contact (ANA Alert) for internal and external reporting (external law firm, entrusted over- seas report reception team). Our efforts here are to grasp compli- ance-related information and resolve issues. These reporting systems are available to all group executives, employees, and temporary personnel involved in operations. ANA Group retirees and officers and employees of our business partners may also use these reporting systems. We protect the privacy of the caller and other relevant parties, and the Group assures that no punitive measures will be taken against those that seek consultation or cooperate in confirming facts. This helps us obtain internal risk- related information promptly and aids in self-correction. Our various initiatives and efforts to provide information about compli- ance with laws and regulations advances compliance manage- ment and contributes to greater corporate value. We also provide education and dissemination of information to the Group in the interest of bolstering this function by preparing surveys of best practices and sharing information about our activities with Audit & Supervisory Board members.
Information Dissemination
A monthly e-mail newsletter covering important legal topics, revisions to laws and regulations, labor or contract issues, and frequently asked questions to Legal & Insurance is sent to the employees and officers concerned. We also issue newsletters presenting legal topics in an easy-to-understand approach twice a year.
The Group intranet has a dedicated compliance website that features manuals and guidelines related to various laws, regula- tions, and rules. We work to improve compliance by group employees and officers by promoting use of the various informa- tion tools.
Group Companies Compliance Survey
Investigations of circumstances surrounding compliance at group companies are conducted once each year. These investi- gations consist of self-checks on the degree to which compli- ance was practiced with regard to relevant laws and regulations as well as examinations of issues pertaining to each group com- pany and to the entire Group. We conduct follow-ups with each company based on survey results as necessary in the interest of resolving issues.
     Compliance Implementation Structure
The ANA Group has developed a compliance system based on the ANA Group Compliance Regulations to promote compliance with laws, regulations, and other standards related to business activities. CPLs are the driving force behind creating stronger
Major Initiatives
Legal Compliance Education
The Group has created an educational handbook and e-learning course for anti-bribery laws around the world based on the ANA Group Anti-Bribery Rules. Our education is designed to prevent incidents that could degrade corporate value. Here, the person- nel at Legal & Insurance conduct education in Japanese and English at our overseas offices in conjunction with education about competition laws, minimizing legal risks on the global level.
Seminars
Seminars are conducted periodically by Legal & Insurance to enhance the legal knowledge of employees and officers on laws and regulations related to air transport, contracts, and labor affairs.
Further, Legal & Insurance holds dispatch seminars at Group companies, with content adjusted to meet the specific needs of the participants.
Coordination with Overseas Branches
The Company has clearly identified venues for communicating between the Legal & Insurance and overseas branches and is stepping up measures to minimize exposure to legal risks on a global level and prevent occurrences that could diminish corpo- rate value. Furthermore, the Company seeks to foster a mind-set focused on legal compliance among all Group executives and employees, including those working overseas. To this end, we hold legal compliance seminars at overseas branches.

      2. Scheduled Flight Cancellations Due to Maintenance in Connection with Rolls-Royce Engines
Prioritizing safety above other considerations, ANA has conducted enhanced inspections and maintenance for Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines used on Boeing 787 aircraft since early fiscal 2018. As a result, we were forced to cancel certain scheduled domestic and international flights between July and October 2018.
We apologize once again for the inconvenience to passengers.
Background
In rare cases, engines in question showed earlier-than-anticipated deterioration in specific compressor and turbine components. Prioritizing safety above all other considerations, ANA have advanced inspection and repair for these parts. However, in early fiscal 2018 the engine manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism amended technical guidance via Airworthiness Directive to strengthen inspection frequency (April) and expanded scope (July).
As a result of securing maintenance slot for more frequent inspections and the temporary spike in engines requiring repair, we experienced insufficient aircraft resources to support our scheduled flights. In response, we were forced to decide cancellations for certain regularly scheduled flights.
Response
ANA conducted the inspections and permanent reliability improvement measures as instructed / recommended by the Civil Aviation Bureau and the engine manufacturer. In addition, giving priority to safety and security above all other considerations, we introduced more frequent inspections and parts replacement ahead of the instructed schedule. ANA was ahead of other airlines in advancing the introduction of upgraded components.

The Audit & Supervisory Board Members Office was established and placed under the direct control of the Audit & Supervisory Board members to provide support for audits. This office cooperates with the Internal Audit Division, which is directly under the supervision of the president and CEO, and the accounting auditors, to enhance the Company’s auditing system.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit Division, which reports directly to the president and CEO, audits the operations and accounts of ANA HOLDINGS INC. and group companies and conducts evaluations from an inde- pendent, objective perspective that correspond to the standards in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act on the reporting system for the internal control over financial reporting. Audits are comprised of regular audits, which are conducted in accordance with annual audit plans, and intermittent audits conducted at the discretion of management. Regular audits are impartially and objectively con- ducted based on risk analyses of each division and group company.
The results of audits are reported to the president and CEO every month and to Audit & Supervisory Board members when needed.
Audits by the Accounting Auditors
The accounting auditors perform audits of ANA HOLDINGS INC.

Analysis and Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
    Method of Evaluation during Fiscal 2018
Every director and Audit & Supervisory Board member received a questionnaire to be returned no later than January 2019. The questionnaire solicited responses regarding progress and assessments related to issues identified by each director through past analyses and evaluations of board effectiveness.
Outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, as well as the chairman of the board, president & CEO, and the senior executive vice president, were interviewed between
February and March 2019 to delve deeper into the results of the surveys. A report was presented to the board of directors in March 2019, providing a detailed analysis of survey and interview results. In response, the Company established a PDCA cycle to enhance further effectiveness of the board of directors through operational changes toward new solutions. We will continue to conduct evaluations and analyses of this type as we strive for further improvement in the effectiveness of the board of directors.

Fiscal 2018 Initiatives and Goals Based on Fiscal 2017 Survey and Interview Results
 Goals
Initiatives
Share and discuss information about important corporate issues (safety, customer satisfaction, alliances, human resources strategy, etc.)
Share corporate strategies and progress of ANA Group companies regularly
• Regularly (almost every month) shared information at board meetings on safety issues, as well as details and progress of initiatives.
• Set time aside for explanations and discussions from ANA directors related to strategic management issues (alliance strategy, human resources strategy, etc.).
• We provided time for explanations and discussions from the president of ANA Sales Co., Ltd. on the management strategy and progress of travel services operator ANA Sales.
• Difficult to balance time allocation to address complex issues.
• It may be a good idea to re-visit areas that have been observed once in the past. Having heard various information in board meetings, we might see something new if we go back again.
• Discussions narrowed in focus to a single topic during direct talks is effective.
Future Initiatives
       Provide direct interactions between outside directors and employees who work at airports and sales offices
         • Conduct direct talks between outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board mem- bers with section managers at the ANA Engineering & Maintenance Center and maintenance departments within Group companies. Topic of talks include human resource development and other matters.
• To deepen the understanding of outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members about operations under their current portfolio, we provided opportunities to attend and observe pre-flight briefings for flight crew members and flight attendants, as well as pre- flight inspections and pre-departure briefings.
          Make board meetings more efficient by organizing the meeting agenda, revising operating rules, reducing the number of documents handed out, and providing more detailed explanations prior to the meeting
     • Review and revise operating rules to improve the efficiency of the board meetings. • Provide detailed explanations prior to meetings for more effective discussions.
   Board Discussions Related to Corporate Strategy
Example: 622nd Ordinary Meeting of the Board of Directors (March 26, 2019)
Agenda Item: ANA medium-term human resources strategy
One of the most important topics within the ANA Group Corporate Strategy is our human resources strategy. Here, the director in charge of ANA human resources reported on the state of human resources, followed by an active discussion, which included outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board.
 Major Topics Covered by the Board Effectiveness Survey
(1) Theperformanceofboardfunctions(decision-making, supervision of business execution)
(2) Responsetoissuesidentifiedintheprioryear’ssurvey
(3) Managementofboardmeetings
i. Discuss board deliberations, including dissenting opinions, at other internal meetings
ii. Provide balance among agenda item explanations, questions and answers, and time for discussions
iii. Content (time, quality) for explanations to outside
directors prior to meetings
iv. Materials (quantity, quality) handed out during board
meetings
Opinions Discussed (excerpt)
1
Development and Utilization of Human Resources who are Expert in the Use of Digital Technology
2
Human Resource Development and Retirement Extensions
   • The ANA Innovation KAIZEN Office works to improve the productivity of current operations. The Digital Design Lab takes the lead in promoting innovation in our organization.
• While it is important to use Big Data to improve customer satisfaction, we need human resources who can analyze delay factors and perform other investigations into ANA operations.
• Digital human resources do not necessarily need to be hired from outside the Company. We have many talented human resources in the Company who can grow into digital human resources if trained to think independently.
 • To develop human resources, we must communicate the importance of the work of each individual, instilling a feeling and teaching the social importance of our work. We must create policies that motivate people to work for our company and create an organization worthy of this desire.
• OJT is important for improving individual skills. However, the education plans of many companies leave the details to managers on the front lines. We should be able to do better in formalizing OJT.
• Japanese companies should take a serious look at extend- ing the retirement age. If we are to continue, our company must exercise strict-but-fair selection rather than extending employment little-by-little making work conditions less toler- able over time.

Notable Opinions Stemming from the Fiscal 2018 Questionnaires / Interviews
• Board content and discussions are more substantial,
stemming from a focus on more active board meetings. • Time has been secured to explain the status of Group
companies and ANA business strategies. At the same time, regular reports have been simplified and the quality of discussions has improved.
•
•
•
A column to write a summary of internal meetings should be implemented on board meeting documents for matters other than regularly addressed items to enhance efficiency of meeting discussions.
The board should increase the frequency of pre-meeting briefings or provide time for explanations and questions for outside directors, separate from board meetings, with respect to the ANA Group Corporate Strategy.
Hold interviews with outside directors about their interests and aspirations to improve the content of observations and direct talks related to their area of responsibility

Foundation Supporting Corporate Activities
Toward Stronger Governance
Basic Approach
In 2013, we transitioned to a holding company structure and realigned the authority of the board of directors and the Group Management Committee to build a foundation supporting aggressive and speedy management. We will continue to pursue better quality in gover- nance by encouraging discussions in board meetings, providing meaningful dialogue with stakeholders, and introducing other measures to implement management policies that contribute to the creation of corporate value.
Training for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member Remuneration
      The Company implements training and individual coaching tailored to the knowledge and experience of internal directors. This training will include outside seminars dealing with finance, accounting, compliance, and other disciplines. To provide directors with infor- mation and knowledge necessary for their duties, we intend to offer regular group training for directors, as well as lectures and discus- sions led by outside experts. Internal Audit & Supervisory Board members also have opportunities for training in audit methodology, CSR, risk management, compliance, and other topics, according
to the member’s knowledge and experience.
We provide opportunities for outside directors and outside
Audit & Supervisory Board members to learn more about the ANA Group and the airline industry. These opportunities include on- site visits at airport handling, maintenance, flight operations, in-flight services, and other departments. Other training provides basic knowledge about the airline industry and presentations on the businesses of group companies.
1. Basic Policies for Director Remuneration
The basic policies for director remuneration are as follows.
• Ensure the transparency, fairness, and objectivity of remunera-
tion and establish a remuneration level worthy of his/her roles
and responsibilities
• Reinforce incentives for achieving management objectives by
introducing performance-linked remuneration combining a diverse range of indicators to clarify roles and responsibilities for company results.
• Establish a remuneration system that achieves our social responsibilities as a company, while allowing the Company to share profits with shareholders through raising medium- to long-term corporate value.
2. Procedures for Determining Remuneration
The board of directors decides director remuneration, taking into account reports by the Remuneration Advisory Committee. The total amount of director remuneration shall be within the scope of the amount approved at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. 3. Remuneration Advisory Committee
The Remuneration Advisory Committee consists of a majority of outside directors, Audit & Supervisory Board members, and outside experts to ensure appropriate and transparent process of decision- making related to director remuneration. The committee is in charge of the director remuneration system and director remuneration standards, conducting discussions based on surveys of director remuneration at other companies provided by outside experts.
4. Remuneration System
(1) Internal directors
• In addition to a fixed basic remuneration, remuneration for directors
includes an annual variable performance-linked bonus and long- term incentive share remuneration plan as a means of providing healthy incentives for pursuing sustainable growth for the Company.
• The ratio of fixed basic remuneration and bonus/share remu- neration for total remuneration is 1:0.67 fixed to variable, if annual performance targets have been accomplished. The ratio of variable remuneration ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 times according to the degree of achievement for annual performance targets.
i. Bonuses
We use net income, safety, and customer satisfaction as indi- cators that reflect the performance and substance for a single fiscal year. The Remuneration Advisory Committee and the board of directors have previously determined the target values for each indicator and a table for corresponding pay- ment levels. This table determines payment amounts based on the performance on each indicator.
ii. Share remuneration
We use return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and operating income margin as indicators for improved corporate value over the medium to long term and sustainable growth. The Remuneration Advisory Committee and the board of directors determine the amount of payment through a combi- nation of payment levels determined by the board and the respective indicators.

 The Japanese Corporate Governance Code was revised in June 2018, as was the final version of Guidelines for Investor and Company Engagement. With these changes, our board of direc- tors discussed and confirmed a number of matters that we will include in our corporate governance report. These matters included an examination of cross-shareholding policy, initiatives in human resources and operations toward functioning as corpo- rate pension fund asset owners, and procedures for the dis- missal of management members. We also discussed matters other than disclosures for our corporate governance report.
These matters included CEO succession planning, CEO selection and dismissal, methods to verify the appropriateness of cross- shareholdings, business portfolio revisions based on an accurate understanding of the cost of capital, management resource allocation (capital investment, etc.), ensuring diversity on the board of directors, and more.
We recognize the need for greater activity and diversity among our board of directors to reach higher levels of governance. We plan to enhance the effectiveness of the board (greater use of PDCA cycle) as we proceed.
(2) Outside directors
• Remuneration for outside directors consists of fixed compensa-
tion (monthly compensation) without a performance-linked por- tion. This compensation encourages outside directors to exercise their supervisory functions from an independent standpoint.
(3) Audit & Supervisory Board members
• Remuneration for both inside and outside Audit & Supervisory
Board members consists of fixed compensation (monthly com- pensation) without a performance-linked portion. This compen- sation encourages those members to exercise their supervisory functions from an independent standpoint.
• Remuneration levels for members of the Audit & Supervisory Board are determined in line with remuneration at other companies and in consultation with outside experts.
     Cross-Shareholdings
ANA HOLDINGS engages in cross-shareholding when we deem such holdings to contribute to improved corporate value over the medium to long term from the viewpoint of continuing smooth business, maintaining business alliances, and grow- ing profits through strengthening business relationships.
It is difficult to quantitatively calculate the direct or indirect amount of contribution of cross-shareholdings to our busi- ness. Therefore, the amount of investment in each cross- shareholding is regarded as the amount of capital invested in each respective stock. We multiply this amount by our costs of capital (weighted-average cost of capital) and deduct this amount from the post-tax dividend provided for each holding. If the amount is negative and we determine that the business contributions expected to be obtained through the holdings will not offset the negative amount for a discernible period of
time and further will not contribute to sustainable growth, we reduce our holdings in said stock. We will also reduce the amount of a holding if the market value of the holding in ques- tion is significantly below acquisition value with no prospect of recovery in our estimation.
Every year, the board of directors conducts a comprehen- sive review of individual cross-shareholdings. The board evaluates the significance of holdings and the benefits and risks associated. At this time, the Company has determined there are no cross-shareholdings that should be subject to reduction. In addition, the exercise of voting rights associated with cross-shareholdings will be judged based on the results of dialogues with the company in question after examining the medium- to long-term improvement of the corporate value and the impact on the Group’s business.

Discussion Between the Chairman of the Board and Outside Director
 Strengthening Governance for Further Corporate Value Growth
Shinichiro Ito
Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Board of Directors ANA HOLDINGS INC.
Shosuke Mori
Outside Director ANA HOLDINGS INC.
  The ANA Group believes that stronger governance is an indispensable part of the pursuit of sustainable growth. Outside Director Shosuke Mori offered his opinions on initiatives and the current state of ANA HOLDINGS board of directors in connection with corporate governance. Mr. Mori offers the benefit of his extensive experience in senior management in the electric power industry.
1. Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Mori Our outside directors have management experience in industries other than air transport. I feel extremely gratified that our opinions are taken seriously and are incorporated into various policies and resolutions. While there is no end goal defining
2. Initiatives for Stronger Governance
Ito We provide opportunities for outside directors to learn the Group business through site observations, interviews with employees, and other direct interactions on our front lines. Operating aircraft requires harmony and cooperation across a variety of jobs. It is important for outside directors to observe a variety of departments, and this is a policy we believe should continue.
Mori It is also important to understand the front lines when discussing corporate strategy. Even a brief understanding of the front lines provides a greater understanding including the general circumstances when listening to the first draft of a proposed
perfect board of director effectiveness, it is important to maintain a willingness to reflect diverse opinions and different values across the Group.

It is extremely important to maintain a willingness to incorporate diverse opinions and different values across the Group (Mori)
Ito Moving forward, the board of directors will be required to play an even stronger role to further strengthen governance in support of corporate value growth. We have continued to provide materials and explanations to outside directors prior to board meetings, which has improved the function of these meetings. What is your impression, particularly as a participant who has served as an outside director for many years?
Mori When I first began serving as an outside director, the board of directors did not set aside much time to discuss any outside opinions offered. Board meetings were also very short at times. Today, meetings are completely different. I have opportuni- ties to participate in board meetings at other companies, and I think that the functions of the ANA HOLDINGS’ board are very substantial and that the board is steadily reaching higher levels of effectiveness. In particular, Chairman Ito and other participating members seem to be constantly looking for ways to improve board effectiveness. The support staff demonstrate through their efforts how serious they take this stance. The office sends
questionnaires to directors and conducts interviews to find sug- gestions for improvement. Staff make efforts to prepare concise meeting documents with supplementary materials for clearer understanding of the main points. More recently, corporate strat- egy discussions have been very informative, reflecting consider- able research into the operating environment. I appreciate the deep research into and summarization of information forming the basis of discussions.
Ito Active discussions are a welcome development; how- ever, some meetings have become rather long. I believe we still have room to improve our meeting management skills. Meanwhile, we have been receiving much valuable input from our outside directors, leading to more intense board meetings. I think our meetings reflect an even greater acknowledgment that we must raise the level of management transparency while approaching discussions from the standpoint of our stakehold- ers. In this sense, I think ANA HOLDINGS board of directors is making improvements in a very positive direction.
strategy. For example, when you watch a baseball game on TV, you might see the batter hit a ground ball to third, while the third baseman throws the batter out at first. The TV screen only shows the third baseman picking up a grounder and the first baseman catching the ball. However, people who have experienced watch- ing the game in person at the stadium have a different perspec- tive. They can imagine the second baseman and the right fielder sprinting to back up the play, even when those movements are never shown on TV. It’s a similar situation with the board of direc- tors. By knowing the front lines, we can imagine circumstances not fully communicated through documents and explanations.
 Learning the front lines provides a background for understanding beyond what is possible through documents and explanations (Mori)

3. Proper Governance in Businesses of a Highly Public Nature

We must provide greater visibility to management activities that prevent actions in violation of rules (Mori)
Ito We are an airline group functioning mainly in the Air Transportation Business. We must approach governance from the stance of a corporate group with highly public elements.
Mori The electric power business is another industry that places top priority on safety, including the safe operations of nuclear power plants. The Air Transportation Business is respon- sible for the safety of millions of people, and safety is properly viewed as management’s top priority. It is important to conduct management and governance that encourages all employees to have this same attitude toward safety.
Ito That’s exactly right. We conduct ongoing initiatives to ensure all group employees packed with awareness of our safety principle that states Safety is our promise to the public and is the foundation of our business. Last fiscal year, the board of directors spent quite a bit of time discussing the Boeing 787 engine issue, the alcohol-related issue among pilots, and others. Our outside directors made several pointed observations that I felt we should always keep foremost in mind.
Mori As I stated in one of the board meetings, rather than commanding employees to obey rules or threatening them with punishment, we must provide greater visibility to management activities that prevent actions in violation of rules. The Corporate Governance Code includes numerous matters related to safety. The current content of the code is designed to facilitate decisions by investors in Europe and the United States. Perhaps rather than responding to all matters in the same way, we should be distin- guishing which is an area of management focus and which is an area calling for explanation rather than compliance per se. This is the idea of Sampo Yoshi (good for everyone), or perhaps man- agement theory has always been a part of business in Japan. It should be enough to identify the truly important matters and to take committed action for achieving the ANA Group Mission Statement and Management Vision.
Ito The ANA Group is heavily end-service oriented, which means more than 80% of our employees work on the front lines. It’s important to have a solid understanding of on-site operations.
Mori That’s true. A capacity for understanding is important. Many can say they know, but the details change with the times. This is why understanding current operations is important, rather than relying on past knowledge and stating stubborn opinions based on outdated experience.
Ito Many women in the ANA Group work mainly as flight attendants. More recently, we are in an era where women are executive officers in charge of sales divisions at our Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya branches, for example. We are being chal- lenged to develop talented employees of all genders while maxi- mizing the advantages of front-line experience.
Mori Fortunately, the ANA Group is well known as a company that students aspire to join after graduation. We have the ground- work for attracting talented individuals. The next task is how to
cultivate them. I think promoting someone just because of their gender is insulting to the individual. What is important is that we offer an education and training system that supports the cultiva- tion of leaders regardless of gender and promotes the most talented and experienced professionals.
We must offer an education and training system that cultivates leaders regardless of gender and promotes the most talented and experienced professionals (Mori)
     ANA’s Way Survey Provides Stronger Communications between Management and Employees
Following the principles of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, we conduct a twice-yearly survey (ANA’s Way Survey) to determine whether ANA Group employees understand and comply with ANA’s Way, our group code of conduct. The results of this survey are reported to the board of directors who discuss ways to resolve the issues identified.
A total of 46 ANA Group companies participated in the fiscal 2018 survey, accounting for an employee response rate of 96.5%. The most recent survey indicated an emerging need for more active communi- cations between management and employees. In response, the Group has created opportunities for not only inside directors but also outside directors to interact directly with on-site personnel. We have also made efforts to promote mutual understanding between man- agement and employees.

  4. Cultivating Directors and Qualities of the Ideal Successor
 More than 80% of ANA Group employees work on the front lines; it’s important to have a solid understanding of on-site operations (Ito)
Ito With the recent revision to the Corporate Governance Code, many companies in Japan have started to discuss succes- sion plans and other matters. ANA HOLDINGS is not alone in the need to evolve our process to cultivate senior managers and senior manager candidates. What is your opinion about the quali- ties desired for future managers?
Mori The environment surrounding the air transportation industry changes with astonishing speed. The industry is
particularly susceptible to global events, which is why managers in this sector must not only have expertise in air transportation but also an understanding of general global economics and the ability to be flexible in adapting to change. This is why I believe candidates should experience a wide variety of business fields early in their careers. Still, a company cannot be built solely on the back of generalists. Companies need leaders with high levels of expertise who can hold a broad vision beyond their own fields of interest.

 Results of Value Creation
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
  Economic Conditions
General Economic Overview
The Japanese economy experienced a gradual recovery during fiscal 2018 (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019), supported by rising consumer spending in response to ongoing improvements in corporate earn- ings and employment. The airline industry enjoyed firm demand in general, mainly due to an ongoing gradual recovery in the Japanese and global economies and increasing number of inbound travelers to Japan.
The future economy is expected to experience a continued gradual recovery, supported by improving employment, rising income levels, and the positive impact of government policies. However, we must keep a careful eye on risks, including a potential overseas economic downturn, trade issues, and other factors that may have a negative impact on business.
Fuel Price Trends
The average price for Dubai crude oil was $69.4 per barrel during fiscal 2018. During the first half of the year, Dubai crude ranged around $70 per barrel, due to a number of factors including the decision to defer production increases among OPEC and major non-member state oil producers such as Russia, a firm recovery in demand for petroleum, and a cautious outlook with respect to geopolitical risk. While the market price for Dubai crude fell as low as $60 per barrel in the second half, prices rose to $66.9 per barrel by the end of fiscal 2018.
The market price of Singapore kerosene tracked the price of crude oil. The average price for the fiscal year was $82.2 per barrel, ending at $78.0 per barrel on March 31, 2019.
Foreign Exchange Market
The Japanese yen averaged ¥110.9 to the U.S. dollar for fiscal 2018, ending the year at ¥111.0 per U.S. dollar. The yen continued to weaken compared to the U.S. dollar throughout the first half of the fiscal year due to a spreading interest rate gap between the two countries stemming from steady interest-rate increases in the United States. The value of the yen rose slowly throughout the second half of the year in response to concerns about intensifying trade friction and the resulting impact on the global economy.
Air Transport Traffic Trends
International Air Transport Association (IATA) member airlines reported 1,810 million passengers on scheduled international flights in 2018 (7.0% increase year on year). Passengers on scheduled domestic flights numbered 2,560 million (6.8% increase). At the same time, scheduled global air cargo volume increased 2.9%. (Source: IATA World Air Transport Statistics, 2019).
In Japan, passengers on trunk routes* decreased 0.5% to 43.44 million for fiscal 2018. The number of passengers on local routes* increased 3.4% to 60.47 million. In total, Japanese air transport passengers numbered 103.9 million, an increase of 1.7%. Domestic cargo volume decreased 9.0% to 0.82 million tons. The number of passengers carried by Japanese airlines on international services increased 4.5% to 23.40 million, while the volume of international cargo handled by Japanese airlines decreased 18.0% to 1.44 million tons. (Source: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism preliminary report)
* Trunk routes refer to routes connecting Sapporo (New Chitose), Tokyo (Haneda), Tokyo (Narita), Osaka (Itami), Kansai, Fukuoka, and Okinawa (Naha) airports with one another. Local routes refer to all other routes.

Performance for Fiscal 2018
Overview of the ANA Group
As of March 31, 2019, the ANA Group (“the Group”), led by holding company ANA HOLDINGS INC., consists of 128 subsidiaries (includ- ing ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD.) and 44 affiliates. A total of 62 companies are treated as consolidated subsidiaries, with another 16 treated as equity-method subsidiaries and affiliates. The Group had 43,466 employees as of March 31, 2019, up 1,536 employees year on year.
During fiscal 2018, we executed the FY2018–22 ANA Group Corporate Strategy (published February 1, 2018), while asserting our fundamental dedication to safety. We focused on three major strategies during the year: (1) Expand airline revenue platform and pursue optimized portfolio; (2) Select and concentrate on existing business, create new business domains; and (3) Utilize open innovation and ICT. We pursued Safety, Quality and Services, while at the same time making forward progress in human resources and capital expenditures toward the 2020 slot expansions at Tokyo metropolitan area airports.
Segment Information
Consolidated Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses, and Operating Income
Fiscal 2018 operating revenues amounted to ¥2,058.3 billion, a ¥86.5 billion (4.4%) increase year on year. This increase was mainly due to positive trends in our mainstay Air Transportation Business, as well as increased revenues in Airline Related, Trade and Retail, and Others segments.
Operating expenses increased 4.8%, or ¥86.0 billion, to ¥1,893.2 billion. As we looked ahead to slot expansions at Tokyo metropolitan area airports, we gave priority to investments in safety, human resources, aircraft, and other equipment. At the same time, we engaged in a number of cost management measures.
As a result, operating income rose ¥0.5 billion (0.3%) compared to the prior fiscal year, reaching ¥165.0 billion.
Review by Segments
The Group operates four reportable segments: Air Transportation, Airline Related, Travel Services, and Trade and Retail.

ANA International Passenger Business
The ANA International Passenger Business outperformed prior fiscal year in both passenger numbers and revenues. Demand for business travel from Japan was strong throughout the year, while we also captured increased inbound demand.
A total of 10.09 million passengers used the ANA network in fiscal 2018 (3.6% increase), while unit price rose 5.3% to ¥64,556. Operating revenues rose 9.1% year on year to ¥651.5 billion. We recorded a 2.5% increase in available seat-kilometers (ASK) and saw an increase in revenue passenger-kilometers (RPK) of 3.3%. Load factor increased 0.6 points to 77.0%. ANA expanded its route network throughout fiscal 2018. In June, ANA added flights to the Haneda– Bangkok route (three flights per day total), while in October, we began a code-share flight with Alitalia. In February 2019, we intro- duced service to Vienna.
human resources in anticipation of slot expansion at Tokyo metropoli- tan area airports rose, we have engaged in steady cost management measures.
Results by business were as follows.
Supported by solid business conditions in Japan and overseas, business demand was firm throughout the year, allowing us to strengthen yield management. We captured demand for leisure travel both into and out of Japan through a variety of discount fares. We also bolstered promotional activities to encourage greater demand among inbound travelers.

tions and ticket sales up to 355 days prior to departure, and intro- duced other fare structure innovations. We launched a Let’s Go to Hokkaido project to support recovery in disaster areas and a promo- tional campaign for travel to Kansai International Airport for inbound tourists. These promotions and policies resulted in encouraging demand for travel both in Japan and overseas. ANA added many service improvements during the year. In April 2018, ANA introduced free on-board Wi-Fi and the adoption of more A321neo aircraft with monitor-equipped seats in all classes. We also renovated our domes- tic lounges at Itami, Fukuoka, and Naha airports.

 The ANA Domestic Passenger Business outperformed
year in both passenger numbers and revenues. Although we experi- enced the negative effects of several natural disasters and Rolls- Royce engine maintenance during the first half of the year, strong business demand and our capture of inbound travel, as well as fare discounts matched to demand, combined to drive performance in passenger numbers and revenues higher. ASK grew 0.1% year on year, while RPK rose 1.1%. Load factor was 69.6%, an increase of 0.7 points. Passenger numbers grew 0.4% to 44.32 million and unit price rose 0.6% to ¥15,716. Operating revenues were up 1.0% to ¥696.6 billion.
In fiscal 2018, ANA converted Chubu–Miyako and Fukuoka– Ishigaki routes from summer-only to full-year service, capturing

airline charters (cargo charter flights using aircraft owned by other companies), and other measures buoyed our results. Optimizing the scope of our Okinawa hub network beginning with the winter schedule and converting some routes to direct flights also helped improve profitability.
Domestic Cargo Business operating revenues decreased 10.6% to ¥27.4 billion, reflecting a 9.8% decline in cargo volume to 390,000 tons and a 0.8% drop in unit price. While we made efforts to grow revenues by setting non-scheduled extra cargo flights for the Okinawa–Haneda route during peak demand for flowers, air cargo demand overall was weak throughout the year. Also, we experienced

Operating Expenses
Air Transportation Business operating expenses increased ¥79.5 billion (5.1%) year on year to ¥1,653.8 billion. Specific expense amounts and reasons for year-on-year changes are described below.
<Aircraft Leasing Fees>
Aircraft leasing fees increased ¥12.9 billion (11.7%) year on year to ¥123.4 billion. This increase was mainly due to the use of airline charters for international cargo operations and an increase in leased aircraft in service from 86 at the end of the previous fiscal year to 97 as of March 31, 2019.
<Depreciation and Amortization>
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased ¥8.7 billion (6.0%) to ¥152.9 billion. This increase was mainly due to putting more Boeing 787-10 and Airbus A380 aircraft into service during the fiscal year as we continued to update the owned fleet.
<Aircraft Maintenance>
Aircraft maintenance expenses decreased ¥9.9 billion (5.9%) year on year to ¥157.0 billion. Although engine maintenance outsourcing and other expenses rose year on year, we did not incur expenses to participate in Maintenance Outsourcing Programs for which we recorded approximately ¥25 billion in the previous fiscal year.
<Personnel>
Personnel expenses increased ¥5.8 billion (2.9%) year on year to ¥207.8 billion. This increase reflected the impact of hiring more employees, particularly ahead of the 2020 slot expansion at Tokyo metropolitan area airports.
<Sales Commissions and Promotion>
Sales commissions and promotion expenses increased ¥5.1 billion (5.0%) year on year to ¥107.8 billion. This increase was mainly due to an increase in demand in our International Passenger Business and mileage program-related expenses.
<Contracts>
Contract expenses increased ¥15.9 billion (7.2%) year on year to ¥239.6 billion. This increase was mainly due to ASK / ATK capacity- related increases in operations outsourcing associated with the upcoming 2020 slot expansion at Tokyo metropolitan area airports.
<Others>
Others increased ¥8.5 billion (4.2%) year on year to ¥209.8 billion. This result was mainly due to increased expenses related to airport lounges and in-flight services.

 The LCC Business recorded ¥93.6 billion in operating revenues, a 6.9% increase year on year, supported by a 4.6% increase in passen- ger numbers at 8.15 million and a 2.3% increase in unit price to ¥11,482. ASK rose 1.9% and RPK rose 1.8%. Load factor was 86.2%, which was a 0.1-point decrease compared to the prior fiscal year. This performance was supported by our expansion of routes and capture of the active inbound demand.
Our domestic and international networks offered expanded service for our customers. Peach Aviation introduced service between Okinawa (Naha)–Kaohsiung (April) and Osaka (Kansai)–Kushiro (August). Vanilla Air launched Narita–Ishigaki and Okinawa (Naha)– Ishigaki routes (July), as well as more frequent flights between Okinawa (Naha) and Taipei (October).
Looking toward the upcoming merger, Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air worked to capture demand, including a special co-promotion, Peach and Vanilla are a Sweet Combination: Joint Discounts on All Routes.

  Fuel and fuel tax expenses amounted to ¥333.7 billion, a ¥33.0 billion (11.0%) increase year on year. This expense accounted for 20.2% of segment operating expenses, compared with 19.1% in the previous fiscal year. This ¥33.0 billion increase was mainly due to increases in ANA price factors (including hedging effectiveness) of approximately ¥30.0 billion, a decrease in ANA consumption volume factors of approximately ¥1.5 billion, and an increase in LCC Business of approximately ¥4.5 billion.
Fuel consumption volume increased due to the expansion of international services. The ANA Group is working to control fuel consumption volume increases by introducing fuel-efficient aircraft and other measures, including the adoption of efficient flight opera- tions. During fiscal 2018, we engaged in the same measures of fuel tax reduction as we followed in the previous fiscal year.
<Landing and Navigation Fees>
Landing and navigation fees amounted to ¥121.6 billion, down ¥0.8 billion (0.7%) year on year. Passenger aircraft flights (excluding Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air flights) on ANA domestic operations decreased 1.0%, while ANA international flights increased 0.8% and freighter flights decreased 14.5%. We also experienced the impact of natural disasters and planned flight cancellations due to Rolls-Royce engine maintenance.
 
 Results of Value Creation
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Airline Related Business
Fiscal 2018 segment operating revenues increased ¥6.7 billion (2.4%) year on year to ¥291.0 billion. Operating income increased ¥2.5 billion (23.9%) to ¥13.1 billion. These increases were mainly due to increased contracts for airport ground support work (check-in procedures, baggage handling, etc.) at Fukuoka Airport and other airports. We also saw an increase in contracts for in-flight meal- related services from overseas airlines.
Trade and Retail
Fiscal 2018 operating revenues in our Trade and Retail business increased ¥7.6 billion (5.3%) year on year to ¥150.6 billion. Operating income decreased ¥0.8 billion (17.8%) to ¥3.7 billion.
Operating revenues increased year on year at our airport ANA DUTY FREE SHOP retail locations, as we captured demand among inbound travelers. Transaction volume for perishable foods in our food business rose as well, contributing to this result. On the other hand, operating income was lower, mainly due to lower profits in our aerospace and electronics businesses, as well as in our lifestyle industries business.
Non-Operating Income / Expenses
Net non-operating expenses amounted to ¥10.9 billion for fiscal 2018 against net non-operating income of ¥32.1 billion in fiscal 2017. This result is due to the recording of special gains in the previous fiscal year for gains on step acquisition related to Peach Aviation, which was consolidated during fiscal 2017.
Cash Flows
Fundamental Approach
The ANA Group’s fundamental approach to cash management is to conduct continuous investments strategically to strengthen competi- tiveness over the medium and long term, while maintaining current financial soundness.
Capital expenditures are ordinarily kept within the scope of cash flows from operating activities, including repayment of lease obliga- tions, to generate free cash flow, which enables us to maintain a balance between total interest-bearing debt and shareholders’ equity.
The Group’s primary means of raising funds are borrowings from banks and bond issuances. The Group has also concluded commitment lines totaling ¥153.6 billion with major domestic financial institutions to ensure reliable access to working capital in case of emergency. Commitment lines were unused as of the end of March 2019.
The Group has access to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)’s guarantee system for investments in aircraft, our primary assets.
Overview of Fiscal 2018
Free cash flow resulted in expenditures of ¥12.5 billion (sum of cash flows from operating activities and investing activities). Net cash used in financing activities totaled ¥46.4 billion. As a result, cash and cash equivalents decreased ¥58.6 billion from the beginning of the fiscal year, amounting to ¥211.8 billion at the end of the fiscal year.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
After adjusting the ¥154.0 billion in income before income taxes for depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥296.1 billion, down ¥19.8 billion year on year. This result was mainly due to an increase in income tax payments.

     Travel Services fiscal 2018 operating revenues amounted to ¥150.7 billion, an ¥8.5 billion (5.4%) decrease year on year. Operating income decreased ¥3.1 billion (83.8%) to ¥0.6 billion, mainly due to increased costs stemming from upgrading travel systems. Domestic travel services operating revenues amounted to ¥119.3 billion, a ¥7.7 billion (6.1%) decrease year on year. While we recorded strong results stemming from demand for advanced purchased of Tabisaku dynamic packages, our ANA Sky Holiday product experienced weak sales due to natural disasters and struggled to attract customers in Okinawa.
Overseas travel services operating revenues decreased ¥0.6 billion (3.1%) to ¥20.9 billion. While guided tour products attracted customers effectively in Europe, our Tabisaku dynamic package struggled.
Inbound travel sales were strong in China and Korea. However, natural disasters and other factors resulted in weak customer attrac- tion. Accordingly, operating revenues included in other revenues declined slightly, amounting to ¥10.4 billion.

 Results of Value Creation
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥308.6 billion, down ¥15.8 billion year on year. This result was mainly due to payments for purchases of property and equipment related to payments upon delivery of aircraft, purchases of spare parts, and advance payments for aircraft to be put into service in the future. Payments were also made for intangible assets, including investments in software. Net cash used in investing activities amounted to ¥314.1 billion when excluding cash movements that resulted in net proceeds of ¥5.5 billion related to the acquisition and sale of time deposits and nego- tiable deposits of more than three months.
Free Cash Flow
As mentioned above, net cash provided by operating activities totaled ¥296.1 billion. Since net cash used in investing activities was ¥308.6 billion, free cash flow for fiscal 2018 amounted to a net expenditure of ¥12.5 billion, an increase of ¥4.0 billion compared to the previous fiscal year. Substantial free cash flow decreased ¥79.4 billion year on year to ¥18.0 billion when excluding cash movements associated with the acquisition and sale of time deposits and nego- tiable deposits of more than three months.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled ¥46.4 billion, up ¥16.4 billion year on year. This result was mainly due to funds raised from the issuance of bonds, etc., offset by dividend payments and loan repayments.

Capital Expenditures and Aircraft Procurement
Capital Expenditures
ANA Group capital expenditures are based on an approach of selection and concentration. We invest to strengthen safety, increase our competitiveness, and improve profitability. These expenditures primarily include the acquisition of aircraft, spare engines, and aircraft parts, as well as information systems and facilities expenditures. Among other investments during fiscal 2018, the ANA Group invested in aircraft for our Air Transportation Business and in the construction of ANA Blue Base, ANA Group training center. As a result, capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 amounted to ¥375.8 billion, an increase of 23.4% compared to the prior fiscal year.
By segment, Air Transportation Business capital expenditures increased 26.9% year on year to ¥370.7 billion. Airline Related expenditures decreased 84.0% to ¥1.8 billion, while Travel Services expenditures decreased 71.3% to ¥0.2 billion. Trade and Retail expenditures increased 15.1% to ¥1.1 billion, and Others expendi- tures decreased 32.9% to ¥0.2 billion.

Fundamental Approach to Aircraft Procurement
Aircraft are major investments used over the long term (10-plus years). Decisions regarding the selection of aircraft types suited to routes and networks and the pursuit of the best fleet composition are among the most important issues for airline management.
The ANA Group fleet strategy is based on three basic policies:
(1) Strengthening cost competitiveness by introducing fuel-efficient aircraft; (2) Optimizing supply to demand by increasing the ratios of narrow- and medium-body aircraft; and (3) Enhancing productivity by integrating aircraft types.
Fundamentally, the Group purchases and owns strategic aircraft we intend to use over the medium to long term. We employ operating leases to procure aircraft for use over the short term or for capacity adjustment. The Group may also utilize sale-leaseback transactions as a means to diversify corporate financing methods. In these and other ways, the Group selects the most economical aircraft procure- ment method.
Figures for Airbus A320-200s included 39 aircraft (all leased) operated by Peach Aviation Limited. and Vanilla Air Inc. (35 as of March 31, 2018). Separate from the figures above, as of March 31, 2019, 19 aircraft were leased outside the Group (18 as of March 31, 2018).
Aircraft Procurement Plan for Fiscal 2019
The ANA Group plans to add a total of 17 aircraft. We will expand our international business, including leisure travel demand, and optimize supply to demand in our domestic business as we shift to narrow- body aircraft. Our plans call for purchasing one Airbus A380-800, six Boeing 777-300s, two Boeing 777 freighters (for cargo flights), one
Boeing 787-10, five Boeing 787-9s, and two Airbus A320-200neos. Meanwhile, the Group plans to retire 18 aircraft, consisting of five Boeing 767-300s, three Boeing 767-300 freighters, five Boeing 737-500s, and five Airbus A320-200s.

 Results of Value Creation
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Financial Position
Assets
Total assets as of March 31, 2019 amounted to ¥2,687.1 billion, an increase of ¥124.6 billion compared to March 31, 2018.
Total current assets amounted to ¥700.2 billion as of March 31, 2019, down ¥23.2 billion from one year earlier. Cash and deposits amounted to ¥68.3 billion, a decrease of ¥9.7 billion compared to the end of the previous fiscal year. Marketable securities decreased ¥54.1 billion to ¥225.3 billion. As a result, liquidity on hand amounted to ¥293.6 billion, down ¥63.9 billion year on year.
Total non-current assets at the end of the fiscal year stood at ¥1,986.3 billion, up ¥147.9 billion from one year earlier. This increase was mainly due to an increase in property and equipment through the acquisition of aircraft and the purchase of investment securities.
Liabilities
Total liabilities as of March 31, 2019 amounted to ¥1,577.8 billion, up ¥15.8 billion compared to the end of the previous fiscal year.
Current liabilities totaled ¥685.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, an increase of ¥37.8 billion. This result was primarily due to an increase in advance ticket sales.
Long-term liabilities amounted to ¥891.8 billion as of March 31, 2019, a decrease of ¥21.9 billion compared to the end of the previ- ous fiscal year.
Interest-bearing debt, including finance lease obligations, decreased ¥9.7 billion year on year to ¥788.6 billion. This change was the result of Green Bond issuances which were more than offset in amount by a steady schedule of loan repayments. Debt/equity ratio decreased 0.1 points from March 31, 2018 to 0.7 times.

Retirement Benefit Obligations
The ANA Group defined benefit plans consist of welfare pension fund plans, defined benefit corporate pension plans, and lump-sum retirement benefit plans. In addition, the Group has adopted a defined contribution pension plan. Certain employees are entitled to additional benefits upon retirement.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries adopting defined-benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum retirement benefit plans use a simplified method for calculating retirement benefit expenses and liabilities.
Fuel Expense Sensitivity
ANA calculated fuel expense sensitivity to fluctuations in crude oil prices for fiscal 2019 (calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year, excluding hedging) as follows:
• Fuel expenses: Approximately ¥3.3 billion per year
(Change of $1/bbl of crude oil, ANA brand only)
Foreign Currency Cost Sensitivity
The Company and ANA calculated foreign currency cost sensitivity to foreign exchange market fluctuations for fiscal 2019 (calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year, excluding hedging*) as follows:
• Foreign currency costs: Approximately ¥5.0 billion per year
(Fluctuation of ¥1/U.S. dollar*, ANA brand only)
* Assumption: Calculation for foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar assume fluctua- tions similar to ¥1/U.S. dollar.
Allocation of Profits
Basic Policy on Allocation of Profits
Shareholder returns are an important management priority for the Group.
The Group strives to bolster shareholder returns while maintaining financial soundness. This goal will be accomplished as we secure the funds needed to conduct growth investments (aircraft, etc.) to support future business development. We examine the possibility of further shareholder returns through dividend increases and share buybacks on an ongoing basis, while considering the appropriate level for free cash flow.
Dividends for Fiscal 2018 and Plans for Fiscal 2019
The Group paid fiscal 2018 cash dividends of ¥75.0 per share, ¥5.0 higher than the initial plan and a ¥15.0 increase compared to the previous fiscal year. This dividend reflects due consideration of factors that include fiscal year earnings, financial condition, and future outlook of the business environment.
For fiscal 2019, the Group expects to pay cash dividends of ¥75.0 per share, level with fiscal 2018 dividends. This amount is based on our earnings forecast announced April 26, 2019.

The ANA Group pursues and conducts optimal hedge transactions that reduce the impact of volatility in fuel prices and foreign exchange rates to control the risk of fluctuations in earnings. The objective of this hedging is to both stabilize profitability and equalize expenses in response to rising fuel surcharges and foreign currency revenues associated with growth of the ANA international business.
The Group conducts fuel hedging (for ANA brands) three years in advance of the applicable period after considering fuel surcharge revenues. As of March 31, 2019, ANA had a hedge ratio of approxi- mately 30% for fiscal 2019, approximately 15% for fiscal 2020, and approximately 5% for fiscal 2021.
The Group hedges (for ANA HOLDINGS and ANA brands) U.S. dollar payments for fuel expenses three years in advance and U.S. dollar payments associated with capital expenditures for aircraft and other items five years in advance of the payment periods. Based on a balance of foreign currency revenues, revenues linked to foreign exchange market fluctuations, and foreign currency expenses with respect to U.S. dollar payments, the Group uses forward exchange agreements to hedge any portion of foreign currency expenses in excess of foreign currency revenues. As of March 31, 2019, the Company and ANA had a hedge ratio for U.S. dollar ordinary expen- ditures compared to overall foreign currency-denominated expendi- tures of approximately 20% for fiscal 2019, approximately 10% for fiscal 2020, and approximately 5% for fiscal 2021.

Operating Risks
The following risks could have a significant effect on the judgment of investors in the ANA Group, or “the Group.” Further, the forward-looking statements in the following section are the Group’s judgments as of March 31, 2019.
 116
117
(1) Risk of Economic Recession
The airline industry is susceptible to the effects of economic trends, and if the domestic or global economy is sluggish, this may cause decline of demand for air travel due to deterioration in personal consumption and corporate earnings.
International operations (passenger and cargo) depend on overseas markets, especially China, other parts of Asia, and North America, and economic conditions in these regions could lead to a decline in the passenger and cargo volume or a fall in the unit price.
(2) Risks Related to the Group’s Management Strategy
1. Risks Related to the Group’s Fleet Strategy
In the Air Transportation Business, the Group is pursuing a fleet strategy centered on introducing highly economical aircraft, inte- grating aircraft types, and better optimizing supply to demand. This strategy involves ordering aircraft from The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S., Bombardier Inc., and Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Delays in delivery from any of those four companies for financial or other reasons could create obstacles to the Group’s operations.
In addition, elements of the fleet strategy could prove
ineffective or their expected benefits could diminish significantly due to the factors given below.
1) Dependence on The Boeing Company
In accordance with the above fleet strategy, the Group has ordered a large number of aircraft from The Boeing Company (Boeing). Therefore, should financial or other issues render Boeing unable to fulfill its agreements with the Group or companies such as those that maintain Boeing products, the Group would be unable to acquire or maintain aircraft in accordance with its fleet strategy. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s operations.
2) Delay of Aircraft Development Plans by Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation
The Group has decided to introduce the Mitsubishi Space Jet (formerly MRJ) that Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation is developing, with delivery scheduled for midway through fiscal 2020. Delivery delays could create obstacles to the Group’s operations.
2. Risks Related to Airport Slots
The Group has made various investments and operational changes to take advantage of significant business opportunities created by the expansion of slots at Haneda and Narita airports. Around fiscal 2020, slots are expected to increase from 447,000 to 486,000 per year at Haneda Airport, and from 300,000 to 340,000 at Narita Airport. However, if the number or the timing of the slot allocation at the two Tokyo metropolitan area airports (Haneda and Narita) differs from the Group’s projections, it could affect achievement of the targets of the Group’s corporate strategy.
3. Risks Related to the LCC Business
In the LCC Business, the Group might not obtain the desired results from entering the LCC Business if it fails to achieve the objective of creating new passenger demand, or if competition intensifies with domestic or overseas LCCs. Additionally, flight crew shortages and outflows of flight crew personnel to other airlines could preclude the execution of the Group’s corporate strategy. Furthermore, custom- ers could turn away from LCCs as a result of accidents and other safety incidents caused by LCCs, including those overseas.
4. Risks Related to Investments
The Group may enter new businesses and invest in or acquire other companies to further expand its business in growth areas. These investments and other initiatives may not produce the intended effects. Moreover, if the interests of equity investors do not align, the joint venture may not operate in the manner the Group considers appropriate. If joint venture operations deteriorate, the Group may be exposed to an economic burden. In addition, equity investors other than the Group may experience poor financial results or withdraw from the business.
The Group may also expand into foreign countries, and enter into businesses with remote relation to the airline business. These initiatives may incur unforeseen detriments.
(3) Risks Related to Crude Oil Price Fluctuations
Jet fuel is a crude oil derivative and its price tracks the price of crude oil. Variance that exceeds the Group estimates for factors that affect the price of crude oil, including political instability in the oil-producing nations of the Middle East, the shale oil production structure in the U.S., increased demand for crude oil due to rapid economic growth in emerging countries, reductions in oil stockpiles or reserves, speculative investment in crude oil, and natural disas- ters can affect the Group’s performance as follows.
1. Risk of Increase in Crude Oil Prices
Generally, an increase in the price of crude oil causes an increase in the price of jet fuel, which imposes substantial additional costs on the Group. Accordingly, to control the risk of fluctuations in the price of jet fuel and to stabilize operating income, the Group hedges risks using crude oil and jet fuel commodity derivatives in planned, continuous hedging transactions for specific periods of time. In the event that crude oil prices rise over a short period, there are limitations to the Group’s ability to offset increases in crude oil prices through ongoing cost reductions as well as raising fares and charges. For these reasons, the Group may be unable to avoid the influence of a sharp increase in crude oil prices com- pletely, depending on factors such as hedging positions.
2. Risk of Sudden Decrease in Crude Oil Prices
The Group conducts hedge transactions against changes in the price of crude oil to mitigate risk. Therefore, a sudden decrease in oil prices may not directly contribute to earnings because, in addition to decreases in or expiration of fuel surcharges, hedge positions and other market conditions may preclude the immediate reflection of a sudden drop in fuel expenses in results.
(4) Risks Related to Pandemic Illnesses Including New Strains of Influenza
All of the Group’s businesses including but not limited to its interna- tional routes are exposed to the risk of a decline in demand due to the outbreak and spread of major illnesses including new strains of influenza. The spread of disease and the harm it may cause, including reduced desire to travel by air among customers due to rumors, could affect the Group’s performance by causing the number of passengers on the Group’s domestic and international routes to drop sharply.
Furthermore, more employees and contractors than expected could fall ill due to the spread of highly contagious new strains of influenza and other diseases, or due to increased virulence caused by changes in its profile, which could affect the continuity of the Group’s business.
(5) Risks Related to Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations
The Group’s expenditures in foreign currencies are greater than its revenues in foreign currencies. Therefore, depreciation of the yen affects the Group’s profits. Accordingly, to the greatest extent possible, foreign currency taken in as revenue is used to pay expenses denominated in the same foreign currency to minimize the impact on operating income from the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In addition, the Group uses forward exchange agreements and currency options for a portion of the foreign currency needed for its purchases of aircraft and jet fuel to stabilize payment amounts on a yen conversion basis. However, there are limits to the extent to which the Group can reduce and offset costs by adjusting fares and charges should costs increase due to the rapid depreciation of the yen in the foreign exchange market over a short period of time. Accordingly, such an occurrence could, depending on hedge positions and other factors, affect the Group’s profit and expenditures. Conversely, if the yen should appreciate rapidly in the foreign exchange market over a short period of time, depending upon hedge positions and other factors, this may preclude immediate reflection in lower fuel expenses and impact the Group’s ability to enjoy the full benefits of the apprecia- tion of the yen.
(6) Risks Related to the International Situation
The Group currently operates international routes, primarily to North America, Europe, China, and other parts of Asia. Going forward, incidents including political instability, international conflicts, large- scale terrorist attacks, or deterioration in diplomatic relations with countries where the Group operates and has offices and other bases could affect the Group’s performance due to the accompa- nying decrease in demand for travel on these international routes.
(7) Risks Related to Statutory Regulations
As an airline operator, the Group undertakes operations based on the stipulations of statutory regulations relating to airline operations. The Group is required to conduct passenger and cargo operations on international routes in accordance with the stipulations of international agreements, including treaties, bilateral agreements, and the decisions of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Group’s fares, airspace, operating schedule, and safety manage- ment are subject to a variety of constraints due to these regulations. Further, the Group’s operations are constrained by the Japanese Antitrust Law and similar laws and regulations in other countries with regard to the pricing of fares and charges.
(8) Risks Related to Litigation
The Group could be subject to various lawsuits in connection with its business activities, which could affect the Group’s performance. Company subsidiary ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. has been
investigated by the United States Department of Justice for sus- pected price adjustments related to international air cargo and passenger transport services. Upon overall consideration of various circumstances, the Company reached a plea bargain agreement. With respect to class action civil litigation related to international passenger transport services, the Company agreed in January, 2019 to settle under terms of a US$58 million payment. Accordingly, the Company recorded ¥6.4 billion in settlement payments for fiscal 2018, posted as litigation settlement fees related to anti-trust law claims under other expenses.
(9) Risks Related to Public-Sector Fees
Public-sector fees include jet fuel taxes, landing fees, and fees for the use of navigational facilities. The Japanese government is currently implementing temporary measures to reduce jet fuel taxes and landing fees but could scale back or terminate these measures in the future, which could affect the Group’s performance.

Operating Risks
(10) Risks Related to Environmental Regulations
In recent years, numerous Japanese and overseas statutory envi- ronmental protection regulations have been introduced or strength- ened with regard to such issues as noise, aircraft emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, use of environmentally polluting substances and their disposal, and energy use at major offices. Compliance with such statutory regulations imposes a considerable economic burden on the Group and business activities may be constrained or additional significant expenses incurred if new regulations are introduced, such as a globally shared environmental tax related to an international greenhouse gas emissions credit trading scheme planned for implementation toward 2021.
(11) Risks Related to the Business Environment of the Airline Industry
There could be material changes in the current competitive and business environment within Japan, such as changes in aviation policy or regional policy, as well as changes in the standing of competitors due to mergers or capital tie-ups stemming from bankruptcies and other factors. These changes could affect the Group’s performance.
(12) Risks Related to Competition
The possibility of future increases in costs related to the Group’s operations due to such factors as jet fuel expenses, financing cost, and responses to environmental regulations cannot be ruled out. If such costs increase, in order to secure income, it will be necessary for the Group to cut costs through such means as reducing indirect fixed costs, and to pass on costs through higher fares and charges. However, because the Group is in competition with other airlines and LCCs in Japan and overseas as well as with alternative modes of transportation, such as the Shinkansen, on certain routes, passing on costs could diminish competitiveness. Further, price competition with competitors greatly restricts the passing on of costs that could affect the Group’s performance.
(13) Risks Related to Ineffective Strategic Alliances
The Group belongs to the Star Alliance. Based on antitrust immunity (ATI) approval, joint venture operations are introduced in collabora- tion with United Airlines in the network between Asia and the United States, and with Lufthansa and Lufthansa group companies, Swiss International Air Lines, Austrian Airlines, and Lufthansa Cargo AG. in the network between Japan and Europe. The Group has also entered into individual agreements, mainly in Asia, that go beyond the frameworks of these alliances.
However, the benefits of Star Alliance membership might dimin- ish if the alliance is broken up by antitrust laws in various countries; an alliance partner withdraws from the Star Alliance or changes its business policies; another alliance group becomes more competi- tive; bilateral alliances between member companies end; an alliance partner performs poorly, restructures, or becomes less creditworthy; or restrictions on alliance activities are tightened due to external factors. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s performance.
(14) Risks Related to Flight Operations
1. Aircraft Accidents
An aircraft accident involving a flight operated by the Group or a code-share partner could cause a drop in customer confidence and impair the Group’s public reputation, creating a medium- to long- term downturn in demand that could significantly affect the Group’s performance.
Major accidents suffered by other airlines could similarly lead to a reduction in aviation demand that could affect the Group’s performance. An aircraft accident would give rise to significant expenses including compensation for damages and the repair or replacement of aircraft, but aviation insurance would not cover all such direct expenses.
2. Technical Circular Directives
If an issue arises that significantly compromises the safety of an aircraft, MLIT by law issues a technical circular directive. In some cases, all aircraft of the same model might be grounded until the measures to improve the airworthiness of the aircraft and equip- ment have been implemented as directed. Even when the law does not require a directive to be issued, in some cases when safety cannot be confirmed from a technical perspective, operation of the same model might be voluntarily suspended and inspections and other maintenance activities may be performed. The occurrence of such a situation could affect the Group’s safety credibility or performance.
An unanticipated flaw or technical issue with aircraft owned and operated by the Group could profoundly affect the Group’s performance.
(15) Risks Related to Unauthorized Disclosure of Customer Information and Other Data
The Group holds a large amount of information relating to customers, such as that pertaining to the approximately 34.59 million members (as of the end of March 2019) of the ANA Mileage Club. The Personal Information Protection Law of Japan and similar laws in countries overseas require proper management of such personal information. The Group has established a privacy policy, apprised customers of the Group’s stance regarding the handling of personal information, and established measures to counter any foreseeable contingency to ensure information security, including in its IT systems. In addition, work procedures and information systems are continuously moni- tored and revised to eliminate any potential security gaps. Despite these precautions, the occurrence of a major leak of personal information caused by unauthorized access, an error in conducting business, or some other factor could carry significant costs, in terms of both compensation and loss of public confidence, which could affect the Group’s performance.
(16) Risks Related to Disasters
The extended closure or operational restriction of airports or flight path restrictions due to disasters including an earthquake, a tsunami, a flood, a typhoon, heavy snow, a volcanic eruption, an infectious disease, a strike, or a riot could impact flight operations using affected airports and routes or result in significantly reduced demand for air transportation, which could affect the Group’s performance.
In particular, the Group’s data center is located in the Tokyo metropolitan area, while the operational control for all of the Group’s domestic and international flights is conducted at Haneda Airport and most of the Group’s passengers use Tokyo metropolitan area air- ports. As a result, a major disaster, such as an earthquake or a typhoon; a disaster at the abovementioned facilities, such as a fire; or a strike that closes the airports or limits their access could lead to a long-term shutdown of the Group’s information systems, operational control functions, or its operations themselves that could significantly affect the Group’s performance.
(17) Risks Related to Revenue and Expense Structure
Expenses that are largely unaffected by passenger load factors, including fixed costs such as aircraft expenses, along with fuel expenses and landing and navigation fees which are largely deter- mined by the type of aircraft, account for a significant proportion of the Group’s costs, which limits the Group’s ability to immediately change the scale of its operations in response to changes in economic conditions. Therefore, decreases in the number of passengers or volume of cargo could have a large impact on the Group’s revenue and expenses.
Moreover, a significant decrease in demand during the summer could affect the Group’s performance for that consolidated fiscal year because passenger service sales typically increase during summer.
(18) Risks Related to IT Systems
The Group is highly dependent on information systems for such critical functions as customer service and operational management. A major disruption of one of those systems or of telecommunications networks caused by natural disasters, accidents, computer viruses or unauthorized access, power supply constraints, large-scale power outages, or system failures or malfunctions would make it difficult to maintain customer service and operations and would result in a loss of public confidence, which could affect the Group’s performance. Further, the Group’s information systems are also used by its partner airlines so there is a possibility that the impact of systems failure would not be limited to the Group.
(19) Risks Related to Personnel and Labor
Many group employees belong to labor unions. Events including a collective strike by group employees could have an effect on the Group’s aircraft operation.
(20) Risk of Inability to Secure Required Personnel
The growth of our LCC Business and other factors have increased demand for flight crews and other personnel. A certain period of time is required to cultivate and train flight crews and other personnel. Inability to secure the required number of competent flight crews and other personnel in a timely manner could affect the Group’s perfor- mance. In addition, a change of the supply-demand balance, etc., in labor markets could lead to personnel shortages in airport handling and other operations, as well as a sharp increase in wage levels.
(21) Financial Risks
1. Increase in the Cost of Financing
The Group raises funds to acquire aircraft primarily through bank loans and bond issuances. However, the cost of financing could increase due to deteriorating conditions in the airline industry, turmoil in capital and financial markets, changes in the tax system or governmental financial policy, changes to the guarantee systems at governmental financial institutions, or a downgrade of the Company’s credit rating that makes it difficult or impossible to finance on terms advantageous to the Group. Such eventualities could affect the Group’s performance.
2. Risks Related to Asset Impairment or Other Issues
The Group owns extensive property and equipment as a function of its businesses. If the profitability of various operations deteriorates, or a decision is made to sell assets, the Group may be required to recognize asset impairment losses or loss on sales of property and equipment in the future.
(22) Risk of Inability to Secure Aircraft Fuel
The Group sees the slot expansions at Tokyo metropolitan area airports as a major business opportunity. As we plan for business growth, aircraft fuel consumption volume is expected to increase. If we are not able to secure appropriate volumes of aircraft fuel, this development could have an effect on Group aircraft operations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2019
 1.
Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifi- cations have been made in the consolidated financial statements of the previous fiscal year to conform to the classifications used in the current fiscal year.
Translation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen and, solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan, have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of ¥110.99 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2019. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the amounts shown could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate. Translations of U.S. dollars are rounded down to the nearest thousand and, therefore, the totals shown in tables do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts.
Summary of significant accounting policies
(a) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2019 include the accounts of the Company and its 62 (64 in 2018) significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”).
Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.
Investments in 16 (16 in 2018) unconsolidated subsidiaries and significant affiliates are accounted for by the equity method.
The difference between the cost and the underlying net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 10 to 15 years.
Investments in 94 (91 in 2018) subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Group is also eliminated.
Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made in consolidation.
(b) Foreign currency translation
All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differ- ences arising from the translation are included in the consolidated statement of income.
The balance sheet accounts of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments in net assets.
(c) Marketable securities and investment securities
Marketable securities and investment securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Under the accounting standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at cost, determined by the moving-average method. See Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” for additional information.
(d) Allowance for doubtful accounts
The allowance for doubtful accounts is stated in amounts considered to be appropriate based on the Group’s past credit loss experience and an evaluation of potential losses in the receivables outstanding.
(e) Inventories
Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries, and are stated at cost, principally determined by the moving-average method. The net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when their net realizable value is less than book value. See Note 5 “Inventories” and Note 22 “Supplementary information for the consolidated statement of income” for addi- tional information.
(f) Property and equipment (excluding leased assets)
Property and equipment, excluding leased assets, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on the estimated useful lives. Major assets are depreciated by the following method:
Buildings................................... Straight-line method Aircraft ...................................... Straight-line method
The Company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives for major property and equipment, based upon the Company’s estimate of durability:
Buildings................................... 3–50 years Aircraft ...................................... 9–20 years
Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor remodels and improvements, are charged to income as incurred.
The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assets of the Group are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets determined to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. See Note 21 “Impairment loss” for additional information.
(g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets)
Intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight- line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software.
(h) Retirement benefits
The retirement benefit plans of the Group cover substantially all employees other than directors and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the Company and subsidiaries.
The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments.
The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans.
The Company accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within net assets (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects, and are recognized in profit or loss over the average remaining service years of employees.
(i) Income taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences. See Note 10 “Income taxes” for additional information.
(j) Leases
Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of the contract as the useful life.

(k) Derivatives
The Group uses derivatives, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, and commodity options and swaps are to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Group does not use derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to income, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses.
(l) Revenue recognition
Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are provided.
(m) Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and exposed to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents include time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit, all of which mature or become due within three months of the date of acquisition.

(p) Unapplied new accounting standard
“Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 29 – March 30, 2018) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30 – March 30, 2018)
(1) Overview
The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new revenue standard, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, (International Financial Standard 15 (“IFRS 15”) and Accounting Standard Codification 606 (“Topic 606”) issued by IASB and FASB, respectively) on May 2014.
Against the background of the fact that IFRS 15 will be effective from periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be effec- tive from periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, the ASBJ issued ASBJ Statement No. 29, “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,” and ASBJ Guidance No. 30, “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition.” The core principle of the standard and guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The ASBJ’s primary policy for developing its accounting standard for revenue recognition was to include the basic principles of IFRS 15 for the purpose of comparability, between financial statements in accordance with Japanese GAAP and those in accordance with IFRS or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, for particular items for which industrial practice should be taken into consid- eration, alternative means are to be provided to the extent that comparability is maintained.
(2) Application date
The Company will apply the accounting standard and guidance for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2021, and is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard and guidance on its consolidated financial statements in future applicable periods.

(2) Method of determining the expected rate of return on plan assets
The expected rate of return on plan assets has been estimated based on the anticipated allocation to each plan asset class and the expected long-term returns on plan assets held in each category.

Income taxes
The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in a normal effective statutory tax rate of approximately 30.62% and 30.86% for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The Group files a tax return under the consolidated corporate-tax system, which allows companies to base tax payments on the combined profits or losses of the parent company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.
The tax effects of significant temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards which resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:
On February 16, 2018, the ASBJ issued ASBJ Statement No. 28, “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting,” which requires deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be classified as investments and other assets and long-term liabilities, respectively. Deferred tax assets were previously classified as current assets and investments and other assets, and deferred tax liabilities were previously classified as current liabilities and long-term liabilities under the previous accounting standard. The revised accounting standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2018. The Company retrospectively applied the revised accounting standard effective April 1, 2018, and deferred tax assets of ¥27,678 million which were previously classified as current assets as of March 31, 2018 have been reclassified as investments and other assets of ¥93,376 million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
 (h) Assumptions used for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are set forth as follows:
Discount rates
Expected rate of return on plan assets
(i) Defined contribution pension plans

The contributions to the defined contribution pension plans of the Company and certain subsidiaries were ¥4,423 million ($39,850 thousand) and ¥4,062 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Asset retirement obligations
(a) Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
(1) Overview of asset retirement obligations
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches, and certain other offices. As the Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations.
(2) Calculation of asset retirement obligations
The Group estimates the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculates the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%.

(b) Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
Changes in the valuation allowance were mainly deductions from deferred tax assets of Vanilla Air Inc. due to the integration of Peach Aviation Limited and Vanilla Air Inc., and an increase in loss on valuation of inventories.
A reconciliation of the difference between the normal effective statutory tax rate and the actual effective income tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:
     The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property, and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for land and office at airport facilities, including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport, and Naha Airport. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the above airports are considered to be critical infrastructure, it is beyond the control of the Company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities.

(a) Dividends
Under the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”), the appropriation of unappropriated retained earnings of the Company with respect to a financial period is made by resolution of the Company’s shareholders at a general meeting to be held subsequent to the close of the financial period and the accounts for that period do not therefore reflect such appropriation.

   Finance lease transactions are capitalized by recognizing lease assets and lease obligations in the consolidated balance sheet.
Tangible fixed lease assets include mainly aircraft, flight equipment, host computers and peripheral equipment. Intangible lease assets include software. The depreciation method for leased assets is described in Note 3 (j) “Leases.”
(*1) The total amount of dividends does not include ¥9 million ($81 thousand) in dividends to be paid to the subsidiaries and affiliates. This is because the shares held by subsidiaries and affiliates are recognized as treasury stock.
The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus, and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.

Financial instruments and related disclosures
Overview
(a) Group policy for financial instruments
The Group limits its fund management to short-term time deposits and raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions, including banks. The Group uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risks described below and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
(b) Types of financial instruments and related risk
Trade receivables (notes and accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers.
Marketable securities and investment securities are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed mainly of the shares of other companies with which the Group has business relationships.
Substantially all trade payables have payment due dates within one year.
Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments, and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term interest-bearing debt at variable rates, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as hedging instruments. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses.
For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from receivables and payables denominated in foreign curren- cies, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk of the commodity prices of fuel and to stabilize operating profit.
1) Management of credit risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers)
The Group manages its credit risk from receivables on the basis of internal guidelines, which include monitoring of payment term and balances of major customers by each business administration department to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage.
As for derivatives, the Group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with sound credit profiles.
2) Management of market risks (fluctuation risks of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates)
In order to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks, the Group principally utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks related to debt, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk related to commodity prices for fuel.
As for marketable securities and investment securities, the Group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment.
There are internal management regulations for derivative transactions which set forth transaction authority and limits on transaction amounts.
The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, the Group reports plans and results of methods and ratios for offsetting risks at the quarterly meetings of the Board of Directors.
3) Management of liquidity risks related to financing (risks that the Group cannot meet the due dates of payables)
The Group manages liquidity risks by establishing a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds that are necessary for the operation of the Group over a certain period of time, in accordance with the Group’s business operating plan and budget.
(c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value estimates. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives presented in Note 16 “Derivatives and hedging activities” are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions.

Estimated fair value of financial instruments
The carrying values of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, and their estimated fair values, are shown in the following tables. The following tables do not include financial instruments for which fair value cannot be reliably determined (Please refer to Note 2 below).
(c) Marketable securities and investment securities
The fair values of marketable and investment securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for the equity instru- ments, and at the quoted price obtained from financial institutions for certain debt instruments. The information on the fair values of marketable and investment securities by classification is included in Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” of the notes to the consoli- dated financial statements.
Liabilities
(a) Accounts payable
The carrying values of notes and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
(b) Short-term loans
The carrying values of short-term loans approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
(c) Bonds
The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is measured at the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined by taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk.
(d) Long-term loans
The fair values of long-term loans are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the debt at the Group’s assumed corporate borrowing rate.

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and jet fuel prices. In order to manage these risks, the Group utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the Group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to outstanding debt. In addition, the Group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to jet fuel prices. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The Group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transac- tions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, are generally monitored by management on a quarterly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically.
The Group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties in regard to derivative financial instruments; however, it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, as the majority of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions.
Summarized below are the notional amounts and estimated fair values of the derivative financial instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 for which hedged accounting has been applied.

The reportable segments of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource allocation and to assess performance.
The Group’s reportable segments are categorized under “Air Transportation,” “Airline Related,” “Travel Services,” and “Trade and Retail.”
The “Air Transportation” segment conducts domestic and international passenger operations, cargo and mail operations and other transporta- tion services. The “Airline Related” segment conducts air transportation-related operations, such as airport passenger and ground handling services and maintenance services. The “Travel Services” segment conducts operations centering on the development and sales of travel plans. It also conducts planning and sales of branded travel packages using air transportation. The “Trade and Retail” segment conducts mainly import and export operations of goods related to air transportation and is involved in in-store and non-store retailing.
(b) Methods of measurement for the amounts of sales, profit, assets, and other items for each reportable segment
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are substantially the same as those described in Note 3 “Summary of significant accounting policies.”
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating income or loss. Intersegment sales and transfers are based on current market prices.

Note: The Group grouped its operating assets for impairment testing based on management accounting categories, and also grouped lease assets, assets to be disposed of by sale and idle assets on an individual basis. Business assets in Miami, Florida were written-down to recoverable amounts, based on the updated business plan. As a result, an impairment loss of ¥1,997 million ($17,992 thousand) was recognized. Details are as follows: ¥1,433 million ($12,911 thousand) for machinery, ¥410 million ($3,694 thousand) for Intangible assets, ¥49 million ($441 thousand) for lease assets, and ¥103 million ($928 thousand) for other assets.
The recoverable amount of the above assets was measured at its net selling price as determined by estimates of selling cost and selling price.

The number of shares of the Company held by the Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 were 107 thousand and 114 thousand, respectively. The shares held by those trusts were deducted from the number of shares of common stock at the end of each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, which were used to determine net assets per share.
Supplementary cash flow information
A reconciliation of the difference between cash and deposits stated in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows is as follows:
Note: The Group grouped its operating assets for impairment testing based on management accounting categories, and also grouped lease assets, assets to be disposed of by sale and idle assets on an individual basis. Company housing in Osaka was written-down to recoverable amounts, since the assets were expected to be sold. As a result, an impairment loss of ¥2,232 million was recognized. Details are as follows: ¥1,192 million for land and ¥1,040 million for buildings and structures. Company housing in Chiba was written-down to recoverable amounts, since the assets were expected to be sold. As a result, an impairment loss of ¥2,144 million was recognized. Details are as follows: ¥1,883 million for land, ¥258 million for buildings and structures, and ¥3 million for tools, furniture and fixtures. Company housing in Kanagawa was written- down to recoverable amounts, since the assets were expected to be sold. As a result, an impairment loss of ¥1,319 million was recognized. Details are as follows: ¥907 million for land, ¥407 million for buildings and structures, and ¥5 million for tools, furniture and fixtures.
The recoverable amount of the above assets was measured at its net selling price as determined by estimates of selling cost and selling price.

Glossary
Passenger Business Terms
Available Seat-Kilometers (ASK)
A unit of passenger transport capacity, analogous to “production capacity.” Total number of seats x Transport distance (kilometers).
Revenue Passenger-Kilometers (RPK)
Total distance flown by revenue-paying passengers aboard aircraft. Revenue-paying passengers x Transport distance (kilometers).
Load Factor
Indicates the seat occupancy ratio (status of seat sales) as the ratio of revenue passenger- kilometers to available seat-kilometers. Revenue passenger-kilometers / Available seat-kilometers.
Yield
Unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer. Revenues / Revenue passenger-kilometers.
Unit Revenues
Quantitatively measures revenue management performance by showing unit revenues per available seat-kilometer (Revenues / Available seat-kilometers). Calculated as yield (Revenues / Revenue passenger-kilometers) x load factor (Revenue passenger-kilometers / Available seat-kilometers).
Unit Cost
Indicates cost per unit in the airline industry. Calculated as cost per available seat-kilometer.
Revenue Management
This management technique maximizes revenues by enabling the best mix of revenue- paying passengers through yield management that involves optimum seat sales in terms of optimum timing and price based on network and fare strategy.
Optimizing Supply to Demand
Involves flexibly controlling production capacity (available seat-kilometers) according to demand trends in ways such as increasing or decreasing the frequencies on routes and adjusting aircraft size.
Cargo Business Terms
Available Ton-Kilometers (ATK)
A unit of cargo transport capacity expressed as “production capacity.” Total cargo capacity (tons) x Transport distance (kilometers).
Revenue Ton-Kilometers (RTK)
Total distance carried by each revenue-paying cargo aboard aircraft. Revenue-paying cargo (tons) x Transport distance (kilometers).
Freighter
Dedicated cargo aircraft. Seats are removed from the cabin space where passengers would normally sit, and the space is filled with contain- ers or palletized cargo.
Belly
The space below the cabin on passenger aircraft that is used to transport cargo.
Okinawa Cargo Hub & Network
The ANA Group’s unique cargo network. With Okinawa (Naha) Airport as an international cargo hub, the network uses late-night connecting flights in a hub and spoke system servicing major Asian cities.
Airline Industry and Company Terms
IATA
The International Air Transport Association. Founded in 1945 by airlines operating flights primarily on international routes, functions include managing arrival and departure slots at airports and settling receivables and payables among airline companies. Approximately 290 airlines are IATA members.
ICAO
The International Civil Aviation Organization. A specialized agency of the United Nations created in 1944 to promote the safe and orderly develop- ment of international civil aviation. More than 190 countries are ICAO members.
Star Alliance
Established in 1997, Star Alliance was the first and is the world’s largest airline alliance. ANA became a member in October 1999. As of July 2019, 28 airlines from around the world are members.
Code-Sharing
A system in which airline alliance partners allow each other to add their own flight numbers on other partners’ scheduled flights. The frequent result is that multiple companies sell seats on one flight. Also known as jointly operated flights.
Antitrust Immunity (ATI)
Granting of advance approval for immunity from competition laws when airlines operating international routes cooperate on planning routes, setting fares, conducting marketing activities,
or other areas, so that the airlines are not in violation of the competition laws of such coun- tries. In Japan, the United States, and South Korea, the relevant department of transportation grants ATI based on an application (in countries other than these three, it is common for a bureau such as a fair trade commission to be in charge), but in the European Union the business itself performs a self-assessment based on the law. ATI approval is generally based on the two conditions that the parties do not have the power to control the market and approval will increase user convenience.
Joint Venture
A joint business in the international airline industry between two or more airlines. Restrictions such as bilateral air agreements between countries and caps on foreign capital investments still exist in the international airline industry. Therefore, airlines form ATI-based joint ventures, instead of the commonly known methods used in other industries such as capital tie-ups and M&As, etc. By forming joint ventures, airlines in the same global alliance are able to offer travelers a broader, more flexible network along with less expensive fares, thus strengthening their compet- itiveness against other alliances (or joint ventures).
Full Service Carrier (FSC)
An airline company that serves a wide range of markets based on a route network that includes code-sharing connecting demand. FSCs offer multiple classes of seats and provide in-flight food and beverages that are included in advance in the fare paid. FSCs are also called network carriers or legacy carriers when compared with low cost carriers (LCCs).
Low Cost Carrier (LCC)
An airline that provides air transportation services at low fares based on a low-cost system that includes using a single type of aircraft, charging for in-flight services, and simplifying sales. Fundamentally, LCCs operate frequent short- and medium-haul point-to-point flights (flights between two locations).
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul
(MRO) Business
A business that is contracted to provide aircraft maintenance services using its own maintenance crew and other personnel, along with dedicated facilities. Services include the maintenance, repair, and overhaul of aircraft and other equip- ment owned by airlines.
Dual Hub Network Strategy
A strategy for using the two largest airports in the Tokyo metropolitan area (Haneda and Narita) for different yet complementary strategic aims and functions. At Haneda, which offers excellent access from central Tokyo, the strategy targets overall air travel demand in the Tokyo metropoli- tan area, including the outskirts of Tokyo, as well as demand for connecting flights from various Japanese cities to international routes that harness ANA’s existing domestic network. Meanwhile, at Narita the strategy aims to capture transit demand for travel between third countries via Narita, focusing on Trans-Pacific travel between North America and Asia/China. This will be accomplished by upgrading and expanding the international network and enhancing connect- ing flights by setting efficient flight schedules.

Forward-Looking Statements
  Note: No specified wholly owned subsidiaries as of the end of the fiscal year under review.
This report contains statements based on the ANA Group’s current plans, estimates, strategies, and beliefs; all statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements represent the judgments and hypotheses of the Group’s management based on currently available information. Air Transportation Business, the Group’s core business, involves government-mandated costs that are beyond the Company’s control, such as airport utilization fees and fuel taxes.
In addition, conditions in the markets served by the ANA Group are subject to significant fluctuations. Factors that could affect actual results include, but are not limited to, economic trends, sharp changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and disasters.
Due to these risks and uncertainties, the Group’s future performance may differ significantly from the contents of this report. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the forward-looking statements in this report will prove to be accurate.

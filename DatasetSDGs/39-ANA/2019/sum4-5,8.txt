  Service Legacy of Diversity, Implementation of Barrier-Free Mindsets
 Basic Approach
As we approach the year 2020 and our customers continue to diversify globally, continuing to be chosen and trusted by customers will be crucial for the future of ANA Group growth. We believe our responsibility as a public transportation entity is to serve an inclusive society in which we can all move forward together. To create a sustainable society, the ANA Group respects the diversity of all customers. We will accelerate initiatives aimed at providing world-class inclusive and universal services.
Implementation Structure
We created a policy for inclusive and universal services to reflect our shared values. Under this policy, we carry out programs to improve our facilities and services.
We have implemented a range of initiatives to ensure that every employee embraces a barrier-free mindset in society and allow us to offer world-class inclusive and universal services. At the same time, we are working to create a framework that will allow our customers to use our services with peace of mind.
The ANA Group is working to foster people capable of leading the movement toward a barrier-free mindset within society.

Becoming an LGBT-Friendly Airline Group
Based on the April 2015 ANA Group Diversity and Inclusion Declaration, we work to deepen employee under- standing of LGBT issues, as well as endeavor to facilitate understanding and encourage an environment accepting of customer diversity and LGBT issues within our company. The ANA Group pursues initiatives toward an inclusive society, offering a comprehensive range of training and materials appropriate to LGBT issues for our employees. This training includes the ANA Group LGBT Booklet we distributed in June 2018.
The ANA Group was honored for the third successive year with the highest level of Gold in PRIDE Index 2018, an index that evaluates LGBT-related initiatives, by the volunteer work with Pride* organization.

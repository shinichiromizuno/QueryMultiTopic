Initiatives Toward an Integrated Society
In June 2019, we established ANA Blue Academy Tomoni- Tsukuru, a new education program for the next generation, targeting elementary and middle school students and their parents. In this program, which was jointly developed with the Japan Blind Football Association, employees of ANA Group companies and currently active blind football players serve as teachers. By experiencing blind football, participants learn how to consider other points of view when communicating and to understand the importance of empathy for their surroundings. These experiences help youth to think about an inclusive soci- ety in which it is easy for everyone to live together.
In fiscal 2019, we plan to expand this program to eight locations around Japan. The ANA Group supports the idea of connecting to tomorrow, one of the visions of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Through this program, we learn together with children, while creating the hopes and dreams of an interconnected world as defined in our mission statement and contributing to the achievement of the SDGs.

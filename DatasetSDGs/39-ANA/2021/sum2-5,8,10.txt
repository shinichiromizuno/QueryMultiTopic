After conducting training for all cabin attendants, we began a program in fiscal 2019 to report potential cases of human trafficking found in-flight to ground facilities.
In fiscal 2020, in collaboration with Narita International Airport Corporation, we worked with related organizations to hold an online seminar on the topic of human trafficking prevention.

  Basic Approach
The ANA Group has a wide range of business operations which involve various risks to human rights.
The ANA Group is committed to upholding human rights in accordance with the global standards provided in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In April 2016, we established the ANA Group Policy on Human
Rights. We based this policy on the International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two International Covenants), the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In fiscal 2020, we reviewed our existing procurement policy and formulated a new ANA Group Procurement Policy con- sisting of the Basic Procurement Policy and the Supplier Code of Conduct. We continue to encourage our contractors and suppliers to adopt similar policies.
We will continue human rights initiatives, recognizing that respect for human rights lies at the very foundations of the philoso- phy of the SDGs.
To comply with the anti-bribery laws of countries around the world, we have established the ANA Group Anti-Bribery Regulations which explains these regulations with specific examples. By distributing the ANA Group Anti-Bribery Handbook and conducting e-learning programs, we are working to educate our employees. In fiscal 2020, we conducted online seminars in China and e-learning in the United States.

In recent years, human rights issues, such as industrial accidents, have become increasingly serious in the globalized supply chains of companies. In addition to complying with the laws and regulations of each country, companies are required to respect the spirit of internationally recognized standards and principles to contribute to achieving a sustainable society.

As well as providing safe and secure services, the ANA Group will contribute to the creation of social value
through our procurement activities by taking initiative in considering local and global social and environmental issues.
As part of this effort, we have formulated the ANA Group Procurement Policy to promote more sustainable procurement activities throughout the supply chain. Particularly in terms of human rights and the environment, we now request more extensive and detailed information from suppliers compared to our previous ANA Group Purchasing Policy.Issuing the Human Rights ReportThe ANA Group issued our first Human Rights Report in Japan in fiscal 2018, aiming to promote communication with stakeholders through active dissemination of our initiatives to respect human rights. The Group has continued to issue these reports annually since then.

  1 Responsibility to Respect Human Rights
To ensure respect for human rights, in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2019 we conducted a review to identify potential risks to human rights related to business activities across the ANA Group and at all locations where we serve. We are working to prevent the occur- rence of risks with regard to the areas we have identified.
Supply Chain Management of In-Flight Meals
In fiscal 2017, the ANA Group became the first Japanese company to join the Bluenumber Initiative*2. We are in the process of registering information on producers and companies involved in in-flight meal ingredients to build a highly transparent food supply chain that includes respect for human rights and environmental conservation in the production process.
*2 The Bluenumber Initiative is a global program to establish food supply chain platforms by Bluenumber Foundation.

 Survey on Employment Conditions of Foreign
Workers in Japan
To quickly address not only potential but actual human rights risks of foreign workers, in fiscal 2020 we conducted a system-based review on the employment status of foreign workers in the ANA Group and major contractors. By using this summarized data going forward, we will strive to provide a suitable and comfortable work environment. In addition, with the cooperation of a third-party organization (Caux Round Table Japan*1), we have begun operating a grievance process system in accordance with global standards. Going forward, we will continue to work on improving the effectiveness of this system we have established.

In addition to sharing the ANA Group Procurement Policy and international standards on business and human rights with contractors and suppliers, we also provide web-based in-house e-learning programs to further promote understanding of ANA Group activities. We also work together with our business partners to ensure their workplace environments uphold respect for human rights.
Expert Review
Since fiscal 2016, the ANA Group has held regular annual discussions with international human rights experts to obtain advice on ANA Group initiatives to respect human rights. In October 2020, we invited three human rights experts from the Institute for Human Rights and Business*3 and World Benchmarking Alliance*4 to evaluate the progress of the initiatives set forth by the ANA Group given the advice received in fiscal 2019. The experts advised us on supply chain management methods and new human rights issues that we should be aware of in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

benchmark indicators to evaluate company contribution levels to a sustainable society.

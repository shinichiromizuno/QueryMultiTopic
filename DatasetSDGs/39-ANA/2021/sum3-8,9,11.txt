 To achieve one of our business innovation initiatives, we are providing services with avatar technology that connect users with people, goods, services, and places. From the comfort of their own home, users can see aquarium exhibits and shows, and enjoy shopping at their favorite stores.

   Basic Approach
Regional revitalization is an initiative to overcome the declin- ing population and shrinking regional economy, and to ensure that the region will grow in the future. In addition to air transportation, the ANA Group is developing businesses in many areas that contribute to the local communities, including hometown tax donations, cashless promotion proj- ects, digital advertising using ANA Mileage Club data, and resolving social issues through the newme avatar*1.
Future businesses will strengthen the relationships we have built with local communities through our airline and travel businesses, and work with local governments, NGOs, NPOs, along with a variety of local companies. These collaborations will address the concerns and issues of local communities, and utilize and apply the strengths and assets of the group while focusing on the promotion of tourism for the sustainable development of local communities. We will take on the chal- lenge of expanding the scope of problems to resolve.
*1 newme avatar: A new means of transportation developed by avatarin Inc, an ANA Holdings start-up that transports a person’s consciousness and presence without moving their body.

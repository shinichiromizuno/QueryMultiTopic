● Health management and mental health
Our company implements health exam-
inations and complete medical checkups once a year. In addi- tion, the supervisors of our offices with 50 employees or more acquire “health supervisor” certification and carry out checks regarding mental health.

Our company proactively works for the
hiring, and continuous employment of persons with disabili- ties, and we assign workplaces, work content, and so on taking into consideration the characteristics of each individual.

● Initiatives of K’s Career Staff
The K’ s Denki subsidiary K’s Career Staff engages in the tempo- rary-staffing business. Recently, there are many employees
who have a lot of physical strength for work and are highly motivated even at the age 65 and over. In order to make it possible for people to reapply the high-level skills that they have developed through their experience at K’s Denki, K’s Career Staff recruits general temporary workers, and proactively provides K’ s Denki employees who are age 65 and over with opportunities to once again actively participate in work activities.

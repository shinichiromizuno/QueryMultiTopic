  October
Some customers faced the problem of not being able to purchase consumer electronics because there were no consumer electronics mass retailer nearby. In order to provide support to such customers, we carried out sales using transport trucks in Rikuzentakata City and Minamisanriku-cho.We donated a complete set of consumer electronics that were needed at “Tenohira ni Taiyo no Ie,” a symbiosis house that supports children affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake.2012 to 2014
As part of our reconstruction-support activities targeting persons affected by the earthquake disaster, we implemented a “consultation service for problems regarding consumer electronics products” at temporary housing in various regions. From 2012 to 2014, we provided this consul- tation service 66 times (for 9,824 households). We provided advice on the use of consumer electronics products to affected persons, and, on a voluntary basis and as a store, we carried out inspections, cleaning, repairs, and so on regarding malfunctioning consumer electronics.

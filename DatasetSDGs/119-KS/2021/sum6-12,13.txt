● Four specified items
In accordance with the Home Appliance Recycling Act, when we receive the “four specified items” televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners from customers, we collect a recycling collection and transportation fee from the customers, and then take responsibility for appropriately handing over the items to manufacturers for recycling.

● Recycling of small-consumer electronics
In accordance with the Small-Home
Appliance Recycling Act, when we receive used waste consumer electronics from customers that are other than the “four specified items,” we collect a disposal fee from the customers and appropriately hand them over to a state-certified recycling business operator for recycling. Even though small-consumer electronics contain large amounts of rare metals such as gold, silver, and copper, most of the time only their iron and aluminum are recycled and they are disposed of in landfills. Thus, we support the recycling of small-consumer electronics in order to help reduce landfill shortages and achieve the steady supply of rare metals.

● Addressing problem of plastic garbage
We have been progressively switching our (fee-based) plastic-shopping bags to ones that are made from biomass. The problem of plastic garbage such as shopping bags is not only polluting ocean environments, but also causing global warming. In order to prevent environmental pollution and global warming, on July 1, 2020, we ended the free-of-charge provision of shopping bags (made of plastic), and started offering plastic-shopping bags to customers who need them for a fee.

● Collection of compact rechargeable batteries and button batteries
As an initiative to protect human health and the environment from mercury, we participate in the Battery Association of Japan as a collection-supporting establishment for the collection of button batteries that
Volume collected Number of stores contain trace amounts of mercury. Furthermore, based on the Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources, we carry out the collection of used compact rechargeable batteries. We have garnered praise for these initiatives, and have received commendations from JBRC for six consecutive years (starting in 2015).

● Collection of used cell phones
Our company collects used cell phones. Cell phones
contain large amounts of rare metals such as gold,
silver, and copper, so we promote collecting and recycling them in order to achieve the effective use of resources. Furthermore, as part of our measures for the protection of personal information, when collecting cell phones in person, we thoroughly check to make sure that there is no physical damage, the data has been erased, and so on.

● Collection of used ink cartridges
We support initiatives related to “Ecorica” recyclable ink cartridges in which ink cartridges that customers have finished using are collected, cleaned and refilled with ink at factories, and then once again sold as products at stores. Ecorica collection boxes are installed at our stores for this purpose.

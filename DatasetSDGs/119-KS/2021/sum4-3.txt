● Development of stores with few level differences
We believe that stores that make it possible to do
all shopping at a first-floor sales floor are ideal. We strive to avoid making customers use escalators to search for prod- ucts. Furthermore, we try to minimize level differences inside our stores in order to make shopping smoother for custom- ers using shopping cards, wheelchairs, and so on.

● Provision of wheelchairs
Near the entrances of our stores, we provide wheel- chairs that all customers can use.

● Provision of AED
We provide automated exter-nal defibrillators (AED) near the entrances of our stores. Our employees learn how to use these during their training on firefighting, etc.

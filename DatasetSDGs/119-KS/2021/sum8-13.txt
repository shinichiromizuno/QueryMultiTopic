‚óè Logistics integration and participation in White Logistics Movement
We have been working to achieve logistics integration through the joint operation of logistics with Nittsu NP Logistics. This involves consolidating products from manufacturers at a single location, dividing them for each store, and then delivering them to stores after loading them onto trucks. This is effective both for reducing costs and for reducing CO2 emissions. We also participate in the White Logistics Movement, and are aiming to further increase the efficiency of our logistics.

Enhancing Quality of Life
—Providing Products Required by Society—Climate Change Issues
Komatsu established the Komatsu Earth Environment Charter in 1992, launching proactive initia- tives for addressing climate change and other environmental issues a step ahead of its peers.
The enactment of the Paris Agreement in 2016 sparked a rapid rise in the importance of initia- tives for addressing climate change in the global society. As a global business operator, Komatsu recognizes that contributing to the transition to a low-carbon society is an important management issue in light of the increased frequency of abnormal climate events and natural disasters and changes in resource demand resulting from global warming.
In April 2019, Komatsu announced its endorsement of the recommendations of theTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).Through climate change risk and oppor- tunity assessments and scenario analyses based on these recommendations, we will pursue
increases our resilience toward climate change impacts. At the same time, we will advance climate change response mea- sures through a healthy dialogue with stakeholders. Furthermore, we will supply high-quality, high-performance products, services, and solutions that are designed for reducing environmental impacts, par- ticularly in relation to climate change, and for safety.

       VOICE
Komatsu’s mid-term management plan puts forth environmental impact reduction targets pertaining to cutting CO2 emissions, which contribute to mitigating climate change, and the increasing use of renewable energy. Approximately 90% of CO2 emissions from the lifecycles of Komatsu construction equipment, which span from production through to disposal, are attributable to the consumption of fuel during product use at active workplaces. Recognizing this fact, we are dedicated to lowering CO2 emissions from both production and product use.
Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from production include utilizing ICT to carefully track product manufacturing processes and all of the energy used therein and identifying where energy is wasted in these processes. We are addressing this waste through steadfast small reforms to remove each and every source of energy waste as well as large reforms that entail transforming the very way we do our work. By tracking metrics pertaining to factors such as plant air-conditioning, lighting, and machinery, we are endeavoring to eliminate wastes and switch to more efficient equipment. These energy conservation efforts are being complemented by the increased use of renewable energy. Specific renewable energy initiatives include electricity generation using solar power and thinned wood as well as air-conditioning systems that take advan- tage of differences in temperature between air and underground water.
To reduce CO2 emissions from product use, Komatsu is utilizing its pro- prietary technology development and production systems to improve effi- ciency with regard to engines and hydraulic, electronic, and other components. These efforts have led to the reduction of CO2 emissions through the introduction of the world’s first hybrid system for construction equipment. Through ongoing development and improvement measures driven by proprietary technologies, we seek to further reduce the CO2 emis- sions from Komatsu products. For example, we have been promoting the electrification of our products and have launched compact battery-powered forklifts and, more recently, electric mini excavators that do not emit CO2.
Our attempts to improve the fuel efficiency of our products are not lim- ited to performance enhancements to the products themselves; we are also utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technologies obtained through open innova- tion to reduce fuel consumption by tracking conditions across active work- places. For example, KOMTRAX includes a function that provides customers with operating status and fuel efficiency improvement recommendations to

encourage them to use their equipment more efficiently. Meanwhile, the SMARTCONSTRUCTION solution monitors conditions throughout construc- tion workplaces to propose more efficient construction methods and allows us to provide solutions for optimizing customer workplaces.
We are also pursuing CO2 reductions in the forest machine business, which has been identified as a core theme of the mid-term management plan. In this business, we see potential to cut emissions by delivering products with superior safety and productivity to realize recycling-oriented forestry, a woodland management approach entailing a cycle of planting, cultivating, and felling forests. Accordingly, as part of our social contribu- tion activities, we have been participating in forest restoration projects to greenify the sites of mines at which the excavation of underground miner- als has been completed.
Komatsu does not view climate change response measures exclu- sively in terms of the related risks. Rather, we see these measures as representing prime opportunities to create new businesses. For example, we could create businesses that enable us to improve the value of cus- tomer workplaces through the provision of solutions that take advantage of products and open innovation capitalizing on the strength of our ability to develop and produce key components in-house.

 Komatsu’s Business Model Komatsu’s Growth Strategies Resolution of ESG Issues Corporate Profile through Growth Strategies  TOPICS
 Afforestation Projects Advanced Worldwide
Surface mining operations are subject to rigorous regulation to protect the environment as they develop resources. The mine rehabilitation process, which includes filling mine sites and restoring them for use in agriculture or as forests, entails a great deal of effort within the confines of this regulatory framework.
However, even such effort does not guarantee that former mine sites can be revived as sustainable forests. If the revegeta- tion process fails, the nutrition will be lost from the top soil, due to its reduced water-holding capacity, and the mine site will decay further.
Komatsu believes that human intervention is needed to break this downward spiral and assist in the forest restoration pro- cess. In addition to helping forge relationships with our mining customers, these efforts utilize our construction equipment and forest machines, making them a social contribution activity that is highly compatible with Komatsu’s business.
  North America-Originating Forest Restoration Projects
Spreading across the Globe
Komatsu’s involvement in forest restoration projects can be traced back to projects launched in North America in April 2019. Through one of these projects, we are working to rehabilitate a mine site spanning 1,000 acres (4 square kilometers) in West Virginia over a period of three years. Komatsu provides monetary support, renting equipment, and dispatching employee volunteers for tree planting activities in this project (see KOMATSU REPORT 2019 for details). In FY2019, we planted 50,000 trees across a 93-acre (0.4 square kilometers) stretch of the former mine site.
In March 2020, another forest restoration project was launched in Australia through collaboration between major mineral resource company Anglo American PLC and Komatsu Australia Pty. Ltd. and Komatsu Mining Corp. The current goal of this project is to plant more than 9,000 trees at the former site of Anglo American’s Dawson Mine to restore the forest of this site using indigenous tree species and with an eye to converting parts of the site to farmland. At the kickoff event held in March 2020, a total of 120 people, including employees of the three companies, local residents, and elementary school students, gathered to plant 4,000 trees in a single day.

  In Europe, we have partnered with Belgium-based NPO Tree-Nation
ASBL, which specializes in afforestation, and we are conducting donation
campaigns to fund the afforestation activities this NPO is advancing on
five continents. A major characteristic of this initiative is that it allows
donators to check the progress in the tree planting activities they funded and confirm the resulting CO2 absorption volume via a smartphone application. European Komatsu Group companies are soliciting donations on various occasions via the efforts of employees as well as collaboration with partners to contribute to the restoration of forests.
Carbon Offset Initiatives
The forests to be restored through the on-schedule advancement of forest restoration projects in North America and Australia should absorb an estimated value of approximately 2,000 tons of CO2 each year. Komatsu anticipates that the spread of its forest restoration projects will have the positive benefit of mitigating climate change.

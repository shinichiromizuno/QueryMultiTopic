Background
Given the global trend of decarbonization aimed at a breakaway from reliance on fossil fuel, the Group positions “realization of decarbonized society” through the use of renewable energy as the most important issue.
Goals (commitments)
To hand down our precious global environment to future generations, we will strive in the Group-wide efforts to expand renewable energy procurement and maximize energy conservation, among other things, thus contributing to the realization of decarbonized society.
Targets/KPIs for FY2023
●40% cut in Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions (from FY2017, consolidated) ●Rate of renewable energy to electricity used in business activities: 40% ●Introduction of in-house power generation from renewable energy in
partnership with new electricity producers/suppliers
Major actions in FY2020
●18.7% cut in Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions (from FY2019, consolidated) ●Admitted to climate change “A List” of CDP 2020
●Joined “RE100”
●Rate of renewable energy up 10.3% through expanded switch to such
energy (up 6.3 percentage points from FY2019)
●Shinsaibashi PARCO store, 100% operated by renewable energy,
opened with a grand ceremony.
●Introduction of energy-saving & highly energy-efficient equipment,
expansion of EVs in fleet of company cars

Toward 100% renewable energy by 2050
The Group joined “RE100” (100% Renewable Energy)* in October 2020. We will seek to use renewable energy for 100% of our electricity consumed in business operations by 2050.
Shinsaibashi PARCO, which opened with a grand ceremony in November 2020, has switched 100% of electric power used at the entire store to renewable energy. The store depending on renewable energy for 100% of its power consumed is the first PARCO outlet to do so. Together with the adjacent Daimaru Shinsaibashi store, the PARCO outlet plays the role of a model ESG store of the Group.
Through these initiatives, the Group’s ratio of renewable energy in FY2020 stood at 10.3%, improving 6.3 percentage points from FY2019. In the future as well, we will go ahead with a gradual transition to renewable energy in a planned manner, focusing on Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores and Parco outlets.
* An international initiative seeking to source 100% of electricity consumption in business activities from renewable energy by 2050.

Initiatives for Scope 1 & 2 GHG emission cuts
The Group is a corporate group focused on retail, and much of its GHG emission volume stems from the use of electric power. Therefore, we place emphasis on the use of electricity, promoting initiatives to switch power, particularly electricity consumed at stores, to renewable energy.
At the same time, we are striving to reduce GHG emissions by thorough energy conservation through the replacement of illumination with LED lighting and by direct reduction in emissions through the replacement of company cars with EVs.
As a result, the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY2020 decreased 18.7% to 132,106 t-CO2 from FY2019. Compared with the SBT base year of FY2017, the Group achieved a 32.0% reduction, proceeding steadily toward the attainment of SBT.
The Group obtained a statement of third-party assurance from Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LRQA) for Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY2019.

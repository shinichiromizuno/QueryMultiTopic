Kanzawa Medical Research Foundation
Kanzawa Medical Research Foundation was established on June 27, 1997, on the basis of private assets offered by Kunio Kanzawa, then Chairman of Kissei Pharmaceutical, and funds provided by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., in commemoration of its 50th anniversary in business.
When the foundation was established, there was the expecta- tion that the drop in birthrate and growth in life expectancy at that time would result in a declining birthrate and aging society phenomenon and become an important socioeconomic issue in the near future. From a medical perspective, it was believed that a highly significant part of solving this problem was the mainte- nance and promotion of women’s health. Against this backdrop, the foundation promotes the development of healthcare and medical science by encouraging studies (hereinafter referred to as subjected studies) from various angles on the causes, preven- tion, diagnoses, and therapies, etc., of various diseases that occur in women of reproductive age with a focus on the perinatal period and elderly/senile women, thereby contributing to the enhancement of people’s health and welfare.

To achieve these goals, the foundation conducts the following
activities related to the above subjected studies:
(1) Research grants
(2) Overseas study grants
(3) Awards for excellent results-bearing research (Kanzawa Medical Award) (4) Organization of seminars on subjected studies
The total number of rewards and grants and the amount of money awarded to date (1997–2020) are shown in the following table.

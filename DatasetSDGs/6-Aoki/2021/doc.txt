 Growth Strategy
    Message from the President
We will continue to enrich people’s lives by engaging in businesses that are tailored to customer needs and social expectations.
President and Representative Director, AOKI Holdings Inc. Akihiro Aoki
business since our founding, we established a proprietary vertical merchandising (VMD) system that allows us to carry out integrated management of everything from product development to planning, production, and sales in house. By providing high-quality, reasonably priced suits at our stores across Japan, we became a pioneer in making it possible for businesspersons to own a variety of suits.
Thereafter, as people’s needs and values grew more diverse, we set forth the concept of enriching people’s lives based on our desire to enrich various aspects of our customers’ lives and serve all our stakeholders. Based on this concept, we have expanded our business fields by resolving social issues and enriching people’s lives. This includes our Anniversaire and Bridal Business, which introduced Japan’s first guest house-based weddings, and our Entertainment Business that provides places where a wider range of customers can find physical and mental relaxation.
The world is going through drastic changes right now. Changes in values related to consumption, products, and services and the pace of digitalization are accelerating. We consider these changes in the social environment to be opportunities. As such, we will continue to uphold and strengthen the unique DNA of taking on accepted ideas and pursuing new innovation that has been handed down since our founding as we work on resolving social issues and contributing more broadly to society.
Creating new value tailored to new lifestyles
In the fiscal year ended March 2021, restrictions on economic activity in Japan continued, and the situation remained harsh due to the impact of such factors as the declaration of a state of emergency in conjunction with the spread of COVID-19. The future remains unpredictable as it is still unclear when the pandemic will subside.
Under these circumstances, the AOKI Group worked on providing new products and services tailored to new lifestyles and reducing costs in each business. At
the same time, 71 new stores were opened, and 25 were closed in order to improve the efficiency of operations, primarily in the Entertainment Business, as had been decided at the beginning of the fiscal year. However, the impact of the pandemic was greater than anticipated. As a result, net sales fell to ¥143,169 million (down 20.6% year on year), and there was an operating loss of ¥5,793 million (as opposed to operating profit of ¥6,649 million one year earlier), an ordinary loss of ¥6,606 million (as opposed to ordinary profit of ¥5,501 million one year earlier), and a net loss attributable to owners of the parent of ¥11,931 million (as opposed to profit attributable to owners of the parent of ¥447 million one year earlier).
The situation is expected to remain uncertain, including how the virus spreads and when it may subside. We will continue to take action to address the pandemic while implementing various measures tailored to new lifestyles and working to create new value.
In the Fashion Business, we will focus on enhancing ongoing product planning, development, improvement, and digitalization in response to changes in business styles and lifestyles. In the Anniversaire and Bridal Business, we will develop and propose new wedding styles and continue to revise our cost structure. In the Entertainment Business, we will promote new utilization of our facilities by introducing various content and new services to expand our customer base and increase the frequency of use. In particular, with FiT24, we will work to expand our share by actively opening new stores in addition to differentiation, leveraging our unique strengths. Our aim is to secure profits in each business by implementing the various measures above, and in the fiscal year ending March 2022, we expect to record net sales of ¥169.3 billion and operating profit of ¥5.0 billion.
The AOKI Group will continue to maximize synergy between our businesses and pursue customer lifetime value to the fullest as we put the concept of enriching people’s lives into practice. Thank you for your continued support and patronage.
 DNA passed down since the Company’s founding
In the 1950s, when Japan’s economic growth began to take off, the price of a single suit was equivalent to the starting monthly salary of a university graduate. Needless to say, suits were not an easily affordable product. The AOKI Group was born in that era out of a desire to make it possible for businesspersons to afford
to own a variety of suits. Since that time, we have operated under a management philosophy that consists of the three elements of business integrity, social responsibility, and community service. Over the years, we have contributed to society by continually addressing customer requirements and the needs of the times.

    "Takeout Service" launched at AOKI and ORIHICA
This service offered by AOKI and ORIHICA allows customers to take product and coordination information home with them from the store and to make the purchase from anywhere after taking their time to look over everything.
When the customer scans the QR code provided by the staff at the store on their smartphone, they are taken directly to the takeout page and can make the purchase on the online store if they like the item(s). This improves convenience for the customer, and by allowing them to reconsider the product later, it makes a sale more likely for the store as well.

Journey and outlook of digitalization
In 2018, we introduced a marketing automation tool in our online store in the Fashion Business. This led to a higher percentage of repeat customers, prompting an acceleration of Group-wide efforts to promote digitalization. We have produced various results, including the Group Customer Integration and Information Utilization Project, which promotes referrals between Group companies, and fusion of online and offline activities such as appointments to visit stores, chat-based customer service, and remote customer service. Other results include inbound support in the Fashion Business and the introduction of marketing automation in the Bridal Business.
We are pursuing the provision of more seamless and comfortable service that creates a more unified feel for the AOKI Group with a target of 2025 so that we can continue to provide even more customer satisfaction.

 Initiatives in fiscal year ended March 31, 2021
In terms of products, we launched Pajamas Suit® and ACTIVE WORK SUIT® in response to new lifestyles, and a series of antibacterial/washable masks as a measure to prevent infection. We also introduced various new services in our online shop and worked to enhance our digital customer service. In terms of stores, we opened three new stores while closing 13 stores to improve operational efficiency. As a result, our new graduate product strategy did well in March, but due to people staying home, temporary closures and reduced operating hours at some stores, and other issues arising from the spread of COVID-19, net sales fell to ¥85,387 million (down 13.2% year on year) and operating profit to ¥1,499 million (down 48.1% year on year).
Measures for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
In addition to planning, developing, and improving essential items amid the pandemic such as masks, we will focus on planning, developing, and expanding our new Home & Work Style product line and our product line for working women. We will also develop products and services that are exclusive to our online shop. Moreover, we will work on revamping our network of stores by improving or closing unprofitable stores and improving store operations in order to increase operational efficiency. Including relocations, we plan to open three new stores.
  Characteristics of AOKI Characteristics of ORIHICA
  Cumulative sales of anti-microbial washable mask series surpass 12 million units
Mask wearing has become a new habit due to the spread of COVID-19. AOKI launched our anti-microbial washable masks in May 2020 when there was a shortage of masks nationwide. Later, we also launched masks with adjusters and cool masks that are comfortable even in the summer. By April 2021, cumulative sales had surpassed 12 million units. In addition, we donated 45,000 of these masks to those involved in sports for people with disabilities nationwide requiring masks.
Launch of sustainable dress shirts made with recycled fibers from plastic bottles
In recent years, environmentally conscious product development has grown in importance. Amid this environment, AOKI launched dress shirts made with recycled fibers primarily from used plastic bottles (Toray Industries, Inc.'s &+TM). We have considered environmental responsibility in everything from the material of the shirts to the buttons and the plastic packaging and bags that come with them. In addition, we sought to make these shirts high-performance, making them wrinkle resistant for easy care and giving them an anti-microbial deodorizing treatment.
  Business Overview
Fashion Business
We will continue to evolve the Life & Work Style business by adapting to new lifestyles.
Customer service The first apparel retailer to introduce a stylist system
AOKI established the stylist system in 2004. At stores, certified AOKI Customer Stylists offer customers ideas for apparel that best matches their preferences and lifestyles. Training gives stylists knowledge about fashion, styling, and communicating with customers.
Stores The nationwide network includes both suburban and stores in city centers
The AOKI strategy for opening stores draws on a powerful brand in the fashion market and knowledge gained from operating a growing network of stores. Currently, in addition to suburban locations, we are opening stores in city centers and near train stations, including shopping centers and malls, other buildings, and shopping streets. We are operating specialty stores for larger sizes both as stand-alone stores and within some AOKI stores.
Merchandise A large selection of products that encompass broad spectrum of customer needs
AOKI creates various products—from machine-washable suits to suits made with Japan’s top technologies and business casual style apparel—using a vertical merchandising system that allows integrated management from the conception of products to their sale.
Customer service Style Navigators make shopping more fun
At ORIHICA stores, customers are assisted by Style Navigators who offer ideas about new ways to enjoy different fashions. Their customer service experience is shared company-wide with employees at each store.
      Stores Numerous store formats that incorporate a London design theme
Different store types are used depending on the location and customer base. They include apartment-style stores, stores modeled after a high-end residence, and stores modeled after a Soho design studio, all of which are inspired by London—the birthplace of suits.

We proposed various styles of wedding, including chapel weddings, small weddings, and photo-only weddings tailored to new lifestyles. We also introduced a service allowing customers to manage the entire process up to the day before the wedding online, and closed our Toyosu location at the end of the contract. Despite implementing these various efforts and reducing costs, the number of couples holding weddings decreased substantially due to postponement of wedding ceremonies and receptions. As a result, net sales fell to ¥8,033 million (down 63.9% year on year), and there was an operating loss of ¥3,088 million (as opposed to operating profit of ¥439 million a year earlier).
Measures for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
We will continue to provide safe and secure weddings, including implementing a 100-item checklist to prevent the spread of infection and layouts that allow for social distancing, while developing and proposing new wedding styles. In addition, we will continue to review our cost structure as we reduce costs, maximize the effect of new sales promotion channels, and strengthen our marketing efforts.

 Initiatives in fiscal year ended March 31, 2021
In response to increased demand for telecommuting, KAIKATSU CLUB proposed new ways to utilize its locations, including the introduction of a free web camera rental service and new content. Additionally, COTE D’AZUR promoted use by providing other services in addition to karaoke, such as television and video watching, and FiT24 performed well leveraging its unique strengths. In terms of locations, we opened 68 new locations and closed 11 others. Despite these measures, due to people staying home, temporary closures and reduced operating hours at some stores, and other issues arising from the spread of COVID-19, net sales fell to ¥48,499 million (down 16.9% year on year) and the operating loss came to ¥5,190 million (as opposed to operating profit of ¥2,672 million a year earlier).
Measures for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
We will introduce various content and new services as we work to expand our customer base and increase the frequency of use. We will also expand our share of the market by becoming dominant in each area and increase efficiency by introducing self-service machines at front desks. In addition, we plan to open 33 new KAIKATSU CLUB locations and 60 FiT24 locations, including locations whose openings were postponed the previous fiscal year.

  ESG
                    Creating a better future for people and society
The AOKI Group has established a management philosophy based on the three pillars of business integrity, social responsibility,
and community service in order to create a better future
for people and society.
Through our business activities, we are promoting the creation of value shared with society and local communities so that we can realize a better, sustainable world. To that end, we are actively working on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and focusing on the issues set forth in the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).
Environment
The AOKI Group recognizes its relationship with the global environment as a priority issue.
We strive to create products, services, and commercial spaces with minimal environmental impact.
      What are SDGs?
SDGs is the abbreviation for "Sustainable Development Goals." These are goals to be achieved by 2030 that were adopted at the United Nations Summit in September 2015 and shared by international society for bringing about a better, sustainable world.
Reducing power consumption
Lighting accounts for the bulk of power consumption at locations. At the AOKI Group, we install LED lighting, which consumes less power than fluorescent lighting, when opening new locations or renovating existing ones.
We have been actively switching to LED lighting at existing locations as a measure to conserve electricity, especially since the Great East Japan Earthquake. Up to this point, we have completed the switch at all AOKI, ANNIVERSAIRE, KAIKATSU CLUB, COTE D’AZUR, and FiT24 locations as well as about 60% of our ORIHICA stores. As a result, we have reduced power consumption at each store in the Fashion Business by around 40% compared to fiscal 2009, thereby reducing the environmental impact of our stores.
Developing eco-friendly products
AOKI is focused on the development of eco-friendly products in order to reduce environmental impact.
For example, we have developed washable suits and other breathable “cool biz” business suits and dress shirts that provide comfort even in offices where air conditioning is used sparingly. We also offer suits, vests, and sweaters made with warm materials for “warm biz” that make it easy to adjust to different temperatures.
In addition, we are developing other eco-friendly products such as suits featuring polyester linings that come from recycled plastic bottles (Teijin Frontier Co., Ltd.'s ECOPETTM) and suits featuring linings with low environmental impact (Asahi Kasei Corp's BembergTM) as well as dress shirts made with recycled fibers from plastic bottles (Toray Industries, Inc.'s &+TM).
Trend in recycling rate
In 1996, we launched the world's first wool recycling project. In this project, customers trade in their used wool clothing, and our partner factories turn them into various recycled products.
Wool is biodegradable and fire-resistant to begin with, so ultimately, the recycled products also break down naturally. We bear some of the costs associated with transporting and processing the wool within the recycling process as part of our environmental conservation efforts.

ESG
           Social
As a public instrument of society, the AOKI Group contributes to social progress by building partnerships and relationships of trust in order to create happiness for all our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, investors, business partners, and employees.
 Dialogue with shareholders and investors
The AOKI Group is engaged in activities based on our investor relations policy to notify our shareholders and investors promptly and accurately of management policies, business strategies, business results, and financial information.
In the fiscal year ended March 2021, we held two performance briefings for institutional investors (by phone). We will continue to deepen dialogue through semiannual performance briefings and briefings for individual investors as well as communication of information via our website.
For customers
The AOKI Group improves product development and location environments by listening to feedback from customers at each location, taking note of valuable opinions received over the phone and by e-mail, collecting postcards from customers who purchase our products, and conducting customer research at locations, in order to deliver products and services that exceed our customers’ expectations. Our aim is to tie this into the creation of further customer happiness.
Ensuring customer satisfaction
As a fashion business, AOKI has established a customer hotline, which we use to develop high-quality products and stores by sharing the feedback and suggestions received with each department. Additionally, we have notebooks at each ORIHICA store in which staff members record the compliments given by customers and services that were positively received. The notes are shared between staff members, and the good examples are communicated to all stores.
In the Anniversaire and Bridal Business, we conduct bride and groom questionnaire surveys after the wedding. Customer feedback on the staff’s service, products, facilities, and other aspects of the event is shared company-wide and used in daily improvement activities.
In the Entertainment Business, officers and other staff from headquarters gather information on customer complaints and requests through regular visits to business locations in which they talk to customers directly in an effort to improve our services.
Briefing session for individual investors
Ensuring reliable quality and service
We are working to enhance education on product quality in the Fashion Business, including promoting Textiles Evaluation Specialist certification, and seeking to continually manage and improve quality by enlisting the support of our Quality Control Department and outside agencies. We also inspect products after they are delivered to our distribution centers based on our in-house inspection standards.
In the Anniversaire and Bridal Business, we came in second place in the Young Professionals category of the HRS Service Competition 2021. This competition is held by the Japan Hotel and Restaurant Service Development Association for professional service people who represent the next generation for the purpose of increasing awareness of skills and service. Through active participation in competitions, we are seeking to improve the hospitality skills of our staff.
HRS Service Competition 2021
With trading partners
We believe that it is important to develop cooperative relationships with our business partners in order to deliver valuable products and services to our customers.
For that reason, in the Fashion Business, we hold quality improvement meetings with our suppliers to share customer feedback and get them involved in product development.
For employees
At the AOKI Group, we believe it is important to create happiness not only for our customers but also for everyone who works in the Group. We promote various initiatives for such objectives as diversity and work-life balance, including the introduction of the Shift Gears Program allowing employees to change their work style according to their life stage, in order to create an environment in which each employee can thrive and demonstrate their unique talents, thereby improving the experience of our customers.
With local communities
One of the pillars of our management philosophy is pursuing community service. We believe that it is important to contribute to society in non-commercial ways as well. As such, we promote cultural activities in local communities and engage in such efforts as sports sponsorship and next-generation training.
Sports sponsorship
We have sponsored the Nagano Marathon ever since it was started in 1999. The marathon carries on the principles of the Nagano Winter Olympics, which were held in 1998 in Nagano Prefecture where the AOKI Group was founded.
We also contribute to the promotion of sports through uniform sponsorship, including support for student sports and providing suits and polo shirts when KAWASAKI FRONTALE travels.
AOKI Group Harmony Concert
In order to contribute to the local communities where we do business, the AOKI Group has been holding the AOKI Group Harmony Concert as part of our cultural promotion activities. It was started in 1973, and in January 2020, it was held for the 22nd time.

ESG
  Governance
We are reinforcing the functions of the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors and coordination with the Internal Auditing Office, each committee, legal advisors, and the accounting auditor in pursuit of improving legal compliance and the transparency and efficiency of management in order to establish a healthy corporate governance structure.
     Basic Approach
The AOKI Group Philosophy is based on the three pillars of business integrity, social responsibility, and community service. We recognize the importance of corporate governance in pursuing this philosophy and increasing medium- to long-term corporate value. Our basic approach is to strengthen the administrative organization to increase the transparency and fairness of management and put sound and efficient management into practice.
For that reason, we are also working to further enhance corporate governance by improving the internal control system, which
Corporate Governance Structure
We are a company with a board of auditors. To ensure objectivity and neutrality, we elect auditors who are thoroughly familiar with finance and accounting as certified public accountants/certified tax accountants and experienced external auditors. We have adopted a system wherein they supervise the Board of Directors and manage legal compliance and risk by coordinating with the Internal Auditing Office, each committee, legal advisors, and the accounting auditor. Additionally, they supervise the execution of the directors’ duties, with one standing auditor attending important meetings.
The Board of Directors is comprised of 14 directors, including three external directors. They have monthly and extraordinary meetings,
includes reviewing the organization and reinforcing the risk management structure, as well as by engaging in appropriate information disclosure, ensuring the rights of shareholders, engaging in dialogue with shareholders, and appropriately cooperating with other stakeholders.
By increasing corporate value through the pursuit of the three pillars of the AOKI Group Philosophy, we will meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders.
while the Executive Committee, which includes presidents of subsidiaries and standing auditors, meets monthly. They decide important matters, report on management issues, and exchange information. We have also introduced an executive officer system to expedite management decision-making.
In April 2019, we established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee to further increase the fairness and transparency of officer elections and determination of officer remuneration. The committee is chaired by an external director, and it consists of five members, including external directors, external auditors, and two directors.
The Compliance Committee reviews compliance-related issues, while a legal consultation is held monthly to discuss individual matters with legal advisors. Furthermore, rules and manuals are prepared as necessary to strengthen the Group’s internal control system, and workshops and other training sessions are held for
External Director/Auditor Support Structure
Auditors may give orders to employees of the Administrative Office on important matters related to audit operations as necessary. Additionally, the external director who is a certified public accountant takes advantage of his specialist knowledge and many years of experience to provide advice, share opinions, and gather information at meetings of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee as well as weekly group report meetings attended by presidents of subsidiaries and other important meetings. The other external director and an external auditor are directly provided with explanations of important agenda items prior to meetings of the Board of Directors and otherwise kept up to date.

We have established a comprehensive education system to develop professional human resources that pursue customer satisfaction, operating income, and social contribution. By giving them experience with the diverse businesses of fashion, bridal, and entertainment, we develop human resources that have a multifaceted way of looking at things and are capable of thinking outside the box. 
Our third strength is store development and operations. The AOKI Group has a combined total of more than 1,200 stores across Japan. Effective utilization of our chain store know-how related to new store development and operational data in each business allows us to achieve efficient store operations, including format changes within the Group. In 2019, we launched our Real Estate Leasing Business and are working to streamline overall Group management by boosting rent of mainly closed stores in the Fashion Business and closed COTE D’AZUR karaoke facilities. 
Our fourth strength is our broad customer base. We enjoy solid brand loyalty cultivated over our more than 60-year history and have a wide range of customers acquired through our three different businesses. In order to more effectively utilize this customer base, we switched to a Group-wide system of integrated management of customer data that had heretofore been managed separately according to business format. Membership perks to be based on the total amount of usage across Group companies, and mutual use of points and exchanging for prizes is already possible in the Fashion Business. We have prepared an environment that allows customers of each business format to make wide use of AOKI Group services. 
Focus on streamlining of management utilizing Group synergy 
In the fiscal year ended March 2020, the Japanese economy continued to show signs of improvement in 
corporate earnings and the employment situation, but economic stagnation was growing as a result of the consumption tax hike when the global spread of COVID-19 hit and caused rapid deceleration of the economy, bringing about a harsh economic climate. 
Under this environment, the AOKI Group continues to prioritize ensuring the safety and health of our customers, trading partners, local communities, and our employees and their families as well as preventing the spread of the virus while engaging in efforts to ensure business continuity in light of the ever-changing circumstances. 
In the Entertainment Business, we aggressively opened a combined total of 113 KAIKATSU CLUB and FiT24 locations. On the other hand, in the Fashion Business, we reviewed the profitability of individual stores and our dominant areas. A total of 67 stores were closed, some of which were relocated to improve operational efficiency and others of which were converted into KAIKATSU CLUB locations. 
Moreover, we implemented various measures in each business to address the changing times and diversification of customer needs and actively worked to revitalize existing stores. The Entertainment Business performed well as a result. Nevertheless, net sales dropped to ¥180,220 million (down 7.6% year on year), operating profit to ¥6,649 million (down 50.7%), and ordinary profit to ¥5,501 million (down 53.7%) due to a warm winter and changes in business style in the Fashion Business as well as the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each of our businesses starting in late February. 
In regard to the outlook for the future, it is difficult at this time to reasonably calculate the timing of when the spread of COVID-19 will slow, when economic activity will return to pre-COVID-19 levels, the impact on the Group’s net sales, and other factors, so our full-year consolidated earnings forecasts for the fiscal year ending March 2021 are to be determined. We will publish the earnings forecasts on our website (https://www.aoki-hd.co.jp/en/) as soon as it is possible to disclose them. 
Thank you for your continued support and patronage. 
Pursuing further innovation by enhancing our four strengths 
The AOKI Group has four strengths that have been cultivated since our founding. The first of these is planning and development of products and services. For more than 60 years, we have worked on planning and developing products in the business fashion field that 
reflect the wants and needs of our customers, accumulating an abundance of knowledge, information, technology, and know-how along the way. We have also produced many results in our development of new services, including the establishment of new sales methods. Moreover, we have rolled out the know-how that we have cultivated in the Fashion Business to the Bridal and Entertainment businesses as well and have

Carrying out business integration in anticipation of the future 
In anticipation of the future potential of the Café Complex Operations Business and the Karaoke Facility Operations Business, the businesses were combined and renamed the Entertainment Business in the fiscal year ended March 2020. Over the past 10 years, the number of locations in the Entertainment Business has increased by about 350, and by the fiscal year ending March 2021, the number of locations will have exceeded that of the Fashion Business. In order to maintain and build on this rate of business growth, we will continue opening facilities and promote the securing of outstanding human resources, greater efficiency in facility operations, and improved business operations in the aim of further evolution of our business formats. 
Sharp increase in telecommuting/ shared office demand 
          
Supervision, management, and strategy formulation 
Demand for telecommuting and shared offices has increased due to the spread of COVID-19. KAIKATSU CLUB, which provides sharing spaces, is promoting use of the spaces for business needs as well, including work, learning, online meetings, and online interviews, by renting out web cameras and other such means. Various measures have been taken to ensure safe and secure use, including ventilation using a patented air ventilation system, partitions to prevent contact between those next to each other, and the introduction of an automated entry/exit system.

Launching the “#will fun” project 
Ensuring a happy wedding ceremony for the bride and groom 
Some customers are considering postponing their weddings due to the spread of COVID-19. Anniversaire has launched a project called “#will fun” in response. Various experimental offerings have been developed, including online and telephone consultations allowing customers to engage in wedding preparations and consultations at home, a limited-time-only “YELL Plan” for smaller weddings offered out of a desire for people not to give up on their wedding plans, and a limited number of handmade flower kits and original puzzles that can be made at home and used to decorate the venue on the day of the wedding.

Rolling out new styles addressing needs 
More comfortable, less constrained business settings 
As workplace dress codes are liberalized and telecommuting becomes more common, more people are having troubles such as figuring out what to wear to work. In response, AOKI is rolling out “New Biz Style” according to changes in business dress codes and mix-and-match set-up suits perfect for working women. Rather than simply being worn as a suit, the jacket and pants can be paired with other items to create a mature wardrobe that can be worn not only to work as usual but also in private life.

Enhancing the link between e-commerce and physical stores 
As the number of users of AOKI and ORIHICA online shops increases, customer demand for checking sizes and the feel of the material and seeing different options for how suits can be coordinated has also increased. 
In response, we have launched a reservation service that allows customers to reserve products selected on the online shop at their nearest physical store as well as a “STAFF START” service where staff post their coordinated outfits on the official online shop, social media, and other platforms. These new services that bring together e-commerce and physical stores have been well-received by our customers.

Celebrating together with remote guests 
Many customers have asked us how they should hold their wedding, expressing concerns about inviting people that live far away and elderly guests or not being able to change the date of their wedding due to being pregnant. In response, we have launched online weddings that allow guests to participate in the wedding from home. It is a new wedding style that brings together offline and online services and allows remote guests to watch the ceremony taking place at the chapel live and enjoy conversation with the bride and groom as well as other guests.

Initiatives in fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 
In terms of products, we proposed "New Biz Style" for both men's and women's products corresponding to changes in business apparel styles. In terms of stores, we opened eight new stores while closing 67 stores, including relocations and format changes to KAIKATSU CLUB and other formats, after the review of individual store profitability and dominant areas to improve operational efficiency. 
However, in addition to weather factors, changes in business apparel styles, and the impact of the consumption tax hike, the number of customers greatly decreased from late February to March, our biggest sales period of the year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, net sales came in at ¥98,352 million (down 14.0% year on year) and operating profit at ¥2,886 million (down 60.3%). 
Measures for fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 
In addition to enhancing our set-up suits addressing changes in business styles such as telecommuting, and our product lineup for working women, we will strengthen coordination between physical stores and e-commerce to make it easier for customers to purchase products via either channel. We will also develop and sell products necessary for new lifestyles, including antibacterial/washable masks. Furthermore, we will reduce and streamline costs, focusing on advertising expenses, rent, and personnel expenses, and implement measures to optimize inventory. 
Brand Characteristics: AOKI Brand Characteristics: ORIHICA 

Launch of antibacterial/ washable masks and double antibacterial/ washable cool masks 
In response to increasing demand for cloth masks as a result of extension of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, AOKI and ORIHICA have begun selling masks. One is an antibacterial/washable mask made with a three-layered, soft and stretchable jersey fabric, and the other is 
a UV protection double antibacterial/washable cool mask with better breathability. Through the end of July 2020, we sold a cumulative total of more than 4 million masks. 

Sales of Super Non-Iron Shirt surpass the one million mark 
ORIHICA launched the Super Non-Iron Shirt in response to customer demand for reducing the household work load, including reduced time and effort required for washing and prevention of staining so that the clothing will last longer. These shirts were well-received for their superior shape-holding performance and how they do not need to be ironed after washing despite being “smart silhouette” dress shirts. Since its launch in March 2016, total sales up to January 2020 had amounted to more than one million. 

Business Overview 
Fashion Business 
We will revitalize existing stores, addressing changes in business styles and lifestyles. 
Customer service The first apparel retailer to introduce a stylist system 
AOKI established the stylist system in 2004. At stores, certified AOKI Customer Stylists offer customers ideas for apparel that best matches their preferences and lifestyles. Training gives stylists knowledge about fashion, styling, and communicating with customers. 
Stores The nationwide network includes both suburban stores and stores in city centers 
The AOKI strategy for opening stores draws on a powerful brand in the fashion market and knowledge gained from operating a growing network of stores. Currently, in addition to suburban locations, we are opening stores in city centers and near train stations, including shopping centers and malls, other buildings, and shopping streets. We are operating specialty stores for larger sizes both as stand-alone stores and within some AOKI stores. 
Merchandise A large selection of products that encompass broad spectrum of customer needs 
AOKI creates various products—from machine-washable suits to suits made with Japan’s top technologies and business casual style apparel—using a vertical merchandising system that extends from the conception of products to their sale. 
Customer service Style Navigators make shopping more fun 
At ORIHICA stores, customers are assisted by Style Navigators who offer ideas about new ways to enjoy different fashions. Their customer service experience is shared company-wide with employees at each store. 
    
Stores Numerous store formats that incorporate a London design theme 
Different store types are used depending on the location and customer base. They include apartment-style stores, stores modeled after a high-end residence, and stores modeled after a Soho design studio, all of which are inspired by London—the birthplace of suits.

Merchandise A wide ranging product lineup including business casual style 
ORIHICA was created in Omotesando, a district of Tokyo that is shaped by fashion ideas and trends from around the world. The brand includes business apparel, casual clothing, and women’s fashions. Lead by a British creative director, the brand has earned the loyalty of fashion-conscious customers.

Initiatives in fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 
We sought to increase customer attraction by offering “TREND COLLECTIONS” proposals for new, fashionable and gorgeous wedding styles that incorporate the latest trends and strengthening sales promotions that utilize social media. However, in addition to the decrease in the number of locations and changes in the market environment, the number of couples holding ceremonies decreased significantly due to postponements of ceremonies and receptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, net sales came in at ¥22,270 million (down 12.4% year on year) and operating profit at ¥439 million (down 79.7%). 
Measures for fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 
We will provide services in line with the guidelines of the Bridal Institutional Association to conduct wedding ceremonies that offer peace of mind. While taking into consideration the three C’s when we meet with customers that visit our locations, we have also made it possible to engage in smooth wedding preparations at home utilizing online meetings. Moreover, we will develop and propose new plans such as online weddings and photo-only plans according to customer needs.

Four prizes, including a Gold Prize, received at a competition to determine the top service representative in Japan

The young professionals category included skilled service representatives from established hotels and restaurants, and as a Kanto wedding venue, Anniversaire received four prizes, including a Gold Prize for being number one in Japan for the first time. 

“TREND COLLECTIONS” proposals of new wedding styles incorporating latest trends 
Anniversaire has come up with “TREND COLLECTIONS” proposals to address the desire of some customers to put on more personalized weddings better tailored to their own lives and the times. This is an innovative effort incorporating latest trends from Japan and around the world into weddings, such as different table coordination depending on the season, including table cloths, flowers, and cutlery as well as trendy touches added to the dresses and tuxedos.

At KAIKATSU CLUB, renovations were performed at 76 locations, primarily involving the introduction of fully private rooms with locks and the addition of karaoke rooms, non-smoking booths, and showers. We also opened 85 new locations. At COTE D’AZUR, we introduced the latest karaoke machines and held various events and campaigns. Our FiT24 24/7 self-service fitness gyms performed well, and we opened 28 new locations. As a result of the above, new locations contributed and existing locations performed well, bringing net sales to ¥58,388 million (up 7.9% year on year). On the other hand, the increase in costs associated with the opening of new locations and the spread of COVID-19 pushed operating profit down to ¥2,672 million (down 16.0%). 
Measures for fiscal year ending March 2021 
We will promote use as a “sharing space” for business needs, including work, learning, and online interviews as we work on improvements to the business format. Additionally, by introducing our patented air ventilation system and automated entry/exit system, we will implement thorough measures to avoid the three C’s and respond to customers' heightened awareness of safety and security. Moreover, on top of reducing rent, personnel, and other expenses, we will review our capital investment plan to further reduce expenses and streamline costs.

Creating a stir after being shown on TV: “KAIKATSU Kami Potato” 
The thin-cut french fries (nicknamed “KAIKATSU Kami Potato”) at KAIKATSU CLUB are a popular menu item for which more than a million orders are sold annually. The key point of the popularity, which was introduced on a popular New Year's TV program, is that only choice potatoes are used, and the fries are crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. Once you have tried the texture when they’ve just come out of the fryer, you will be hooked. From 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., in addition to plain french fries, you can get all-you-can-eat bread. (Not available at some locations.)

Environment 
The AOKI Group recognizes its relationship with the global environment as a priority issue. We strive to create products, services, and commercial spaces with minimal environmental impact. 

Reducing power consumption
Lighting accounts for the bulk of power consumption at locations. At the AOKI Group, we install LED lighting, which consumes less power than fluorescent lighting, when opening new locations or renovating existing ones.
We have been actively switching to LED lighting at existing locations as a measure to conserve electricity, especially since the Great East Japan Earthquake. Up to this point, we have completed the switch at all AOKI, ANNIVERSAIRE, COTE D’AZUR, KAIKATSU CLUB, and FiT24 locations as well as about 60% of our ORIHICA stores. As a result, we have reduced power consumption at each store in the Fashion Business by around 40% compared to fiscal 2009, thereby reducing the environmental impact of our stores.

Developing eco-friendly products
AOKI is focused on the development of eco-friendly products in order to reduce environmental impact.
For example, we have developed washable suits and other breathable “cool biz” business suits and dress shirts that provide comfort even in offices where air conditioning is used sparingly. We also offer suits, vests, and sweaters made with warm materials for “warm biz” that make it easy to adjust to different temperatures.
In addition, we are developing other eco-friendly products such as suits featuring polyester linings that come from recycled plastic bottles (Teijin ECOPET®) and linings with low environmental impact (Asahi Kasei BembergTM).

Trend in recycling rate
In 1996, we launched Japan’s first wool recycling project. In this
project, customers trade in their used wool clothing, and our partner
factories turn them into various recycled products.
Wool is biodegradable and fire-resistant to begin with, so ultimately, 239 the recycled products also break down naturally. We bear some of 200
the costs associated with transporting and processing the wool
within the recycling process as part of our environmental
conservation efforts.

Social 
As a public instrument of society, the AOKI Group contributes to social progress by building partnerships and relationships of trust in order to create happiness for all our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, investors, business partners, and employees. 

Dialogue with shareholders and investors 
The AOKI Group is engaged in activities based on our investor relations policy to notify our shareholders and investors promptly and accurately of management policies, business strategies, business results, and financial information. 
In the fiscal year ended March 2020, we held two performance briefings for institutional investors. We will continue to deepen dialogue through semiannual performance briefings and briefings for individual investors as well as communication of information via our website. 
For customers 
The AOKI Group improves product development and location environments by listening to feedback from customers at each location, taking note of valuable opinions received over the phone and by e-mail, collecting postcards from customers who purchase our products, and conducting customer research at locations, in order to deliver products and services that exceed our customers’ expectations. Our aim is to tie this into the creation of further customer happiness. 
Ensuring customer satisfaction 
As a fashion business, AOKI has established a customer hotline, which we use to develop high-quality products and stores by sharing the feedback and suggestions received with each department. Additionally, we have notebooks at each ORIHICA store in which staff members record the compliments given by customers and services that were positively received. The notes are shared between staff members, and the good examples are communicated to all stores. 
In the Bridal Business, we conduct bride and groom questionnaire surveys after the wedding. Customer feedback on the staff’s service, products, facilities, and other aspects of the event is shared company-wide and used in daily improvement activities. 
In the Entertainment Business, officers and other staff from headquarters gather information on customer complaints and requests through regular visits to business locations in which they talk to customers directly in an effort to improve our services. 
Briefing session for individual investors 
Ensuring reliable quality and service 
We are working to enhance education on product quality in the Fashion Business, including to obtain Textiles Evaluation Specialist certification, and seek to continually manage and improve quality enlisting the support of our Quality Control Department and outside agencies. We also inspect products after they are delivered to our distribution centers based on our in-house inspection standards. 
In the Bridal Business, four employees entered the Young Professionals category of the HRS Service Competition 2020. This competition is held by the Japan Hotel and Restaurant Service Development Association for professional service people who represent the next generation for the purpose of increasing awareness of skills and service. We won first place and the fighting-spirit award and were the first specialized wedding hall operator in the Kanto region to take the title of number one in Japan. Also, ANNIVERSAIRE Inc. won the most outstanding company award. 
With trading partners 
We believe that it is important to develop cooperative relationships with our business partners in order to deliver valuable products and services to our customers. For that reason, in the Fashion Business, we hold quality improvement meetings with our suppliers to share customer feedback and get them involved in product development. 
For employees 
At the AOKI Group, we believe it’s important to create happiness not only for our customers but also for everyone who works in the Group. We promote various initiatives for such objectives as diversity and work-life balance, including the introduction of the Shift Gears Program allowing employees to change their work style according to their life stage, in order to create an environment in which each employee can thrive and demonstrate their unique talents, thereby improving the experience of our customers. 
We also hold awards ceremonies to recognize long-time employees and outstanding employees who have contributed not only to sales but also in various other ways using indicators such as the number of positive reviews from customers. 
With local communities 
One of the pillars of our management philosophy is pursuing community service. We believe that it is important to contribute to society in non-commercial ways as well. As such, we promote cultural activities in local communities and engage in such efforts as sports sponsorship and next-generation training. 
Sports sponsorship 
We have sponsored the Nagano Marathon ever since it was started in 1999. The marathon carries on the principles of the Nagano Winter Olympics, which were held in 1998 in Nagano Prefecture where the AOKI Group was founded. 
We also contribute to the promotion of sports through uniform sponsorship, including support for student sports and providing suits and polo shirts when KAWASAKI FRONTALE travels.

ESG 
   
Governance 
We are reinforcing the functions of the Board of Directors and the Board of Auditors and coordination with the Internal Auditing Office, each committee, legal advisors, and the accounting auditor in pursuit of improving legal compliance and the transparency and efficiency of management in order to establish a healthy corporate governance structure. 

Basic Approach 
The AOKI Group Philosophy is based on the three pillars of business integrity, social responsibility, and community service. We recognize the importance of corporate governance in pursuing this philosophy and increasing medium- to long-term corporate value. Our basic approach is to strengthen the administrative organization to increase the transparency and fairness of management and put sound and efficient management into practice. 
We are also working to further enhance corporate governance by improving the internal control system, which includes reviewing the 
Corporate Governance Structure 
We are a company with a board of auditors. To ensure objectivity and neutrality, we elect auditors who are thoroughly familiar with finance and accounting as certified public accountants/certified tax accountants and experienced external auditors. We have adopted a system wherein they supervise the Board of Directors and manage legal compliance and risk by coordinating with the Internal Auditing Office, each committee, legal advisors, and the accounting auditor. Additionally, they supervise the execution of the directors’ duties, with one standing auditor attending important meetings. 
The Board of Directors is comprised of 13 directors, including two external directors. They have monthly and extraordinary meetings, 
organization and reinforcing the risk management structure, as well as by engaging in appropriate information disclosure, ensuring the rights of shareholders, engaging in dialogue with shareholders, and appropriately cooperating with other stakeholders. 
By increasing corporate value through the pursuit of the three pillars of the AOKI Group Philosophy, we will meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
while the Executive Committee, which includes presidents of subsidiaries and standing auditors, meets monthly. They decide important matters, report on management issues, and exchange information. We have also introduced an executive officer system to expedite management decision-making. 
In April 2019, we established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee to further increase the fairness and transparency of officer elections and determination of officer remuneration. The committee is chaired by an external director, and it consists of five members, including external directors, external auditors, and two directors. 
The Compliance Committee reviews compliance-related issues, while a legal consultation is held monthly to discuss individual matters with legal advisors. Furthermore, rules and manuals are prepared as necessary to strengthen the Group’s internal control system, and workshops and other training sessions are held for employees to raise awareness of the system. 
External Director/Auditor Support Structure 
Auditors may give orders to employees of the Administrative Office on important matters related to audit operations as necessary. Additionally, the external director who is a certified public accountant takes advantage of his specialist knowledge and many years of experience to provide advice, share opinions, and gather information at meetings of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee as well as weekly group report meetings attended by presidents of subsidiaries and other important meetings. The other external director and an external auditor are directly provided with explanations of important agenda items prior to meetings of the Board of Directors and otherwise kept up to date.

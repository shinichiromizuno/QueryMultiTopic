Demand for teleworking has expanded quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic. NESIC offers its know-how to custom- ers that have not yet rolled out teleworking on their own and address this social issue. In particular, we have seen an increase in opportunities to assist new customers with which we had not done business with before. Currently, we are mainly providing licenses to Zoom and other services. Moreover, we deepen relationships with customers by introduc- ing products and services, as well as various solutions for security and enhancing networks, related to teleworking. We expect demand to strengthen in terms of remote (contactless) services in all public and private sectors, and will improve our ability to tap into this demand.

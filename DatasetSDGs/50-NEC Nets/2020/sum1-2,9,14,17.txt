Onshore Salmon Farming Business
 NESIC entered into the onshore salmon farming business while leveraging its ICT / digital technologies. For this business, the Company created a new business model that expands into value added areas, as an extension of its business domains through partnerships while enhancing the value added of the business with digital technology, in addition to the provision of conventional ICT services.
NESIC forged a partnership with Hayashi Trout Farm, a pioneer in salmon farming in Japan and the largest onshore fish farming operation in the nation. By pairing NESIC’s ICT and digital technologies with Hayashi Trout Farm’s know-how and cutting-edge technologies in fish farming, we are digitally transforming the fish farming industry, such as by improving productivity and moving away from primary industry business practices unique to the marine products sector. AI is deployed to automate measurements of the length and weight of fish, and controls for regulating water temperatures, oxygen levels and feed. Through these innovations, costs are reduced through an industrial production process, while ensuring consistent supply throughout the year. The use of ICT and digital technologies ensures quality through trace- ability, and also reduces the burden on managers with remote observation and controls. In these ways, digital technolo- gies can solve issues faced by the fish farming industry. Through these
endeavors, we aim to help solve social issues around the world, namely protecting the marine environment and solving food shortages. By offering this business as a franchise model, NESIC supports greater involvement in the fish farming industry.
In addition to the onshore fish farming business, we will collaborate with partners in various fields to advance the use of our digital technolo- gies while taking on the challenge of adopting new business models with the ultimate aim of solving issues faced by society.

Responsible for
Product Planning DepartmentRecognition of the environment and basic strategy
We will develop products mainly from the perspective of improving security and convenience, reflecting the conditions of social and economic environments and changes in customer needs.
For environmental changes, the average life expectancy is expected to keep extending, so we believe that the needs will increase for healthy and rich post-retirement lives while preparing for the longevity risks. The low-interest-rate environment is also expected to continue.
Considering these circumstances, we will enhance the coverage of medical care riders in order to provide well-balanced coverage with low insurance premiums. In addition, in response to the advent of an age of the 100-year life, we will expand the range of coverage to meet varied needs, such as nursing care, inheritance, and preparation for longevity risks. We will also aim to develop more attractive products by researching products that contribute to the extension of healthy life expectancy using health data.
We will develop insurance services which meet the coverage needs of all generations and various scenes and provide insurance services connecting generations and services tailored to the lives of customers.

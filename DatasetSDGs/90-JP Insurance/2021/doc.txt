   Message from the CEO
We will devote ourselves to our new Medium-Term Management Plan, endeavoring to achieve the transformation of Japan Post Insurance.
 Regaining trust is the mission I must achieve.
Let me begin by extending my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by COVID-19, as well as my sincerest gratitude to those who remain engaged in treating patients and preventing infection on the medical front lines, and those who bolster the lifeline infrastructure.
The Postal Life Insurance Service, the Company’s predecessor, was created in 1916 with the social mission of “protecting the means of fundamental livelihood of the public through simple procedures.” Even after becoming a private sector company, we remain firmly committed to this social mission, and continue pursuing our management philosophy, “Be a trustful partner for people, always being close at hand and endeavoring to protect their well-being.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have provided emergency measures such as the extension of the grace period for premium payments and the reduction or exemption of interest rates on loans, as well as the payment of insurance claims. We are resolved to continue fulfilling our social mission as a life insurance company.
SENDA Tetsuya
Director and President, CEO, Representative Executive Officer
Since assuming the position of President, CEO and Representative Executive Officer on January 6, 2020, I have made every effort to regain the trust of customers, which I believe is my mission. I would like to reiterate my deepest apologies for the trouble and concern experienced by many people due to the Company’s solicitation quality issues. We have conducted and completed insurance claim surveys for all customers, with the exception of cases in which surveys could not be completed due to reasons attributable to customers. Furthermore, personnel involved in customer solicitation activities that violated laws and regulations have been disciplined. Going forward, we will continue to confirm the policy coverage of customers and compensate customers for any disadvantages caused.
On top of this, as President and CEO, I am taking the lead in devoting the Company to customer-first business operations to avoid the occurrence of similar incidents, and working to reform our corporate culture so that every employee acts autonomously and proactively to support and serve our customers.
2 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

 Medium-Term Management Plan based on thinking from scratch and returning to our roots (p. 20)
I believe that the Company is currently facing the most challenging business environment that it has encountered since inception. We have entered into an era in which conventional values are rapidly changing, triggered by the ongoing global COVID- 19 pandemic. Successful experiences and business models of the past are no longer useful or helpful for industries, including life insurance. Under such circumstances, we have formulated a new Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2021– FY2025), based not upon an extension of the conventional business model, but rather, a radical reconsideration of how the Company should be reborn.
The new Medium-Term Management Plan returns to the root of our management philosophy –“Be a trustful partner for people, always being close at hand and endeavoring to protect their well-being”–and clearly demonstrates our social mission that “We will remain trusted and selected by customers, thereby protecting their lives by providing life insurance product.” Moreover, as the basic policy of the plan, we have set out the following themes: “reconstruction” of Japan Post Insurance to transform us into a company truly trusted by customers through continuous efforts to regain trust and enhancement of the business foundation; “sustainable growth,” which we will pursue by improving customer experience value (CX1) and contributing to the resolution of social issues; and, as the foundation for achieving these, corporate culture and workstyle reforms as well as enhanced governance and capital policy.
Note 1: CX, an abbreviation for customer experience, refers to everything experienced by customers, not only functional items such as prices and performance of products and services, but also emotional and psychological values, like satisfaction, generated throughout the entire process from before buying insurance to after-sales support and insurance claim payment.
Reconstruction aimed at being a company truly trusted by customers (p. 22)
Since July 2019, the Company has placed the highest priority on regaining trust from customers, and refrained from proactively making proposals. We resumed proposal activities for customers in April 2021. In order to “revitalize” the Company and carry out sales activities while ensuring quality, the proper condition of a life insurance company, we will drastically change our sales
process and ensure that the customers using our products and services are well-informed and satisfied.
Supporting customers nationwide with the new Japan Post Insurance sales system (p. 24)
For our “reconstruction,” we need to strengthen our business foundation on top of continuing efforts aimed at regaining trust.
To respond to customers’ increasingly diverse insurance needs, it is essential to tailor our services to the life plans and family lives of our customers, along with meticulous and careful after- sales services. To do this, we will establish a new Japan Post Insurance sales system by accepting a total of approximately 13,000 consultants (employees mainly engaged in visiting customer homes, etc.) and other staff from Japan Post Co.
Under the new sales system, the roles of the consultants and post office counters will be clearly defined. The consultants will be devoted to making proposals for life insurance products and after- sales services as life insurance professionals, using their specialist knowledge and mobility. In addition, the introduction of a customer assignment system will allow them to provide high- quality and attentive after-sales follow up for customers. On the other hand, post office counters will respond to a variety of customer needs by proposing a wide range of financial products. Moreover, through the collaboration between these consultants and post office counters, we will achieve comprehensive consulting services provided by the Japan Post Group as a whole, featuring both specialization and breadth.
The establishment of this new Japan Post Insurance sales system is a project on which the future of the Company rests. We will make company-wide efforts under the resolution that top management, including the President and CEO, will take the lead in the challenge, see to its success, and achieve customer satisfaction.
Enhancing insurance services to provide support the age of the 100-year life (p. 26)
In addition to establishing the new Japan Post Insurance sales system, developing products that meet customers’ needs is crucial to strengthening our business foundation. As society enters the age of the 100-year life, we must develop products that thoroughly meet the insurance needs of customers

of all generations. We will improve the coverage of medical care riders to be added to basic insurance policies so that we can accurately meet customers’ insurance needs, such as receiving generous protection at low premiums. We will also promote the development of our insurance services, including the expansion of products that meet the protection needs of the elderly and middle- to senior-aged population, and the research and development of products that contribute to extending a healthy life expectancy.
The Company, which is subject to additional restrictions under the Postal Service Privatization Act on top of general regulations based on the Insurance Business Act, conducted acquisition of its treasury shares in May 2021, and the ratio of voting rights of Japan Post Holdings in the Company decreased to around 49.9% in June 2021. Accordingly, the additional restrictions on new operations will be relaxed from a license system to an advance notification system. Going forward, we will develop products that meet customers’ requirements with a sense of speed.
“Sustainable growth” that enhances our competitiveness (p. 30)
Along with the abovementioned “reconstruction,” “sustainable growth” is set as another pillar of the Medium-Term Management Plan. To achieve “sustainable growth,” we are working to “improve customer experience value (CX)” and “contribute to resolving social issues.”
We believe that “improving customer experience value (CX)” is a key to how we, as a life insurance company, can enhance our competitiveness in the life insurance market. We should be able to expand opportunities to connect with potential customers if, by enhancing customer convenience and services through measures such as through swift insurance benefits payments and the provision of simpler and more diverse services, we can ensure that our customers feel glad they chose Japan Post Insurance, and share their experience or even recommend the quality services of Japan Post Insurance to others.
As specific initiatives, we plan to transform our business model into one where insurance procedures can be mostly completed when we come in contact with customers. For example, when customers apply for a new policy, sales employees will be accompanied online by customer service center staff in charge of customer support, who will check the application
items for on-the-spot confirmation that the application procedures can be completed correctly. Moreover, we will enable the family of customers to be present online, even if they live in distant places, so that customers can feel safe and comfortable.
Additional focus will be placed on setting up a customer database. As quickly as possible, we will create a common platform that will enable us, not individually but as a team, to support customers by grasping information on each customer through all channels, including consultants, post office counters and customer service centers, in the same way.
Furthermore, when examining “improvement of customer experience value (CX),” emphasis will be placed on combining “physical” measures, or direct communications with customers and “digital” measures, which include using Web services and ICT. By increasing contact points with customers through DX2 and adding personalized, heartfelt support, we will improve customer satisfaction. By integrating the “physical” channel of post offices, a strength of the Japan Post Group, and the new digital capabilities, we will make the customer experience (CX) better, or experiences that move customers.
Note 2: DX, an abbreviation for digital transformation, is a process where companies transform their products, services, and business models based on customer and societal needs, by leveraging data and digital technologies to respond to drastic changes in the business environment. This includes transformation of the operation itself, organization, processes, and corporate culture, which will lead to a competitive advantage.
Contribution to resolving social issues related to sustainability (p. 36)
Another key point for achieving “sustainable growth” is “our contribution to resolving social issues related to sustainability.”
The Postal Life Insurance Service was born more than a century ago when it was difficult for people, with only a handful of exceptions, to purchase life insurance. Behind this initiative was a commitment to popularizing basic coverage through the familiar network of post offices, by offering insurance for small coverage amounts through simple procedures. Inheriting this commitment to the goal of “contribution to resolving social issues,” the Company will proactively help to resolve the social issues of the present, including the “declining birthrate and aging population,” “extension of healthy life expectancy,” and “environmental issues.”
4 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

 Specifically, in light of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), we have laid out such material topics as heartfelt and friendly services for the elderly, extension of healthy life expectancy, enhancement of well being,3 initiatives for carbon neutrality4 and the promotion of diversity. By addressing these challenges as priorities, we will work to resolve various social issues.
For health promotion, in particular, the Company has long worked to popularize the Radio Exercise Program. Looking ahead, we would like to spread the word on how great the Radio Exercise Program is, while enhancing the value of our insurance services by, for example, studying the effects of the program on health, and accumulating and using the data to develop new products.
What is more, the Company is also a large institutional investor, having an asset portfolio of approximately 70 trillion yen. As a life insurance company that can make long-term investments, we have conducted ESG (environment, social, and governance) investments aimed at resolving social issues, including renewable energy, support for COVID-19 countermeasures, and the promotion of expanding roles for female employees. Starting in the current fiscal year, we are applying the ESG investment strategy to all assets in our portfolio. By carrying out investments that give a sense of
“warmth” typical of the Company, we would like to exert our leadership to achieve a sustainable society.
Note 3: Well-being is a state where one is physically, mentally, and socially fulfilled.
Note 4: Carbon neutrality refers to the idea of achieving “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,” by subtracting the amount of greenhouse gasses including carbon dioxide absorbed by trees, etc. from the amount emitted.
Aiming to enhance corporate value in a sustainable way
I believe that customers will trust us and keep choosing us only if we squarely face the issues of the era and region, and act to resolve them. The next five years covered by the new Medium-Term Management Plan represent an extremely important period for the Company’s rebirth. As we aim to improve our corporate value in a sustainable way, we will listen carefully to and reflect on the thoughts and opinions of each of our stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, employees and local community members. I would like to ask for your continued support for Japan Post Insurance, as we endeavor to achieve “reconstruction” and “sustainable growth” for a better future.

  About Japan Post Insurance
Our History
The Postal Life Insurance Service, the predecessor of Japan Post Insurance, was founded in 1916. Created with the social mission of “protecting the means of fundamental livelihood of the public through simple procedures,” the Postal Life Insurance Service fulfilled its role of ensuring the stability of people’s lives by providing an insurance system available at relatively affordable fees with simple enrollment procedures and no medical examination. Although more than a century has passed since our founding, our mission to support the lifestyles of people through insurance has not changed, despite our transformation from a government-run entity to a private corporation in line with the changing times. Japan Post Insurance will continue to deliver insurance services as a means of security to customers nationwide through the network of post offices rooted in the community, thereby protecting the well-being of each and every customer with the power of insurance.

  Japan Post Insurance and Radio Exercise —History of Promoting Community Health—
The Postal Life Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications created the Radio Exercise Program in 1928 in an effort to maintain and improve people’s health. The Ministry introduced the program in celebration of the enthronement ceremony of the Showa Emperor.
Japan Post Insurance, which was created as a result of the privatization of the original Japan Post, has assumed the role of promoting the exercise program, first undertaken by the Ministry of Communications and then by its successors, namely the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Postal Service Agency and Japan Post prior to privatization. We have been working together with NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and the NPO Japan Radio-taiso Federation to promote the program.

Commissions are calculated based on a formula generally used in the life insurance industry and are paid in installments over several years.
Commissions for maintenance and claim payment
For maintenance and claim payment services consigned to Japan Post Co., a unit price is set and paid based on the processing time of the service at post offices.
Commissions include a commission proportional to the number of policies in force, the number of post offices, etc. (basic commission), and a commission based on the performance of the maintenance of policies in force and follow-up activities (incentive commission).

Net income in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 increased ¥15.4 billion (10.2%) year on year to ¥166.1 billion.
Although the monthly premiums we receive from customers to operate business are a fixed amount, the amount of commissions paid funded by the premiums are set unevenly, with initial payments set high. Therefore, net income increased because of a decrease in operating expenses caused by the decrease in new policies (refer to “Annualized Premiums from New Policies (Individual Insurance)”).
We manage insurance premiums entrusted from customers and hold assets such as securities in order to provide for payments of insurance claims and others. Total assets as of March 31, 2021 amounted to ¥70,172.9 billion.

We aim for a childcare leave utilization rate of 100% for both male and female employees by establishing an environment in which childcare leave is easy to use regardless of employee gender, as part of our efforts to create a working environment where every employee can work actively.
   Notes: 7. The satisfaction level was evaluated on a five-point scale of “satisfied,” “somewhat satisfied,” “not satisfied or dissatisfied,” “somewhat dissatisfied,” and “dissatisfied,” and the total ratio of customers who answered “satisfied” and “somewhat satisfied” is shown. The results of the surveys of FY2018/3 and prior fiscal years are not shown because their survey methods differ from the current one. In FY2020/3, the Customer Satisfaction Survey was not performed as we concentrated our efforts on insurance claim surveys and other initiatives.
8. Emissions from facilities and vehicles of all organizations within Japan Post Insurance. We changed the method of calculating CO2 emissions and now use the adjusted coefficient of emissions by electricity utility announced by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

  Notes:
1. The financial data represent consolidated figures. However, core profit, number of shares issued, status of policies and dividend per share represent non-consolidated figures. Furthermore, net income represents net income attributable to Japan Post Insurance.
2. The consolidated solvency margin ratios have been calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth in Articles 86-2 and 88 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act and in the public notification No.23 issued by the Financial Services Agency in 2011.
3. In the calculation of the consolidated solvency margin ratio from March 31, 2016 onwards, the total amount of solvency margin was partially amended in accordance with the Cabinet Office Ordinance No.16 of 2016. Accordingly, the consolidated solvency margin ratios on March 31, 2012 through 2015, and March 31, 2016 onwards were calculated based on different standards.
4. The economic solvency ratio (ESR) is the capital amount based on economic value divided by the integrated risk amount based on economic value and is one of the indicators that represent the financial soundness of life insurance companies (Figures are based on the Company’s internal model; 99.5% confidence level).
5. Annualized premiums are calculated by multiplying the amount of a single premium installment payment by a multiplier determined according to the relevant payment method to arrive at a single annualized amount. For lump-sum payments, annualized premiums are calculated by dividing the total premium by the insured period.
6. Annualized premiums from policies in force include reinsured Postal Life Insurance Policies (for individual insurance, limited to Postal Life Insurance Policies (insurance)).
7. Third-sector insurance includes medical benefits (including hospitalization and surgery benefits), living benefits (including limited illness and nursing care benefits), and premium
payment waivers benefits (excluding disability and including specified diseases and nursing benefits).
8. In the calculation of EV and the value of new business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 onwards, an approach which utilizes the ultimate forward rate is applied as the
extrapolation method of interest rates at longer durations of the risk-free rates (an approach in which the forward rates for the last year of the market data onwards are assumed to
be the same is used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 and before).
9. The value of new business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 onwards is calculated as the difference between the EV calculated on the basis of the profit and loss for all

  Business Strategy for Value Creation
Medium-Term Management Plan
Overview of Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2021–FY2025)
In May 2021, Japan Post Insurance announced “Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2021–FY2025),” a new Medium-Term Management plan covering the period from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 to the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026.
Going back to our management philosophy, “Be a trustful partner for people, always being close at hand and endeavoring to protect their well-being,” we formulated our Medium-Term Management Plan positioning “We will remain trusted and selected by customers, thereby protecting their lives by providing life insurance product” as our social mission.
In response to the solicitation quality issues surfaced in 2019 and changes in the external environment, we will aim to achieve sustainable growth by reconstructing into a company truly trusted by customers and providing insurance services that will impress our customers.
To achieve these goals, we will reform into a corporate culture that allows every employee feel employee satisfaction (ES) while growing together with the company, and enhance governance.
* Employee Satisfaction
Reflection on the Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019/3–FY2021/3)
In the prior Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019/3–FY2021/3), we positioned “pursue customer-first business operations,” “achieve sustainable growth,” and “maintain sound business operations” as the foundation of management, and have been proceeding with these initiatives.
However, regarding the solicitation quality issues that arose in and after July 2019, we take the findings for improving business by the regulatory agency, etc. very seriously, and have formulated various improvement measures under a business improvement plan as a mechanism to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future. We could not achieve our target for the annualized premiums from policies in force due to the preferential allocation of company-wide management resources to the promotion of various improvement measures to recover trust from customers.
We exceeded our target for earning per share (EPS) due to a decrease in operating expenses as a result of refraining from making proactive sales efforts in response to solicitation quality issues, in addition to a steady increase in investment income. However, we recognize that challenging conditions will continue over the medium to long term.
We achieved the dividend per share (DPS) target ahead of schedule.

Message from the CEO About Japan Post Insurance Business Strategy for Value Creation Management Base to Support Value Creation Corporate Information Financial Statements

   Business Strategy for Value Creation
Continued Efforts to Regain Trust
 Business improvement plan
We received orders from the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan to suspend business (from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020) and improve business operations based on Article 132, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act on December 27, 2019. We submitted a business improvement plan to FSA on January 31, 2020, and have since been making regular reports on our progress. Based on the findings in the order to improve business, recommendations from the Special Investigation Committee, etc., we thoroughly implemented the preventive countermeasures listed in the business improvement plan (creation of a healthy corporate culture, establishing an appropriate sales promotion plan, strengthening solicitation quality control and strengthening governance by the Board of Directors, etc.) and completed most of the measures.
We will continue to verify the effectiveness of these measures and improve operations, including by making the necessary changes based on the results.
Pledge to Regain Customers’ Trust
Since July 2019, we have refrained from making proactive sales efforts at post offices and our directly- managed offices, including during the period of the business suspension order from January to March 2020. However, the JP Reform Execution Committee assessed that the minimum necessary conditions for resuming sales activities have been met, and it has been confirmed that the purpose of operations for regaining customers’ trust is shared and ensured by employees. Accordingly, on October 5, 2020, we conducted operations aimed at regaining customers’ trust, placing top priority on apologizing to our customers. We apologized for causing customers concern, explained “Pledge to Regain Customers’ Trust,” and performed policy confirmation activities.
  Pledge for our vision
We pledge to remain close beside each and every one of our customers, giving top priority to customer satisfaction and peace of mind,and to be a company that they can trust.
Pledge for our activities
We are committed to customer-oriented business operations and providing satisfying and courteous services for customers.
We will carefully listen to feedback from customers in order to reflect it in the improvement of our services.
We will enhance the expertise of our employees so that they can provide accurate and easy-to understand explanations to satisfy our customers.
We will comply with laws and regulations and provide high-quality services that our customers can use with a peace of mind.
We will provide products and services that will bring joy to our customers based on their needs.
Through these activities, we also received words of appreciation from customers, such as “Thank you for contacting me again and again,” “It is a tough job to visit each customer, but it is a unique strength of post offices,” and “Thank you for notifying me that I’m able to apply for hospitalization benefits.”
After that, we resumed explanations and proposals of insurance products and services to customers who we previously visited or to those who requested explanations, etc. at our directly-managed offices on February 10, 2021, and then expanded these activities to include all customers on April 1 of the same year. In addition, on the same day, post offices started to provide information and make proposals on insurance products and services that meet customer needs. These actions marked a shift to a new sales style, one that builds a relationship of trust through sales activities.
  22 JAPAN POST INSURANCE
New in-house system to respond to customers’ requests
In the event that we detect any possibility of a problem with solicitation quality through reports by customers, we not only handle this as an individual problem but also analyze the possibility of an occurrence of similar problems, and expand active investigations. We grasp the depth of the problem in question and take preventive countermeasures.
Pledge to Regain Customers’ Trust

   Continuation of the initiatives during the Medium-Term Management Plan
In the best interests of every customer, we announced our vision for customer-first business operations, along with the measures needed to ensure its realization in terms of our framework and business operations, as our “Basic Policies for Customer-first Business Operations.”
The entire Company will work as one in an effort to further improve and develop customer-first business operations based on the “Basic Policies for Customer-first Business Operations.”
Basic Policy for Customer-first Business Operations
https://www.jp-life.japanpost.jp/aboutus/company/abt_cmp_fiduciary.html (in Japanese)
Under the current Medium-Term Management Plan, we will radically shift from the previous “proposal-first” sales approach based on products to a new sales approach and thoroughly conduct activities to ensure that “our customers can use our products and services based on their satisfaction and understanding.”

  Notes: 1. The solicitation policy that reflects the customer-first philosophy, based on the principle of providing insurance coverage founded on high ethical standards which take the original roles and mission of life insurance into account.
2. “Standard of Japan Post Insurance sales” based on a solicitation policy that reflects the customer-first philosophy.
In addition, while keeping and fulfilling “Pledge to Regain Customers’ Trust,” throughout the insurance period, we will be engaged in careful follow-up services for strengthening ties with our customers, based on the concept of “providing services in the form of life insurance,” thereby rebuilding relationship with them.
First, we will work to enhance customers’ understanding of the necessity of their insurance protection in force, through “policy coverage confirmation activities” utilizing the “Notification of Policy Coverage” sent to each customer in the month prior to his/her birthday.
In addition, for initiatives to regain trust, we will thoroughly implement the PDCA cycle and strengthen checking systems and control to enhance risk sensitivity, verify and review the effectiveness of the improvement measures, and construct a scheme to prevent policies that are not in line with customers’ intentions, and ensure the effectiveness of these initiatives.
JP Reform Execution Committee
Four Japan Post Group companies, Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., Japan Post Co., Ltd., Japan Post Bank Co., Ltd., and Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. established the JP Reform Execution Committee on April 2, 2020, to seek advice from external experts from a fair and neutral standpoint, in order to restore public confidence in the Japan Post Group.
Meetings of this Committee have been held 10 times as of April 30, 2021. In the meetings, the progress of the business improvement plan, conditions for resuming sales activities, the whistleblowing contact point of the Japan Post Group, etc. were verified, and opinions and recommendations about the growth strategy of the Japan Post Group and other matters were presented from various viewpoints.

 Recognition of the environment and basic strategy
We will develop products mainly from the perspective of improving security and convenience, reflecting the conditions of social and economic environments and changes in customer needs.
For environmental changes, the average life expectancy is expected to keep extending, so we believe that the needs will increase for healthy and rich post-retirement lives while preparing for the longevity risks. The low-interest-rate environment is also expected to continue.
Considering these circumstances, we will enhance the coverage of medical care riders in order to provide well-balanced coverage with low insurance premiums. In addition, in response to the advent of an age of the 100-year life, we will expand the range of coverage to meet varied needs, such as nursing care, inheritance, and preparation for longevity risks. We will also aim to develop more attractive products by researching products that contribute to the extension of healthy life expectancy using health data.
We will develop insurance services which meet the coverage needs of all generations and various scenes and provide insurance services connecting generations and services tailored to the lives of customers.

Achieving Greater Depth and Sophistication of Asset Management
  For Japan Post Insurance to become a “world-leading institutional investor”
We secure stable investment income under effective risk management to pay insurance claims and other obligations to customers without fail, and aim to become a “world-leading institutional investor” by achieving greater depth and sophistication of asset management for both portfolio development and investment in each field, including alternative investments.
HARUNA Takayuki
Managing Executive Officer
Responsible for Investment Operation Department, Alternative Investment Department and Global Credit Investment Department
 Recognition of the environment and basic strategy
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the global economy rapidly deteriorated at the beginning of the fiscal year due to the implementation of countermeasures against the spread of COVID-19, which was followed by a recovery trend due to large-scale fiscal and monetary policy packages and gradual easing of movement restrictions in many countries. However, the recovery was moderate due primarily to the intermittent resurgence of COVID-19. During the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, the global economy is expected to recover gradually thanks to the continuation of large-scale fiscal and monetary policy packages in various countries and the gradual normalization of economic activities associated with the propagation of vaccines.
Under the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework, we will continue to invest in return-seeking assets using rigorous risk management to secure stable income in the low-interest-rate environment, while implementing ALM-based asset management through asset-liability matching, to ensure the payment of insurance claims to customers.
Past activities
To ensure the yields promised to customers, we have promoted the diversification of assets in response to the prolonged low-interest-rate environment.
While we have diversified assets centered on assets that are externally managed, with the aim of achieving stable profit improvement in the low-interest-rate environment, we have started in-house management of U.S. corporate bonds and Japanese equities in phases, steadily promoting the diversification of our assets.
We consider various factors of ESG when making investment decisions, in order to realize a sustainable society, improve investment results, and reduce risks in the long term.
As a result of promoting the diversification of assets to increase the profitability of our ALM-based asset management, the ratio of return-seeking assets to total assets as of March 31, 2021 increased to 15.9%.

   Business Strategy for Value Creation
Improving Customer Experience Value (CX)
  Creating experience values which leads to the total satisfaction of our customers in their choice of insurance company
We will pursue ways to impress our customers and radically reform all services including insurance proposals, support and procedures from the viewpoint of improving the “customer experience value.”
We will improve the “customer experience value” by providing “warmth” and “convenience” by combining physical and digital measures.

 Recognition of the environment and basic strategy
The life insurance industry is going through a structural change, owing to factors such as the reformation of the life insurance market associated with the rapid progress of the falling birthrate and the aging population in Japan, as well as the entry of companies from other industries. In line with these changes, the business model of life insurance itself is undergoing transformation, with the propagation of smartphones, social media, etc. and the diversification of communication methods, as well as the advancement of digital technologies, changes and diversification of lifestyles of customers, and rapid advances in medical technologies.
From 2020 onward in particular, due in part to the impact of COVID-19, the daily lives and awareness of customers have changed, and the transformation of digital technologies in company activities has accelerated. In the age of living with and post COVID-19, it is our responsibility to fulfill our social mission and role as a life insurance company without fail, adapting to customer needs in this turbulent environment.
In addition, governments are also promoting the use of digital technologies in corporate settings based on the concept of Society 5.0, and proceeding with the digitalization of their own operations, including a plan to establish the Digital Agency.
Companies are rapidly proceeding with the digital transformation (DX) of their business models in order to create new services and business approaches and to secure competitive advantages. On the other hand, we see a gap between customers who can use these digital technologies, etc. and those who cannot when we provide them with services.
Under these circumstances, we recognize it is essential to promote DX in a way that customers of diverse ages and values will feel warmth, by making use of physical contact points with customers, like post offices and consultants.
Given this environment, we plan to radically reform all services, including insurance proposals and other procedures, from the viewpoint of improving the customer experience value (CX). Our goal is to provide convenience to customers and support customers anywhere at any time. To do this, we will construct IT system platforms to underpin improved experience values and provide services combining physical means of contact that convey warmth with convenient digital systems.
We intend to enhance the customer experience by providing quality services that ensure customers feel truly glad they chose Japan Post Insurance, and aim to expand the customer base through family and friends, to communities and societies.
Past activities
We are responding to various changes in lifestyles, including the rising number of non-face-to-face service users due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are also working to improve customer convenience by expanding the functions of “My Page,” a Web service for policyholders, accessed using familiar devices, such as home PCs and smartphones.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we started a trial of a survey conducted immediately after procedures in order to gather evaluations, etc. for each important contact point with customers in real-time.

   Business Strategy for Value Creation
Corporate Culture Reform
  Reform personnel to reform the culture
The most important factor in the promotion of corporate culture reform is personnel reform. We will create a culture that can reliably respond to the expectations of customers by ensuring that all employees understand our social mission and engage in their duties with job satisfaction.
TACHIBANA

Senior Managing Executive Officer
Responsible for Human Resources Department and Human Resources Development Department
 Recognition of the environment (Recognition of the issues)
The issues surrounding solicitations for our products revealed the unreasonable nature and irrationality of our sales targets and our poor awareness of compliance and customer protection. We now recognize that the underlying causes of the issues were poor communication between the head office and front-line personnel and the low risk sensitivity, which were rooted in our organization itself, including the awareness of employees and the corporate culture.
We consider it necessary to work hard to recover the trust of customers and promote initiatives to reformation of our corporate culture by going back to the Company’s management philosophy, in order to promote reconstruction and achieve sustainable growth.
Vision
The reformation of our corporate culture is a major pillar of our reconstruction. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we set up a dedicated team specially assigned by the President to improve the issues noted above, namely communication and risk sensitivity, as a company-wide effort. In addition, to identify the issues existing in every organization, we conducted an ES (employee satisfaction) survey for all employees, and have been working to solve the identified company-wide issues and issues unique to each organization.
Through these activities, we aim to achieve these goals:
All officers and employees across the Company work together to make the Company grow by facilitating internal communication and mutual understanding
Share the challenges of the Company among all organizational units
All officers and employees share the management vision, etc. of the Company and act autonomously and independently based on the customer-first principle.
Improving communication
The causes of poor in-house communication are the lack of sharing information between the head office and front-line personnel and limited information dissemination from management. To solve these issues, we have gone ahead with communication measures, such as the introduction of “Direct Suggestions to the President of Japan Post Insurance” for employees to directly present opinions and proposals to the President, periodic distribution of messages from the President to all employees, and opinion exchange meetings between officers and employees. As with feedback from customers, management and related departments focuses on the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing opinions and proposals received from employees through “Direct Suggestions to the President of Japan Post Insurance” to improve operations. In addition, they function to detect risks.
We will continue these communication programs, strengthen collaboration not only between the head office and front-line personnel but also with organizations and departments, and aim to become a company that strives to respond to customers’ expectations with company-wide togetherness.

  Support for diverse career formation
We are constructing a mechanism to support every employee to set up their own career plan, gain professional experience, and improve their skills for the realization of that plans, in order to promote the independent growth of employees. Specifically, we will proceed with such measures as the acquisition and accumulation of information about the future hopes of employees through career interviews, the clarification of personnel, skills, etc. necessary for each department going forward, personnel allocation that contributes to the growth of employees, and the establishment of a personnel system in which employees can select from diverse work styles.
Initiatives to strengthen management capabilities
For our reconstruction and sustainable growth, all employees must fulfill their roles to the maximum extent. In particular, managers, who are the core of each organization, must perform operations and fulfill their duties from the viewpoint of management beyond the boundaries of the benefits of their own organizations, as well as construct an environment where their subordinates can exercise their capabilities to the maximum level. For that purpose, we will aim to transform the behavior of managers by more clearly showing the image of managers we desire and then evaluating not only their performance but also their everyday behavior in the conduct of duties.
Enhance the personnel evaluation system
We are working to realize “personnel evaluations for the development of human resources” through which all employees can find their “strengths” and “weaknesses” and improve their capabilities. Specifically, we will introduce a mechanism for organizations to evaluate and cultivate every employee, in addition to revising the personnel evaluation standards.
Human resources development
Our aim is to create an environment where every employee can make full use of his or her capabilities in order to offer customers superior services and to enhance corporate value. Our “Human Resources Development Basic Policies” emphasize development of people who put the customer first. We are vigorously supporting our employees so that they are motivated to grow together with the Company with job satisfaction, while always being mindful of corporate social responsibility.
In addition to training by job level according to employees’ positions, such as training for new employees, we also make voluntary training programs available in order to develop their capabilities. We also provide programs to support employees’ self-development, including a program encouraging employees to acquire qualifications and certifications.
Through the linkage of these programs with practical training at each workplace, we promote effective human resources development so that “all employees can develop their talents and work with energy and vitality.”
Human Resources Development Basic Policies
We shall cultivate human resources who have self-awareness of corporate social responsibility and who place the customer first.
We shall cultivate human resources who have expert capabilities and a well-rounded character.
We shall cultivate human resources who are imbued with a spirit of challenge for addressing new issues and who have the ability to get things done.
    In order to motivate each and every employee for personal development and foster them to become human resources capable of taking action expressing the four orientations (Note 1) based on the customer-first concept while implementing the PDCA cycle on a daily basis, we have a system in which OJT (Note 2), support for self-development and Off-JT (Note 3) are linked under the “Human Resources Development Basic Policies”.
Notes: 1. “Four orientations” refer to “Ownership oriented,” “Challenge oriented,” “Speed oriented,” and “Customer oriented,” which are listed as elements of our desired image of human resources.

ESG Investment
We will take on initiatives for realizing a sustainable society through asset management, considering ESG elements for the entire asset portfolio as an institutional investor that manages long-term assets.
ESG Investment Policy
From the perspective of fulfilling our social responsibilities to all stakeholders, we are promoting initiatives to solve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues facing society, and actively taking on challenges toward the sustainable growth of corporate value and social development.
In asset management, we will consider various factors of ESG in making investment decisions, in order to realize a sustainable society, improve investment results and reduce risks in the long-term.
We will integrate ESG factors into the investment processes (such as investment analyses and decision- making processes) in phases, according to the characteristics of respective assets. For example, we will invest in the environmentally-friendly natural energy power generation business, and will actively evaluate companies with technology, business foundations, and other characteristics that contribute to the solution of ESG issues in the area of internal domestic equity investments.
By appropriately conducting constructive dialogue and exercising voting rights in consideration of ESG factors, we will encourage investee companies to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society through their business activities, and to improve their corporate value. In addition, we will also seek substantial disclosure of non-financial information, including ESG factors, in order to improve our investment processes.
We will monitor the status of ESG investment activities at the investment managers that we do business with, and will encourage their ESG investment activities such as by sharing successful examples.
We will work on information exchange and collaboration with other institutional investors, industry groups, and others, in order to further contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.
We will disclose the status of our ESG investment activities regularly on our website and through disclosure and other materials.

I want to help resolve social issues through ESG investments
In the Investment Planning Department, I am in charge of the planning and promoting ESG investments. I am searching for solutions to issues every day, while interest is growing in environmental and social problems, which have a great impact on society in the medium to long term.

  Achieving carbon neutrality
To realize a decarbonized society, we will aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from FY2020/3 levels by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
To achieve the long-term target of the Paris Agreement, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 emissions) by cutting back on electricity consumption through energy-saving and streamlining facilities and vehicles and by using decarbonized power sources, on the basis of a shift to a carbon-neutral society including the associated technological innovation.
Based primarily on the results of an energy- saving diagnosis, we are improving the operation of

lighting and air-conditioning equipment, cutting back on energy consumption, mainly by installing energy-saving equipment, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 emissions) by introducing hybrid and eco-friendly vehicles.
By the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we reduced CO2 emissions by 9,148 t-CO2 (32% of total emissions) compared with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014.
In addition, we are working to reduce paper use by encouraging cutting back on copy paper and converting office forms to digital format.
  Supporting environmental conservation
We support programs to revitalize forests and increase greenery, such as making donations to forestation activities.
In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, we donated ¥2 million to the “Green Fund” operated by the National Land Afforestation Promotion Organization. This was used to support for such activities as reforestation by citizens’ groups.

Popularizing and promoting Radio Exercise
Radio Exercise is a popular exercise routine that anyone can participate in anywhere, anytime. Recently, people have come to spend more time at home due to COVID-19, so Radio Exercise has come to attract attention as an exercise that is easy to do at home.
We want to convey the warmth and attractiveness of Radio Exercise in order to use it as a solution to social issues such as health promotion and revitalization of local communities in an age of the 100-year life.
      We hold Radio Exercise events throughout Japan.
Festival of 10 Million People’s Radio Exercise and Minna no Taiso (“Exercise for Everyone”)
This is the biggest Radio Exercise event. We have held this event every year since 1962, and many people have participated in it through TV and radio.
Radio Exercise and Minna no Taiso Tour
We hold the summer tour (July 20 to August 31) and the special tour (April to October excluding the period of the summer tour), which are broadcast live on NHK Radio 1.
Radio Exercise Digital Tour/Digital Radio Exercise Competition
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Radio Exercise Tour was canceled due to COVID-19, so we held the “Radio Exercise Digital Tour” and “Digital Radio Exercise Competition” as alternative events (distribution of Radio Exercise videos). For the Radio Exercise Digital Tour, we donated the amount corresponding to the number of views of the videos as of the end of March 2021 (¥1,250,900) to the Japanese Red Cross Society to support the activities of health care practitioners and the prevention of infection.
All-Japan Elementary School Radio Exercise Competition
This competition for elementary school students started in 2014. The event contributes to developing the physical strength of elementary school students nationwide.

Every year, we create and distribute Radio Exercise Attendance Cards to many people through post offices and branches of Japan Post Insurance nationwide.

  Providing services through a health support app
With the advent of the super-aging society, the role expected of life insurance is no longer limited to conventional services. For example, we make insurance payments in cases such as hospitalization due to illness or injury, but includes providing services for preventing illness and injury, and for promoting and maintaining health. To fulfill such a role, we are vigorously supporting healthy and affluent lifestyles, and as a measure of this support, we have launched the Sukoyakanpo health support app which helps people pursue health with ease. The app is available for free, and features both the Standard menu for everyone, and the Premium menu with more enhanced content for policyholders and insured people, as well as policyholders’ families.

In addition, the “person responsible for management of human rights awareness” and “person in charge of human rights awareness” of each organization promote human rights initiatives, responding to problems related to human rights, and taking other actions.
Initiatives to eliminate of harassment
We believe that harassment in the workplace is a problem related to human rights and not only deeply impacts the dignity of individuals and causes irreparable damage to victims, but also negatively affects the people nearby and prevents all employees working in the same workplace from making full use of their abilities. We have stipulated “Prohibition of harassment” in the rules of employment and raise awareness through education as well as training to prevent harassment. In addition, we have set up a consultation desk to enable victims to consult us with a sense of security.
Human rights awareness training, education, and activities
We help to raise awareness of human rights at various ways, such as training by job level for officers, executive employees, administrators, new employees, etc. as well as DVD training, e-learning, workshops in the workplace, etc. for all employees.
In addition, we also invite employees to come up with human rights awareness slogans every year, and create and display posters of the best entries in all workplaces.

 Message from Outside Directors
 SUZUKI Masako
Outside Director
Detect risks and prevent recurrence
To prevent solicitation quality issues being repeated, we must detect risks by strengthening cross-organizational collaboration and incorporating varied viewpoints.
It is important to clarify the roles of each organization, strengthen cross- organizational collaboration, and maintain a checking function. To do this, Executive Officers will exchange opinions over the boundaries of their assigned duties and activate mutual information sharing and vertical two-way communication company-wide, which will strengthen the organization.
Face-to-face communication for education
Education is a must for promoting corporate culture restructuring, one of the big
themes of the Medium-Term Management Plan, and strengthening the autonomy
of the organization. I have been working in the human resources industry for
many years and believe that the development of human resources requres the
generosity to believe in subordinates and daringly assign jobs to them. When
doing this, face-to-face communication is important. Communication only in
writing is insipid and colorless from the viewpoint of subordinates. We need to have face-to-face communication with subordinates. I believe that the foundation of a company is its personnel and, if expectations and roles for subordinates can be conveyed clearly, trust will be received directly. This will become the first step to gaining customers’ trust.
Return to the starting line for the achievement of SDGs
It is important for the Company to be aware of sustainable management and work wholeheartedly to achieve the SDGs. In doing this, the initiatives will proceed more smoothly if the Company reviews the current methods from scratch and returns to the starting line-the stage of black-and-white photocopies. It will also be important to devise ways of having young employees be more proactively engaged in such familiar initiatives as their own jobs.
   SAITO Tamotsu
Outside Director
Ascertain both issues and solutions from the corporate front lines
I have been engaged in manufacturing, where we were told that we should observe the front lines, reality, and actual articles. This means that management and business is impossible without knowing what happens on the front lines. The basis for the hands-on policy is mutual dialogue.
The Company has had problems with in-house communication, such as the opinions of frontline employees not being delivered to management and instructions from superiors being one way only. To raise sensitivity to risk we do not overlook feelings of strangeness in each department, it is highly important to activate communication and ensure frequent communication across the boundaries between superiors and subordinates. The communication between the Head Office and front lines has been strengthened since the previous fiscal year. I want this trend to continue.
Be committed to protecting customers
To achieve the new Medium-Term Management Plan, every employee has to
consider what kind of role they want to fulfill in order to achieve the management
philosophy, which is the starting line and the objective. Every employee has to consider what it means to protect their customers through the power of insurance, to transmit opinions, and to take action. I expect the Company to fulfill an important role in society, commensurate to the trust placed in post offices.

  Management Base to Support Value Creation
 YAMADA Meyumi
Outside Director
Sincerely strive to regain customers’ trust
I believe that it is critically important for management to execute business from the viewpoint of customers, by fully grasping customer feedback through the front lines to detect risks correctly based on solicitation quality issues. To regain trust, it is necessary to continue to face customers with an attitude of sincerity. Open collaboration within the Group is also an important element, so it is vital for the Group to work together as one.
Fusion between real and digital means; Establish a mechanism that is easy to use for anyone
In the Medium-Term Management Plan, digital transformation (DX) is a big theme. Digitalization has been proceeding rapidly, and most consumers can connect to the Internet through smartphones, etc. Digitalization will improve the Company’s corporate value by eliminating the boundaries between real and digital means, and create services that customers can use without a sense of burden, in ways suitable for the conditions and their needs based on the Company’s features.
Challenge for ESG management
The world has begun to move towards decarbonization. As an institutional investor, we will be required to engage in investment activities from an ESG-focused perspective. In addition, as initiatives unique to the Company, we are also required to promote health through Radio Exercise, which many consumers are familiar with, and to provide services tailored to diverse consumers connecting insurance with health promotion through digital technologies. The promotion of these initiatives requires an environment where employees can work flexibly and comfortably. I expect the Company to trust employees and create a corporate culture with a high degree of autonomy for employees.
   HARADA Kazuyuki
Outside Director
What is the strength of an organization “with no escape”
“With tracks we cannot escape.” This is the fate of the railroad industry, is where I come from. Community-based business requires customers’ trust to secure availability even after 30 years or even 50 years. How about the Company? Community-based post offices are the basis of trust. These are also organizations with an inescapable role. They have not only to sell insurance but also manage a warm business with an attitude that supports the entire lives of customers.
Achieving corporate culture restructuring through Group wide efforts
I think that after privatization, the business of Japan Post Group has been
improved from the viewpoint of customers. The new Medium-Term Management
Plan is a plan to go one step further, but I consider that its base, corporate
culture restructuring is a difficult task because the organization of the Group is
gigantic and its human affairs are congested. There are also some indications of
obstacles, such as a sense of distance from the front lines. It is important to
proceed with initiatives for corporate culture restructuring through Group wide
efforts, deepening close communication especially between the Head Office and the front lines.
Good health and well-being
The third goal of the SDGs is “Good health and well-being.” Japan Post Insurance is right on this goal. I think that our mission is to expand the initiatives of Radio Exercise and support the lives of customers. The initiatives for the achievement of the SDGs are none other than doing business, and the Company is required to change society through business.

Deepen understanding of people and define risk sensitivity
The Company must raise risk sensitivity through organization-wide programs. It is necessary to accurately determine what kinds of events can become future risks. It is also necessary to be more sensitive to what’s going on in the world. Climate change problems and the SDGs are not issues we can handle alone, so we are required to be receptive to what happens outside the company and to raise our level of sensitivity.
An improvement in governance, which is an issue for the Company, and the achievement of the Medium-Term Management Plan depend on how strongly we can instill customer-first philosophy and to value employees.
Work for humans; Work only humans can do
A major pillar of this Medium-Term Management Plan is to strengthen the business infrastructure, including digital transformation (DX), but this requires deep underlying love and understanding of people. Both employees and customers are people. Even if digitalization goes ahead, we must not forget that our business is communication between humans.
What customers need and demand now -- I expect the Company to consider people and human interaction as the starting line, sincerely supporting customers by deepening understanding of others, and becoming a company selected by customers.

  Risk Management Systems
Outline of Risk Management Systems
In accordance with the “Basic Risk Management Policy,” we have set up and regularly convene the Risk Management Committee headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), while formulating rules of risk management.
The Risk Management Committee deliberates on risk management policies and matters concerning the establishment and operation of risk management systems as well as on matters concerning the implementation of risk management. This committee also performs appropriate risk management by monitoring and analyzing the status of each risk and other related matters. The CRO submits and reports on important matters to the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors for discussion.
Also, the CRO controls the Company’s risk management and builds, verifies and upgrades risk management systems in accordance with changes in risk management circumstances and the operating environment. The Risk Management Department is in charge of overall control of risk management and under the direction of the CRO executes affairs concerning building, verifying and upgrading risk management systems. At the same time, it regularly verifies the status of risk management by monitoring, analyzing and managing the state of risk management in sections responsible for performing risk management in each risk category (“risk management sections”).
Risk Management Structure
Each of the Executive Officers in charge of risk management sections operate and upgrade the systems for managing their respective assigned risks by ascertaining the presence, types and profile of risk, as well as the risk management techniques and systems as prescribed by the Basic Risk Management Policy. While operating a mutual checks and balances system with departments of the head office and branches in charge of business execution, risk management sections appropriately fulfill their monitoring role and manage their assigned risks in accordance with risk management standards. As investment risk and operational risk have multiple subcategories, we have designated the Risk Management Department for handling comprehensive risk management in conjunction with the risk management sections for respective subcategories.
In order to strengthen our risk management systems, the Internal Audit Department conducts internal audits and examines the appropriateness and effectiveness of our risk management systems.
In enforcing risk management, we collaborate with the risk management departments of Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. and JAPAN POST INSURANCE SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Co., Ltd., the Company’s subsidiary.

      I am a policyholder of Japan Post Insurance and interested in the coverage of the newly released special rider. May I change only the coverage of the special rider?
In April 2020, we introduced a conditional cancellation system in which the cancellation, etc. of an existing policy takes effect on the condition that a new policy is executed, which enabled us to revise coverage without interruption. In addition to it, we introduced a policy conversion system in April 2021. The policy conversion system is “total conversion of a policy” to replace the coverage of the current policy with that of the new one and “conversion of only the special rider” to replace the coverage of the current special rider with that of the new policy without cancelling the basic policy, both of which are customer-first systems to allow customers to revise coverage without canceling the current policy based on certain requirements.
    Related to purchase of insurance
Related to procedures
Related to payment of insurance claims, etc.
Other
I’m considering purchasing insurance. Is there any product with long-term coverage with low insurance premiums?
I am refraining from going out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so it will be helpful if I can claim hospitalization benefits, etc. without going to a post office.
It was troublesome to check “Yes” or “No” in many answer columns of the notification, so the procedure should be easier.
The policyholder, my father, died, and I will cancel his policy, so I want material through which I can grasp the necessary documents at a glance.
It was helpful that claims were paid when I was hospitalized for short time for an operation. The preparation for the claim procedure was troublesome: for example, it was necessary to have a filled out hospitalization certificate. The procedure should be easier.
I tried to check insurance products of Japan Post Insurance on the website, but the site was difficult to see with a smartphone, so it should be improved.
For ordinary term insurance, we previously provided only insurance with an insurance period of 10 years, but in April 2021, we started to provide products of four policy types expiring at the ages of 55, 60, 65, and 70, respectively, with the age range expanded to people aged 15 or older. In addition, we now provide long-term coverage with low insurance premiums to young and middle-aged customers by revising the premiums of the ordinary term insurance.
Even in the past, procedures such as changing an address could be completed through My Page of Japan Post Insurance. In addition, in November 2020, we added such procedures including “requesting documents for claiming hospitalization benefits, etc.” and “registering and changing registered family members” and will gradually add others in order to respond to the increasing demand for non-face-to- face use of services, etc.
*To perform procedures through My Page, certain conditions have to be met.
In April 2021, we revised the form of the notification such as integrating important matters and answer columns in order to make the importance of the notification understood clearly by customers and to reduce the burden of filling out the form.
In April 2021, we introduced a system to determine the documents necessary for procedures such as family registry depending on the inheritor who will perform the procedure based on the inheritor information and policy information received from customers, and provide a list of the documents.
In April 2021, we made it possible to make an insurance claim for hospitalization with surgery with a “circumstances of hospitalization/surgery form” filled out by the customer, a copy of a medical examination report issued by the medical institution, etc. instead of the hospitalization certificate filled out by the doctor.
*To use a “circumstances of hospitalization/surgery form,” it is necessary to meet certain requirements.
In December 2020, we revised the Web pages of all products for smartphone viewing so that they would be easier to see.
            I can check policy coverage with the “Notice of Policy Details” sent every year, so it should be described in a more easy-to- understand way.
   In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, we have enhanced the items described on the policy statement and have come to include a coverage list in order to make it easier for customers to understand their policy and coverage. In addition, for ease of confirmation by customers, we will send the policy statement separately from the Certificate of Premium Payment, which is delivered around October every year, during the birth month of policyholders born in July 2021 and onward.
*For policyholders who have not registered their birth date, we will send their policy statements in the contract month of their latest policies (month of effect).
  Gratitude/Compliments
The total number responses that were gratitude/compliments that we received from customers between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, was 338,711.
<Customer feedback>
- It was very helpful that the staff this time immediately visited the employee’s home to process the claim for payment of hospitalization benefits for an employee. The employee would have felt anxious due to long hospitalization and sick leave, so I felt that it was excellent that the sympathy of the company was conveyed to the employee so that the employee could feel secure about not only the financial aspect but also the benefits of the workplace.
- (We receive a request for claim for payment of hospitalization benefits, so we prepared it using the support system and accepted it). When I claimed payment for hospitalization benefits before, I had to fill in many items, but this time there were fewer items to be filled in, so the procedure was easy to complete. Because I am old, writing something is troublesome. It is helpful that there are few items to be filled in.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
We conduct a “Customer Satisfaction Survey (Customer Feedback Survey)” to directly receive opinions from customers who have purchased policies issued by the Company, and we use them to improve insurance services.
 Results of the FY2021/3 Customer Satisfaction Survey
For total satisfaction with our services, about 80% of customers show satisfaction (total of “Satisfied” and “Somewhat satisfied”). We will work to improve customer services to gain the satisfaction of more customers.
Not satisfied or dissatisfied

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the 15th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders was held with the health and safety of shareholders as the first priority. We took measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as taking temperature readings using thermography and other methods, wearing face masks, having alcohol sanitizer available, spacing the seats far apart, and making some Directors attend the meeting through an online meeting system. In addition, we accepted questions in advance through our website, and also provided a live stream via the Internet for shareholders who refrained from attending the meeting to view the proceedings.
We worked on ensuring early sending and disclosure of the Convocation Notice and made it
possible to view the points of the Convocation Notice on a smartphone so that our shareholders would have enough time to carefully review the proposals. Moreover, in addition to ensuring the exercise of voting rights via the Internet and introducing a mechanism to enable easy exercising of voting rights by scanning a 2D code with a smartphone, etc., we addressed the issue of improving how shareholders exercise their voting rights by participating in the virtual platform recommended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which allows institutional investors to exercise voting rights electronically.
At the meeting, we strived to explain our business lines using video materials to facilitate the understanding of shareholders. We also enhanced mutual understanding by answering questions received in advance and by holding a Q&A session with shareholders.
After the meeting, we swiftly disclosed the shareholder newsletter, the results of the exercised voting rights and other relevant information on the Company’s website as part of our efforts to improve the way we provide corporate information to shareholders.

Corporate Information
 Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan
Unlike the Postal Life Insurance Policies before privatization, the life insurance policies of Japan Post Insurance after privatization do not involve government guarantees for payment of insurance claims. The policyholders’ protection scheme applies to life insurance policies in the same way as other life insurance companies.
•Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan
Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan (“Protection Corporation”) is a corporation established pursuant to the Insurance Business Act. It serves as a mutual assistance mechanism for the purpose of life insurance policyholder protection in the event of the default of a member life insurance company. The Protection Corporation engages in processes and measures including financial support for facilitating the transfer of the insurance portfolio from the insurer in default, along with the succeeding insurer’s general business administration, underwriting of the transferred portfolio and financial support for the payment of insurance claims covered under the policyholder protection scheme, as well as the purchase of rights of claim for insurance concerned, in an effort to ensure policyholder protection, thereby sustaining the credibility of the life insurance industry.
Because of the nature of life insurance policies, taking out a new insurance policy under the same conditions as the insurer in default could involve some difficulty due to the policyholder’s age and health status. Therefore, in the event of the default of an insurance company, the Protection Corporation provides financial support for the transfer of the insurance portfolio, thereby ensuring continuous insurance coverage for the policyholder.
The portfolio subject to transfer covered under the policyholder protection scheme must, according to the provisions of the Insurance Business Act, etc., comprise life insurance policies originally written in Japan (excluding those associated with the specified special account (*1) for performance-linked insurance contracts), in which the limits of indemnity are set to be equivalent to 90% of the relevant policy reserve, etc. (*2), except for the high assumed interest rate
policies (*3) (which does not mean that the policyholder protection scheme provides 90% of the level of protection provided by the original insurance claims or annuities (*4)).
The transfer of the insurance portfolio might involve, apart from the reduction in policy reserve, etc., changes in experience assumptions (including assumed interest rate, assumed rate of mortality and assumed rate of expenses) that serve as the basis of calculating policy terms and conditions, in order to ensure adequate maintenance of the insurance portfolio with reasonable security on a continuous basis, which could entail a reduction in the level of protection provided by the original insurance policies or annuities. Furthermore, special early surrender loading (involving a special surrender charge apart from the normal surrender charge for a certain period of time, for the purpose of sustaining a group of insured parties and the insurance policies associated therewith) might be established.

Indemnity ratio in the high assumed interest rate policies
= 90%
-
[aggregate of (assumed interest
rate less basic interest rate in ÷ 2] each year in the past 5 years)
Notes:1. The basic interest rate shall be determined by the Commissioner of the Financial Services Agency and the Minister of Finance, based on the average rate of investment returns in the past five years at life insurance companies. The current basic interest rate is 3% (information about the current basic interest rate is provided on our website).
2. In the case where different assumed interest rates apply to the basic coverage and riders under one policy, each such basic coverage and rider applied by a different assumed interest rate shall be regarded as an independent insurance policy, and subject to the evaluation to determine whether it constitutes a high assumed interest rate policy. Meanwhile, in the case of a collective insurance policy such as a group insurance policy where a premium is paid by each insured individual to whom a different assumed interest rate applies, each such insured individual is considered to have taken out an independent insurance policy individually, and is subject to the evaluation regarding whether or not such independent individual policy constitutes a high assumed interest rate policy. However, in the case of defined contribution plan products, each insured individual is subject to the evaluation regarding whether or not he/she is a holder of a high assumed interest rate policy, regardless of whether he/she pays the premium.
*1 This refers to a special account for the insurance policies that do not involve minimum guarantees (such as guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum maturity benefit) of the insurance policies involving the establishment of a special account. Corporate reorganization procedures for the insurer in default might be based on the preparation of a reorganization plan without involving a reduction in the policy reserve, etc., for the insurance policies concerned (whether implementing such reduction or not shall be determined in the course of an individual reorganization procedure).
*2 Policy reserve, etc. refers to the reserve funded based on insurance premiums and investment proceeds for the future payment of insurance claims, annuities and benefits.
*3 This refers to the policies with an assumed interest rate constantly beyond a basic interest rate (Note 1) in the five years prior to the default (Note 2). For such policies, the limit of indemnity for the policy reserve, etc. shall be as follows, provided, however, that such limit shall not go below the limit of reimbursement in the case where no financial support is provided to the insurer in default.
*4 Likewise, it does not mean that the Protection Corporation provides 90% of the level of the guaranteed minimum maturity benefit originally provided under the individual variable annuity.

Notes: 1. The aforementioned “public financial support” is provided in the form of a government measure against the default of a life insurance company in the period up to the end of March 2022, approved through deliberation in the Diet, in the case where contributions by the member insurers fail to cover the cost for the financial support.
2. This refers to the payment of insurance claims, covered under the policyholder protection scheme based on insurable events during the default proceedings, as well as the Protection Corporation’s purchase of rights to claim insurance money, etc. associated with the insurance policies covered under the policyholder protection scheme. In such instances, the payment ratio and purchase ratio are the same as the ratio of the limit of indemnity for policy reserve, etc. (The ratios in the case of high assumed interest rate policies are as described in (*).)
* All descriptions of the scheme, including the scope and the limit of indemnity of the policies covered under the policyholder protection scheme, are based on current laws and regulations, and could be subject to change in the future in accordance with revisions of relevant laws and regulations.
[Reference] Government guarantee for the Postal Life Insurance Policies
The administration of the Postal Life Insurance Policies taken out before privatization will be succeeded and managed by the Management Network until expiry. The government guarantee for the payment of insurance claims associated with them will continue until those policies expire.
Unlike the Postal Life Insurance Policies, the life insurance policies of Japan Post Insurance do not involve a government guarantee for the payment of insurance claims. The policyholders’ protection scheme applies to the life insurance policies in the same way as other life insurance companies.

Corporate Information
 Principal Risk Categories and Definitions
We manage risk by designating risk management sections in respective risk categories. The Risk Management Department, which is in charge of the overall control of risk management, verifies the status of respective risk management sections based on their reports, while periodically reporting on relevant matters to the Risk Management Committee.
Risk management in each risk category is described in the sections below.
Insurance Underwriting Risk
Life insurance policies are contracts that provide long- term coverage to policyholders against the risk of death, illness or injury. When underwriting, we need to make an accurate assessment and analysis of potential risks and appropriately reflect identified risks in the corresponding premiums.
Accordingly, we undertake such activities as verifying our setting of premium rates and assessing and analyzing the occurrence of insured events.
The Economic Value Promotion Office, Actuarial and Accounting Department, which is the section that manages underwriting risk, conducts risk management appropriately by measuring the amount
Investment Risk
To provide for anticipated payment of insurance claims and other benefits, we need to carefully manage funds entrusted to us from customers under life insurance policies.
Based on this perspective, in order to maintain sound management and offer assurance to customers, we have a basic investment policy to ensure stable asset management by investing in and financing yen-denominated interest-bearing assets, such as Japanese public and corporate bonds and loans, matched to the long-term and fixed interest rate characteristics of our liabilities. With a view to improving profitability, we also deepen and sophisticate asset management, considering market constraints and soundness.
Funding Risk
The life insurance business involves making and receiving payments to and from customers and business partners as we pay insurance claims and other benefits and conduct fund management. Any trouble in the settlement of these funds will not just cause inconvenience to the parties concerned but will also lead to situations that preclude the continued operation of the business itself.
To avoid such situations and ensure smooth cash flows, we enforce rigorous fund management by monitoring incoming and outgoing cash flows, including the receipt of premiums and payment of insurance claims, on a daily basis.
of insurance underwriting risk, evaluating the profitability of each product sold and verifying the appropriateness of our underwriting standards from a medical perspective.
As required in managing insurance underwriting risk, we cede reinsurance upon fully studying the financial status of reinsurers. On the other hand, when underwriting reinsurance, we secure the required information, study the profitability and risk characteristics and verify whether the underwriting risk is limited so as to cause no serious impact on management.
The Risk Management Department, which is the section in charge of investment risk management, the Credit Assessment Department and the General Affairs Department are assigned the task of managing investment risk. These sections monitor investment risk and enforce appropriate management under a checks and balances system with departments of the head office in charge of business execution. The Risk Management Department provides comprehensive management of investment risk, working in collaboration with the Credit Department and General Affairs Department. Meanwhile, we strive to develop adequate risk management systems according to the risk profiles of our asset portfolio which is becoming advanced and sophisticated.
The Cash-Flow and Expense Management Department, which is the section responsible for funding risk management, has defined categories corresponding to cash flow tightness and established risk management standards in each category. The section implements appropriate management of funding risk by performing management and verification in accordance with these standards. Moreover, we carry out stress tests related to funding risks, assuming a large amount of policy surrenders and lapses, in an effort to improve cash flow management.

 Market Liquidity Risk
We might sell assets in which we have made investments using funds entrusted to us from customers, and could incur losses when we are forced to execute such transactions at extremely unfavorable prices compared to normal or are unable to execute such transactions at all because of market turmoil.
Accordingly, we make investments primarily in assets with high liquidity.
Operational Risk
Our executives and employees strive to prevent operational risks that could cause inconvenience to our customers or corporate losses, and to appropriately respond when such risks occur. We have designated risk management sections in each detailed subcategory of operational risk, thereby identifying and assessing the location, scale and
1) Processing Risk
Errors in business processing will cause considerable inconvenience to customers and result in the loss of our credibility. Departments of the head office and branches autonomously assess and address accidents that have occurred in the past and those that could foreseeably occur. This information is used to formulate and develop rules and standards to facilitate prompt and accurate administrative
2) Computer System Risk
Under the current situation where an extensive scope of our business processing relies on information sys- tems, major system failures or delays in system devel- opment could cause considerable inconvenience to customers and result in the loss of our credibility. Therefore, as the section responsible for computer system risk management, the IT Management Department strives to reduce computer system risk by verifying and supervising that the risk is appropriately managed by system administration personnel in the departments that maintain information systems.
3) Other Operational Risk Subcategories
Other detailed subcategories of operational risk are legal risk, human risk, reputational risk, tangible asset risk, outsourcing risk and compliance risk. For each subcategory, we designate a section to handle risk
The Risk Management Department, which is the section in charge of market liquidity risk management, has established management standards to limit the holding of securities with low liquidity, etc. The section implements the appropriate management of market liquidity risk by performing management and verifica- tion in accordance with these standards.
nature of company-wide operational risk and managing the risk according to severity. In this way, we prevent operational risk from materializing and minimize losses in the event it does. The Risk Management Department works in collaboration with these risk management sections and provides comprehensive management of operational risk.
processing, as well as to supervise and educate employees.
The Business Process Planning Department, which is the section in charge of processing risk management, evaluates and verifies whether risk management is appropriately conducted in each organization and makes efforts to suppress and minimize processing risk.
We have formulated a manual to respond to a major system failure and set up a structure to take immediate action. For the overall information systems for Japan Post Insurance, our main systems, we operate main computer centers as well as backup centers in order to respond to risk resulting from a system failure. In case of a system failure, we investigate the impact on customers, analyze the causes and implement appropriate countermeasures in order to prevent recurrence.

 1 Summary of Consolidated Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2021
To address the issues related to solicitation quality that occurred during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we have made company-wide efforts including investigation into insurance policies to eliminate disadvantages for customers and implementing preventive countermeasures. As for sales activities of products, which we have suspended and refrained from conducting since July 2019, we resumed our activities aimed at regaining customers’ trust last October, placing top priority on apologizing to our customers. We then shifted to a new sales stance in April this year to reconstruct trust relationships with customers through sales activities by proposing insurance products and services in accordance with the needs of customers.
In response to the global spread of COVID-19, we have implemented a measure to include death due to COVID-19 in the scope of double payment of insurance benefits, the extension of the grace period for payment of premiums, and investments in COVID-19 bonds for the purpose of infectious disease countermeasures. We have continued initiatives like this to protect the lives of customers and support society as a whole as a life insurance company.
Ordinary income amounted to ¥6,786.2 billion (5.9% decrease year on year), comprising the sum of insurance premiums and others of ¥2,697.9 billion (16.9% decrease year on year), investment income of ¥1,121.6 billion (1.4% decrease year on year), and other ordinary income of ¥2,966.6 billion (4.9% increase year on year).
Ordinary expenses amounted to ¥6,440.4 billion (7.0% decrease year on year), comprising the sum of insurance claims and others of ¥5,866.0 billion (5.3% decrease year on year), investment expenses of ¥70.8 billion (42.9% decrease year on year), operating expenses of ¥403.0 billion (14.9% decrease year on year), and other ordinary expenses of ¥100.4 billion (25.9% decrease year on year).
As a result, ordinary profit amounted to ¥345.7 billion (20.6% increase year on year), and net income attributable to Japan Post Insurance amounted to ¥166.1 billion (10.2% increase year on year), which is calculated by subtracting extraordinary losses, provision for reserve for policyholder dividends, and total income taxes from ordinary profit.

100 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

 JAPAN POST INSURANCE CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 AND 2020
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of JA- PAN POST INSURANCE Co., Ltd. (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations concerning preparation of con- solidated financial statements, the Ordinance for Enforcement of Insurance Business Act and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of the International Financial Report- ing Standards. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain re- classifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form that is more familiar to readers outside Ja- pan.
All Japanese yen figures in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen, except for per share information. Accordingly, the total of each account might not be equal to the combined total of individual items.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorpo- rated and mainly operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the conve- nience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.71 to US$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2021. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(1) Consolidation and Equity Method 1) Scope of consolidation
Under Japanese GAAP, a company is required to con- solidate any subsidiary when the company substantially controls the operations of the subsidiary, even if it is not majority owned. Control is defined as the power to govern the decision-making body of an enterprise. The consolidated financial statements for all periods presented include the accounts of the Company and a subsidiary, JAPAN POST INSUR- ANCE SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Co., Ltd. (collectively, the “Group”). There are no non-consolidated subsidiaries.
2) Application of the equity method
A company is required to apply the equity method ac- counting to its non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates under Japanese GAAP. There are no non-consolidated subsidiaries that qualify for the equi- ty method accounting, while the Company has 3 affiliates in 2021 (3 in 2020) including Japan Post In- vestment Corporation that are not accounted for by the equity method because their net income (loss), re- tained earnings and others are immaterial, and the exclusion of these companies from the scope of com-
panies accounted for by the equity method does not hinder a reasonable understanding of the Group’s fi- nancial position and results of operations.
3) Fiscal year-end date of the consolidated subsidiary
The fiscal year-end date of the consolidated subsidi- ary is the same as the consolidated balance sheet date.
(2) Securities
Securities including cash and deposits, as well as mone- tary claims bought, which are equivalent to securities, and securities invested in money held in trust, are record- ed based on the following:
1) Held-to-maturity bonds
Held-to-maturity bonds are carried at amortized cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculated us- ing the moving-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
2) Policy-reserve-matching bonds
In accordance with the “Temporary Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Policy-Reserve- Matching Bonds in the Insurance Industry” (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 21), policy- reserve-matching bonds are carried at amortized cost and the cost of these securities sold is calculated using the moving-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
3) Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates that are not accounted for by the equity method
Investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affil- iates that are not accounted for by the equity method are carried at cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculated using the moving-average method.
4) Available-for-sale securities
A) Available-for-sale securities at fair value
Available-for-sale securities at fair value are carried at their fiscal year-end market price, of which the average market prices during the final month of the fiscal year are used to value stocks. The cost of se- curities sold is calculated using the moving-average method.
B) Available-for-sale securities for which the fair val- ues are deemed extremely difficult to determine Government and corporate bonds (including foreign bonds) without a market price for which the premium or discount represents the interest adjustments are carried at the amortized cost (the straight-line meth- od) using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at cost using the moving-aver- age method.
Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for- sale securities, net of income taxes, are included in net assets.
(3) Derivative Transactions
All derivative transactions are valued at fair value.

 (4) Hedge Accounting
1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for for- eign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its for- eign-currency-denominated bonds, as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Ac- counting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the con- tract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
A) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-denominated bonds
B) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign-currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the ag- gregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted in cases of foreign ex- change contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or in- terest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.
(5) Depreciation
1) Tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated us- ing the straight-line method based on the following useful lives:
Buildings : 2–60 years
(7)
specific allowances, which are determined based on in- dividual collectability of accounts, are recorded.
All loans and claims are assessed initially by the rele- vant departments based on internal rules for self-assessment of asset quality. The asset evaluation de- partment, which is independent from the relevant departments, reviews these self-assessments. The above reserves and allowances are recorded based on the re- sults of these assessments.
For loans and guaranteed loans that were extended to borrowers that have filed for bankruptcy, including legal bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation, or that are considered substantially bankrupt, an allowance is provided for in the amount of loans, net of collateral value or the amounts expected to be recoverable under guarantees. The re- serve for possible loan losses also includes amounts set aside for other assets subject to valuation allowance. The amounts written off for loans and other assets during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, were ¥96 million ($1 million) and ¥49 million, respectively.
Policy Reserves
To prepare for the fulfilment of future obligations under the insurance contracts with respect to policies that have commenced as of the fiscal year-end, policy reserves are calculated in accordance with the statement of calcula- tion methodology for insurance premiums and policy reserves (Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 4 of the Insurance Business Act) and accumulated, pursuant to Article 116, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act.
The amount of policy reserves may be affected if actu- al results of basis of the calculation of policy reserves such as assumed mortality rates, assumed interest rates, and expected rate of expenses deviate significantly or deviations are expected in the future due to changes in the environment.
Among the policy reserves, insurance premium re- serves are calculated based on the following methodology. The amount includes additional policy reserves accumu- lated for the portion of the reinsurance contracts issued to the Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insur- ance and Post Office Network (hereinafter the “Management Network”), and for lump-sum payment annuities, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Or- dinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
1) Reserves for contracts subject to the standard policy
reserves are calculated in accordance with the meth- od prescribed by the Commissioner for Financial Services Agency (Public notice No. 48 issued by the Ministry of Finance in 1996).
2) Reserves for other contracts are calculated based on the net level premium method.
Pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance
for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, effective from the year ended March 31, 2011, additional policy re- serves were accumulated, in preparation for the fulfilment of future obligations, over a 10-year period for a portion of the reinsurance contracts from the Management Net- work. As a result, the amount of provision for additional policy reserves was ¥176,734 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.
In addition, for the year ended March 31, 2021, addi- tional policy reserves were accumulated for a portion of
Other tangible fixed assets:
2–20 years
2) Intangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
The capitalized development costs of software intend- ed for internal use are amortized over the expected useful life of mainly 5 years using the straight-line method.
3) Leased assets
The Group mainly leases vehicles under finance lease arrangements that do not transfer the ownership of leased property to the lessee.

 the reinsurance contracts from the Management Network, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act. As a result, the amount of additionally accumulated policy reserves was ¥245,841 million ($2,221 million). However, there is no impact on ordinary profit and income before income taxes due to the reversal of contingency reserves in the same amount.
Among the policy reserves, contingency reserves are accumulated to ensure the fulfilment of future obligations under insurance contracts in preparation of possible fu- ture risks, pursuant to Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
The Chief Actuary, pursuant to Article 121, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 80 of the Or- dinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, confirms whether the policy reserves as of the fiscal year- end have been appropriately accumulated.
The Management Network was established in October 2007 to support the privatization of Japan Post by suc- ceeding from Japan Post postal savings such as fixed amount or term postal savings deposited and Postal Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 to ensure that such postal savings and Postal Life Insurance are managed appropriately and to fulfill the relevant liabil- ities without fail.
The Company has entered into the reinsurance con- tracts comprising outsourcing agreements for the administrative operation of the Postal Life Insurance and the reinsurance contracts for insurance liabilities based on former Postal Life Insurance Contracts, for Postal Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 that have been assumed by the Management Network.
In addition, based on the master plan by the Postal Service Privatization Act, with respect to the amount equivalent to that lent to policyholders of the Postal Life Insurance Contracts and to Japanese local governments and others succeeded from Japan Post Corporation, the Company has lent loans to the Management Network un- der the same loan conditions as those of the contracts between Japan Post and its counterparties.
(8) Insurance Premiums
The first premium is recorded for premiums that have been collected and for which the policy has commenced, in the amount collected. Premiums thereafter are record- ed in the amount of each collection.
The portion of collected insurance premiums corre- sponding to the unexpired period as of the fiscal year- end are accumulated as policy reserves, pursuant to Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
(9) Insurance Claims and Others
When an insured event occurs and payment is made in the amount calculated based on the insurance contract, insurance claims and others (excluding reinsurance pre- miums) are recorded in the amount of the payment.
Reserve for outstanding claims has been accumulated for insurance claims and others, for which payment is due but has not been paid at the fiscal year-end, and for which
the occurrence of the insured event has not been reported but the Company deems that the insured event provided in the insurance contract has occurred but not yet paid, pursuant to Article 117 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 72 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insur- ance Business Act.
(Additional information)
The Company has applied “Accounting Standard for
Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (ASBJ Statement No. 24, March 31, 2020) to its consolidated financial statements from the year ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company has stated “(8) Insurance Premiums” and “(9) Insurance Claims and Others” as accounting principles and proce- dures adopted in cases where the relevant accounting standards are not clear.
(10) Reserve for Insurance Claims and Others
With regard to policies that have been discovered through investigations to have likely caused disadvantages to customers in a way that is not in line with their intentions, reserve for insurance claims and others is provided in the projected amount of insurance claims and others arising due to future policy measures to compensate customers for their disadvantages, based on the past record of ef- forts to address such disadvantages.
(11) Retirement Benefits
In calculating the projected benefit obligation, the benefit formula basis is used to attribute the expected benefit to the respective service period.
The actuarial difference is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employees from the fiscal year following the respec- tive fiscal year in which the difference is incurred.
Prior service cost is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employ- ees in the fiscal year of incurrence.
(Additional information)
In August 2020, the Company decided on and notified
all concerned of the change to the Retirement Allowance Regulations effective October 1, 2020, whereby the lump- sum severance indemnity plans were revised in association with the extension of mandatory retirement age from 60 to 65. Due to this change, retirement benefit obligations decreased and prior service cost (favorable variance) of ¥1,273 million ($11 million) was recognized.
(12) Reserve for Management Board Benefit Trust
To provide for the granting of shares and others of the Company to executive officers of the Company in accor- dance with the stock benefit rules, reserve for management board benefit trust is provided in the pro- jected amount of stock benefit obligations.
(13) Reserve for Price Fluctuations

(18) Additional Information
1) Transactions for granting shares and others of the
Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust
The Company has introduced a trust-based perfor- mance-linked stock compensation system for executive officers of the Company from the year end- ed March 31, 2017.
The Company has adopted “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc., through Trusts” (Practical Issues Task Force (“PITF”) No. 30, March 26, 2015) with re- spect to the accounting treatment of the aforementioned trust agreement.
A) Outline of the transaction
In accordance with predetermined stock benefit rules, the Company shall grant its executive officers a certain number of points depending on the per- formance for the fiscal year, and later shall have the Board Benefit Trust (BBT) grant executive officers who meet the requirements for eligibility at the time
of their retirement a given number of shares of the Company equivalent to the number of such points accumulated up to their retirement, as well as the amount of money equivalent to a certain portion of such number of shares, as calculated by the fair value at the time of their retirement.
Shares to be granted to executive officers, in- cluding the portion of shares to be granted in the future, are managed separately as trust assets through purchases by the trust bank from the stock market using the fund held in trust in advance by the Company.
B) Shares of the Company held in trust
Shares of the Company held in trust are recorded as treasury stock under the category of net assets at book value in the trust (excluding accompanying expenses). The book value of such treasury stock at the end of the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, was ¥367 million ($3 million) and ¥393 mil- lion, respectively, while the number of such treasury stock was 156 thousand shares and 166 thousand shares, respectively.
2) Efforts to regain to customers’ trust
On December 27, 2019, the Company received ad- ministrative dispositions pursuant to the Insurance Business Act from the Financial Services Agency of Japan, on account of improper solicitation actions and underlying systematic problems. The Company is re- solved to treat the implementation of the business improvement plan that it formulated as its top-priority management issue and is making company-wide ef- forts to do so. In addition, the Company has been confirming with all customers with insurance policies whether their insurance policies are in line with their intentions and compensating customers who have suf- fered disadvantages.
At the year ended March 31, 2020, the company reasonably estimated insurance-related expenses to be incurred due to the refund of premiums and the payment of insurance claims to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by customers, and recorded reserve for insurance claims and others in the amount of ¥29,722 million.
In the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded the refund of premiums and the payment of insurance claims to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by customers as part of insurance claims and others, and the corresponding adjustment to policy re- serves as part of reversal of policy reserves, while recording a reduction of the net amount totaling ¥21,589 million ($195 million) from reserve for insur- ance claims and others at the end of the previous fiscal year, and a reversal of ¥5,280 million ($48 mil- lion), as a result of reflecting the progress in the investigation of insurance policies in accounting esti- mates. Consequently, reserve for insurance claims and others stood at ¥2,851 million ($26 million) as of March 31, 2021. The amounts of the aforementioned reduction and reversal of reserve for insurance claims and others are included in other ordinary income in the consolidated statement of income for the year end- ed March 31, 2021.

 6. LOANS
There were no bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans, past due loans for three months or more, or restructured loans as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. Definitions for each of the respective loans are as follows:
Bankrupt loans refer to non-accrual loans, excluding the balances already written off, which meet the conditions prescribed in Article 96, Paragraph 1, Item 3-(a) to (e) and Item 4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act (Ordinance No. 97 in 1965). The interest accruals of such loans are suspended because the principal or interest on such loans is unlikely to be collect- ed due to delinquency in payments for them for a considerable period of time or other reasons.
Non-interest accrual loans are those loans for which interest payments have been suspended to assist and support the bor- rowers in the restructuring of their business.
Past due loans for three months or more are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date, excluding those classified as bankrupt loans and non-accrual loans.
Restructured loans are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business. This category excludes loans classified as bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans and past due loans for three months or more.

25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(1) Policy for Handling Financial Instruments
The Company promotes matching between assets and li- abilities using yen-denominated interest-bearing assets, taking into consideration the characteristics of liabilities so as to maintain sound management and ensure pay- ments for insurance claims and others. The Company endeavors to invest in yen-denominated bonds such as Japanese local government bonds and Japanese corpo- rate bonds, of which the yield is expected to be relatively higher than that of Japanese government bonds, as well as in return-seeking assets (previously referred to as risk assets) including foreign bonds and stocks from the per- spective of improving profitability and strengthening the risk management system.
Derivative transactions are used mainly as a hedging method against foreign exchange fluctuation risk and in- terest rate risk to our investment assets.
(2) Features and Risks of Financial Instruments
Financial assets owned by the Company consist mainly of securities and loans and are managed by using an asset liability management (ALM) framework. Such secu- rities are exposed to credit risk of their issuing bodies as well as market price fluctuation risk and interest rate risk. In addition, foreign-currency-denominated bonds are ex- posed to foreign exchange risk. Moreover, the Company owns loans with floating interest rates, which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Derivative transactions that the Company uses are mainly foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. These are identified as a key hedging method against foreign exchange fluctuation risk and interest rate risk. Other derivative transactions are also used mainly for the purpose of hedging, and the market-related risk of derivative transactions is therefore reduced and limited.
(3) Risk Management Framework for Financial Instruments 1) Management of market risk
Market risk is the risk of losses resulting from fluctua- tion in the value of assets and liabilities held that include off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in various market risk factors such as inter- est rates, foreign exchange rates and stock prices. Market risk is categorized into interest rate risk and market price fluctuation risk for its management. Inter- est rate risk is the risk of losses resulting from fluctuation in the value of interest-bearing assets de- nominated in yen and insurance liabilities due to fluctuations in yen interest rates, and the risk arises as the Company has a certain limit in matching assets with liabilities as an insurance company with a mission to offer universal service products including endow- ment insurance and whole life insurance. Market price fluctuation risk is any market risk other than interest rate risk.
Among the company-wide risks including market risk, the Company identifies those that can be quanti- fied and manages the company-wide risks by comparing the capital amount and the company-wide integrated risk amount calculated based on the amount of the quantified risks.
2) Management of credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of losses resulting from a decline or elimination in the value of assets including off-bal- ance-sheet assets due to deterioration in the financial conditions of borrowers and other reasons.
To control investment and lending to borrowers with high credit risk, the Company manages its investment and lending by prescribing credit eligibility rules based on internal rating. Moreover, to prevent concen-
  118 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

 tration of credit risk on a particular borrower, group or industry, the Company establishes credit limits corre- sponding to internal rating and standards of credit shares by industry.
The results of their activities are reported to the risk management committee regularly.
(4) Additional Notes Concerning the Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument includes prices based on market quotations as well as rationally calculat- ed prices for those for which the market prices are not readily available. In calculating prices, certain premises

120 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

 The calculation methods for fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Assets
1) Cash and deposits
Deposits (including negotiable certificates of deposit) mature within the short term (one year), and their fair val- ue approximates book value.
2) Call loans and 3) Receivables under securities borrowing transactions
These are settled within the short term (one year), and
their fair value approximates book value.
4) Monetary claims bought
The fair value of monetary claims bought accounted for as securities in “Accounting Standard for Financial Instru- ments” (ASBJ Statement No. 10) is calculated in a similar manner to the method described in 6) “Securities” below.
5) Money held in trust
The fair value of money held in trust is based on the price quoted by the exchange for stocks and the net asset val- ue for mutual funds.
Money held in trust is provided in Note 4 (4) “Money Held in Trust” in accordance with the purpose of the hold- ings.
6) Securities
The fair value of bonds is primarily based on the price published by industry associations such as the reference statistical price published by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, or the price offered by the financial institu- tions, while the fair value of stocks is based on the price quoted by the exchange. The fair value of mutual funds is based on the net asset value.
Securities are described in Note 4 “SECURITIES” in ac- cordance with the purpose of keeping in possession.
7) Loans
For policy loans and those included in loans to the Man- agement Network of Postal Life Insurance Contracts, book values are used as fair values because amounts are limit- ed to the values of the corresponding cash surrender value, and their fair value approximates book value con- sidering their short maturities and interest conditions.
For industrial and commercial loans with floating inter- est rates, for which the future cash flows follow market interest rates, their fair value approximates book value.
For industrial and commercial loans with fixed interest rates or loans to the Management Network (excluding poli- cy loans), fair value is based on a net discounted present value of future cash flows.

Derivatives
Notes on the fair value of derivatives are presented in Note 26 “DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.” Interest rate swaps subject to exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps are jointly dis- closed with hedged industrial and commercial loans. Therefore, their fair values are included in the relevant indus- trial and commercial loans.

 Notes:
1. Based on the concept that the benefits of brand value enjoyed by the Company from maintaining its membership in Japan Post Group are reflected on the Company’s
performance, brand royalty fees are calculated by multiplying the amount of insurance policies in force as of the end of the previous fiscal year, which is a financial indi-
cator whereupon such benefits have been reflected, by a fixed rate.
2. The Company makes payments including commission of insurance solicitation calculated by multiplying the insurance amounts and the insurance premiums of each
contract by the commission rates set for each class of insurance, and the commission of maintenance and collection calculated by multiplying the unit prices set for
each type of outsourcing services, such as the collection of insurance premiums and payments for insurance money, by the volume of work.
3. Transaction amount does not include consumption taxes. Year-end balance includes consumption taxes.
4. In addition to the above, from the year ended March 31, 2020, out of the expenses required for the maintenance of the post office network, the expenses necessary to
ensure universal service will be covered by the funds provided to JAPAN POST Co., Ltd., from the Management Network using the contributions from the Company and JAPAN POST BANK Co., Ltd., as funds, with the exception of the amount to be borne by JAPAN POST Co., Ltd., in accordance with the Act on Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insurance and Post Office Network. In the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the contributions paid by the Company to the Management Net- work amounted to ¥56,063 million ($506 million) and ¥57,574 million, respectively.

    Accuracy of the calculation and sufficiency of policy reserves
   The key audit matter
In the consolidated balance sheet of Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiary, Policy reserves of ¥59,397,720 million were recognized as of March 31, 2021, accounting for a significant portion (88.2%) of total liabilities therein.
As described in Note 2, “SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, (7) Policy Reserves”, policy reserves are set aside for the fulfilment of future obligations under the insurance contracts pursuant to the Insurance Business Act and other applicable laws and regulations (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Act”).
Pursuant to the Act, policy reserves, which represent a large portion of total liabilities of an insurance company, are required to be accumulated each accounting period in accordance with the statements of calculation methodology approved by the Financial Services Agency in Japan (FSA). In addition, the Act requires an insurance company to validate the sufficiency of policy reserves, and an additional policy reserve may be required to be provided for, as necessary.
Policy reserves are calculated based on certain calculation assumptions affecting long-term future cash flows, such as assumed mortality rates, assumed interest rates, and expected operating expense ratios. The calculation formula for policy reserves stipulated in the statements of calculation methodology approved by the FSA is complex, and therefore involves a high level of expertise in actuarial valuation. In addition, pursuant to the Act, in order to validate the sufficiency of policy reserves, an analysis on future income and expenses must be performed by the chief actuary. This analysis requires significant management judgment on assumptions underlying the estimate of future cash flows, such as a level of insurance product sales, the amount of insurance claims and other benefit payments, investment income and operating
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In order to assess whether the calculation of policy reserves was accurate and the amount of policy reserves was sufficient, we performed the following procedures, among others, by involving actuarial specialists and IT system specialists within our firm:
(1) Internal control testing
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls over the processes to ensure the accuracy of the calculation and sufficiency of policy reserves. In the assessment, special attention was given to the following controls:
 IT controls over the policy reserve calculation system to ensure the accuracy of the calculation of policy reserves;
 controls that the actuarial-related departments ensure that policy reserves are recognized completely for all of the Company’s insurance contracts;
 controls that the actuarial-related departments ensure the accuracy of the calculation of policy reserves by reperforming the calculation of policy reserves on a sample basis, and assessing the consistency with the amount of policy reserves calculated by a system other than the policy reserve calculation system used for financial reporting purpose; and
 controls that the Company’s management receives the opinion report of the chief actuary to evaluate the sufficiency of policy reserves.
(2) Assessment of the accuracy of the calculation of policy reserves
 We confirmed that the policy reserves for existing insurance products whose policy reserve rates were revised during the current fiscal year were accurately calculated in accordance with the statements of calculation methodology approved by the FSA through recalculation; and
 We confirmed that the changes in policy reserves from the previous fiscal year were consistent with insurance premium, insurance claims and operating expenses for the current fiscal year.
(3) Assessment of the sufficiency of the amount of policy reserves

    expenses, which involves a high level of expertise in actuarial valuation.
We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the accuracy of the calculation and sufficiency of policy reserves was one of the most significant matters in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.
 We assessed whether the amount of policy reserves was sufficient by confirming that an analysis on future income and expenses was appropriately performed pursuant to the Act in accordance with the “Standard of Practice for Appointed Actuaries of Life Insurance Companies” issued by the Institute of Actuaries of Japan, and comparing the amount of policy reserves with the calculation results of the previous fiscal year; and
 We assessed the contents of the opinion and supplementary reports of the chief actuary considering the chief actuary’s opinion, and inquired of the chief actuary about the reports.
      Reasonableness of management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets
   The key audit matter
In the consolidated balance sheet of Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiary, Deferred tax assets of ¥904,135 million were recognized as of March 31, 2021. As described in Note 15, “DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES” to the consolidated financial statements, the amount of gross deferred tax assets before being offset by deferred tax liabilities amounted to ¥1,336,093 million. Of this amount, the deferred tax assets related to policy reserves and reserve for price fluctuations were ¥1,011,450 million and ¥223,044 million, respectively, accounting for a significant portion.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that deductible temporary differences are expected to reduce future taxable income. The amount recognized as deferred tax assets depends on the appropriateness of a company category determined in accordance with “Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets” (Guidance No. 26 of the Accounting Standards Board of Japan) and the estimated future taxable income.
As described in Note 15, “DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES”, the Company determined that deferred tax assets related to policy reserves and reserve for price fluctuations were recoverable because future
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In order to assess whether management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets was appropriate, we performed the following audit procedures, among others:
(1) Internal control testing
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain of the Company’s internal controls relevant to the estimate of future taxable income, including those over the development of a business plan.
(2) Assessment of a company category
We evaluated the appropriateness of a company category determined in accordance with “Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets,” with a particular focus on the assessment of whether significant changes in the business environment of the insurance subsidiary were expected in the near future.


Assessment of the reasonableness and feasibility of estimated future taxable income
We obtained an understanding of assumptions underlying the insurance subsidiary’s business plan, which formed the basis for the estimate of future taxable income by inquiring of the Company’s management and the personnel in the relevant department;
We compared the future taxable income estimated in the previous fiscal years with actual

Financial Statements
    taxable income would be generated over the long term and therefore deferred tax assets have an effect of reducing the amount of tax payable. The future taxable income to be generated was estimated based on the business plan prepared by management of the Company. Accordingly, the estimate involved significant management judgment on key assumptions, such as forecasts of the level of insurance product sales, the amount of insurance claims and other benefit payments, investment income and operating expenses.
We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the reasonableness of management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets was one of the most significant matters in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly, a key audit matter.
results; and
 We confirmed the consistency between the estimated future taxable income and the business plan.
      Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the executive officers’ and directors’ performance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
    132 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

  of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Convenience Translation
The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Financial Statements
 JAPAN POST INSURANCE CO., LTD.
NOTES TO THE NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2021 AND 2020
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying financial statements of JAPAN POST IN- SURANCE Co., Ltd. (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Fi- nancial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations concerning preparation of financial statements, the Ordinance for Enforcement of Insurance Busi- ness Act and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of the International Financial Reporting Stan- dards.
In preparing these non-consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the non-consolidated financial statements issued domesti- cally in order to present them in a form that is more familiar to readers outside Japan.
All Japanese yen figures in the non-consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen. Accordingly, the total of each account might not be equal to the combined total of individual items.
The non-consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Com- pany is incorporated and mainly operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.71 to US$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2021. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(1) Securities
Securities including cash and deposits, as well as mone- tary claims bought, which are equivalent to securities, and securities invested in money held in trust, are record- ed based on the following:
1) Held-to-maturity bonds
Held-to-maturity bonds are carried at amortized cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculated us- ing the moving-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
2) Policy-reserve-matching bonds
In accordance with the “Temporary Treatment of Accounting and Auditing Concerning Policy-Re- serve-Matching Bonds in the Insurance Industry” (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 21), policy-reserve-matching bonds are carried at amor- tized cost and the cost of these securities sold is calculated using the moving-average method. Amorti- zation is calculated using the straight-line method.
3) Equities of subsidiaries and affiliates
Equities of subsidiaries and affiliates are carried at cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculat- ed using the moving-average method.
4) Available-for-sale securities
A) Available-for-sale securities at fair value
Available-for-sale securities at fair value are carried at their fiscal year-end market price, of which the average market prices during the final month of the fiscal year are used to value stocks. The cost of se- curities sold is calculated using the moving-average method.
B) Available-for-sale securities for which the fair val- ues are deemed extremely difficult to determine Government and corporate bonds (including foreign bonds) without a market price for which the premium or discount represents the interest adjustments are carried at the amortized cost (the straight-line method) using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at cost using the moving-average method.
Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for- sale securities, net of income taxes, are included in net assets.
(2) Derivative Transactions
All derivative transactions are valued at fair value.
(3) Hedge Accounting
1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Company applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its for- eign-currency-denominated bonds as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Ac- counting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the con- tract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
A) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-denominated bonds
B) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign-currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the ag- gregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted in cases of foreign ex- change contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or in- terest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.

 (4) Depreciation
1) Tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated us- ing the straight-line method based on the following useful lives:
Buildings : 2–60 years
1) Reserves for contracts subject to the standard policy reserves are calculated in accordance with the meth- od prescribed by the Commissioner for Financial Services Agency (Public notice No. 48 issued by the Ministry of Finance in 1996).
2) Reserves for other contracts are calculated based on the net level premium method.
Pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance
for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, effective from the year ended March 31, 2011, additional policy re- serves were accumulated, in preparation for the fulfilment of future obligations, over a 10-year period for a portion of the reinsurance contracts from the Management Net- work. As a result, the amount of provision for additional policy reserves was ¥176,734 million for the year ended March 31, 2020.
In addition, for the year ended March 31, 2021, addi- tional policy reserves were accumulated for a portion of the reinsurance contracts from the Management Network, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act. As a result, the amount of additionally accumulated policy reserves was ¥245,841 million ($2,221 million). However, there is no impact on ordinary profit and income before income taxes due to the reversal of contingency reserves in the same amount.
Among the policy reserves, contingency reserves are accumulated to ensure the fulfilment of future obligations under insurance contracts in preparation of possible future risks, pursuant to Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
The Chief Actuary, pursuant to Article 121, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 80 of the Or- dinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, confirms whether the policy reserves as of the fiscal year- end have been appropriately accumulated.
The Management Network was established in October 2007 to support the privatization of Japan Post by suc- ceeding from Japan Post postal savings such as fixed amount or term postal savings deposited and Postal Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 to ensure that such postal savings and Postal Life Insurance are managed appropriately and to fulfill the relevant liabil- ities without fail.
The Company has entered into the reinsurance con- tracts comprising outsourcing agreements for the administrative operation of the Postal Life Insurance and the reinsurance contracts for insurance liabilities based on former Postal Life Insurance Contracts, for Postal Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 that have been assumed by the Management Network.
In addition, based on the master plan by the Postal Service Privatization Act, with respect to the amount equivalent to that lent to policyholders of the Postal Life Insurance Contracts and to Japanese local governments and others succeeded from Japan Post Corporation, the Company has lent loans to the Management Network un- der the same loan conditions as those of the contracts between Japan Post and its counterparties.
Insurance Premiums
The first premium is recorded for premiums that have been collected and for which the policy has commenced, in the amount collected. Premiums thereafter are record- ed in the amount of each collection.
Other tangible fixed assets:
2–20 years
2) Intangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
The capitalized development costs of software intend- ed for internal use are amortized over the expected useful life of mainly 5 years using the straight-line method.
3) Leased assets
The Company mainly leases vehicles under finance lease arrangements that do not transfer the ownership of leased property to the lessee.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer own- ership are depreciated to a residual value of zero using the straight-line method over the lease term.
(5) Reserve for Possible Loan Losses
Reserve for possible loan losses is provided pursuant to the Company’s standards for self-assessment of asset quality, and a general allowance is provided using a rate based on historical collectability experience. In addition, specific allowances, which are determined based on in- dividual collectability of accounts, are recorded.
All loans and claims are assessed initially by the rele- vant departments based on internal rules for self-assessment of asset quality. The asset evaluation de- partment, which is independent from the relevant departments, reviews these self-assessments. The above reserves and allowances are recorded based on the re- sults of these assessments.
For loans and guaranteed loans that were extended to borrowers that have filed for bankruptcy, including legal bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation, or that are considered substantially bankrupt, an allowance is provided for in the amount of loans, net of collateral value or the amounts expected to be recoverable under guarantees. The re- serve for possible loan losses also includes amounts set aside for other assets subject to valuation allowance. The amounts written off for loans and other assets during the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, were ¥96 million ($1 million) and ¥49 million, respectively.
(6) Policy Reserves
To prepare for the fulfilment of future obligations under the insurance contracts with respect to policies that have commenced as of the fiscal year-end, policy reserves are calculated in accordance with the statement of calcula- tion methodology for insurance premiums and policy reserves (Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 4 of the Insurance Business Act) and accumulated, pursuant to Article 116, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Business Act.
The amount of policy reserves may be affected if actu- al results of basis of the calculation of policy reserves such as assumed mortality rates, assumed interest rates, and expected rate of expenses deviate significantly or deviations are expected in the future due to changes in the environment.
Among the policy reserves, insurance premium reserves are calculated based on the following methodology. The amount includes additional policy reserves accumulated for the portion of the reinsurance contracts issued to the Management Network, and for lump-sum payment annu- ities, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.

      Message from the CEO About Japan Post Insurance Business Strategy for Value Creation Management Base to Support Value Creation Corporate Information Financial Statements

Financial Statements
 The portion of collected insurance premiums corre- sponding to the unexpired period as of the fiscal year- end are accumulated as policy reserves, pursuant to Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act and Article 69, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
(8) Insurance Claims and Others
When an insured event occurs and payment is made in the amount calculated based on the insurance contract, insurance claims and others (excluding reinsurance pre- miums) are recorded in the amount of the payment.
Reserve for outstanding claims has been accumulated for insurance claims and others, for which payment is due but has not been paid at the fiscal year-end, and for which the occurrence of the insured event has not been reported but the Company deems that the insured event provided in the insurance contract has occurred but not yet paid, pursuant to Article 117 of the Insurance Busi- ness Act and Article 72 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
(Additional information)
The Company has applied “Accounting Standard for Ac- counting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (ASBJ Statement No. 24, March 31, 2020) to its non-consolidated financial statements from the year ended March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Compa- ny has stated “(7) Insurance Premiums” and “(8) Insurance Claims and Others” as accounting principles and procedures adopted in cases where the relevant ac- counting standards are not clear.
(9) Reserve for Insurance Claims and Others
With regard to policies that have been discovered through investigations to have likely caused disadvantages to customers in a way that is not in line with their intentions, reserve for insurance claims and others is provided in the projected amount of insurance claims and others arising due to future policy measures to compensate customers for their disadvantages, based on the past record of ef- forts to address such disadvantages.
(10) Reserve for Employees’ Retirement Benefits
To provide for payment of retirement benefits to employ- ees, a reserve for employees’ retirement benefits is provided based on the projected amount of retirement benefit obligations at the end of the fiscal year.
In calculating the projected benefit obligation, the benefit formula basis is used to attribute the expected benefit to the respective service period.
The actuarial difference is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employees from the fiscal year following the respec- tive fiscal year in which the difference is incurred.
Prior service cost is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employ- ees in the fiscal year of incurrence.
Accounting methods for unrecognized actuarial differ- ence and unrecognized prior service cost are different from those of the consolidated financial statements. (Additional information)
In August 2020, the Company decided on and notified all concerned of the change to the Retirement Allowance Regulations effective October 1, 2020, whereby the lump- sum severance indemnity plans were revised in association with the extension of mandatory retirement
age from 60 to 65. Due to this change, retirement benefit obligations decreased and prior service cost (favorable variance) of ¥1,273 million ($11 million) was recognized.
(11) Reserve for Management Board Benefit Trust
To provide for the granting of shares and others of the Company to executive officers of the Company in accor- dance with the stock benefit rules, reserve for management board benefit trust is provided in the pro- jected amount of stock benefit obligations.
(12) Reserve for Price Fluctuations
Reserve for price fluctuations in security investments is calculated based on Article 115 of the Insurance Busi- ness Act.
(13) Translation of Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the fiscal year-end.
(14) Consumption Taxes
All figures are net of consumption taxes.
(15) Additional Information
1) Transactions for granting shares and others of the
Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust
Notes to the transactions for granting shares and oth- ers of the Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust are omitted as they are pre- sented in Note 2 (18) “Additional Information” of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021.
2) Efforts to regain to customers’ trust
On December 27, 2019, the Company received ad- ministrative dispositions pursuant to the Insurance Business Act from the Financial Services Agency of Japan, on account of improper solicitation actions and underlying systematic problems. The Company is re- solved to treat the implementation of the business improvement plan that it formulated as its top-priority management issue and is making company-wide ef- forts to do so. In addition, the Company has been confirming with all customers with insurance policies whether their insurance policies are in line with their intentions and compensating customers who have suf- fered disadvantages.
At the year ended March 31, 2020, the company reasonably estimated insurance-related expenses to be incurred due to the refund of premiums and the payment of insurance claims to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by customers, and recorded reserve for insurance claims and others in the amount of ¥29,722 million.
In the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded the refund of premiums and the payment of insurance claims to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by customers as part of insurance claims and others, and the corresponding adjustment to policy re- serves as part of reversal of policy reserves, while recording a reduction of the net amount totaling ¥21,589 million ($195 million) from reserve for insur- ance claims and others at the end of the previous fiscal year, and a reversal of ¥5,280 million ($48 mil- lion), as a result of reflecting the progress in the investigation of insurance policies in accounting esti- mates. Consequently, reserve for insurance claims and others stood at ¥2,851 million ($26 million) as of

 March 31, 2021. The amounts of the aforementioned reduction and reversal of reserve for insurance claims and others are recorded as reversal of reserve for

 5. LOANS
There were no bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans, past due loans for three months or more, or restructured loans as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. Definitions for each of the respective loans are as follows:
Bankrupt loans refer to non-accrual loans, excluding the balances already written off, which meet the conditions prescribed in Article 96, Paragraph 1, Item 3-(a) to (e) and Item 4 of the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act (Ordinance No. 97 in 1965). The interest accruals of such loans are suspended because the principal or interest on such loans is unlikely to be collected due to delinquency in payments for them for a considerable period of time or other reasons.
Non-interest accrual loans are those loans for which interest payments have been suspended to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business.
Past due loans for three months or more are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date, excluding those classified as bankrupt loans and non-accrual loans.
Restructured loans are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business. This category excludes loans classified as bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans and past due loans for three months or more.

 Independent Auditor’s Report
  Independent auditor’s report
To the Board of Directors of JAPAN POST INSURANCE Co., Ltd.:
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying non-consolidated financial statements of JAPAN POST INSURANCE Co., Ltd. (“the Company”), which comprise the non-consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, the non-consolidated statements of income, changes in net assets for the years then ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying non-consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and its financial performance for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Non-Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the non- consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the non-consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the non-consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Accuracy of the calculation and sufficiency of policy reserves
The descriptions of the above key audit matter to be provided in our auditor’s report on the non- consolidated financial statements are substantially the same as those described for the key audit matter, “Accuracy of the calculation and sufficiency of policy reserves” in our auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, information concerning this key audit matter is omitted in the auditor’s report on the non-consolidated financial statements.

  Reasonableness of management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets
The descriptions of the above key audit matter to be provided in our auditor’s report on the non- consolidated financial statements are substantially the same as those described for the key audit matter, “Reasonableness of management’s judgment on the recoverability of deferred tax assets” in our auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, information concerning this key audit matter is omitted in the auditor’s report on the non-consolidated financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the non-consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of non-consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the non-consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the executive officers’ and directors’ performance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Non-Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the non-consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these non-consolidated financial statements.
As part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the non-consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the non-consolidated financial statements or, if such

  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
 Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the non-consolidated financial statements are in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the non-consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the non-consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the non-consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Convenience Translation
The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying non-consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2021 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 1 to the non-consolidated financial statements.

Notes:
1. Bankrupt or quasi-bankrupt loans are loans to borrowers who have fallen into bankruptcy for reasons such as the commencement of bankruptcy
proceedings or reorganization proceedings, or the petition for commencement of rehabilitation proceedings, and loans similar to these.
2. Doubtful loans are loans for which principal and interest are unlikely to be collected or received as stipulated in an agreement due to the
borrower’s deteriorating financial conditions and results even though the borrower has not fallen into bankruptcy.
3. Substandard loans are past due loans for three months or more and restructured loans.
“Past due loans for three months or more” are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date (excluding the loans noted in 1 and 2). “Restructured loans” are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made for the purpose of assisting and supporting the borrowers in the restructuring of their business (excluding the loans noted in 1 and 2, and past due loans for three months or more).
4. Normal loans are loans which do not fall under the loans noted in 1 to 3 above as there are no particular problems found with the borrower’s financial conditions and results.
5-2 Status of Risk-Monitored Loans
There were no such outstanding balances as of March 31, 2020 and 2021.

 (3) Combined Fair Value of Derivative Transactions (with or without Hedge Accounting) 1) Qualitative Information
 (i) Detail of the transactions
The derivative transactions used by the Company are as follows:
– Currency-related: Foreign exchange contracts and currency option transactions
– Interest rate–related: Interest rate swaps
– Bond-related: Over-the-counter bond options
(ii) Policy for using derivative transactions
The Company uses derivative transactions primarily for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk and foreign exchange fluctuation risk of our investment assets.
(iii) Purposes of the use of derivative transactions
The Company mainly conducts derivative transactions relating to currencies to control foreign exchange risks associated with foreign currency–denominated assets and derivative transactions relating to interest rates to fix the floating interest rates of loans. An overview of the hedge accounting using derivative transactions conducted by the Company is as follows:
(1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its foreign-currency-denominated bonds, as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
(2) Hedging instruments and hedged items (i) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency
exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-
denominated bonds
(ii) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
(3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign- currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
(4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by com- paring the aggregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of hedge effec- tiveness is omitted in cases of foreign exchange contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or interest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.
(iv) Description of the risks
Derivative transactions used by the Company are exposed to market risk (risks due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates) and credit risk (risks of transaction partners’ default, including bankruptcy).
The Company uses derivative transactions primarily for the purpose of hedging the risks of our investment assets, and therefore it believes that the market-related risk of derivative transactions is reduced and limited.
Meanwhile, as we select transaction partners with superior creditworthiness based on their ratings and other factors, the credit risk of derivative transactions is believed to be limited. The Company conducts derivative transactions over the counter.
(v) Risk management framework
The Company has formulated the Basic Risk Management Policy, which sets out the investment policies of derivative transactions, and uses derivative transactions primarily for hedging purposes.
In addition, we prevent risks by setting credit limits for each transaction partner selected on the basis of superior creditworthiness verified by their ratings and other factors.
The Risk Management Department is in place as an organizational unit responsible for compre- hensively managing all types of risks, as part of an effort to reinforce our internal management system.

 (vi) Additional notes about quantitative information
– Additional notes about credit risk
We calculate the credit risk amount associated with derivative transactions by using the current exposure method.
– Additional notes about the calculation of fair value
We calculate fair value on the following basis: [Foreign exchange contracts]
Fair value is calculated using the forward foreign exchange rate as of the fiscal year-end date. [Currency options]
Fair value is based on prices offered by the financial institutions.
[Interest rate swaps]
Theoretical values are calculated by discounting the difference in future cash flows to present values based on the published market interest rate.
[Over-the-counter bond options]
Fair value is based on prices offered by the financial institutions.
– Additional notes about net unrealized gains (losses)
We use derivative transactions primarily as a means to hedge the market risk of our investment assets, and there are no so-called transactions for trading purposes.
Profit or loss from derivative transactions and the hedged investments is recognized on a combined basis, whereby the effect of a reduction in interest rate risk and foreign exchange fluctuation risk has been verified.

       Spread (Positive/Negative Spread)
A spread is the differential between the assumed return on insurance premium investments and the actual investment return. When the actual investment return is higher than the assumed return on insurance premium investments, there is a “positive spread.” Conversely, a “negative spread” exists when the actual investment return is lower than the assumed return on insurance premium investments. For the year ended March 31, 2021, there was a positive spread of ¥76.3 billion.
The spread (positive/negative spread) is calculated according to the following formula:
Positive spread = [investment return on core profit – average assumed rate of return] × general account policy reserves
[¥76.3 billion] [1.82%] [1.69%] [¥58,645.3 billion]
• Investment return on core profit is the return on general account policy reserves after deducting the provision for interest on policyholder dividends from the general account investment revenue included in core profit.
• Average assumed rate of return is the return of assumed interest on general account policy reserves.
• General account policy reserves are calculated as follows for policy reserves in the general account, excluding contingency reserve:
(Policy reserves at beginning of period + policy reserves at end of period − assumed interest) × 1/2
• Policy reserves and assumed interest are calculated based on the actual cumulative amount.

 (8) Embedded Value (“EV”)
Embedded value (“EV”) is one of the corporate value indicators for life insurance companies.
The profit-loss structure in the life insurance business involves a loss at the time of sale and profit over a policy’s duration. A loss occurs temporarily at the time of sale, caused by a considerable amount of expenses generally incurred with the sale of a policy. Future profit is generated as the policy’s long duration serves to provide revenues over a long
period of time, covering these initial expenses.
Under the current statutory accounting practices in Japan, gains and losses are recognized as they occur in each
 fiscal year. EV, on the other hand, is used to represent the present value of gains and losses that cover the entire duration. EV is the sum of the adjusted net worth (ANW), which reflects gains/losses from business activities in the past, and the value of in-force covered business (VIF), which is the present value of the expected future profits from the in-force covered business.
Since the end of the year ended March 31, 2013, we have been disclosing EV calculated on the basis of the European Embedded Value Principles (“EEV Principles”) as additional information supplementary to the financial data provided under the current statutory accounting practices.

   Notes:
The EEV Principles and Guidance were published in May 2004 by the CFO Forum, a group representing the Chief Financial Officers of major European insurance companies, in order to improve consistency and transparency in EV calculation and reporting.

        Notes:
1. For the long-duration risk-free rates at terms longer than the extrapolation entry term, extrapolation to the ultimate forward rate is applied without
changing the ultimate forward rate itself.
2. The 50bp decrease is applied to both positive and negative risk-free rates, without a floor.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we refrained from proactive sales activities, so the volume of new policies was so small that the sensitivity of the value of new business is deemed immaterial and is accordingly not calculated.

 4) Main EV Assumptions (i) Economic Assumptions
Based on the assets held by Japan Post Insurance,
the risk-free rates for use in the certainty equivalent
calculation have been determined based on Japanese Term
For calculation of the value of in-force covered business
For calculation of the value of new business
     March 31, 2020
   March 31, 2021
  Fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (Rate at December 31, 2019)
  Fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (Rate at June 30, 2020)
   government bonds as of the valuation date.
The table on the right shows, for selected terms, the risk-free rates (converted to spot rates) used for the calculation. For interest rates at longer durations, for which reference rates are not available, we take an extrapolation approach utilizing an ultimate forward rate assumed to converge over a period of time to a fixed ultimate level, commonly set based on
macroeconomic or other methods.
We have assumed an ultimate forward rate of 3.8%,
and as the market of Japanese government bonds beyond 30 years is not considered deep and liquid, we have determined the extrapolation entry term as 30 years. For the forward rate for year 31 and later years, we have applied the Smith-Wilson approach with convergence to the ultimate forward rate over 30 years.

                          All cash flows (premiums, expenses, claims and benefits, cash surrender values, taxes, etc.) are projected applying the best estimate assumptions up to the termination of the policies. Best estimate assumptions are specified by product group, considering recent experience and expected future prospects.
5) Notes on the Use of Results
(i) As the profits arising from the release of the contingency reserve and reserve for price fluctuations related to the Postal Life Insurance policies form a part of the reinsurance dividend paid to the Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insurance and Post Office Network, the EV calculations take into consideration the profits net of this reinsurance dividend. Therefore, the contingency reserve and reserve for price fluctuations related to these policies are included in the VIF, rather than the ANW, as it is assumed that these reserves will be released in the future.
(ii) The calculation of EV is based on many assumptions, including future outlook, which involves certain risks and uncertainties. Since actual performance may differ materially from these assumptions, we strongly recommend that users exercise caution.
(iii) We requested an independent actuarial firm to review the assumptions and the calculation of our EV results and obtained a written opinion verifying the validity. For further details of this written opinion and our EV, please refer to our website (https://www.jp-life.japanpost.jp/english/news/2021/en_news_id000117.html).

(6) Rationality and Adequacy of the Confirmation under Article 121, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Insurance Business Act (limited to the confirmation pertaining to third-sector insurance)
1) Principles for Ensuring Appropriateness of Policy Reserves for Third-sector Insurance
We carry out the liability adequacy test and stress test as required by laws and regulations in order to ensure a sufficient level of policy reserves.
The scope of the stress test includes the applicable products of Postal Life Insurance.
2) Rationality and Adequacy of the Level of Risk Frequency and Others Assumed for the Purpose of the Liability Adequacy Test and Stress Test
For the purpose of assuming risk frequency, we calculate the occurrence rate that covers the fluctuations of payment of hospitalization benefits and others with certain rates of probability (99% and 97.7%) during the next 10 years, based on the historical actual payment, etc. of hospitalization benefits and others.
3) Results of the Liability Adequacy Test and Stress Test
We have verified as a result of the stress test that there is no need for an additional provision of contingency reserve or policy reserves for third-sector insurance, as the expected occurrence rate we assumed beforehand adequately covers the risks expected to materialize in the future.

 Message from CEO
The Founding Spirit and Vision of Japan Post Insurance
On October 1, 1916, the predecessor of Japan Post Insurance, the Postal Life Insurance Service was created in Japan, and began to offer its products at approximately 7,000 post offices nationwide. At that time, although life insurance offered by the private sector was steadily developing, only a handful of people had reaped its benefit, and it was not yet widely available to the common public. As Japan was already an industrially developed country, there was a need for life insurance, as a social policy for people who were the labor force. Accordingly, creation of a simple life insurance system with small coverage amounts became an urgent task for society. Under these social circumstances, the Postal Life Insurance Service began as a system that could be joined through a simple procedure, without a medical examination and at a relatively affordable monthly rate, in order to provide the peace of mind that comes with insurance, as a protection for the means of the fundamental livelihood of the people of Japan.
More than a century has passed since the introduction of the Postal Life Insurance Service. Considering the current state of society, it is clear that Japan has secured its status as a developed nation through a period of rapid economic growth. However, it is also a fact that Japan still faces a number of social problems, including a rapid aging of society with a declining birth rate. Therefore, I believe that the social significance and mission to provide the means of fundamental livelihood that is expected of Japan Post Insurance have not changed in the slightest, since the era of its founding.
This mission has been passed down without fail since our founding, and continues to remain rooted in our current management philosophy, “Be a trustful partner for people, always being close at hand and endeavoring to protect their well-being.” This management philosophy represents Japan Post Insurance’s resolve to “Fulfill our abiding mission as a member of Japan Post Group” and “Continuously support and protect our customers’ dreams and enthusiasm.”

Message from CEO
 
Contributing to local communities with the nationwide post office network,
and working towards the sustainable growth of our corporate value.
 Currently, we deliver peace of mind in the form of insurance to the people of Japan, via approximately 20,000 post offices located nationwide. We will never cease fulfilling our mission of protecting people’s well-being through insurance, while also contributing to our customers as a member of the Japan Post Group. Leveraging our “trustworthy” and “reliable” brand image accumulated over the years as assets, we will do our best to stay by our customers’ sides, and continue to earn their trust and affection.
Review of the Medium-term Management Plan 2020 and Our Performance in FY2019/3
Under the Medium-term Management Plan 2020 (FY2019/3 – FY2021/3), we have established “pursue customer-first business operations,” “achieve sustainable growth,” and “maintain sound business operations” as our fundamental management approach, with the aim of increasing profit in both sales and asset management in an extremely low interest rate

environment, as well as reversing the declining trend and achieving growth in annualized premiums from policies in force. Specifically, we have set earnings per share (EPS), dividend per share (DPS), and annualized premiums from policies in force (individual insurance) as our key quantitative targets for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, and are working on strategies for each area of business, including sales and products, administrative services, and asset management. As details of these primary strategies will be presented in the “Key Strategies” section (P. 26), I would like to focus on our performance during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, which was the first year of our Medium-term Management Plan 2020, consolidated net income reached ¥120.4 billion (15.3% increase year on year), our highest profits since privatization, and EPS was ¥200.86. In our consolidated performance forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we expect EPS of ¥165.12, which exceeds the goal of ¥155 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 that was set

in our Medium-term Management Plan, and indicates steady progress. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we set DPS at a total of ¥72, by adding a special dividend of ¥4 per share to ordinary dividend of ¥68 per share based on favorable performance. We expect to pay ¥76 in DPS for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, and aim to achieve a steady and continuous growth in dividends.
With regard to new policies, we have strengthened sales activities focusing on protection needs, and made efforts to cultivate new customer bases, including the uninsured as well as the young and middle-aged. As a result, annualized premiums from new policies for individual insurance amounted to ¥351.3 billion (6.6% decrease year on year). However, we
have steadily increased the number of new policies for ordinary whole life insurance (increased amount type) and special endowment insurance with high protection features, which together accounted for nearly 50% of all new policies. Annualized premiums from new policies for third-sector insurance amounted to ¥61.6 billion (4.1% increase year on year), marking a record high.
Looking at policies in force as of March 31, 2019, although annualized premiums from policies in force for individual insurance were on a declining trend amounting to ¥4,677.1 billion (3.8% decrease year on year), annualized premiums from policies in force for third-sector insurance amounted to ¥753.1 billion (0.3% increase year on year), and were on an increasing trend. Moving forward, we aim to reverse the current pattern, and achieve a growth in annualized premiums from policies in force during this Medium-term Management Plan period, by strengthening sales focused on protection, cultivating new customer bases, and improving solicitation quality and working to increase our policy maintenance rate by pursuing customer-first business operations.
Strengthening Human Capital as a Management Resource
Human resources are a crucial form of capital
in any corporate organization. Due to labor shortages and a market favoring job applicants in recent years, corporations are faced with a harsh recruiting environment. However, we are responding to changes in the social environment as we strive to recruit talented human resources. Since training human resources is just as important as recruiting, we are fostering an environment in which each and every employee can think and act for themselves at all times, in order to fully realize their potential, by promoting company-wide initiatives for workstyle reform. Furthermore, we are striving to conduct the
training of human resources who focus on “customer-first,” and are inclined towards four orientations: “ownership,” “challenge oriented,” “speed oriented,” and “frontline oriented.”
The Company provides products and services to individual customers via post offices. Accordingly, for the purpose of supporting post offices, we have placed Agency Relations Divisions at 82 of our branches across Japan, where they offer support and guidance for sales and business at post offices. The approximately 20,000 posts offices nationwide that are responsible for life insurance solicitations are a very important sales channel, which accounts for approximately 90% of new policies sold by Japan Post Insurance. For this reason, training and supporting post office employees are essential.
Specific initiatives we have undertaken include training by job level, in which our instructors teach post office employees, as well as problem-solving training, in which the Agency Relations Divisions at each branch take the lead. In this manner, we strive to conduct detailed training that suits the sales figures, skills, and issues faced by each individual, as part of a “strategy to conduct training that fits each individual.” Furthermore, we are working on a “management project that tends to individual post offices,” that strengthens management skills at post offices. In this project, employees of the Company and Japan Post Co., Ltd. with leadership skills visit or are stationed at post offices nationwide that have offsite sales functions, analyzing issues in the sales structure of each individual post office, and offering proposals for improvement measures as well as execution support.
“Customer-first” Sales Activities and Service Improvement
An important mission of all life insurance companies is to provide long-term protection and peace of mind, by providing attentive explanations, while grasping the intentions of our customers, and ensuring that they purchase insurance with adequate understanding and consent. In order to achieve this mission, we are collaborating with Japan Post Co., Ltd. to conduct “customer-first sales activities.”
Starting in April 2019, in order to further pursue “customer-first sales activities,” we have taken measures to reflect the maintenance of policies in employee evaluations and their allowances, and revise our recording method of sales performance. We will continue to aim for the highest level of solicitation quality in the industry, and strive to truly satisfy all of our customers.
6 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

Our business model of providing simple, small-coverage-amount products and services via our nationwide network of approximately 20,000 post offices is our greatest strength. In recent years, in addition to face-to-face service provided through post offices, the need has arisen for non-face-to-face services via the Internet or mail. In light of our customers’ diversifying needs, we are working to “expand the points of contact with customers” and “promote the digitalization of various operations” through the use of digital technology in order to improve customer service. Specifically, we are enhancing the content of our website to make it easier for customers to understand, and are developing new services such as by introducing My Page web service for policyholders, which enables some processes and services to be conducted online, as new digital points of contact with customers.
Since March 2017, we have introduced decision support for insurance claim payment examination work using artificial intelligence (AI). By inputting past payment cases in the AI, we are able to obtain judgment materials based on the results obtained by machine learning. Using AI enables us to make quick assessments at a level on par with employees with sophisticated knowledge and experience regarding our products, policy conditions, and medicine, and to gain benefits such as faster payment processing. Thus far, we have expanded the use of AI to call center operations and in the future, we plan to examine the effects of AI on customer
service improvement and workstyle reform, while also examining use in other fields, such as enhancing support for post offices (operations help desks) and contact points with customers.
Realizing a Sustainable Society
Among the international rules and guidelines
for realizing a sustainable society recently formulated, the “Sustainable Development Goals” (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations
in 2015 in particular, demand actions from corporations aimed at achieving these goals. In order to achieve sustainable development as a company in the future, it is crucial to strategically incorporate SDGs into management, establish goals and implement them. We have positioned continuance of sustainable growth in harmony with society while giving consideration toward the global environment as the basis of its management, and have formulated a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) action plan for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, to serve as a guidepost toward achieving SDGs and improved the Company’s CSR promotion system. Through this plan, we intend to practice management in a manner that balances the creation of economic and social value of the Company, by further strengthening these efforts as part of our business strategy, and attempting to achieve the SDGs including these for social responsibility and the environment.

Efforts to Promote Health as a CSR Activity
We are making particular efforts to promote the Radio Exercise Program as a way of responding to social issues in our graying society. Radio Exercise was first introduced in 1928 by the Postal Life Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, a predecessor of Japan Post Insurance. At the time when Radio Exercise was introduced, Japan still had a very short average life expectancy, in the 40s. Therefore, in the course of operating our life insurance business, the Company was faced with the pressing issue of extending the very lifespan of the people. Promoting the spread of Radio Exercise served as a means to promote the health of the people of Japan.
In response to the privatization of postal services, we inherited the responsibility of promoting Radio Exercise, which had previously been conducted by the Postal Life Insurance business. Unlike the time when Radio Exercise was first introduced, modern day Japan has become a super-aging society, the 100-Year Life, and extending the healthy life expectancy, the part of one’s lifespan in which one can continue to live in good health, has become a huge issue. Radio Exercise can once more contribute greatly to resolving this issue, and we have continued to position the promotion of Radio Exercise at the center of our CSR activities, and are actively working on this task.
In addition, as a new initiative to support health promotion of our customers, we launched a “health support app” in January 2019. This health support app provides contents such as a pedometer function, as well as Radio Exercise in audio and video formats, and can search for venues nationwide where Radio Exercise is conducted, in order to support the adoption of exercise habits. Starting in April 2019, we have provided contents in the form of a premium version of the app for policyholders only. This includes content that displays calories and nutrients, and gives advice on nutritional balance when the customer takes a picture of their food, as well as content that recommends recipes based on the health aspects that the customer wishes to improve, such as their blood pressure or BMI, in order to support health through improving eating habits. We have positioned this health support app as the “next- generation Radio Exercise,” and are providing services that contribute to improving our customers’ quality of life.
Capital Policy
With the aim of continuously improving shareholder value, we have based our capital policy on maintaining a sufficient level of capital required to strengthen our profitability
and management base, while taking into consideration capital efficiency. In addition,
we have made appropriate reviews, while considering whether the required level of capital is appropriate relative to the risk associated with our business activities, and whether it meets the level demanded by regulatory rules. At the same time, we aim to improve return compared to risk, while maintaining the financial soundness of our operations under an ERM(Note) framework.
In January 2019, we issued ¥100.0 billion in subordinated unsecured bonds for domestic public offering, thus further strengthening our financial base. In April 2019, following the sale of common stock in Japan Post Insurance by Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. we enhanced shareholder returns by acquiring treasury stock in order to mitigate the impact on the supply- demand balance of our shares, and in May, cancelled nearly the same number of treasury stock acquired.
With regard to shareholder returns, we have placed the return of profits to shareholders as one of the key management measures, and are securing soundness of management while returning stable profits to our shareholders. In addition, from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we have decided to pay an interim dividend in addition to the year-end dividend, for the purpose of enhancing opportunities to return profits to our shareholders. Moving forward, we aim to steadily increase dividend per share, while taking into consideration our earnings outlook and financial soundness.
Note: “Enterprise risk management (ERM)” aims to ascertain risks on an overall basis, which encompasses latent significant risks, for any risk a company faces and compare and contrast such risks with its capital and other areas in managing risk for our overall business.
8 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

Achieving Sustainable Growth
We expect customer needs for life insurance products and services to transition from death benefits toward survival benefits, such as medical care and nursing care, and as we approach an era in which many people live to 100, an expansion of protection and preventive services to assist people in living richer, healthier daily lives is expected. In anticipation of these changes, we will enhance our survival benefit products, including third-sector insurance. We are also examining methods of combining the information acquired from digital contact points, such as the health support app mentioned earlier, with information acquired from post offices, and using this information to improve services and conduct marketing, as well as developing new products and services that utilize health data. In the future, basing our business on providing face-to-face services through post offices, we will examine services through various channels, with the aim of further improving customer satisfaction and creating additional sales opportunities.
Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. conducted a secondary offering of the common stock of the Company in April 2019. This offering was conducted to help further advance the steady implementation of our privatization including the future relaxation of the additional restrictions applicable to the Company through multiple disposals of such shares and to help investor demand by enhancing the market liquidity of the Company’s stock. Through the secondary offering of the Company’s common stock and the acquisition of treasury stock, the shareholding of the Company’s common stock by Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. has been reduced from about 90% to the lower 60% range. Based on this environment, we aim to make sustained improvements in corporate value through methods including new business development.
With deregulation on the horizon, we believe that we have great potential for growth in the domestic life insurance market. However,
other life insurance companies are promoting overseas expansion, which has contributed
to profits to a certain extent. We too will make necessary preparations to further improve our corporate value, such as conducting surveys and research on overseas expansion and training human resources.
Finally, I would like to reaffirm that Japan Post Insurance will continue to contribute to society and achieve sustainable growth with society, based on the recognition that the basis for our growth strategy is the realization of a sustainable society.

 Our History
The Postal Life Insurance Service, the predecessor of Japan Post Insurance, was founded in 1916. Created with the social mission of “protecting the means of fundamental livelihood of the public through simple procedures,” the Postal Life Insurance Service fulfilled its role of ensuring the stability of people’s lives by providing an insurance system available at relatively affordable fees with simple enrollment procedures and no medical examination. Although more than a century has passed since our founding, our mission to support the lifestyles of people through insurance has not changed, despite our transformation from a government-run to a private corporation in line with changes in the times. Japan Post Insurance will continue to deliver insurance services as a means of security to customers nationwide through the network of post offices rooted in the community, thereby protecting the well-being of each and every customer with the power of insurance.

Japan Post Insurance, which was created as a result of the privatization of the original Japan Post, has assumed the role of promoting the exercise program, first undertaken by the Ministry of Communications and then by its successors, namely the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Postal Service Agency and Japan Post prior to privatization. We have been working together with NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and the NPO Japan Radio-taiso Federation to promote the program.

  Notes:
1. As the Company transitioned to consolidated accounting from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 onwards, the financial data from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 onwards represent consolidated figures, while those of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2010 and 2011 represent non-consolidated figures. However, core profit, number of shares issued, status of policies and dividend per share represent non-consolidated figures. Furthermore, net income represents net income attributable to Japan Post Insurance from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 onwards.
2. The solvency margin ratios as of March 31, 2010 and 2011 have been calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth in Articles 86 and 87 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act and in the public notification No. 50 issued by the Ministry of Finance in 1996. Furthermore, the solvency margin ratios from March 31, 2012 onwards have been calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth in Articles 86-2 and 88 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act and in the public notification No. 23 issued by the Financial Services Agency in 2011.
3. In the calculation of the solvency margin ratio from March 31, 2012 onwards, the calculation standard for the total amount of solvency margin and the total amount of risk was partially amended (tightening of margin calculations, tightening and refining of risk measurements and others), in accordance with the Cabinet Office Ordinance No. 23 of 2010 and the public notification No. 48 issued by the Financial Services Agency in 2010. From March 31, 2016 onwards, the total amount of solvency margin was partially amended in accordance with the Cabinet Office Ordinance No. 16 of 2016. Accordingly, the solvency margin ratios on and before March 31, 2011, March 31, 2012 through 2015 and March 31, 2016 onwards were calculated based on different standards. The figure in brackets “[ ]” as of March 31, 2011 is the figure disclosed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 on the assumption that the standard as of March 31, 2012 was applied on March 31, 2011.
4. The economic solvency ratio (ESR) is the capital amount based on economic value divided by the integrated risk amount based on economic value and is one of the indicators that represent the financial soundness of life insurance companies (Figures are based on the Company’s internal model; 99.5% confidence level).
5. Annualized premiums are calculated by multiplying the amount of a single premium installment payment by a multiplier determined according to the relevant payment method to arrive at a single annualized amount. For lump-sum payments, annualized premiums are calculated by dividing the total premium by the insured period.
6. Annualized premiums from policies in force include reinsured Postal Life Insurance Policies (for individual insurance, limited to Postal Life Insurance Policies (insurance)).
7. Third-sector insurance includes medical benefits (including hospitalization and surgery benefits), living benefits (including limited illness and nursing care benefits), and premium
payment waivers benefits (excluding disability and including specified diseases and nursing benefits).
8. In the calculation of EV and the value of new business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 onwards, an approach which utilizes the ultimate forward rate is applied as the
extrapolation method of interest rates at longer durations of the risk-free rates (an approach in which the forward rates for the last year of the market data onwards are assumed to
be the same is used for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 and before).
9. The value of new business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 onwards is calculated as the difference between the EV calculated on the basis of the profit and loss for all
in-force covered business including new business issued, and the EV calculated on the basis of the profit and loss for all in-force covered business if no new business had been
issued (the value of new business for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and before is calculated on the basis of the profit and loss for new business on a stand-alone basis).
10. The Company implemented a 30:1 stock split effective August 1, 2015. The lower rows of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015 for EPS have been calculated assuming
the stock split was implemented on April 1, 2013.
11. The Company established a Board Benefit Trust (BBT) in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Shares of the Company held in the trust, which was recorded as treasury stock
under the category of shareholders’ equity, were included in treasury stock to be deducted from the calculation of the average number of shares during the fiscal year, for the
purpose of calculating EPS.
12. The number of employees excludes employees assigned to other companies by Japan Post Insurance but includes employees assigned to Japan Post Insurance by other
companies. The figures exclude non-regular employees (including indefinite-term employees based on the indefinite-term employment conversion system).
13. Ratio of female managers represents the ratio as of April 1 of the following fiscal year.
14. Average age and average years of service are based on attained ages and years of service as of March 31, 2019, and truncated to the first decimal place.
15. Average years of service represent the number of years of continuous service including years at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Postal Services Agency (Ministry
of Internal Affairs and Communications) and Japan Post.
16. Rate of employees with disabilities represents the number employed by the Company on a non-consolidated basis, as of June 1 of each year. 17. Status of retention of new employees represents the retention rate of new graduates for each year after three years from their employment.

         Review of FY2019/3
With the advent of a super-aging society, the falling population is expected to have an impact on Japan’s life insurance market. On the other hand, the necessity for self-help efforts such as medical care protection, nursing care protection and preparing funds for life in old age is increasing. Customer needs are also becoming increasingly diverse owing to the diversification of lifestyles mainly among the young and middle- aged customer segments. The environment surrounding companies is also rapidly changing due to factors including the evolution of ICT.
Based on such recognition, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the first year of the Medium-term Management Plan 2020, we implemented the initiatives described below aiming for the “1) Strengthening of sales activities focusing on protection needs,” “2) Improvement in solicitation quality,” “3) Cultivation of new customer base,” “4) Development of new products,” and “5) Establishment of sales foundation.”
1 Strengthening of sales activities focusing on protection needs
Although the savings-type products that had been our specialty are losing their appeal in the prolonged low interest rate environment, life insurance is becoming increasingly important in order to be prepared for illness, injury, and longevity risks as lifespans extend in the aging society, and it has become vitally important for us to offer proposals attuned to such protection needs.
26 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we worked to enhance sales skills of sales personnel, including the supporting of meticulous training corresponding to the needs of individual sales personnel of Japan Post Co.
We also worked to strengthen proposal capabilities of our sales personnel so as to respond to diverse needs of company managers, taking advantage of other insurance companies’ products sold on commission, such as products for corporate clients and cancer insurance, in addition to our own products.
2 Improvement in solicitation quality
We worked to create solicitation materials that emphasize the appeal of our products effectively and describe product coverage in an easy-to-understand manner. In order to ensure thoroughgoing customer-first solicitation activities, we are implementing comprehensive measures to improve solicitation quality including the strengthening of confirmation of intent of elderly customers toward purchasing policies, the strengthening of employee coaching using solicitation quality diagnosis records that evaluate and analyze the solicitation quality for each post office and sales personnel, and the introduction of the maintenance rate for customer policies in the evaluation criteria for sales personnel.
3 Cultivation of new customer base (the uninsured and the young and middle-aged)
We endeavored to cultivate a new customer base by securing opportunities for contact with customers who are policyholders and their family members and potential customers who are uninsured through the publicizing of activities, such as Feel Secure with Kampo activities (launched in FY2016/3), the Family Registration Scheme (launched in FY2019/3) and the Sukoyakanpo health support app (launched January 2019). As a result, the number of new policies purchased by customers who are young and middle-aged (59 years old and younger) increased from the previous year, accounting for about 50% of the total number of new policies.
4 Development of new products
In order to respond to diverse customer needs by enriching our insurance products, we prepared for the launch of two new products in April 2019: the products with relaxed underwriting criteria Kampo ni Omakase for people with health issues and the advanced medical rider for further enrichment of medical care protection.
5 Establishment of sales foundation
We prepared for the introduction of new mobile
devices for sales in the fiscal year ending March 31,
2020. The introduction of these new mobile devices
for sales will enable us to offer easy-to-understand
explanations of products and services using video
clips. Moreover, these devices can manage sales
personnel schedules and record the status of sales
activities, thus increasing the efficiency of sales
activities. Furthermore, we worked to strengthen
sales support by expanding digital contact points with customers through the provision of attractive information and services utilizing LINE and the health support app (Sukoyakanpo).
Ongoing Initiatives
We will continue the initiatives implemented in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, including support of Japan Post Co. to upgrade sales skills for strengthening sales activities focusing on protection needs and development of products to meet diverse customer needs.
We will also work to further enhance solicitation quality. By ensuring customer-first sales activities, we will strive to live up to the trust and confidence of our customers.

Review of FY2019/3
The social environment is undergoing continual change year by year, including the diversification of customer needs amid transforming lifestyles, a declining labor population, and the evolution of ICT, and we recognize that the Company must also adapt appropriately to these changes.
In view of this social environment, in the Medium-term Management Plan 2020, we are addressing improvement of customer service and enhancement of efficiency in back-office administration in order to pursue customer- first business operations and achieve sustainable growth.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we implemented initiatives to improve customer service in terms of the scheme and the IT system, including introduction of the Family Registration Scheme in readiness for aging of policyholders and in the event of disaster and an “insurance procedure support system” for certain claims that prints the necessary information for various claim documents in advance and automatically determines the documents needed at the time of a claim so as to offer “simple, easy-to-understand claim procedures.”
Family Registration Scheme
Cases where the Family Registration Scheme comes in handy
  The policyholder wishes to check the policy details but cannot make an inquiry by himself/herself
 Notices on various procedures sent from Japan Post Insurance are not delivered to the policyholder or it becomes difficult to contact the policyholder because of a disaster, etc.
 The registered family member can check the policy details.
Note: The registered family member cannot make claims for payment of insurance or other benefits, make policy changes, etc.
 The post office or Japan Post Insurance will
contact the registered family member.
Note: If the mail addressed to the policyholder is undelivered because he/she has moved, the mail cannot be sent to the registered family member.
 28 JAPAN POST INSURANCE
If a member of the family is registered...
Enhancement of efficiency in back- office administration
Improvement of customer service

We continued the use of AI technology at Japan Post Insurance Call Centers for insurance claim payment and assessment operations and to handle inquiries from customers. We also began digitalization of paper forms at our Service Centers that handle processing after the receipt of various claims and also began initiatives for the introduction of RPA. The use of digital technology has enabled us to eliminate the use of about 32 million sheets of paper, leading to reduced paper consumption and higher administrative efficiency.
Ongoing Initiatives
As initiatives to improve customer service, we intend to expand the scope of claims that can be handled by the “insurance procedure support system,” introduce an “onscreen declaration/automated assessment system” that automatically performs assessment based on the declarations input by customers in paperless applications, and also introduce an “application form printing system” for printing application forms in which data prepared in advance are reflected in the case of applications for addition of riders mid-term, etc.

   We will promote the utilization of digital technologies to enhance efficiency in back-office administration, including studying the digitalization of the current paper-based policy maintenance administration process, such as changes in policyholder or beneficiary, and bank account registration, and expand the range of use of AI technology to cover inquiries from post offices regarding administrative procedures, as well as promote initiatives for full-scale introduction of RPA.
In addition to these initiatives, by carrying out improvements to existing administration, we intend to reduce the back-office administrative workload by an amount equivalent to approximately 1,000 people, and reallocate these freed-up resources to new areas that will lead to improvement of customer service or to focus areas such as sales support.

Review of FY2019/3
In response to the prolonged low interest rate environment, we have promoted diversification of asset management in order to ensure the yields promised to customers.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, in addition to the start of in-house management of U.S. corporate bonds, we implemented a new investment strategy for in-house management of Japanese equities that takes into account the growth potential of companies. We also began investment in overseas real estate and private equity funds managed by Japan Post Investment Corporation (“JP Investment”)(Note 1). Thus, we are steadily making progress with diversifying asset management.
As a result of promoting the diversification of asset management to increase profitability in our ALM-based asset management under the ERM framework, the ratio of risk assets(Note 2) to total assets of March 31, 2019 increased to 13.8%.

Diversification of asset management; Sophistication of risk management

Ongoing Initiatives
The operating environment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 had been unstable until December 2018, including the decline in share prices and the trend toward a stronger yen and a weaker dollar against the backdrop of increasing uncertainties about overseas economies. However, the operating environment recovered stability from January 2019 onward. Meanwhile, the end of the upward economic cycle is approaching in the U.S. and other developed countries whose economies have been expanding for many years. Regarding the outlook for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we believe uncertainties are increasing.
In these circumstances, while more closely monitoring the market environment in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, we will promote further diversification by expanding the target assets in each asset class we have invested in so far and enhancing the asset management methods.
 Key ongoing initiatives
 •Diversification of investment products (expand the target currencies in foreign bond investments, expand alternative investments, etc.)
• Expansion of in-house management (U.S. corporate bonds, equities)
• Enhancing of asset management methods (derivative transactions, etc.)
• Further promotion of ESG investment
• Sophistication of ALM and risk management
  Reinforcement of asset management framework
As measures for the asset management framework, we are strengthening human resources and the organizational framework.
As for strengthening of human resources, the number of employees engaged in asset management was 192 as of April 1, 2019, an increase of 19 from that as of April 1, 2018. While continuing efforts to secure human resources, we will strengthen expert human resources from a long-term perspective.
We have also expanded our organizational framework, including the establishment of the Alternative Investment Office, with the aim of bolstering alternative investment(Note). We will continue to enhance our organizational framework to promote the diversification of asset management.
Note: “Alternative investments” is a general term for new investment options or methods other than financial instruments that have a relatively long history such as bonds or listed stocks (traditional assets).

                 In order to accelerate digital transformation through the active use of ICT for further improving customer service and enhancing efficiency in back-office administration, we intend to invest approximately ¥120.0 billion during the period covered by the Medium-term Management Plan 2020 to establish ICT platforms.
We promoted the introduction of new mobile devices for sales in order to offer explanations of products using video clips and managing schedules of sales personnel, shift to electronic forms used for our back- office (Service Centers) operations, and construction of the next-generation open system for handling various claim procedures at post offices nationwide.
While promoting establishment of ICT platforms, we developed applications for the products with relaxed underwriting criteria Kampo ni Omakase and the advanced medical rider launched in April 2019. We also promoted development of the “insurance procedure support system” to realize simple, easy-to-understand claim procedures for customers and post offices. As a result, customers’ burden of completing claim forms has been greatly reduced and administrative efficiency at post offices has been enhanced.
In addition, we developed My Page, a Web service for policyholders, which enables “simple, easy-to- understand claim procedures, anywhere, anytime.”
Ongoing Initiatives
With the aim of becoming the No. 1 Japanese insurance company selected by customers, we will strive to enhance corporate value, mainly through the offering of high-grade, stable ICT services to customers by establishing ICT platforms compatible with environmental changes and new technologies.

Provision of services utilizing a health support app
The role expected of the life insurance business is shifting from the provision of conventional services, that is, protection against illness and injury, to the provision of services for prevention of illness and injury and for maintaining and promoting health. To fulfill such a role, we intend to vigorously support health and affluent lifestyles.
As a measure for such support, we have launched the Sukoyakanpo health support app that helps people pursue health at ease. The following two menus are available free of charge.
Promotion of Kampo Platinum Life Service
We are conducting a company-wide initiative called “Kampo Platinum Life Service” to win the favor of the growing number of elderly customers by offering age-friendly services based on a sense of security and trust that has been enabled by improving contacts with all customers from the perspective of our elderly customers.

 Initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions
We issue “Eco News,” a quarterly newsletter about energy saving, to encourage all our employees to take energy-saving action.
“Eco News” features articles on various topics, such as encouragement of energy-saving temperature setting for air conditioning, environmentally friendly driving, and reduced consumption of copy paper, and refraining from elevator use when traveling a couple of floors up or down (“2 up 3 down”), to raise employee awareness and promote vigorous action to reduce CO2 emissions.
Donations in line with online provision of Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions
On October 2, 2014, we made our Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions available online. Previously, we had provided our Contract Guidelines
  and Policy Conditions to all customers in a paper booklet format. By selecting “web viewing,” policyholders now have the option of confirming their Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions in PDF format on our website instead of receiving a paper brochure.
The provision of the Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions on the website eliminates the need for conventional brochures, thereby enabling a reduction in the amount of paper used. In July 2018, we donated a total of ¥33.0 million to 33 environmental groups working on forestation based on the number of customers who opted for online Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions in the 12 months from October 2016 to September 2017.

ESG investment activities
From the perspective of fulfilling our social responsibilities to all stakeholders, we are promoting initiatives to solve ESG issues facing society, and actively taking on challenges toward the sustainable growth of corporate value and social development.
In asset management, we will consider various factors of ESG in making investment decisions, in order to realize a sustainable society, improve investment results and reduce risks in the long-term.
ESG Investment Policy
As an institutional investor managing assets over the long term, we manage assets in accordance with the ESG Investment Policy. The ESG Investment Policy was established in view of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), in order to clarify our basic policies on ESG investment.
For details of Japan Post Insurance’s ESG Investment Policy, please refer to the Company’s website.
https://www.jp-life.japanpost.jp/english/aboutus/csr/en_abt_csr_esg.html
Integration of ESG factors into the investment process
 Initiatives in the area of internal domestic equity investments
We utilize ESG integration as a method to consider ESG factors in making investment decisions, and manage the following two domestic equity funds.
Fund investing in high-dividend companies whose corporate value is expected to increase over the medium- to long-term, based on comprehensive evaluation of companies’ initiatives on ESG issues and financial information.
Fund investing in companies that view ESG issues as a growth opportunity, based on evaluation of “contribution to performance” and “growth potential” of companies’ technological capabilities and business base which contribute to the achievement of SDGs and resolution of issues related to them, while taking financial information into consideration.
 Initiatives in the area of internal bond investments etc.
We utilize ESG-themed investment as a method to consider ESG factors in making investment decisions. We select themes that can widely contribute to the achievement of SDGs and the resolution of issues related to them, and invest in projects beneficial to the resolution of ESG issues.
Major ESG-themed investment examples
1) Investment in solar power generation projects
2) Investment in a Social Bond to finance socio-economic development in Africa
3) Investment in a Thematic Bond promoting gender equality
4) Investment in a Sustainable Development Bond to Raise Awareness of Health and Nutrition of Women, Children, and Adolescents 5) Investment in a Climate Awareness Bond

United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment signatory
We signed the UN PRI in October 2017 to promote ESG investment and to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. In accordance with the PRI, we are fulfilling our social responsibility as an institutional investor and will report our initiatives in our RI Transparency Report, which will be made available on the UN PRI website.
Stewardship activities
Through constructive engagement, we are striving to build strong relationships with investee companies and to appropriately monitor their status. We request investee companies to enrich disclosure of not only financial information but also non-financial information, including ESG factors, and check their initiatives concerning environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) issues.
Our voting activities are based on our Policies on the Exercise of Shareholders’ Voting Rights, but it is not a mechanical routine, as we take into consideration non-financial information, including ESG factors, and information earned from dialogues with companies.
We discuss and verify these stewardship activities at our Responsible Investment Advisory Committee with external experts.
For details of Japan Post Insurance’s stewardship activities, please refer to the Company’s website.

We established an Internal Audit Department that is independent of our business-executing departments to contribute to sound and appropriate business operations. We have set up an internal audit framework to review and assess the Company’s internal control system and the appropriateness and effectiveness of our business execution in accordance with the “International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing” developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
The Internal Audit Department carries out internal audits of various internal and external entities, including individual sections within the head office, regional headquarters, branches and our subsidiaries, as well as Japan Post Co., which acts as an agency of the Company.
48 JAPAN POST INSURANCE
Audited departments where problems or issues have been identified in an internal audit must carry out the corrections or improvements, and the improvement measures taken by audited departments are accurately evaluated. The Internal Audit Department reports the results of internal audits to the President, CEO, Representative Executive Officer, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.
The Internal Audit Department is also seeking to improve the professional skills required for auditing by enhancing its training programs for internal auditors and encouraging staff to obtain the relevant qualifications. At the same time, the Department has endeavored to strengthen the Company’s internal audit framework by securing experienced staff in each area of the Company’s operations.

We have established an operating structure to ensure effective and smooth operations of the Board of Directors. In particular, in order to increase the effectiveness of supervision by the Directors, we arrange a yearly schedule with sufficient time built in, provide accurate information as needed, fully explain the details of proposals in advance, and ensure time for prior discussion and question-and- answer sessions at the Board of Directors.
Furthermore, in an effort to give Outside Directors a better understanding of our operations, we set up opportunities for informal discussion apart from the meetings and proceedings of the Board of Directors, where Outside Directors can receive explanations of the situation at the Company with regard to timely and appropriate topics such as our digital strategies, workstyle reforms, etc. We also hold inspection tours of post offices and the Company’s regional headquarters and branches for Outside Directors.
Composition of the Board of Directors
Outside Directors exchange opinions with employees at regional headquarters and branches during an inspection tour (September 2018)

Dialogue between the CEO and an Outside Director

Mitsuhiko Uehira
Dialogue
Outside Director
(President of Work-Life Balance Co., Ltd.)
Yoshie Komuro
 Outside Director Yoshie Komuro and Director and President, CEO, Representative Executive Officer Mitsuhiko Uehira exchanged their views on the Board of Directors and workstyle reform of the Company.
The Board of Directors of Japan Post Insurance as seen by an Outside Director Uehira: The relationship between you and Japan Post Insurance started when we requested your advice and support regarding workstyle reform at the Company in 2015. After that, you assumed the position of Outside Director in June 2017, and almost two years have passed since that time. Could you give us your impression of Japan Post Insurance, as an Outside Director?
Komuro: When I was supporting workstyle reform at meetings with trial teams for reviewing workstyles, we worked together with employees to advance workstyle reform by receiving their input. Their comments provided insight from the close-up perspectives of managers and employees, so I still feel that the many conversations I had at that time were very fruitful.
Meanwhile, after I became a Director two years ago, and assumed a position involving supervision of the business-executing departments, I started to see things from a broader perspective, including
management policies and management strategies, which led me to many more new discoveries.
One example is the sheer number of customers. While the Board of Directors also touches on this topic from time to time, we have around 26 million customers. Japan has a population of 120 million, so roughly one in five people in Japan are our customers. This means that we have a truly massive customer base that is rarely seen at other life insurance companies. In addition, I feel that the fact that we provide insurance services through a vast network of about 20,000 post offices nationwide is our greatest strength from the perspective of competitive strategy. At the same time, I have the impression that we act as a “public institution for society.”
Uehira: Thank you. The Company’s predecessor, the Postal Life Insurance Service was created with the social mission of “protecting the means of fundamental livelihood of the public through simple procedures.” The privatization process has transferred that social mission to the Company as it is today, and the fact that we have inherited this social
56 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

mission makes me strongly aware that we have a role to play as a “public institution for society,” just as you say.
Director Komuro, having participated in our Board of Directors, what do you think about the Company serving this role?
Komuro: I take part in discussions regarding resolutions by the Board of Directors and various reports from business-executing departments, while thinking about the role the Company plays in society. The Outside Directors, who account for the majority of the Board of Directors come from a diverse mix of generations, genders, and backgrounds, and I feel that discussions at the Board of Directors meetings are very fruitful.
Furthermore, the business-executing departments provide me with thoughtful, detailed explanations before the Board of Directors meetings, so the Board does not have to spend a lot of time explaining the agenda, and instead can spend more time on discussions. I hear that the business-executing departments work hard to ensure that their meetings also run smoothly.
Uehira: I agree. I have been telling people inside the Company for a long time that all participants in our meetings should discuss important points and issues with an equal understanding. In order for this to happen, it is essential that the materials and explanations be very easy to understand. In that sense, I feel that various meetings held in the Company are also being improved accordingly. In addition, the importance of ensuring that everyone involved has an equal understanding of the points of discussion is not limited to meetings, but also applies to relationships between superiors and subordinates, as well as senior and junior employees. I feel that establishing an equal understanding will lead to workstyle reform, as it reduces wasted work resulting from various misunderstandings and mistakes.
Initiatives and results in workstyle reform
Komuro: The necessity for workstyle reform, as it is commonly discussed today, includes such aspects as addressing the labor shortage and supporting employees as they balance childcare or nursing care with their jobs. But I see our workstyle reform as moving one step beyond that point, to make Japan Post Insurance “a more comfortable company to work at.”
In 2015 I gave a lecture at a “Workstyle Review Seminar” aimed at our executives and managers. From that point forward, we have made incremental progress, and our efforts continue today as an initiative for all workplaces and employees. At each
workplace, we have established a system for identifying unique issues, examining measures for improvement, implementing these measures, and reflecting on progress.
When I received reports about initiatives for workstyle reform at last year’s Board of Directors meetings, I heard about the “Workstyle Reform Survey” that is currently underway. Each employee assigns scores to 15 items, including “Is there a shared awareness of delivering results in a limited time at your workplace?” and “Is your workplace an environment that makes it easy to take leave?” By aggregating these scores for each workplace, we can quantify matters that cannot normally be represented quantitatively, such as workplace culture and employee awareness, and I thought this enables employees to obtain an objective view of the state of their own workplaces. At the same time, when the Board of Directors is supervising the business- executing departments, I find it helpful to have access to such information as employee workplace awareness.
In addition, among the 15 questions in the survey, we ask employees, “Do you always act in the shoes of the customer or business partner?” This asks about the employee’s own awareness of customer-first job execution. I think it’s a wonderful achievement that this question yielded the highest average score of 4.07 out of 5 points.
Uehira: We have formulated our “Basic Policies for Customer-first Business Operations,” and announced these policies broadly, both inside and outside of the Company. In addition to announcing these basic policies, I believe it is important to work to foster employees who can continue to put these policies into practice on a daily basis. As a major prerequisite for this, it is necessary to increase the job satisfaction level of each of our employees, and we are using workstyle reform as a method to improve that satisfaction.
Komuro: So improving job satisfaction among employees through workstyle reform is linked to customer-first business operations. I believe that we are beginning to see various results of our continuous workstyle reform initiatives.
Uehira: I think so. We have reduced the average amount of overtime work per employee several years in a row, and that number was down to 8.4 hours per month in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. This is roughly half of those in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 which was four years ago. Furthermore, the rate of annual paid leave taken among all employees was 87.7% on average in the fiscal year ended March

31, 2019. This means that employees take about 17.5 days of annual paid leave, which is a very high level. In addition, all employees are given three days of paid leave for summer vacation and two days of paid leave for winter vacation.
We have also achieved an employment rate for people with disabilities that is higher than the statutory rate, and are continuing our support for wheelchair tennis, which we started in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. With regard to promotion of women’s career activities, we not only hold various training programs and seminars, but are also focusing on enabling networking by female employees, and at the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, 12.1% of management positions at the Company were occupied by women.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we received “Platinum Kurumin” (Note) certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. In addition, for the second year in a row, we have achieved a gold rating on the “PRIDE INDEX,” (Note) which evaluates LGBT-related initiatives at corporations.
Note: See page 21 for details on “Platinum Kurumin” and the “PRIDE INDEX.”
Komuro: We are actively working on health management as well. The “Sukoyakanpo” is an app that I myself personally use. It’s fun to manage the number of steps I walk every day in a stamp- collecting format with our corporate mascot, Kampo- kun, and it makes me want to walk more. So, it really is a great health support app.
Uehira: Thank you. Japan Post Insurance was also selected as a “Health and Productivity Management Outstanding Organization (White 500).” In addition, our promotion of Radio Exercise and support for
wheelchair tennis has also gained recognition, and we have been certified as a “Tokyo Sports Promotion Company.”
Radio Exercise was established more than 90 years ago by our predecessor, the Postal Life Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to promote the health of the people of Japan. While Japan’s modern super-aging society can be said to be undergoing a “health promotion boom,” we take pride of the fact that we have been engaged in health promotion for more than 90 years. Even today, we are working companywide to promote widespread participation in Radio Exercise, and we perform Radio Exercise during work hours, at all workplaces. Management takes the lead in this initiative, with all attendees of Executive Committee meetings performing Radio Exercise before meetings.
Komuro: Radio Exercise has really become a permanent part of the Japanese culture. I heard that the Radio Exercise attendance cards used by elementary school students during summer break are made and distributed by the Company. I see that the Company is undertaking a wide variety of efforts in health management and health promotion support.
Earlier, you elaborated on our efforts to promote the roles of women. In addition to the three female Outside Directors, we also have three female Executive Officers in the Company, which is a relatively high ratio. I heard that the ratio of female managers was 6.5% at the start of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. However, in just four years since then, that number has risen to 12.1%(Note). As I understand it, we are making great progress in promoting women’s career activities. Please tell us
   58 JAPAN POST INSURANCE

about your future plans for promoting women in the workplace.
Note: See page 20.
Uehira: Although it’s rather simple, it all comes down to properly evaluating, training, and promoting human resources, regardless of gender. If we continue to steadily practice this basic policy, then in the future, I expect we will approach approximately equal numbers of male and female employees and managers. We are working to become a company where everyone can work comfortably and demonstrate their full potential, regardless of their gender.
Komuro: Compared to other companies, we offer a good selection of support and systems for employees to balance childcare or nursing care with their jobs. Furthermore, our workplace culture makes it easier for them to use these systems, so I feel that our workplace enables people in various circumstances to shine.
Vision we hope to achieve through workstyle reform
Uehira: Our goal for promoting workstyle reform and diversity is to be “an attractive company that offers self-fulfillment and job satisfaction through work.” I want to create a virtuous spiral of improvement, in which every employee can work enthusiastically and grow through self-fulfillment. The presence of such actively working, appealing employees will then make
Japan Post Insurance a more attractive company. What I mean by “self-fulfillment” is that employees
can feel themselves growing, even if it’s little by little, through their day-to-day work. I think a lot of people consider their professional and private lives to be completely separate. However, I believe that personal development within a company also leads to growth within society outside of the Company. Furthermore, the growth of our employees also translates to growth of the Company.
There is still room for many improvements to be made regarding employee workstyle, and I want to make our workplace culture even better. There are still so many things left for us to do. We would like you to continue to demonstrate her skills to accelerate these improvements.
Komuro: Thank you very much. Appealing employees make the Company itself a more attractive company. Those are wonderful words that really leave an impression. I will do my best on the Board of Directors, to ensure that the Company can continue its efforts as a pioneer in workstyle reform, and trigger efforts by other companies as well.

Risk Management Systems
Economic, demographic and other conditions surrounding the life insurance industry business environment are dramatically changing. As a life insurance company, Japan Post Insurance needs to ensure the financial stability and soundness of business operations now and into the future in order to manage the precious funds entrusted to us by customers and ensure payment of the sum insured to secure their living in times of need. In particular, as we have a social mission to take part in constantly providing the universal service products of endowment insurance and whole life insurance through the post office network, appropriate risk management is extremely important.
We have formulated the “Risk Appetite Statement” as part of our risk-taking strategies. In addition, we recognize effective risk management according to the various risk profiles of the life insurance business as one of management’s highest priorities. Our Basic Risk Management Policy stipulates fundamental matters that include our basic principle for risk management and risk management systems and techniques, and we implement risk management in accordance with this policy. As our basic principle, we undertake risk management with an aim to achieve a higher capital efficiency and risk return ratio, while maintaining financial soundness based on management strategies, in addition to avoiding unforeseen losses. Our risk management systems perform comprehensive risk management and risk management by risk category.
Outline of Risk Management Systems
In accordance with the “Basic Risk Management Policy,” we have set up and regularly convene the Risk Management Committee headed by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), while formulating rules of risk management.
The Risk Management Committee deliberates on risk management policies and matters concerning the establishment and operation of risk management systems as well as on matters concerning the implementation of risk management. This committee also performs appropriate risk management by monitoring and analyzing the status of each risk and other related matters. The CRO submits and reports on important matters to the Executive Committee for discussion.
Also, the CRO controls the Company’s risk management and builds, verifies and upgrades risk management systems in accordance with changes in risk management circumstances and the operating environment. The Risk Management Department is in charge of overall control of risk management and under the direction of the CRO executes affairs concerning building, verifying and upgrading risk management systems. At the same time, it regularly verifies the status of risk management by monitoring, analyzing and managing the state of risk management in sections responsible for performing risk management in each risk category (“risk management sections”).
Each of the Executive Officers in charge of risk management sections operate and upgrade the systems for managing their respective assigned risks by ascertaining the presence, types and profile of risk, as well as the risk management techniques and systems as prescribed by the Basic Risk Management Policy. While operating a mutual checks and balances system with departments of the head office and branches in charge of business execution, risk management sections appropriately fulfill their monitoring role and manage their assigned risks in accordance with risk management standards. As investment risk and operational risk have multiple subcategories, we have designated the Risk Management Department for handling comprehensive risk management in conjunction with the risk management sections for respective subcategories.
In order to strengthen our risk management systems, the Internal Audit Department conducts internal audits and examines the appropriateness and effectiveness of our risk management systems.
In enforcing risk management, we collaborate with the risk management departments of Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd. and JAPAN POST INSURANCE SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Co., Ltd., the Company’s subsidiary.

Comprehensive Risk Management (Enterprise Risk Management (ERM))
We ascertain risk on an overall basis, which encompasses latent significant risks, for any risk we face and compare and contrast various risks with our capital and other areas in managing risk for our overall business.
As our basic principle, based on the characteristics of the life insurance business, we manage companywide risks by comparing the risk amount with the capital amount on an economic-value basis, in compliance with current
Implementation of Stress Tests
We implement periodic stress testing to ascertain the impact of an event that has a low but certain probability of occurring and could have a significant effect on the Company.
In establishing stress scenarios we undertake the following:
• We cover all risk categories that could have a significant impact on the Company taking into consideration the Company’s risk profile status.
• Besides historical scenarios that have occurred in the past, we simulate forward- looking hypothetical scenarios that could occur in the future.

solvency margin regulations applicable to insurance companies, with a view to improving capital efficiency while maintaining financial soundness.
In addition, we promote the sophistication of our ERM system through the application of ERM to the management plans and others, in an effort to attain stable profit and sustainable increases in our corporate value.
• We consider the impacts on the Company under a combined (comprehensive) stress scenario.
Specifically, we add sub-scenarios (financial market turmoil, mass lapse, etc.) into four main scenarios (a rise in interest rates, a decline in interest rates, the occurrence of a major earthquake and the widespread outbreak of a new strain of influenza).
Based on the analysis of the impacts on loss situation and soundness under the stress scenarios, the results of stress tests are periodically reported to the Risk Management Committee and the Executive Committee to be used in management judgments.

We manage risk by designating risk management sections in respective risk categories. The Risk Management Department, which is in charge of the overall control of risk management, verifies the status of respective risk management sections based on their reports, while periodically reporting on relevant matters to the Risk Management Committee.
Risk management in each risk category is described in the sections below.
Insurance Underwriting Risk
Life insurance policies are contracts that provide long-term coverage to policyholders against the risk of death, illness or injury. Upon underwriting, we need to make accurate assessment and analysis of potential risks and appropriately reflect identified risks in the corresponding premiums.
Accordingly, we undertake such activities as verifying our setting of premium rates and assessing and analyzing the occurrence of insured events.
The Economic Value Promotion Office, Actuarial and Accounting Department, which is the section to perform insurance underwriting risk, conducts
Investment Risk
To provide for anticipated payment of insurance claims and other benefits, we need to carefully manage funds entrusted to us from customers under life insurance policies.
Based on this perspective, in order to maintain sound management and offer a sense of assurance to customers, we have a basic investment policy to secure stable asset management by investing in and financing yen- denominated interest-bearing assets, such as Japanese public and corporate bonds and loans, matched to the long-term and fixed interest rate characteristics of our liabilities. With a view to improving profitability, we also promote diversification of our asset portfolio to the extent allowed in managing investment risk.
Funding Risk
Operation of the life insurance business involves making and receiving payments to and from customers and business partners as we pay insurance claims and other benefits and conduct fund management. Any trouble in the settlement of these funds will not just cause inconvenience to the parties concerned but also lead to situations that preclude the continued operation of the business itself.
To avoid such situations and ensure smooth cash flows, we enforce rigid fund management by monitoring incoming and outgoing cash flows, including the receipt of premiums and payment of insurance claims, on a daily basis.
risk management appropriately by measuring the amount of insurance underwriting risk, evaluating the profitability of each product sold and verifying the appropriateness of our underwriting standards from a medical perspective.
As required in managing insurance underwriting risk, we conduct ceded reinsurance upon fully studying the financial status of reinsurers. On the other hand, when underwriting reinsurance, we secure the required information, study the profitability and risk characteristics and verify whether the underwriting risk is restricted to cause no serious impact on management.
The Risk Management Department, which is the section to perform investment risk management, the Credit Department and the General Affairs Department are assigned the task of managing investment risk. These sections monitor investment risk and enforce appropriate management under a checks and balances system with departments of the head office in charge of business execution. The Risk Management Department provides comprehensive management of investment risk, working in collaboration with the Credit Department and General Affairs Department. Meanwhile, we strive to develop adequate risk management systems according to the risk profiles of our diversifying asset portfolio.
The Cash-Flow and Expense Management Department, which is the section to perform funding risk management, has defined categories corresponding to cash flow tightness and established risk management standards in each category. The section implements appropriate management of funding risk by performing management and verification in accordance with these standards. Moreover, we carry out stress tests related to funding risks, assuming a large amount of policy surrenders and lapses, in an effort to improve cash flow management.

Market Liquidity Risk
We may sell assets in which we have made investments using funds entrusted to us from customers, and may incur losses when we are forced to conduct such transactions at extremely unfavorable prices than normal or are unable to execute such transactions at all because of market turmoil.
Accordingly, we make investments primarily in assets with high liquidity.
Operational Risk

In the current situation where an extensive scope of our business processing relies on information systems, major system failures or delays in system development could cause considerable inconvenience to customers and result in the loss of our credibility. Therefore, as the section to perform computer system risk management, the IT Systems Planning Department strives to reduce computer system risk by verifying and supervising that the risk is appropriately managed by system administration personnel in the departments that maintain information systems.

Stakeholder Engagement
General Meeting of Shareholders
For the 13th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders, we strived to improve the convenience for shareholders and enhance communication with them.
We worked on the early dispatch and disclosure of the Convocation Notice so that our shareholders would have enough time to carefully review the proposals. Moreover, in addition to ensuring the exercise of voting rights via the Internet, we addressed the issue of improving the environment for shareholders to exercise their voting rights by participating in the virtual platform recommended by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which allows institutional investors to conduct the electronic exercise of voting rights.
At the meeting, we strived to explain our business lines using video materials to facilitate the understanding of attending shareholders. We also enhanced interactive communication through the Q&A session with shareholders on such issues as the Company’s asset management strategies and the profitability of new products.
After the meeting, we swiftly disclosed the shareholder newsletter, the results of the exercised voting rights and other relevant information on the Company’s website as part of our efforts to enhance the provision of corporate information to shareholders.

 Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan
Unlike the Postal Life Insurance Policies before the privatization, the life insurance policies of Japan Post Insurance after the privatization do not involve government guarantees for the payment of insurance claims. The policyholders’ protection scheme applies to the life insurance policies in the same way as other life insurance companies.
•Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan
Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation of Japan (“Protection Corporation”) is a corporation established pursuant to the Insurance Business Act. It serves as a mutual assistance mechanism for the purpose of life insurance policyholder protection in the event of the default of a member life insurance company. The Protection Corporation engages in processes and measures including financial support for facilitating the transfer of the insurance portfolio from the insurer in default, along with the succeeding insurer’s general business administration, underwriting of the transferred portfolio and financial support for the payment of insurance claims covered under the policyholder protection scheme, as well as the purchase of rights of claim for insurance concerned, in an effort to ensure policyholder protection, thereby sustaining the credibility of the life insurance industry.
Because of the nature of life insurance policies, taking out a new insurance policy under the same conditions as the insurer in default could involve some difficulty due to the policyholder’s age and health status. Therefore, in the event of the default of an insurance company, the Protection Corporation provides financial support for the transfer of the insurance portfolio, thereby ensuring continuous insurance coverage for the policyholder.
The portfolio subject to transfer covered under the policyholder protection scheme must, according to the provisions of the Insurance Business Act, etc., comprise life insurance policies originally written in Japan (excluding those associated with the specified special account (*1) for performance-linked insurance contracts), in which the limits of indemnity are set to be equivalent to 90% of the relevant policy reserve, etc. (*2), except for the high assumed interest rate
policies (*3) (which does not mean that the policyholder protection scheme provides 90% of the level of protection provided by the original insurance claims or annuities (*4)).
The transfer of the insurance portfolio might involve, apart from the reduction in policy reserve, etc., changes in experience assumptions (including assumed interest rate, assumed rate of mortality and assumed rate of expenses) that serve as the basis of calculating policy terms and conditions, in order to ensure adequate maintenance of the insurance portfolio with reasonable security on a continuous basis, which could entail a reduction in the level of protection provided by the original insurance policies or annuities. Furthermore, special early surrender loading (involving a special surrender charge apart from the normal surrender charge for a certain period of time, for the purpose of sustaining a group of insured parties and the insurance policies associated therewith) might be established.
Indemnity ratio in the high assumed interest rate policies
= 90%
-
[aggregate of (assumed interest
rate less basic interest rate in ÷ 2] each year in the past 5 years)
Notes:1. The basic interest rate shall be determined by the Commissioner of the Financial Services Agency and the Minister of Finance, based on the average rate of investment returns in the past five years at life insurance companies. The current basic interest rate is 3% (information about the current basic interest rate is provided on our website).
2. In the case where different assumed interest rates apply to the basic coverage and riders under one policy, each such basic coverage and rider applied by a different assumed interest rate shall be regarded as an independent insurance policy, and subject to the evaluation to determine whether it constitutes a high assumed interest rate policy. Meanwhile, in the case of a collective insurance policy such as a group insurance policy where a premium is paid by each insured individual to whom a different assumed interest rate applies, each such insured individual is considered to have taken out an independent insurance policy individually, and is subject to the evaluation regarding whether or not such independent individual policy constitutes a high assumed interest rate policy. However, in the case of defined contribution plan products, each insured individual is subject to the evaluation regarding whether or not he/she is a holder of a high assumed interest rate policy, regardless of whether he/she pays the premium.
*1 This refers to a special account for the insurance policies that do not involve minimum guarantees (such as guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum maturity benefit) of the insurance policies involving the establishment of a special account. Corporate reorganization procedures for the insurer in default might be based on the preparation of a reorganization plan without involving a reduction in the policy reserve, etc., for the insurance policies concerned (whether implementing such reduction or not shall be determined in the course of an individual reorganization procedure).
*2 Policy reserve, etc. refers to the reserve funded based on insurance premiums and investment proceeds for the future payment of insurance claims, annuities and benefits.
*3 This refers to the policies with an assumed interest rate constantly beyond a basic interest rate (Note 1) in the five years prior to the default (Note 2). For such policies, the limit of indemnity for the policy reserve, etc. shall be as follows, provided, however, that such limit shall not go below the limit of reimbursement in the case where no financial support is provided to the insurer in default.
*4 Likewise, it does not mean that the Protection Corporation provides 90% of the level of the guaranteed minimum maturity benefit originally provided under the individual variable annuity.

2. This refers to the payment of insurance claims, covered under the policyholder protection scheme based on insurable events during the default proceedings, as well as the Protection Corporation’s purchase of rights to claim insurance money, etc. associated with the insurance policies covered under the policyholder protection scheme. In such instances, the payment ratio and purchase ratio are the same as the ratio of the limit of indemnity for policy reserve, etc. (The ratios in the case of high assumed interest rate policies are as described in (*).)
* All descriptions of the scheme, including the scope and the limit of indemnity of the policies covered under the policyholder protection scheme, are based on current laws and regulations, and could be subject to change in the future in accordance with revisions of relevant laws and regulations.
[Reference] Government guarantee for the Postal Life Insurance Policies
The administration for the Postal Life Insurance Policies taken out before the privatization will be succeeded and managed by the Management Network until expiry. The government guarantee for the payment of insurance claims associated with them will continue until those policies expire.
Unlike the Postal Life Insurance Policies, the life insurance policies of Japan Post Insurance do not involve a government guarantee for the payment of insurance claims. The policyholders’ protection scheme applies to the life insurance policies in the same way as other life insurance companies.

Sample of customer comments
∙ When applying for insurance, I was informed about the Family Registration Scheme. It was explained to me that if the policyholder could not be contacted due to an accident or if various notifications did not reach him or her, a registered family member would be contacted. I felt that this system would provide a peace of mind in unexpected circumstances, and completed the registration procedures.
∙ Thank you for visiting my house as part of “Feel Secure with Kampo” activities. The salesperson explained my current insurance coverage and I was able to refresh my understanding of the policy. The salesperson took care of my business kindly while we chatted, and I felt that this was someone I could really rely on. I look forward to dealing with Japan Post Insurance in the future.

 Examples of Improvement Based on Our Customers’ Comments
 Customer comment
  Improvement
   I applied for an insurance policy but was declined. I would like you to sell insurance that is easily accessible to people who have previously been ill.
  In April 2019, we launched Kampo ni Omakase, products with relaxed underwriting criteria that makes it easier to enroll for those with health concerns. We set declaration items that allow as many people as possible to enroll, including those who have chronic diseases such as diabetes or past illness. In some cases, partial coverage may be available for illnesses that occurred before enrollment in the insurance policy and worsened or recurred after enrollment.
Note: Insurance premiums are higher than our other insurance products and some coverage is reduced.
   I would feel more secure if there were products that covered advanced medical treatment that involves high costs.
 In April 2019, we launched a non-participation advanced medical rider (no cash value), which pays an amount (up to ¥3 million in total) equivalent to the fully self-paid amount not covered by public health insurance system benefits, and the technical fees for advanced medical treatment* that can be very expensive, in the case of receiving medical treatment that falls under the scope of advanced medical treatment.
*Medical technologies specified by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare from among new treatment or therapies being studied and developed, and that are at the stage of being evaluated to determine whether they should be covered by public health insurance in the future.
Note: Subject to conditions, including that the advanced medical rider can be added only to basic insurance policies to which the comprehensive medical rider has been added.
   I designated a bank account for insurance, but there were so many items that I had to fill in, which was tedious. Can something be done about that?
   We expanded the scope of the insurance procedure support system introduced in October 2018, and improved the procedures so that bank accounts for insurance can be designated or changed simply by filling in the date of notification and a signature (or signing and seal).
Note: The insurance procedure support system was introduced in October 2018 to allow procedures to be carried out smoothly. Employees enter information obtained from customers into a mobile device, which outputs a payment claim form with the required items already filled in. In principle, customers only have to fill out the date of the claim and their signature (or signing and seal).

1 SummaryofConsolidatedFinancialResultsfortheFiscalYearEndedMarch31,2019

JAPAN POST INSURANCE
The Japanese economy in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 continued a gradual recovery trend as capital expenditures increased and personal consumption improved, despite sluggish growth in exports and production. Although the U.S. continued solid recovery driven by domestic demand, growth rate in Europe weakened due to factors including a slowdown in the manufacturing industry, and a moderate decline in the growth rate continued in China.
The role of the life insurance industry is growing ever more to support self-help efforts of customers by strengthening sales channels and developing products in response to customers’ diversifying needs and heightened selectivity, which mirrors such trends as a continued low interest rate environment, the aging of society with declining birthrates, a growing number of one-person households, and evolving lifestyles.
Under these circumstances, the Company has set forth its management philosophy of “Be a trustful partner for people, always being close at hand and endeavoring to protect their well-being.” Based on this management philosophy, we offer a unique business model of providing simple and easy-to-understand products with smaller coverage amounts to as many customers as possible through the nationwide network of post offices.
Under this management philosophy, the Company, aiming to increase profit in both sales and asset management and reverse the decreasing trend and achieve growth in annualized premiums from policies in force, pursued three key strategies related to sales and products, administrative services, and asset management, by setting “thoroughly implementing customer-first business operations,” “achieving sustainable growth,” and “maintaining sound business operations,” as our fundamental management approach while leveraging the Kampo brand of “reliability” and “trustworthiness.”
Ordinary income amounted to ¥7,916.6 billion (0.5% decrease year on year), comprising the sum of insurance premiums and others of ¥3,959.9 billion (6.5% decrease year on year), investment income of ¥1,204.4 billion (6.2% decrease year on year), and other ordinary income of ¥2,752.2 billion (13.2% increase year on year).
Ordinary expenses amounted to ¥7,651.7 billion (0.1% increase year on year), comprising the sum of insurance claims and others of ¥6,868.8 billion (0.3% decrease year on year), investment expenses of ¥146.0 billion (37.6% increase year on year), operating expenses of ¥519.8 billion (2.6% decrease year on year), other ordinary expenses of ¥117.0 billion (2.5% increase year on year) and others.
As a result, ordinary profit amounted to ¥264.8 billion (14.3% decrease year on year), and net income attributable to Japan Post Insurance amounted to ¥120.4 billion (15.3% increase year on year), which is calculated by adjusting extraordinary gains or losses, and subtracting provision for reserve for policyholder dividends and total income taxes from ordinary profit.

JAPAN POST INSURANCE CO., LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of JA- PAN POST INSURANCE Co., Ltd. (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations concerning preparation of con- solidated financial statements, Ordinance for Enforcement of Insurance Business Act and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain re- classifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form that is more familiar to readers outside Ja- pan.
All Japanese yen figures in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen, except for per share information. Accordingly, the total of each account may not be equal to the combined total of indi- vidual items.
The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japa- nese yen, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorporated and mainly operates. The translations of Japa- nese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.99 to US$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2019. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(1) Consolidation and Equity Method 1) Scope of consolidation
Under Japanese GAAP, a company is required to con- solidate any subsidiary when the company substantially controls the operations of the subsidiary, even if it is not majority owned. Control is defined as the power to govern the decision-making body of an enterprise. The consolidated financial statements for all periods presented include the accounts of the Company and a subsidiary, JAPAN POST INSUR- ANCE SYSTEM SOLUTIONS Co., Ltd. (collectively, the “Group”). There are no non-consolidated subsidiaries.
2) Application of the equity method
A company is required to apply the equity method ac- counting to its non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates under Japanese GAAP. There are no non-consolidated subsidiaries that qualify for the equi- ty method accounting, while the Company has 3 affiliates in 2019 (2 in 2018) including Japan Post In- vestment Corporation that are not accounted for by the
equity method because their net income (loss), re- tained earnings, and others are immaterial, and the exclusion of these companies from the scope of com- panies accounted for by the equity method does not hinder a reasonable understanding of the Group’s fi- nancial position and results of operations.
3) Fiscal year-end date of the consolidated subsidiary
The fiscal year-end date of the consolidated subsidi- ary is the same as the consolidated balance sheet date.
(2) Securities
Securities including cash and deposits, as well as mone- tary claims bought, which are equivalent to securities, and securities invested in money held in trust, are record- ed based on the following:
1) Held-to-maturity bonds
Held-to-maturity bonds are carried at amortized cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculated us- ing the moving-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
2) Policy-reserve-matching bonds
In accordance with “Temporary Treatment of Account- ing and Auditing Concerning Policy-Reserve-Matching Bonds in the Insurance Industry” (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Au- dit Committee Report No. 21), policy-reserve-matching bonds are carried at amortized cost and the cost of these securities sold is calculated using the mov- ing-average method.

4) Available-for-sale securities
A) Available-for-sale securities at fair value
Available-for-sale securities at fair value are carried at their fiscal year-end market price, of which the average market prices during the final month of the fiscal year are used to value stocks. The cost of se- curities sold is calculated using the moving-average method.
B) Available-for-sale securities for which the fair val- ues are deemed extremely difficult to determine Government and corporate bonds (including foreign bonds) without a market price for which the premium or discount represents the interest adjustments are carried at the amortized cost (the straight-line meth- od) using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at cost using the moving-aver- age method.

(3) Derivative Transactions
All derivative transactions are valued at fair value.
(4) Hedge Accounting
1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for for- eign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its for- eign-currency-denominated bonds, as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Ac- counting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the con- tract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
A) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-denominated bonds
B) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign-currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the ag- gregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted in cases of foreign ex- change contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or in- terest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.
(5) Depreciation
1) Tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated us- ing the straight-line method based on the following useful lives:
Buildings : 2−60 years
(6)
Reserve for Possible Loan Losses
Reserve for possible loan losses is provided pursuant to the Company’s standards for self-assessment of asset quality, and general allowance is provided using a rate based on historical collectability experience. In addition, specific allowances, which are determined based on in- dividual collectability of accounts, are recorded.
All loans and claims are assessed initially by the rele- vant departments based on internal rules for self-assessment of asset quality. The asset evaluation de- partment, which is independent from the relevant departments, reviews these self-assessments. The above reserves and allowances are recorded based on the re- sults of these assessments.
For loans and guaranteed loans that were extended to borrowers that have filed for bankruptcy, including legal bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation, or that are considered substantially bankrupt, an allowance is provided for in the amount of loans, net of collateral value or the amounts expected to be recoverable under guarantees. The re- serve for possible loan losses also includes amounts set aside for other assets subject to valuation allowance. The amounts written off for loans and other assets during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were ¥232 million ($2 million) and ¥65 million, respectively.
Policy Reserves
Policy reserves are reserves provided in accordance with Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act. Insurance pre- mium reserves are recorded based on the following methodology:
1) Reserves for contracts subject to the standard policy reserves are calculated in accordance with the meth- od prescribed by the Commissioner for Financial Services Agency (Ordinance No. 48 issued by the Ministry of Finance in 1996).
2) Reserves for other contracts are calculated based on the net level premium method.
They include policy reserves accumulated additionally
in the year ended March 31, 2018, in preparation for future performance of obligations for lump-sum payment annu- ities, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
In addition, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5, of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, additional policy reserves are accumulated, in preparation for future performance of obligations, over a 10-year peri- od from the year ended March 31, 2011, for a portion of reinsurance contracts from the Management Organization, which is an independent administrative institution. As a re- sult, the amounts of provision for the additional policy reserves for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were ¥179,882 million ($1,621 million) and ¥180,903 million, respectively.
The Management Organization, which was renamed the Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insurance and Post Office Network on April 1, 2019, was established in October 2007 to support the privatization of Japan Post by succeeding from Japan Post postal savings such as fixed amount or term postal savings deposited and Postal
Other tangible fixed assets:
2−20 years
2) Intangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
The capitalized development costs of software intend- ed for internal use are amortized over the expected useful life of mainly 5 years using the straight-line method.
3) Leased assets
The Group mainly leases vehicles under finance lease arrangements that do not transfer the ownership of leased property to the lessee.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer own- ership are depreciated to a residual value of zero using the straight-line method over the lease term.
(7)

Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 to ensure that such postal savings and Postal Life Insurance are managed appropriately and to fulfill the relevant liabili- ties without fail.
The Company has entered into reinsurance contracts comprising outsourcing agreements for the administrative operation of the Postal Life Insurance and reinsurance contracts for insurance liabilities based on former Postal Life Insurance Contracts, for Postal Life Insurance Con- tracts concluded by September 2007 that have been assumed by the Management Organization.
In addition, based on the master plan by the Postal Ser- vice Privatization Act, with respect to the amount equivalent to that lent to policyholders of the Postal Life In- surance Contracts and to Japanese local governments and others succeeded from Japan Post Corporation, the Company has lent loans to the Management Organization under the same loan conditions as those of the contracts between Japan Post and its counterparties.
(8) Retirement Benefits
In calculating the projected benefit obligation, the benefit formula basis is used to attribute the expected benefit to the respective service period.
The actuarial difference is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employees from the fiscal year following the respec- tive fiscal year in which the difference is incurred.
Prior service cost is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employ- ees in the fiscal year of incurrence.

Transactions for granting shares and others of the Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust
The Company has introduced a trust-based perfor- mance-linked stock compensation system for executive officers of the Company from the year end- ed March 31, 2017.
The Company has adopted “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc., through Trusts” (Practical Issues Task Force (“PITF”) No. 30, March 26, 2015) with re- spect to the accounting treatment of the aforementioned trust agreement.
1) Outline of the transaction
In accordance with predetermined stock benefit rules, the Company shall grant its executive officers a certain number of points depending on the per- formance for the fiscal year, and later shall have the Board Benefit Trust (BBT) grant executive officers who meet the requirements for eligibility at the time of their retirement a given number of shares of the Company equivalent to the number of such points accumulated up to their retirement, as well as the amount of money equivalent to a certain portion of such number of shares, as calculated by the fair value at the time of their retirement.
Shares to be granted to executive officers, in- cluding the portion of shares to be granted in the future, are managed separately as trust assets through purchases by the trust bank from the stock market using the fund held in trust in advance by the Company.
2) Shares of the Company held in trust
Shares of the Company held in trust are recorded as treasury stock under the category of net assets at book value in the trust (excluding accompanying expenses). The book value of such treasury stock at the end of the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, was ¥450 million ($4 million) and ¥466 mil- lion, respectively, while the number of such treasury stock was 191 thousand shares and 198 thousand shares, respectively.

JAPAN POST INSURANCE
The outline of the risk management policy of policy-reserve-matching bonds was as follows:
The Company categorizes its insurance products into the following sub-groups based on the attributes of each product to manage risks arising from fluctuations in the interest rates of assets and liabilities, and adopts a management policy whereby the duration gap between policy-reserve-matching bonds and policy reserves by sub-groups are reconciled within a certain range and the duration gap is periodically checked.
1) Postal Life Insurance Contracts (insurance policies with a remaining period within 30 years)
2) Japan Post Insurance life insurance contracts (general) (all insurance policies)
3) Japan Post Insurance life insurance contracts (lump-sum payment annuity) (excluding some insurance types)
The remaining period of insurance policies comprising the sub-group covering Postal Life Insurance Contracts used to be
within 20 years, but has been changed to within 30 years from the year ended March 31, 2019, as the issuance of 30- and 40-year Japanese government bonds has expanded to facilitate duration gap adjustment of long-term insurance contracts. This change has no effect on profit or loss.

6. LOANS
  There were no bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans, past due loans for three months or more or restructured loans as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Definitions for each of the respective loans are as follows:
Bankrupt loans refer to non-accrual loans, excluding the balances already written off, which meet the conditions prescribed in Article 96, Paragraph 1, Item 3-(a) to (e) and Item 4, of the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act (Ordinance No. 97 in 1965). The interest accruals of such loans are suspended because the principal or interest on such loans is unlikely to be collect- ed due to delinquency in payments for them for a considerable period of time or other reasons.
Non-interest accrual loans are those loans for which interest payments have been suspended to assist and support the bor- rowers in the restructuring of their business.
Past due loans for three months or more are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date, excluding those classified as bankrupt loans and non-accrual loans.
Restructured loans are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business. This category excludes loans classified as bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans and past due loans for three months or more.

25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
(1) Policy for Handling Financial Instruments
The Company promotes matching between assets and li- abilities using yen-denominated interest-bearing assets, taking into consideration the characteristics of liabilities so as to maintain sound management and ensure pay- ments for insurance claims and others. The Company endeavors to invest in yen-denominated bonds such as Japanese local government bonds and Japanese corpo- rate bonds, of which the yield is expected to be relatively higher than that of Japanese government bonds, as well as in risk assets including foreign bonds and stocks from the perspective of improving profitability as well as to strengthen the risk management system.
Derivative transactions are identified as a key hedging method against foreign exchange fluctuation risk and in- terest rate risk to our investment assets, and these are not used for speculative purposes.
(2) Features and Risks of Financial Instruments
Financial assets owned by the Company consist mainly of securities and loans, and are managed by using an asset liability management (ALM) framework. Such secu- rities are exposed to credit risk of their issuing bodies as well as market price fluctuation risk and interest rate risk. In addition, foreign-currency-denominated bonds are ex- posed to foreign exchange risk. Moreover, the Company owns loans with floating interest rates, which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Derivative transactions that the Company uses are mainly foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. These are used to hedge interest rate risk and for- eign exchange fluctuation risk limited to the purpose of hedging and are not meant for speculative purposes. The market-related risk of derivative transactions is therefore
reduced and limited.

(3) Risk Management Framework for Financial Instruments 1) Management of market risk
Market risk is the risk of losses resulting from fluctua- tion in the value of assets and liabilities held that include off-balance sheet assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in various market risk factors such as inter- est rates, foreign exchange rates and stock prices. Market risk is categorized into interest rate risk and market price fluctuation risk for its management. Inter- est rate risk is the risk of losses resulting from fluctuation in the value of interest-bearing assets de- nominated in yen and insurance liabilities due to fluctuations in yen interest rates, and the risk arises as the Company has a certain limit in matching assets with liabilities, as an insurance company with a mis- sion to offer universal service products including endowment insurance and whole life insurance. Mar- ket price fluctuation risk is any market risk other than interest rate risk.
Among the company-wide risks including market risk, the Company identifies those that can be quanti- fied and manages the company-wide risks by comparing the capital amount and the company-wide integrated risk amount calculated based on the amount of the quantified risks.
2) Management of credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of losses resulting from a decline or elimination in the value of assets including off-bal- ance-sheet assets due to deterioration in the financial conditions of borrowers and other reasons.
To control investment and lending to borrowers with high credit risk, the Company manages its investment

and lending by prescribing credit eligibility rules based on internal rating. Moreover, to prevent concen- tration of credit risk on a particular borrower, group or industry, the Company establishes credit limits corre- sponding to internal rating and standards of credit shares by industry.
The results of their activities are reported to the risk management committee regularly.
(4) Additional Notes Concerning the Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument includes prices based on market quotations as well as rationally calculat- ed prices for those for which the market prices are not

Notes:
1. Money held in trust classified as other than trading, held-to-maturity and policy-reserve-matching.
2. In the column of “Net unrealized gains (losses),” the difference between the consolidated balance sheet amount after deduction of reserve for possible loan losses and
the fair value is provided.
3. Reserve for possible loan losses corresponding to loans has been deducted.
4. Net receivables and payables arising from derivative transactions are stated at net values, and if the values are negative, they are indicated in parentheses.

The calculation methods for fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Assets
1) Cash and deposits
Deposits (including negotiable certificates of deposit) mature within the short term (one year), and their fair val- ue approximates book value.
2) Call loans and 3) Receivables under securities borrowing transactions
These are settled within the short term (one year), and
their fair value approximates book value.
4) Monetary claims bought
The fair value of monetary claims bought accounted for as securities in “Accounting Standard for Financial Instru- ments” (ASBJ Statement No. 10) is calculated in a similar manner to the method described in 6) “Securities” below.
5) Money held in trust
The fair value of money held in trust is based on the price quoted by the exchange for stocks and the net asset val- ue for mutual funds.
Money held in trust is provided in Note 4 (4) “Money Held in Trust” in accordance with the purpose of the hold- ings.
6) Securities
The fair value of bonds is primarily based on the price published by industry associations such as the reference statistical price published by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, or the price offered by the financial institu- tions, while the fair value of stocks is based on the price quoted by the exchange. The fair value of mutual funds is based on the net asset value.
Securities are described in Note 4 “SECURITIES” in ac- cordance with the purpose of investment.
7) Loans
For policy loans and those included in loans to the Man- agement Organization of Postal Life Insurance Contracts, book values are used as fair values because amounts are limited to the values of the corresponding cash surrender value, and their fair value approximates book value con- sidering their short maturities and interest conditions.
For industrial and commercial loans with floating inter- est rates, for which the future cash flows follow market interest rates, their fair value approximates book value.
For industrial and commercial loans with fixed interest rates or loans to the Management Organization (excluding policy loans), fair value is based on a net discounted pres- ent value of future cash flows.

The Reference Statistical Prices published by the Japan Securities Dealers Association are used as fair value. Payables under securities lending transactions
These are settled within the short term (one year), and their fair value approximates book value.
Derivatives
Notes on the fair value of derivatives are presented in Note 26 “DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.” Interest rate swaps subject to exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps are jointly dis- closed with hedged industrial and commercial loans. Therefore, their fair values are included in the relevant indus- trial and commercial loans.
 The consolidated balance sheet amounts of financial instruments for which the fair values are deemed extremely difficult to deter- mine are as shown below:

  Notes:
1. Based on the concept that the benefits of brand value enjoyed by the Company from maintaining its membership in Japan Post Group are reflected in the Company’s
performance, brand royalty fees are calculated by multiplying the amount of insurance policies in force as of the end of the previous fiscal year, which is a financial indi-
cator whereupon such benefits have been reflected, by a fixed rate.
2. The Company makes payments including commission of insurance solicitation calculated by multiplying the insurance amounts and the insurance premiums of each
contract by the commission rates set for each class of insurance, and the commission of maintenance and collection calculated by multiplying the unit prices set for out-
sourcing services, such as the collection of insurance premiums and payments for insurance money, by the volume of work. 3. Transaction amount does not include consumption taxes. Year-end balance includes consumption taxes.

31. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Total number of shares issued (after the cancellation): 562,600,000 shares
(3) Investigation of Rewritten Insurance Policies and Ini- tiatives for Improvement
The Company promotes thoroughgoing customer-first business operation as one of its critical management pri- orities. However, following the internal investigation into the handling of customers’ revision of their insurance cov- erage, it was discovered that in some cases, such revision was carried out in a manner that may have caused disadvantages to customers, not in line with their intentions. As a result, the Company decided to investi- gate all the Company’s policies (approximately 30 million policies including cancelled policies in the past 5 years for a total of approximately 20 million policyholders).
We will reinstate insurance policies or take other mea- sures in accordance with the intent and circumstances of our customers by specifically investigating whether there were any identifiable types of cases that caused disad- vantages to customers not in line with their intentions, namely, the following: cases in which the previous policy was cancelled but the new policy underwriting was de- clined; cases in which subsequent benefit payments were declined as a result of cancellation of the new policy due to breach of the duty to disclose important matters; cases in which sales personnel could have made more reasonable proposals such as switching riders or de- creasing insurance amounts; cases in which the policy coverage and period did not change after rewriting, but the assumed rate of return decreased; and cases of over- lapping insurance because the previous policy was cancelled after the rewriting period (cancelled during the period seven to nine months after date of writing of the new policy).

JAPAN POST INSURANCE CO., LTD.
NOTES TO THE NON-CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying financial statements of JAPAN POST IN- SURANCE Co., Ltd. (the “Company”), have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Fi- nancial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations concerning preparation of financial statements, Ordinance for Enforcement of Insurance Business Act and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure require- ments of International Financial Reporting Standards.
In preparing these non-consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the non-consolidated financial statements issued domesti- cally in order to present them in a form that is more familiar to readers outside Japan.
All Japanese yen figures in the non-consolidated financial statements have been rounded down to the nearest million yen. Accordingly, the total of each account may not be equal to the combined total of individual items.
The non-consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which the Com- pany is incorporated and mainly operates. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan and have been made at the rate of ¥110.99 to US$1, the approximate rate of exchange as of March 31, 2019. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(1) Securities
Securities including cash and deposits, as well as mone- tary claims bought, which are equivalent to securities, and securities invested in money held in trust, are record- ed based on the following:
1) Held-to-maturity bonds
Held-to-maturity bonds are carried at amortized cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculated us- ing the moving-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
2) Policy-reserve-matching bonds
In accordance with “Temporary Treatment of Account- ing and Auditing Concerning Policy-Reserve-Matching Bonds in the Insurance Industry” (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Au- dit Committee Report No. 21), policy-reserve-matching bonds are carried at amortized cost and the cost of these securities sold is calculated using the mov- ing-average method. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.
3) Equities of subsidiaries and affiliates
Equities of subsidiaries and affiliates are carried at cost, and the cost of these securities sold is calculat- ed using the moving-average method.
4) Available-for-sale securities
A) Available-for-sale securities at fair value
Available-for-sale securities at fair value are carried at their fiscal year-end market price, of which the average market prices during the final month of the fiscal year are used to value stocks. The cost of se- curities sold is calculated using the moving-average method.
B) Available-for-sale securities for which the fair val- ues are deemed extremely difficult to determine Government and corporate bonds (including foreign bonds) without a market price for which the premium or discount represents the interest adjustments are carried at the amortized cost (the straight-line method) using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at cost using the moving-average method.
Net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for- sale securities, net of income taxes, are included in net assets.
(2) Derivative Transactions
All derivative transactions are valued at fair value.
(3) Hedge Accounting
1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Company applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its for- eign-currency-denominated bonds as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Ac- counting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the con- tract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
A) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-denominated bonds
B) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign-currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the ag- gregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of
  Annual Report 2019 135
   Corporate Information Financial Statements

JAPAN POST INSURANCE
hedge effectiveness is omitted in cases of foreign ex- change contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or in- terest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.
(4) Depreciation
1) Tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated us- ing the straight-line method based on the following useful lives:
Buildings : 2-60 years
2) Reserves for other contracts are calculated based on the net level premium method.
They include policy reserves accumulated additionally
in the year ended March 31, 2018, in preparation for future performance of obligations for lump-sum payment annu- ities, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act.
In addition, pursuant to Article 69, Paragraph 5, of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Insurance Business Act, additional policy reserves are accumulated, in preparation for future performance of obligations, over a 10-year peri- od from the year ended March 31, 2011, for a portion of reinsurance contracts from the Management Organization, which is an independent administrative institution. As a re- sult, the amounts of provision for the additional policy reserves for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were ¥179,882 million ($1,621 million) and ¥180,903 million, respectively.
The Management Organization, which was renamed the Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insurance and Post Office Network on April 1, 2019, was established in October 2007 to support the privatization of Japan Post by succeeding from Japan Post postal savings such as fixed amount or term postal savings deposited and Postal Life Insurance Contracts concluded by September 2007 to ensure that such postal savings and Postal Life Insurance are managed appropriately and to fulfill the relevant liabili- ties without fail.
The Company has entered into reinsurance contracts comprising outsourcing agreements for the administrative operation of the Postal Life Insurance and reinsurance contracts for insurance liabilities based on former Postal Life Insurance Contracts, for Postal Life Insurance Con- tracts concluded by September 2007 that have been assumed by the Management Organization.
In addition, based on the master plan by the Postal Ser- vice Privatization Act, with respect to the amount equivalent to that lent to policyholders of the Postal Life In- surance Contracts and to Japanese local governments and others succeeded from Japan Post Corporation, the Company has lent loans to the Management Organization under the same loan conditions as those of the contracts between Japan Post and its counterparties.
(7) Reserve for Employees’ Retirement Benefits
To provide for payment of retirement benefits to employ- ees, a reserve for employees’ retirement benefits is provided based on the projected amount of retirement benefit obligations at the end of the fiscal year.
In calculating the projected benefit obligation, the benefit formula basis is used to attribute the expected benefit to the respective service period.
The actuarial difference is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employees from the fiscal year following the respec- tive fiscal year in which the difference is incurred.
Prior service cost is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 14 years, which is less than the estimated average remaining service period for employ- ees in the fiscal year of incurrence.
Other tangible fixed assets:
2-20 years
2) Intangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets)
The capitalized development costs of software intend- ed for internal use are amortized over the expected useful life of mainly 5 years using the straight-line method.
3) Leased assets
The Company mainly leases vehicles under finance lease arrangements that do not transfer the ownership of leased property to the lessee.
Finance lease transactions that do not transfer own- ership are depreciated to a residual value of zero using the straight-line method over the lease term.
(5) Reserve for Possible Loan Losses
Reserve for possible loan losses is provided pursuant to the Company’s standards for self-assessment of asset quality, and general allowance is provided using a rate based on historical collectability experience. In addition, specific allowances, which are determined based on in- dividual collectability of accounts, are recorded.
All loans and claims are assessed initially by the rele- vant departments based on internal rules for self-assessment of asset quality. The asset evaluation de- partment, which is independent from the relevant departments, reviews these self-assessments. The above reserves and allowances are recorded based on the re- sults of these assessments.
For loans and guaranteed loans that were extended to borrowers that have filed for bankruptcy, including legal bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation, or that are considered substantially bankrupt, an allowance is provided for in the amount of loans, net of collateral value or the amounts expected to be recoverable under guarantees. The re- serve for possible loan losses also includes amounts set aside for other assets subject to valuation allowance. The amounts written off for loans and other assets during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were ¥232 million ($2 million) and ¥65 million, respectively.
(6) Policy Reserves
Policy reserves are reserves provided in accordance with Article 116 of the Insurance Business Act. Insurance pre- mium reserves are recorded based on the following methodology:
1) Reserves for contracts subject to the standard policy reserves are calculated in accordance with the meth- od prescribed by the Commissioner for Financial Services Agency (Ordinance No. 48 issued by the Ministry of Finance in 1996).

Accounting methods for unrecognized actuarial differ- ence and unrecognized prior service cost are different from those of the consolidated financial statements.
(8) Reserve for Management Board Benefit Trust
To provide for the granting of shares and others of the Company to executive officers of the Company in accor- dance with the stock benefit rules, reserve for management board benefit trust is provided in the pro- jected amount of stock benefit obligations.
(9) Reserve for Price Fluctuations
Reserve for price fluctuations in security investments is calculated based on Article 115 of the Insurance Busi- ness Act.
(10) Translation of Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the fiscal year-end.
3. SECURITIES
(1) Securities
(11) Consumption Taxes
All figures are net of consumption taxes.
(12) Additional Information
Transactions for granting shares and others of the Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust
Notes to the transactions for granting shares and oth- ers of the Company to executive officers of the Company through a trust are omitted as they are pre- sented in Note 2 (14) “Additional Information” of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019.
 Equities of subsidiaries and affiliates were included in “Stocks,” and investments in capital of affiliates were included in “Other securities.” All of which are carried at cost because their fair values are deemed extremely difficult to determine.

The Company categorizes its insurance products into the following sub-groups based on the attributes of each product to manage risks arising from fluctuations in the interest rates of assets and liabilities, and adopts a management policy whereby the duration gap between policy-reserve-matching bonds and policy reserves by sub-groups are reconciled within a certain range and the duration gap is periodically checked.
1) Postal Life Insurance Contracts (insurance policies with a remaining period within 30 years)
2) Japan Post Insurance life insurance contracts (general) (all insurance policies)
3) Japan Post Insurance life insurance contracts (lump-sum payment annuity) (excluding some insurance types)
The remaining period of insurance policies comprising the sub-group covering Postal Life Insurance Contracts used to be
within 20 years, but has been changed to within 30 years from the year ended March 31, 2019, as the issuance of 30- and 40-year Japanese government bonds has expanded to facilitate duration gap adjustment of long-term insurance contracts. This change has no effect on profit or loss.

  There were no bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans, past due loans for three months or more or restructured loans as of March 31, 2019 and 2018. Definitions for each of the respective loans are as follows:
Bankrupt loans refer to non-accrual loans, excluding the balances already written off, which meet the conditions prescribed in Article 96, Paragraph 1, Item 3-(a) to (e) and Item 4, of the Order for Enforcement of the Corporation Tax Act (Ordinance No. 97 in 1965). The interest accruals of such loans are suspended because the principal or interest on such loans is unlikely to be collected due to delinquency in payments for them for a considerable period of time or other reasons.
Non-interest accrual loans are those loans for which interest payments have been suspended to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business.
Past due loans for three months or more are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date, excluding those classified as bankrupt loans and non-accrual loans.
Restructured loans are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made to assist and support the borrowers in the restructuring of their business. This category excludes loans classified as bankrupt loans, non-interest accrual loans and past due loans for three months or more.

1) Resolution of the Board of Directors regarding the acquisition of treasury stock
A) Reason of the acquisition of treasury stock
The acquisition of treasury stock was implemented with an aim to improve capital efficiency, enhance shareholder re- turns and mitigate the impact on the supply-demand balance of the Company’s shares due to the sale of shares held by JAPAN POST HOLDINGS Co., Ltd., the parent company of the Company, in the future in light of the offering of shares of common stock of the Company as announced on April 4, 2019 in the “Notice Concerning the Offering of Shares.”
B) Details of matters related to the acquisition
(i) Type of shares acquired: Common stock of the Company
(ii) Total number of shares acquired: 50,000,000 shares (maximum)
(The ratio of the total number of shares acquired to the total number of shares issued (excluding treasury stock): 8.3%)

(iv)Acquisition period: From April 8, 2019 to April 12, 2019
(v) Method of acquisition: Purchases through the Off-auction Own Share Repurchase Trading system (ToSTNeT-3) of
Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc.
(vi)In addition to the matters as described above, any matters required for the acquisition of treasury stock shall be
determined at the sole discretion of the President, CEO, Representative Executive Officer of the Company or a
person appointed by the President, CEO, Representative Executive Officer of the Company.
2) Details of the acquisition of treasury stock
A) Type of shares acquired: Common stock of the Company

(2) Cancellation of Treasury Stock
The Company resolved to cancel its treasury stock in accordance with Article 178 of the Companies Act at the Board of Directors meeting held on May 15, 2019, and the cancellation was implemented on May 31, 2019.
1) Type of shares cancelled: Common stock of the Company
2) Number of shares cancelled: 37,400,000 shares
(6.2% of the total number of shares issued before the cancellation) 3) Cancellation date: May 31, 2019
(Reference)
Total number of shares issued (after the cancellation): 562,600,000 shares
(3) Investigation of Rewritten Insurance Policies and Initiatives for Improvement
The Company promotes thoroughgoing customer-first business operation as one of its critical management priorities. However, following the internal investigation into the handling of customers’ revision of their insurance coverage, it was discovered that in some cases, such revision was carried out in a manner that may have caused disadvantages to customers, not in line with their intentions. As a result, the Company decided to investigate all the Company’s policies (approximately 30 million policies including cancelled policies in the past 5 years for a total of approximately 20 million policyholders).
We will reinstate insurance policies or take other measures in accordance with the intent and circumstances of our customers by specifically investigating whether there were any identifiable types of cases that caused disadvantages to customers not in line with their intentions, namely, the following: cases in which the previous policy was cancelled but the new policy underwriting was declined; cases in which subsequent benefit payments were declined as a result of cancellation of the new policy due to breach of the duty to disclose important matters; cases in which sales personnel could have made more reasonable proposals such as switching riders or decreasing insurance amounts; cases in which the policy coverage and period did not change after rewriting, but the assumed rate of return decreased; and cases of overlapping insurance because the previous policy was cancelled after the rewriting period (cancelled during the period seven to nine months after date of writing of the new policy).
It is difficult to estimate the impact of these measures on the financial results of the Company at this point in time. Such impact may materialize in the future financial periods depending on the progress in the implementation of these measures.

Notes:
1. Bankrupt or quasi-bankrupt loans are loans to borrowers who have fallen into bankruptcy for reasons such as the commencement of bankruptcy
proceedings or reorganization proceedings, or the petition for commencement of rehabilitation proceedings, and loans similar to these.
2. Doubtful loans are loans for which principal and interest are unlikely to be collected or received as stipulated in an agreement due to the
borrower’s deteriorating financial conditions and results even though the borrower has not fallen into bankruptcy.
3. Substandard loans are past due loans for three months or more and restructured loans.
“Past due loans for three months or more” are loans for which principal or interest payments are delinquent for three months or more under the term of the loans from the day following the contractual due date (excluding the loans noted in 1 and 2). “Restructured loans” are loans for which certain concessions favorable to borrowers, such as interest reduction or exemption, postponement of principal or interest payments, debt waiver or other arrangements, have been made for the purpose of assisting and supporting the borrowers in the restructuring of their business (excluding the loans noted in 1 and 2, and past due loans for three months or more).
4. Normal loans are loans which do not fall under the loans noted in 1 to 3 above as there are no particular problems found with the borrower’s financial conditions and results.

(3) Combined Fair Value of Derivative Transactions (with or without Hedge Accounting) 1) Qualitative Information
 (i) Detail of the transactions
The derivative transactions used by the Company are as follows:
– Interest rate-related: Interest rate swaps
– Currency-related: Foreign exchange contracts
and currency option transactions
(ii) Policy for using derivative transactions
The Company uses derivative transactions for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk and foreign exchange fluctuation risk of our investment assets. The Company limits the use of derivative transactions to the purpose of hedging in principle and their use is not meant for speculative purposes.
(iii) Purposes of the use of derivative transactions
The Company conducts derivative transactions relating to currencies to control foreign exchange risks associated with foreign-currency- denominated assets, and derivative transactions relating to interest rates to ensure stable income by fixing the floating interest rates of loans. An overview of the hedge accounting using derivative transactions conducted by the Company is as follows:
(1) Methods for hedge accounting
The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign exchange fluctuation risk for a portion of its foreign-currency-denominated bonds, as well as the exceptional treatment and deferred hedge accounting for interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows on a portion of loans in accordance with the “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 10). The exceptional method is used for interest rate swap contracts that are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria. Under this method, the net amount to be paid or received under the contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the loans for which the swap contract was executed.
(2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
(i) Hedging instrument: Foreign currency
exchange contracts Hedged item: Foreign-currency-
denominated bonds
(ii) Hedging instrument: Interest rate swaps Hedged item: Loans
(3) Hedging policies
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of foreign- currency-denominated bonds within a predetermined range. Interest rate swap contracts are used to hedge fluctuations in interest rates of loans within a certain range.
(4) Assessment of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is assessed by comparing the aggregate changes in quotations or cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted in cases of foreign exchange contracts where there is a high correlation between hedged items and hedging instruments, or interest rate swap contracts that applied the exceptional treatment for interest rate swaps.
(iv) Description of the risks
Derivative transactions used by the Company are exposed to market risk (risks due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates) and credit risk (risks of transaction partners’ default, including bankruptcy).
The Company uses derivative transactions for the purpose, in principle, of hedging the risks of our investment assets, and therefore it believes that the market-related risk of derivative transactions is reduced and limited.
Meanwhile, as we select transaction partners with superior creditworthiness based on their ratings and other factors, the credit risk of derivative transactions is believed to be limited. The Company conducts derivative transactions over the counter.
(v) Risk management framework
The Company has formulated the Basic Risk Management Policy, whereby the investment policies of derivative transactions are provided, limiting the use of derivative transactions to the purpose of hedging and prohibiting their use for speculative purposes.
In addition, we prevent risks by setting credit limits for each transaction partner selected on the basis of superior creditworthiness verified by their ratings and other factors.
The Risk Management Department is in place as an organizational unit responsible for comprehensively managing all types of risks, as part of an effort to reinforce our internal management system.

(vi) Additional notes about quantitative information
– Additional notes about credit risk
We calculate the credit risk amount associated with derivative transactions by using the current exposure method.
– Additional notes about the calculation of fair value
We calculate fair value on the following basis: [Interest rate swaps]
Theoretical values are calculated by discounting the difference in future cash flows to present values based on the published market interest rate.
[Foreign exchange contracts]
Fair value is calculated using the forward foreign exchange rate as of the fiscal year-end date. [Currency options]
Fair value is based on price offered by the financial institutions.
– Additional notes about net unrealized gains (losses)
We use derivative transactions as a means to hedge the market risk of our investment assets in principle, and there are no so-called transactions for trading purposes.
Profit or loss from derivative transactions and the hedged investments is recognized on a combined basis, whereby the effect of a reduction in interest rate risk and foreign exchange fluctuation risk has been verified.

       Spread (Positive/Negative Spread)
A spread is the differential between the assumed return on insurance premium investments and the actual investment return. When the actual investment return is higher than the assumed return on insurance premium investments, there is a “positive spread.” Conversely, a “negative spread” exists when the actual investment return is lower than the assumed return on insurance premium investments. For the year ended March 31, 2019, there was a positive spread of ¥58.4 billion.
The spread (positive/negative spread) is calculated according to the following formula:
Positive spread = [investment return on core profit – average assumed rate of return] × general account policy reserves [¥58.4 billion] [1.79%] [1.70%] [¥63,838.5 billion]
• Investment return on core profit is the return on general account policy reserves after deducting the provision for interest on policyholder dividends from the general account investment revenue included in core profit.
• Average assumed rate of return is the return of assumed interest on general account policy reserves.
• General account policy reserves are calculated as follows for policy reserves in the general account, excluding contingency reserve:
(Policy reserves at beginning of period + policy reserves at end of period − assumed interest) × 1/2
• Policy reserves and assumed interest are calculated based on the actual cumulative amount.

Note: Annualized premiums are calculated by multiplying the amount of a single premium installment payment by a multiplier determined according to the relevant payment method to arrive at a single annualized amount. For lump-sum payments, annualized premiums are calculated by dividing the total premium by the insured period.

(8) Embedded Value (“EV”)
Embedded value (“EV”) is one of the corporate value indicators for life insurance companies.
The profit-loss structure in the life insurance business involves a loss at the time of sale and profit over a policy’s duration. A loss occurs temporarily at the time of sale, caused by a considerable amount of expenses generally incurred with the sale of a policy. Future profit is generated as the policy’s long duration serves to provide revenues over a long
period of time, covering these initial expenses.
Under the current statutory accounting practices in Japan, gains and losses are recognized as they occur in each
 fiscal year. EV, on the other hand, is used to represent the present value of gains and losses that cover the entire duration. EV is the sum of the adjusted net worth (ANW), which reflects gains/losses from business activities in the past, and the value of in-force covered business (VIF), which is the present value of the expected future profits from the in-force covered business.
Since the end of the year ended March 31, 2013, we have been disclosing EV calculated on the basis of the European Embedded Value Principles (“EEV Principles”) as additional information supplementary to the financial data provided under the current statutory accounting practices.

   Notes:
The EEV Principles and Guidance were published in May 2004 by the CFO Forum, a group representing the Chief Financial Officers of major European insurance companies, in order to improve consistency and transparency in EV calculation and reporting.

Notes:
1. For the long-duration risk-free rates at terms longer than the extrapolation entry term, extrapolation to the ultimate forward rate is applied without
changing the ultimate forward rate itself.
2. The 50bp decrease is applied to both positive and negative risk-free rates, without a floor.

4) Main EV Assumptions (i) Economic Assumptions
Based on the assets held by Japan Post Insurance,
the risk-free rates for use in the certainty equivalent
calculation have been determined based on Japanese Term

The table on the right shows, for selected terms, the risk-free rates (converted to spot rates) used for the calculation. For interest rates at longer durations, for which reference rates are not available, we take an extrapolation approach utilizing an ultimate forward rate assumed to converge over a period of time to a fixed ultimate level, commonly set based on
macroeconomic or other methods.
We have assumed an ultimate forward rate of 3.5%,
and as the market of Japanese government bonds beyond 30 years is not considered deep and liquid, we have determined the extrapolation entry term as 30 years. For the forward rate for year 31 and later years, we have applied the Smith-Wilson approach with convergence to the ultimate forward rate over 30 years.

                          All cash flows (premiums, expenses, claims and benefits, cash surrender values, taxes, etc.) are projected applying the best estimate assumptions up to the termination of the policies. Best estimate assumptions are specified by product group, considering recent experience and expected future prospects.
5) Notes on the Use of Results
(i) As the profits arising from the release of the contingency reserve and reserve for price fluctuations related to the Postal Life Insurance policies form a part of the reinsurance dividend paid to the Organization for Postal Savings, Postal Life Insurance and Post Office Network, the EV calculations take into consideration the profits net of this reinsurance dividend. Therefore, the contingency reserve and reserve for price fluctuations related to these policies are included in the VIF, rather than the ANW, as it is assumed that these reserves will be released in the future.
(ii) The calculation of EV is based on many assumptions, including future outlook, which involves certain risks and uncertainties. Since actual performance may differ materially from these assumptions, we strongly recommend that users exercise caution.
(iii) We requested an independent actuarial firm to review the assumptions and the calculation of the Company’s EV results and obtained a written opinion verifying the validity. For further details of this written opinion and the Company’s EV, please refer to the Company’s website (https://www.jp-life.japanpost.jp/english/news/2019/en_news_id000091.html).

1) Principles for Ensuring Appropriateness of Reserving Practice for Policy Reserves in Third-sector Insurance
We carry out the liability adequacy test and stress test as required by laws and regulations in order to ensure a sufficient level of policy reserves.
The scope of the stress test includes the applicable products of Postal Life Insurance.
2) Rationality and Adequacy of Risk Frequency and Others Assumed for the Purpose of the Liability Adequacy Test and Stress Test
For the purpose of assuming the risk frequency, we calculate the occurrence rate that covers the fluctuations of payment of hospitalization benefits and others with certain rates of probability (99% and 97.7%) during the next 10 years, based on the historical actual payment of hospitalization benefits and others.
3) Results of the Liability Adequacy Test and Stress Test
We have verified as a result of the stress test that there is no need for an additional provision of contingency reserve or policy reserves in third-sector insurance, as the expected occurrence rate we assumed beforehand adequately covers the risks expected to materialize in the future.

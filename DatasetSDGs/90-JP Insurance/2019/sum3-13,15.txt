Passing on a sound global environment and resources to the next generationEnvironmentalInitiatives for reducing CO2 emissions
We issue “Eco News,” a quarterly newsletter about energy saving, to encourage all our employees to take energy-saving action.
“Eco News” features articles on various topics, such as encouragement of energy-saving temperature setting for air conditioning, environmentally friendly driving, and reduced consumption of copy paper, and refraining from elevator use when traveling a couple of floors up or down (“2 up 3 down”), to raise employee awareness and promote vigorous action to reduce CO2 emissions.
Donations in line with online provision of Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions
On October 2, 2014, we made our Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions available online. Previously, we had provided our Contract Guidelines
  and Policy Conditions to all customers in a paper booklet format. By selecting “web viewing,” policyholders now have the option of confirming their Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions in PDF format on our website instead of receiving a paper brochure.
The provision of the Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions on the website eliminates the need for conventional brochures, thereby enabling a reduction in the amount of paper used. In July 2018, we donated a total of ¥33.0 million to 33 environmental groups working on forestation based on the number of customers who opted for online Contract Guidelines and Policy Conditions in the 12 months from October 2016 to September 2017.

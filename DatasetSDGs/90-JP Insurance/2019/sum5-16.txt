Outline of the Corporate Governance Structure
To speed up decision-making and enhance the transparency of management, we have adopted a company with three committees structure, under which the Board of Directors’ role of management supervision is separated from the Executive Officers’ role of business execution, thereby clarifying the responsibilities with respect to corporate management.

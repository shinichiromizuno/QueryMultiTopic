          Corporate Philosophy of the Kyorin Group
Kyorin continues to fulfill its mission of cherishing life and benefiting society by contributing to better health.
Corporate Message
Your Health is Kyorin’s Mission
Origin of the Name “Kyorin”
The name Kyorin originated from two Chinese characters that represent a truly virtuous way of practicing medicine. It is derived from Chinese folklore, and embodies the Kyorin Group’s aspirations to continuously contribute to the betterment of people’s health in any day and age.
        Kyorin Legend
Long ago, a Chinese physician named Dong Feng treated the sick free of charge, and asked those who recovered from serious illness to plant five apricot tree saplings and those cured of minor illness to plant one.
As time went by, a thick forest of apricot trees was formed in the area. (A story that comes from a Chinese legend named Shinsen-den) “Kyorin” is a compound of “kyo,” the Chinese word for “apricot,” and “rin,” the Chinese word for “woods.” Praising the virtue of Dong Feng, the characters were transported from China to Japan as those representing medicine and medical treatment in general.
Following our corporate philosophy, the Kyorin Group is working to realize its long-term vision, HOPE100, in 2023 to coincide with the centenary of the Group’s core subsidiary, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
The overall vision comprises the Statement and Five HOPEs.

Achieving the HOPE100 long-term vision by putting the Group on a growth trend through accelerated growth of the new drugs group
Under Stage 1 (fiscal 2010–2015), the first step of the HOPE100 long-term vision, the Kyorin Group achieved a degree of success as we strove to expand the ethical drugs business’s development pipeline and maximize the promotion of major pharmaceutical products, while at the same time building and moving forward with a new pharmaceutical business model based on the statement “To bolster the forward momentum of its businesses by reorganizing them and building a framework for promoting each business.”
Stage 2 (fiscal 2016–2019) was guided by the statement “Promoting sustainable growth through innovative changes (changes and innovations),” and we focused on responding to the patent expiry of the major product Kipres and setting a course for medium- to long-term growth through the new drugs group, thus laying the path for the final stage.
The ethical drugs business is currently facing an increasingly challenging external environment in the face of stepped-up government measures to contain costs for medical treatment and drugs, a higher degree of difficulty in new drug creation, and changes in activities of providing information. At the same time, internally we are creating the new drugs group that we expect to drive growth, and businesses including diagnostics are beginning to produce results, allowing us to view fiscal 2020 as the beginning of a period of growth. Against this backdrop, we are looking beyond previous concepts and ways of doing things and have formulated the new HOPE100–Stage 3– (fiscal 2020–2023) medium-term business plan to pursue “originality (unique competitive strength)” as we shift to a growth trend. In the form of a statement, the plan seeks to “realize a growth trend through the pursuit of originality,” as we move forward by pursuing our business strategy and organizational strategy to achieve the targets we have set.
The Kyorin Group has formulated the HOPE100 long-term vision for 2023, which will mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of our core subsidiary, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The period covered (fiscal 2010–2023) is divided into three stages, and from fiscal 2020, we are embarking on the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, which will mark the completion of the long-term vision. To achieve this long-term vision, we will strive for continuous growth as a company and the medium- to long-term enhancement of corporate value based on this medium-term business plan.

KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. has long pursued basic research in infectious diseases. One infectious disease treatment it researched was a new quinolone agent, which led to the production of the oral antibacterial agent Norfloxacin (Baccidal). This preparation was licensed to Merck & Co. (U.S.A.) in 1980 as the world’s first oral new quinolone synthetic antibacterial agent, and was sold in around 140 countries. This was followed by the development of Fleroxacin (Megalocin) and Gatifloxacin (Gatiflo), and the current sale of Lascufloxacin (Lasvic Tablets). In addition to therapeutic drugs, we have expanded into prevention and diagnosis and the field of infection counter- measures through products such as the multipurpose disinfectant cleaner Rubysta, the disinfectant brand Milton, and the proprietary microchannel-based genetic measurement device GeneSOC®.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT 13
Please tell us about Kyorin’s business results for fiscal 2019.
Revenue and profit declined on lower A domestic sales of new drugs.
Under a basic policy of drastically overhauling the NHI drug pricing system, the government has been promoting the use of generic drugs and implementing other measures to contain the costs of drugs. Because of that and the drug price revisions carried out in October in connection with the consumption tax increase (an industrywide 2.4% average), the Japanese pharmaceutical industry continued to face a difficult market environment during fiscal 2019.
For the Kyorin Group, fiscal 2019 was the final year of the HOPE100–Stage 2– medium-term business plan. With unwavering determination in the pursuit of transformation, under the management policy for the plan’s final year of “mobilizing the Group’s collective strengths to bring about transformation,” we moved forward toward achieving our targets and setting a trajectory for continuous growth. At our core ethical drugs business, we prioritized creating original, globally competitive new drugs, continuous drug discovery, and opening markets with new drugs. We also made a Groupwide effort to accelerate the growth of periph- eral businesses and achieve low-cost operations, as we strove to achieve our targets and gain greater recognition from stakeholders.
In terms of domestic sales of new drugs, sales of our main products Flutiform and Beova grew, and there was also a contribution to sales from the release of Lasvic Tablets, but lower sales of long-listed products including Nasonex, Kipres, and Mucodyne, and a delay in the restart of supplies of Desalex after a temporary stop, resulted in sales declining ¥6.5 billion from those of the previous year. Overseas sales of new drugs rose ¥0.7 billion over those of the previous year, with increased revenue related to Gatifloxacin and upfront payment from the conclusion of a licensing agreement with the South Korean company JEIL Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for Vibegron (Beova). Sales of generic drugs grew ¥1.7 billion over those of the previous year on a contribution from the release of Nasonex AG (authorized generic), and the healthcare business recorded ¥0.6 billion sales growth on increased sales of Rubysta and Milton brand products from increased demand for
disinfectants and cleaning agents associated with the spread of the novel coronavirus.
As a result, consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 declined 3.2% from those of the previous year, to ¥109,983 million.
In terms of profit, despite a decline in the cost of sales ratio, the decline in sales of new drugs resulted in lower gross profit, and with an increase in research and develop- ment expenses, operating income declined 16.4% from that of the previous year, to ¥7,503 million.
Q
Q A
What are your reflections
on the HOPE100–Stage 2– medium-term business plan?
Although we did not achieve the numerical targets, we have set a course for the next stage of growth.
To realize our corporate philosophy that “Kyorin continues to fulfill its mission of cherishing life and benefiting society by contributing to better health,” in 2010, the Kyorin Group formulated the HOPE100 long-term vision with a view toward 2023, the 100th anniversary of the founding of our core subsidiary, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The period through 2023 was divided into three stages (Stage 1: fiscal 2010–2015; Stage 2: fiscal 2016–2019; and Stage 3: fiscal 2020–2023), and medium-term business plans have been formulated for each stage with the aim of evolving into a company that is recognized internally and externally as a healthy “Company that supports sound and healthy lifestyles.”
During Stage 1, which was guided by the statement “To bolster the forward momentum of its businesses by reorga- nizing them and building a framework for promoting each business,” we achieved a degree of success in expanding the development pipeline at the ethical drugs business, maximizing the promotion of major products to the greatest extent possible by deepening our franchise customer strategy, and taking steps to build and promote a new pharmaceutical business model.
Under Stage 2, we aimed to deal with the patent expiry of our main product Kipres and secure a path for medium- to long-term growth under the statement “Promot- ing sustainable growth through innovative changes (changes and innovations) to realize our long-term vision.”
  
 We focused on strengthening our drug discovery capabilities, increasing the ratio of the new drugs group in our product mix, promoting the generic drugs business by making the most of its characteristics, and strengthening our ability to achieve low costs. We strove to strengthen our drug discovery capabilities by creating proprietary new drugs in collaboration with the WATARASE Research Center in Japan and ActivX Biosciences in the United States, and through open innovation with domestic and overseas pharmaceu- tical companies, academic institutions, and venture capital start-ups. We also strove to revitalize existing drug discovery platforms and utilize new technologies (nucleic acids, peptides, gene therapy, etc.). Along with creating a structure for drug discovery, we pursued selection and concentration in drug discovery themes as we worked to develop multi- layered programs in fibrosis research and kinase research. We also expanded our pipeline through the in-licensed interstitial lung disease treatment KRP-R120 (ATYR1923) from aTyr Pharma, Inc. of the United States. With the aim of increasing the ratio of the new drugs group to more than 50%, we released three new products—Desalex, Beova, and Lasvic Tablets. In terms of promoting the generic drugs business by making the most of its characteristics, we commenced operations at the Takaoka Pharmaceutical Technology Innovation Center in July 2017, and are using this facility to strengthen our drug development capabilities and increase the number of attractive products developed in-house. In September 2016, we released Kipres AG as the Group’s first authorized generic product. Our successes in this area also include the subsequent release of Nasonex AG, and we obtained approval to manufacture and sell Uritos AG. To strengthen our ability to achieve low costs, we consolidated the Group’s manufacturing functions at the new manufacturing subsidiary, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd., which commenced operations on April 1, 2018. This has led to steady progress in cost reductions by equalizing plant capacity utilization and using assets more efficiently. We continue to aim to create a competitive Group manufacturing structure that provides a stable supply of high-quality products at low cost. Under our development strategies, we are strengthening our businesses related to environmental hygiene and are entering the new business of diagnostics, where we are developing extracorporeal diagnostic agents targeting pathogenic bacteria and viruses for infectious diseases, and released the GeneSoC® device for use in research.
With regard to numerical targets, with dramatic changes in the external environment and special factors including the temporary suspension of supplies of Desalex and delays in the market launch of Lasvic Tablets, we were unable to achieve our targets of average annual growth of at least 3% in consolidated net sales and a consolidated operating income margin of at least 15%. Nevertheless, we have assembled a lineup of new drugs that we expect to become major products and view fiscal 2020, the first year under the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, as the beginning of a period of business growth. We have therefore set even higher numerical targets that we will strive to achieve.
Please give us an overview Q of the HOPE100–Stage 3–
(fiscal 2020–2023) medium-term business plan, and tell us what you hope to achieve.
We will pursue originality to achieve a A growth trend despite the increasingly
challenging external environment.
We have begun operating under the HOPE 100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, but with measures to contain costs for drugs being tightened further, a growing degree of difficulty in new drug discovery, and changes in activities of providing information, we expect the current external environment to become increasingly challenging. At the same time, as I previously mentioned, internally we have a lineup of new drugs to drive growth, including Flutiform, Desalex, Beova, and Lasvic, and with our diagnostics business beginning to bud as well, I believe we have entered a period of business growth. Against this backdrop, during this stage we will pursue originality (using our unique competitiveness) without being bound by conventional methods and ways of thinking, to achieve a growth trend under the statement “Realization of a growth trend through the pursuit of originality.” With the aim of being a company that is globally recognized for its innovative new drug discovery, we will expand the new drugs business, the generics business, and the infection-related business (prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infections) in an integrated manner to become a company that widely sup- ports people’s health, focusing on the following Business Strategy and Organization Strategy.
Business Strategy
Shift to business based on the proposal of solutions and accelerate the growth of the new drugs group
We will transform into a provider of solutions that integrate the ethical drugs business and the infection-related business to solve problems and create a marketing structure that
cuts across the Group, to make a uniquely Kyorin Group contribution to healthcare workers. In the area of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases, for example, I hope to provide doctors, pharmacists, nurses, infection control teams (ICTs), and antimicrobial stewardship teams (ASTs) with comprehensive solutions in the field of infectious disease based on products including the preventive Milton and Rubysta, the GeneSoC® diagnostic device, and Lasvic for disease treatment.
We will strive to accelerate the growth of the new drugs group by placing a maximum focus on products including Flutiform, Desalex, Beova, and Lasvic so that they are prescribed as much as possible.
Enhance pipeline to support medium-term growth
The Kyorin Group to date has focused on franchise cus- tomers (FC) for in-licensing in three areas (respiratory, otolaryngology, and urology), but we will also address the fields of infectious disease and rare and intractable diseases, proactively investing to expand our pipeline to contribute to business results over the medium term.

Strengthen drug discovery capability to realize the creation of innovative new drugs
To create innovative new drugs, we will continue to pursue the challenges of adding layers of research in our priority research domains of fibrosis research and kinase research, and add new fields of research and technology. We will also promote research emphasizing the clarification of the healthcare value of new drug candidates and realize early global out-licensing based on a general rule of achieving proof of concept (POC) ourselves, while also actively acquiring drug discovery seeds as we work to strengthen our drug discovery capabilities.
Improve cost competitiveness
We will increase the cost competitiveness of the generic drugs business by improving the efficiency of the business’s sales structure, while also strengthening the ability of the Takaoka Pharmaceutical Technology Innovation Center to create new generic drug candidates. In addition, by optimizing our manufacturing structure and improving operational efficiency, we aim to achieve stable supplies and enhance our cost competitiveness, and create a structure to facilitate expanded subcontracted manufacturing.
Expand overseas revenue
We aim to expand our overseas revenue by promoting global out-licensing through enhanced drug discovery capabilities. We will also steadily move forward in our think- ing to directly enter the Asian market.
Organization Strategy
Aim to be the leading company for career fulfillment
Under our long-term vision, the Kyorin Group values its employees, executing a business strategy that energizes people and organizations and achieving concrete results as our most important issues. We are working to train and attract human resources to support our development as a next-generation company, following the basic policy of our human resources management system with the aim of being the leading company for career fulfillment.
Performance Targets
I believe that the achievement of continuous growth requires that we set targets in terms of both growth and profitability. For growth, we have set a target of an average compound annual growth rate of at least 5% in consoli- dated net sales, and for profitability, we are targeting consolidated operating income before the deduction of R&D expenses (operating income + R&D expenses) of at least 20% of net sales.
Our fundamental capital policy is to maintain a sound financial base while improving capital efficiency through investments for growth and returns to shareholders. With regard to returns to shareholders, we will maintain a stable dividend while taking the dividend on equity (DOE) ratio into account.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT 17
With the new drugs group assembled, I believe fiscal 2020 will be the “make-or-break” year for escaping from our downward trend. For the main points of our business strategy, we will shift to a business based on proposing solutions and accelerate the growth of the new drugs group, enhance our pipeline, expand drug discovery projects, and improve our cost competitiveness. Group employees will take up repeated challenges in the pursuit of originality as we work to ensure that the transformation to a growth trend is solid.
Q A
Would you please provide a message to stakeholders.
As we approach our 100th anniversary, we want to look ahead to the next 100 years and increase corporate value by developing uniquely Kyorin businesses.
 Regarding a current topic,

Jointly developed with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and based on superfast quantitative PCR technology, we released the GeneSoC® microchannel-based genetic measurement device as a research instrument in November 2019. Designed for practi- cality as an instrument for the rapid detection of infectious diseases that can be used for point-of-care testing (POCT, testing performed by medical practitioners at the bedside of patients), the device has received a great deal of attention for the speed at which it can detect the novel coronavirus. Development is also currently under way for its use as a medical device, and it is making a unique contribution in the field of diagnosing infectious diseases including the
The Kyorin Group’s corporate message—“Your Health is Kyorin’s Mission”—expresses our strong desire to contribute to people’s health, an ideal that has been carried on continuously throughout our almost 100-year history. Since our founding, our business has been based on the precept of contributing to people’s health, an idea consistent with the concepts underlying the international targets for a sustainable world set forth in the Sustainable Development Goals, which have recently been receiving a great deal of attention. To date, the Group has pursued research in infectious disease, immunity, and inflammation, while at the same time developing highly specialized businesses that seek to establish a presence in specific fields, focusing on respiratory, otolaryngology, and urology. Going forward, we will develop businesses in areas where we are able to deploy our strengths, as we strive to enhance our corporate value by continuously pursuing the challenge of evolving into “a company that supports sound and healthy lifestyles” and supports people’s health.

   Drug Discovery
With the medical needs for people’s health today becoming increasingly diverse and complex, the degree of difficulty in creating innovative new drugs is higher than ever. In this environment, although the scientific and technological development efforts of drug manufacturers are resulting in many new drugs, numerous unmet medical needs still exist. Through our corporate activities, the Kyorin Group is using innovation to develop and provide safe products and services that benefit society, enabling the Company to continue to grow and contribute to resolving social issues. Under the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, we are focusing on strengthening our drug discovery capabilities to the greatest extent possible, aiming to become a company that is globally recognized as a company of innovative new drugs.
Pursuing open innovation
To supplement and build on KYORIN Pharmaceutical’s proprietary drug discovery, we are proactively investigating external early-exploratory-stage drug discovery themes and candidate compounds, and using our evaluation technology platforms in areas including auditory function, bladder function, and infectious diseases to create a structure that can carry out speedy evaluations. This includes open innovation with academic institutions, venture capital start-ups, and domestic and overseas pharmaceutical companies, enabling us to approach drug discovery targets from various perspectives. We established the Department of Drug Discovery for Lung Diseases as a joint research program at the Graduate School of Medicine Kyoto University in fiscal 2017, integrating the academic institution’s pathological research and

basic research capabilities with KYORIN Pharmaceutical’s drug discovery capabilities to search for new targets for drug discovery. KYORIN Pharmaceutical also concluded a strategic partnership with the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for drug discovery in the respiratory field in fiscal 2018, and began joint research with the Microbial Chemistry Research Foundation’s Institute of Microbial Chemistry to search for antibacterial drugs effective against multidrug resistant bacteria in fiscal 2018.
We are also acquiring early-stage drug discovery seeds from outside the Group to build new platforms for drug discovery, which will increase and expand our drug discovery seeds, diversify disease areas and modalities, and disperse risks.
  New Drugs Business
 Strengths Opportunities Risks
• Working with the WATARASE Research Center and its disease model analytical technologies and low molecular weight drug discovery technologies, and ActivX Biosciences (ActivX) in the United States, which has broad and quantitative kinase analysis technologies, we are able to identify targets and create novel compounds. (Unique drug discovery capabilities)
• We are working with academic institutions and venture capital start-ups in research areas including fibrosis, infectious diseases, and inflammation. (Competitiveness through alliances)
• Using the low molecular weight drug discovery technologies we have developed over the years, we are not only acquiring multiple pharmacophores for newly identified discovery targets and pursuing optimal research with different basic structures, we are also pursuing simultaneous development with new modalities (nucleic acids, etc.), thereby diversifying the seeds to increase our likelihood of success.
• Increased use of artificial intelligence in drug discovery could make low molecular weight drug discovery more efficient (through major cost reductions and shorter devel- opment periods), which could weaken our advantageous position in drug discovery.
    KYORIN Pharmaceutical will take the following three approaches in its drug discovery activities:
• Search for novel targets
We are strengthening our early-explo- ration-stage research to search quickly for novel drug discovery targets and create innovative new drugs effective against those targets. To strengthen our early-stage drug discovery research both quantitatively and qualitatively, we are using human (patients), disease model animal tissue or cells, and applying technologies including KiNativ and genome editing to enhance the quality of our target identification and validation. We are also stepping up our fibrosis research as a priority research area. Working with academic institu- tions with strengths in basic research, we are making maximum use of cutting-edge technologies like human
disease-specific iPS cells for an enhanced level of drug discovery evaluation to select candidate compounds.
• Expand modalities
In addition to our existing low molecular weight drug discovery, we are using new technologies to explore compounds including medium molecular weight compounds and nucleic acid medicines, and building on our work on fusion protein formulations begun in fiscal 2019 to pursue possibilities in new modalities and create new drugs with global potential that help address medical needs that cannot be met with low molecular weight drugs.
• Restructure drug discovery research centers All research centers, covering early- exploration-stage research to research and development, have been consoli- dated at the WATARASE Research Center, which is carrying out drug discovery research with a structure that is effective and cooperative in the areas of pharmacology, chemistry, safety, and pharmacokinetics, as well as formulation and analysis. Experts
in all these fields work in teams that cross organizational divisions to conduct research and complete development with greater quality and speed for drug discovery research that is consistent with global standards.

      Marketing
Japan’s pharmaceutical industry is undergoing structural market changes, caused by moves to curtail drug costs through promotion of the use of generics, a review of the price maintenance premium system, and price revisions for long-listed drugs. The Kyorin Group formulated the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan in the face of this challenging market environment. Fiscal 2020, the first year under the plan, is being positioned as the beginning of a period of growth, and we will work to accelerate promotion of the new drugs group as much as possible. As a new marketing style, in fields related to infectious disease, we will move beyond medical treatment alone and develop activities that provide total solutions including prevention and diagnosis. In addition, to keep up with the needs of the times, we will provide information by proactively adding digital formats and artificial intelligence to our core format of face-to-face interaction.
Achieving a growth trend in the new drugs group
  New Drugs Business
We believe the new drugs group, which includes Flutiform, the combination drug for asthma treatment, Desalex, the treatment of allergic diseases, Beova, the treatment of overactive bladder, and Lasvic, an oral quinolone antibacterial agent, will be the growth drivers for Stage 3, which starts with fiscal 2020.
Fiscal 2019 sales of Flutiform grew to ¥14.6 billion. After a temporary stop of supplies, sales of Desalex resumed in November 2019 and totaled ¥2.6 billion. With the limit on the prescription period for Beova lifted in December 2019, sales
totaled ¥4.3 billion, with the pace of prescriptions surpassing our initial estimate. Sales of Lasvic Tablets, which commenced in January 2020, have been solid, totaling ¥1.1 billion.
We are forecasting a sales increase of more than ¥10 billion for these four products in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019. We will place a maximum focus on these products as Stage 3 growth drivers, aiming for the new drugs group to account for more than 50% of our net sales target in the plan’s final year.
 Establishing a presence in the franchise customer fields
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. aims to establish a presence in designated fields focusing on respiratory, otolaryngology, and urology (a franchise customer strategy). We are placing impor- tance on relationships of trust with medical practitioners and carrying out activities to provide, gather, and transmit information regarding the proper use of pharmaceutical products.
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has also introduced a
marketing team structure whereby multiple medical represen- tatives are responsible for a designated area. With this structure, entire teams cultivate an area, for swift and systematic responses to increasingly diverse medical needs. Going forward, we will build on this initiative to foster a culture in which teams help each other achieve their targets.
 Strengths Opportunities Risks
• Strong presence in designated fields (respira- tory, otolaryngology, and urology) (franchise customer (FC) strategy)
• Product portfolio in FC fields for continuous growth
• Tailored responses to medical institutions through area management and team structure
• An infection-related business with products that contribute to prevention (Milton, Rubysta), diagnosis (GeneSoC ®), and treatment (Lasvic) (solution-based approach)
• With Flutiform, Desalex, Beova, and Lasvic, a lineup for the new drugs group is in place to drive growth, presenting a significant opportunity for sales growth
• With the GeneSoC® microchannel-based genetic measuring device, which enables quick, accurate, and simple identifica- tion of pathogenic microorganisms, and the development of diagnostic agents, the capability to provide solutions in addition to prevention and treatment in the infection-related business
• Along with progress in control of medical representative visits and systems for them by appointment only, methods for providing informa- tion to physicians are shifting from traditional face-to-face interaction to internet-based methods
• With the drastic overhaul of the drug pricing system, sales of long-listed products will decline. Ability to respond to structural changes being sought in the domestic market for ethical drugs
    Providing information using digital channels and artificial intelligence
With the Guidelines for Prescription Drug Marketing Information Provision having taken effect from April 2019 and the spread of novel coronavirus infections, traditional methods of providing information are changing drastically, and transformations are being sought in the content of information and the ways it is provided. In response to this major shift, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is looking beyond its traditional focus on face-to-face interaction with physicians and providing information using digital channels in various ways. In our proactive use of digital
channels as media for providing, gathering, and transmitting information, in addition to advances in the media we possess in-house, we are optimizing the providing of information via third-party platforms. We are also aggregating our marketing data to enhance the quality of the information we provide
to physicians.
In addition, we are working to enhance the marketing skills
(the ability to grasp needs) of medical representatives, using artificial intelligence to logically analyze their sales presentations.

To overcome the effect of the patent expiry of our main product Kipres and respond to changes in the market environment, during fiscal 2019, the final year under Stage 2, we worked to strengthen the new drugs business with a target of the business accounting for at least 50% of net sales. As a result of a temporary stop of supplies of Desalex and delays in the market launch of Lasvic® Tablets, the percentage of the new drugs group’s sales fell short of this target, at 34.9%. Nevertheless, we were able to bring new products including Desalex, Beova, and Lasvic to market during Stage 2 and have new drugs in place to drive growth as we head into Stage 3.

  The Kyorin Group’s Initiatives to Combat Infectious Disease
Under the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, the Kyorin Group aims to build an infection-related business model around prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We will build a marketing structure that cuts across the Group and address the international issue of antimicrobial resistance by proactively promoting the appropriate use of treatments through a uniquely Kyorin approach that contributes to medical practitioners.
Drug-resistant bacteria that threaten people’s lives around the world
Treatment
 Striving to play a part with a sense of mission in treating infectious disease
KYORIN Pharmaceutical, the company that created Baccidal, is a pioneer in new quinolone agents. With a sense of pride and responsibility, we believe that with Lasvic, we have a mission to promote the appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs. We want to treat infectious diseases in this age of antimicrobial resistance and put smiles on patients with Lasvic, the embodiment of our mission.

The improper use of antibacterial drugs is leading to a global increase in drug-resistant bacteria, while at the same time the development of new antibacterial drugs is declining, creating a major problem for international society. Estimates are that if this situation continues, the annual global number of deaths from infectious disease
caused by drug-resistant bacteria could grow to roughly 10 million people by 2050, from roughly 700,000 in 2013. Measures to counter antimicrobial resistance are therefore being
pursued globally.

Lasvic Tablets
contributing to the treatment
of respiratory and otolaryngological infectious disease
The oral antibacterial drug Lasvic Tablets was developed as a quinolone antibacterial agent that has sufficient antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria targeted in treatment while suppressing full-body exposure, and is also unlikely to develop resistant bacteria. Going forward, the Kyorin Group will strive to educate and promote the appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs by sharing information with physicians, pharmacists, clinical technicians, other members of infection control teams (ICTs), and antimicrobial stewardship teams (ASTs), while also cooperating with surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria based on antimicrobial resistance action plans and academic surveillance programs, and through cooperation with and support of infectious disease-related academic conferences.

GeneSoC®
enables quick, accurate, and simple
identification of pathogenic microorganisms, prevents the spread of infectious disease, and achieves appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs
Proactive screening for pathogenic microorganisms is needed to address problems like the novel coronavirus pandemic and antimicrobial resistance. We also believe it is important to establish an in-house system that can effectively prescribe and discontinue medicines, including accurate decision making of the necessity of antimicrobial drug use based on examination results.
The microchannel-based genetic measurement device GeneSoC® is a real-time PCR system that enables quick, accurate, and simple identification of pathogenic microorganisms. SARS-CoV-2 GeneSoC ER Kyorin is currently being sold as a novel coronavirus detection reagent used with GeneSoC®. Going forward, we will develop reagents for research and the “GeneSoC® mini” dedicated automated prepro- cessing device, and work to commercialize the system for use in extracorporeal diagnosis at an early date, to contribute to the appropriate selection of medications through point-of-care testing (POCT), while also working on further improvements to enable use in hygiene management including the food field and other fields.
Prevention
  Diagnosis
  Rubysta and Milton
contributing to controlling infections in medical institutions
Many types of microbes are present in medical institution environments, and in recent years we have learned that microbes are transmitted through environments. Because much of this transmission takes place via fingers, it is important to keep environment surfaces clean and to disinfect fingers.
Kyorin is contributing to the control of infections with its lineup of the multipurpose disinfectant cleaner Rubysta and the disinfec- tant Milton, as infection countermeasures in medical institutions.
   Contributing to the
prevention of infectious disease in medical institutions by providing appropriate information
We believe that we can contribute to the prevention of infectious disease with Rubysta, for hygiene management in medical treatment environments, and the Milton brand, as an appropriate method for immersion disinfection of tools and equipment.
We will continue to provide information to medical practitioners to contribute to the prevention of infectious disease at medical institutions.

The diagnostics business is one of the core businesses in the Kyorin Group’s new infection-related business, and at the In Vitro Diagnostics Business Division, we are working as one to build a foundation for that business. Going forward, we will further improve the system and develop specialized reagents with the aim of making GeneSoC® a widely used tool for diagnosis and detection.

 Manufacturing
Drug price revisions implemented under the government’s basic policy of comprehensively reforming the NHI’s drug pricing system have had a major effect on the Kyorin Group’s manufacturing structure. With sales of long-listed drugs declining and the market for generics growing, the domestic pharmaceutical market is undergoing drastic structural changes that we expect to impede profitability. The Group has therefore consolidated its three internal manufacturing functions for overall optimization, creating a manufacturing structure that will be able to pursue low-cost operations with a greater sense of speed. Under the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan, we will build on initiatives implemented to date, creating a competitive Group manufacturing structure that will provide a stable supply of low-cost, high-quality products and also be able to increase subcontracted manufacturing for non-Group customers.
Supply chain management
With the aim of establishing solid earnings strength in the face of environmental changes, the Kyorin Group is working to build a structure for more efficient manufacturing that offers stable supplies, with flexibility to address changes in demand, by comprehensively addressing the Group’s entire supply chain. We are pursuing supply chain management that manages (makes visible) the entire process—from domestic and overseas
procurement of raw materials to manufacturing (production management and drug manufacturing), warehousing, and supply (shipping)—on an individual product basis. By quickly addressing issues like reducing lead times from orders to delivery as they arise, we are working to ensure stable supplies and reduce risks, for reliable, stable supplies of products.
  Subcontracted Drug Manufacturing Business
Features of KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities’ Plants
Low-cost, high-volume manufacturing through automation
The Noshiro Plant uses automated transport of pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediate products, as well as robotic arms for labor savings. Automation makes it possible to manufacture large volumes at a low cost with high productivity. In addition to new drugs, the facility is currently using these strengths to manufacture generic drugs in large volumes, focusing on tablets and capsules. The plant’s advanced manufacturing activities have also been approved in GMP inspections carried out by overseas regulatory authorities and global companies headquartered overseas.
Focusing on subcontracted manufacturing incorporating global GMP
For many years the Shiga Plant was a manufacturing base for a non-Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer, and in addition to manufacturing the Group’s main products, the plant is unique for its high portion of manufacturing subcontracted from outside the Group, including for pharmaceutical products to be sold in Japan by overseas manufacturers. The plant is able to keep pace with the needs of the times, using the latest equipment for manufacturing that incorporates global GMP, with an awareness of issues including the prevention of cross contamination. Using its abundant experience and expertise gained from subcontracted manufacturing for global companies headquartered overseas, the facility is bolstering its manufacturing equipment and working aggressively to increase its manu- facturing subcontracted from outside the Group.
Manufacturing numerous types of products with focus on generic drugs
With a focus on generic drugs, the Inami Plant manufactures products in a variety of forms, including solid formulations taken internally, sterilized formulations for injections, eyedrops, and nose drops. Taking advantage of flexibility that enables it to manufacture many types of products, the facility handles various products that newly appear on the drug price list twice a year, manufacturing more than 200 products including those subcontracted from outside the Group. Through frequent visits from drug manufacturers ordering subcontracting, the facility has gained a wealth of expertise in providing a stable supply of high-quality products. In addition to investing in equipment for new pharmaceutical production, the facility is proactively pursuing improvement activities to raise productivity and working to reduce costs.
(Noshiro, Akita)
   Strengths Opportunities Risks
• Ability to meet diverse needs with mass- production technologies through labor saving and automation, the implementation of good manufacturing practices (GMPs) that meet global standards, and the flexibility to produce many types of products
• Manufacturing capabilities for sterilized formulations for injections, eyedrops, and nose drops
• Growing need for subcontracted manufacturing for non-Japanese companies entering the Japanese market
• Ability to address demand of growing use of generic drug products

Business strategyEnhance cost competitiveness
Establishing a manufacturing structure to achieve stable supply and low cost while also enabling expansion of subcontracted manufacturing
       Review of previous medium-term business plan
Created a new manufacturing structure through overall optimization
Under Stage 2, we consolidated the Group’s manufacturing functions being carried out by three plants into a new manufacturing subsidiary, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd., under a priority strategy of enhancing cost reductions. This subsidiary commenced operations in April 2018, using the three plants’ respective specializations: low-cost, high-volume manufacturing of new drugs; manufacturing numerous types of generic drugs; and subcontracted drug manufacturing at global standards. In addition, we implemented an overall optimization of the manufacturing structure to make effective and efficient use of each plant’s equipment, technologies, and human resources. We also carried out proactive, systematic capital investment to achieve labor savings and greater efficiency and to increase our ability to respond to customers’ needs.
Striving for greater cost competitiveness
Under the new medium-term business plan, businesses involved in pharmaceutical manufacturing will share human resources and information across plants, while also creating and operating a human resources management system to cultivate and implement technologies and a mindset for improvement. They will also work to pursue a higher level of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), increase manufacturing capabilities (both capacity and efficiency), including the construction of a new
manufacturing center, and create a stable supply structure that uses outside parties. Through these initiatives, we will establish a stable manufacturing structure that is highly competitive and able to provide a stable supply of quality products at a low cost. We will then focus on increasing subcontracted manu- facturing for non-Group customers and establishing a solid manufacturing base.

 Generics
The Kyorin Group’s generic drugs business is primarily carried out by KYORIN Rimedio Co., Ltd. Even in the era when generic drugs account for 80% of drugs used, we are addressing changes in our operating environment by using the combined advantages of our development, manufacturing, and sales functions, while also proactively working to handle authorized generics as a manufacturer of new and generic drugs, and making our marketing structure more efficient to enhance cost competitiveness.
Strengthen ability to create new generics
To provide generic drug products that can be used safely, KYORIN Rimedio has been carrying out pharmaceutical manufacturing and packaging from the perspectives of medical practitioners and patients, ensuring that products are easy to use in medical institutions and meet the needs of patients taking drugs. The Takaoka Pharmaceutical Technology Innovation Center, which commenced operations in July 2017, is further working to increase the products it develops to improve the quality and speed of pharmaceutical development, with the aim of making KYORIN Rimedio a generic drug company that provides attractive, distinctive generic drug products. As of June 2020, the company had launched eight new ingredients and 15 new products.
Make generics’ marketing structure more efficient to enhance the business’s cost competitiveness
KYORIN Rimedio has been strengthening its sales through a balanced approach using multiple sales channels, and going forward, it will build on that strength while also working to make its generics’ marketing structure more efficient, enhancing its sales capabilities and cost competitiveness through selection and concentration.

Strengthen overseas business
To date, KYORIN Rimedio has been exporting finished products, primarily eyedrops, to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Going forward, in line with economic development and rising incomes across Asia, we anticipate a trend of requests for a higher level of medical care leading to increased demand for Japanese high-quality drugs. KYORIN Rimedio is working to address this demand as quickly as possible by strengthening its businesses of providing technologies and products to countries including Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mongolia.
Over-the-counter drugs
We are addressing diversifying health needs by offering over-the-counter drugs that can be used safely.
Over-the-counter drugs addressing diversifying health needs
With the Japanese government’s introduction of a “self-medication tax system” (special tax deductions for medical expenses) in January 2017, people have become more aware of their health. The Kyorin Group sells the COOL ONE series of over-the-counter drugs that apply active ingredients used in ethical drugs. This series is highly regarded because we are able to provide accurate information regarding the products’ effectiveness and safety gained at the ethical drugs business. We will continue to work to provide products that address diversifying health needs.
* COOL ONE Cough Medicine GX tablets and syrup and COOL ONE expectorant capsules are applicable under the self-medication tax system.
       Initiatives under new medium-term business plan
Address authorized generics
The Kyorin Group has achieved a certain degree of recognition for its steady market penetration using its ability to handle, within the Group, both original drugs and authorized generics that meet the diverse needs of medical practitioners and patients. We released Montelukast Tablets “KM,” our authorized generic version of Kipres, in September 2016, followed by Mometasone Nasal 50μg “KYORIN,” our authorized generic
version of Nasonex, in August 2019, and currently both have gained more than a 50% share of their respective generic markets. We also received approval for the manufacture and sales of Imidafenacin Tablets “KYORIN,” OD tablets 0.1 mg, our authorized generic version of Uritos, in August 2019, and began sales in June 2020.

 Corporate Governance
The Kyorin Group will work to improve sustainable corporate value in order to gain the confidence and live up to the expectations of all stakeholders. As part of these efforts, the Group considers strengthening and enhancing corporate governance an important management issue.
To oversee business execution, we established a Management Committee, comprising the president and directors, which discusses and decides key operational matters concerning the Group.
In addition to the representative directors and the executive directors, who are engaged in ordinary business execution, we actively delegate authority to the corporate officers responsible for specific areas appointed as necessary, thus establishing a framework that allows prompt decision making and clarification of responsibility of business execution under the guidance and supervision of the Board of Directors. As of June 19, 2020, the Company had three corporate officers.
Corporate Governance System
Regarding remuneration and nomination of directors and corporate auditors, Kyorin has established the voluntary Com- mittee on Remuneration and Nominations, mainly comprising independent outside directors, to seek appropriate advice in order to enhance the transparency of decision making.
  Business execution system
Committee on Remuneration and Nominations
 Basic policy on corporate governance
The most important management goal for KYORIN Holdings, Inc. is to continue raising shareholder value. To achieve this goal requires fostering a management environment that enables us to build trust with the general public. Therefore, having given better corporate governance a high priority, we seek to ensure prompt decision making, strong monitoring of the appropriate- ness of management, and to secure ethical and transparent corporate activities. To ensure transparency and fair disclosure, we release appropriate information without delay for the benefit of shareholders and investors. In the future, we intend to actively increase our disclosure of information, and expand and improve our communications with all stakeholders.
KYORIN Holdings, Inc. has appointed three outside directors to further strengthen the supervision of the business execution of directors, and to further enhance the transparency and fairness of management.
Kyorin is a company with a board of corporate auditors based on the Companies Act of Japan. The Board of Corporate Auditors, including the three outside corporate auditors, endeavors to fully demonstrate its auditing and supervising functions and to ensure the transparency of the decisions being made by the Board of Directors. At the same time, corporate auditors carry out a diverse range of activities in fulfilling their auditing function. In addition to participating in important meetings, including those of the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, corporate auditors implement comprehensive audits by checking documents and other materials relating to important decisions and by inspecting Group companies.
Corporate governance system
The Company’s Board of Directors comprises eleven directors, including three outside directors. The Board of Directors usually meets once a month, resolving legal matters, formulating and deciding important management policies and strategies, and overseeing business execution, etc.
In addition, in recognition of our corporate social responsibility (CSR), for every Kyorin Group company we appoint compliance and risk management promotion officers. We have established a Groupwide compliance and risk management system that is administered by the Compliance Committee and Risk Manage- ment Committee. We have established guidelines for each affiliated company based on the Kyorin Compliance Guidelines and set up a system for employees to report and seek advice about possible irregularities. As well as the above measures, we have created management guidelines for affiliated companies and built a system of governance while securing their autonomy. Under this system, we receive regular business reports from these companies and hold meetings with their management before deciding important issues. The Internal Audit Office conducts audits of affiliated companies based on internal audit guidelines. Following the results of these audits, departments that oversee the operations of the affiliated companies issue instructions or warnings and provide appropriate guidance.

Internal audits are conducted by the Internal Audit Office, which is staffed by six employees who report directly to the president, and is independent from other sections. Following yearly auditing plans, the Internal Audit Office regularly assesses and evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the legal compliance and internal control systems in the parent and Group companies. After an audit, the office communicates any problems or areas that need improvement directly to the president and makes appropriate recommendations.
Another function of the office is to evaluate the Group’s internal controls over financial reporting. The office evaluates the devel- opment and operation of these internal controls according to a predetermined scope for evaluation, and makes a report to the president.
Corporate auditors conduct audits in line with an auditing policy and plan set by the Board of Corporate Auditors at
the beginning of each fiscal year. In addition to participating in important meetings, including those of the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, corporate auditors implement comprehensive audits by checking documents and other
materials relating to important decisions and by inspecting Group companies.
In order to ensure that audits are conducted effectively by corporate auditors, corporate auditors receive explanations on the content of accounting audits from the accounting auditing firm of the Company and exchange information with the firm. Corporate auditors also cooperate with the Internal Audit Office to have appropriate communication and to effectively perform the audits.
Under our adopted system, if executives or regular employees discover that an executive officer or employee is acting in contravention of either laws and regulations, or the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, they immediately notify the corporate auditors. We are working to establish an environment conducive to more efficient audits by corporate auditors by coordinating closely with executives and regular employees and by fostering deeper understanding of audits. We assign one auditing staff member to assist the duties of the corporate auditors, and such assignment is carefully checked by directors and corporate auditors to ensure independence.

 A Message from an Outside Director
 I am very honored to have the opportunity to be involved as an outside director in the management of KYORIN Holdings, Inc., as it strives to develop and expand the healthcare business in a diversified manner. I hope to use my experience as a doctor with a clinical, research, and teaching background.
Hiromi Watanabe
Outside Director
Last year the Group formulated a new medium-term business plan, HOPE100–Stage 3–. During the formulation of the plan, I was able to give advice from the perspective of both an occasional patient and a practicing doctor, using my experience in clinical and research fields and the varied insights I have accumulated from working in medical educational posts. In order to achieve the goals of the plan, it is essential that all of us apply our abilities to the fullest. From the standpoint of promoting the increased participation of women in the workplace, one goal for greater diversity, I will be utilizing my own experience to actively contribute even more proposals.
In light of the COVID-19 global pandemic occurring in the midst of advances the Group is making in infectious disease-related areas (prevention, diagnosis, and treatment), my hope is that the Kyorin Group will fulfill its “corporate social responsibility (CSR)” as a company focused on ethical drugs and also make a major contribution to society through sustainable development.
I ask for the continued support of all our stakeholders going forward.  Compliance CommitteeRisk Management Committee

 Compensation of directors and corporate auditors
There are two forms of compensation for directors and corporate auditors: basic compensation and stock options. These are provided as incentives and compensation for the roles that directors and corporate auditors should play. Under the Kyorin Group corporate philosophy, the roles of the directors and corporate auditors include executing management based on management policy and taking into consideration the value creation of various stakeholders, and enhancing corporate value through the sustainable and stable growth of the Group.
However, as outside directors and outside corporate auditors perform their roles of supervising and overseeing management from an independent position, payment is not linked to perfor- mance each year.
The voluntary Committee on Remuneration and Nominations deliberates in advance on the remuneration system for directors and basic policies, using industry standards and the Company’s performance as reference, and the Board of Directors makes a decision based on such deliberations.

Compliance/Risk Management
The Kyorin Group abides by all laws, regulations, codes of conduct, and the spirit thereof, and acts with high ethical standards, as well as promoting activities to appropriately manage internal and external risk pertaining to the business with a view toward the ongoing enhancement of corporate value. Each Group company establishes a Compliance Committee and a Risk Management Committee, which adopt various measures to raise awareness, and promotes compliance and risk management in each Group company to prevent corruption.
Compliance
Basic policy
An enterprise is required to promote the realization of a sustainable society through the creation of added value and employment that are useful to society and through autonomous and responsible actions based on fair and free competition. Following our corporate philosophy, the Kyorin Group conducts its activities in Japan and overseas based on a high standard of corporate ethics, in compliance with both the letter and the spirit of relevant laws, regulations, and international rules.
Corporate Charter and Compliance Guidelines
To ensure that the Kyorin Group’s activities are based on a high standard of corporate ethics, we established the KYORIN Holdings Corporate Charter and Compliance Guidelines (August 2006). Furthermore, we have also built and promoted a compliance system by establishing a Compliance Committee, which meets monthly, and other measures.
Education and training
Internal training is held to ensure an understanding and familiarity with Kyorin’s corporate philosophy and compliance.
1. Focusing on departments responsible for compliance and each division’s compliance promotion managers, Companywide level-specific training (newly hired employees, newly appointed managers, etc.) and functional training are held to teach corporate ethics and compliance, and efforts are made to ensure that an understanding and consideration of compliance are reflected in the work performed by directors, corporate auditors and officers, and employees.
2. June and November are designated “compliance enhancement months,” with the Corporate Charter and Compliance Guidelines read out at morning meetings and other activities held to ensure a thorough understanding and familiarity with compliance Groupwide.
Internal whistleblowing system
The Kyorin Group has established a “Corporate Ethics Hotline” to accept inquiries, consultations, and reports regarding corporate ethics and responses to laws and regulations, etc. The Group also accepts whistleblower reports of suspected injustice or non-compliance via internal e-mail, letter, telephone, and facsimile. We strictly maintain the confidentiality of whistleblowers, respect their privacy, and ensure that they are not disadvantaged. (Number of reports: nine in fiscal 2019)
Risk management
A management structure is in place to prevent the occurrence of risk events at Kyorin and its Group companies, and a Risk Management Committee has been established to address events that do occur. The Risk Management Committee oversees risk management initiatives across the entire Group, while also promoting activities to be implemented as necessary at respective divisions to build a structure to identify potential risks, reduce risks, and prevent risk events from occurring, and to minimize the damage from risk events that do occur unavoidably. The roles of the committee are as follows:
1. Direct risk assessments to related divisions to identify and understand latent risks.
2. Prepare various guidelines and operation manuals for related divisions, and implement training for employees and other preventive measures as necessary, to ensure
that latent risks do not materialize.
3. Prepare procedure manuals and carry out simulated drills at related divisions, and take out insurance and implement other measures as necessary, to minimize losses
if a risk event does occur. Also, a risk management promotion officer has been appointed at each company to raise awareness relating to risk management.
Initiatives related to transparency in relationships with medical institutions and other parties
The mission of a pharmaceutical company is to play an important role in “patient-focused medical care” as a valuable entity that contributes to the health and well-being of people around the world by continuously developing and providing a stable supply of outstanding medicines. To fulfill this mission, partnerships between pharmaceutical companies, research laboratories, and medical institutions including universities and others are essential, and we are required to properly manage our relationships where there is a potential conflict of interest with pharmaceutical companies.
Under these circumstances, the Kyorin Group established the Guidelines for Transparency of Relationships between Corporate Activities and Medical Institutions, etc., and the Guidelines on Transparency of Relationships between Corporate Activities and Patient Groups. In accordance with these guidelines, we publish information about funding to medical institutions, patient groups, and others on our website.
Kyorin’s Reliability Assurance System Reliability assurance system
Our corporate vision aims to be “a pharmaceutical manufacturer that is trusted by patients and medical professionals, and is recognized for its presence in society.” To achieve this, we continuously need to provide products and information that are trusted by broad sectors of society, and we consider this our highest priority. KYORIN Pharmaceutical takes a unified approach to all operations—from (research and) development to sales—and places a maximum emphasis on compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and on ensuring reliability. The Quality Assurance & Reliability Headquarters has primary responsibility in this area, and is independent from research and development, manufacturing, and sales divisions, and proactively works to provide products and information that patients and medical professionals can use safely.

 Reliable products and information Development Manufacturing Sales
GMP GCP GMP GQP GVP GPSP
GMP: Good Manufacturing Practice
GCP: Good Clinical Practice
GQP: Good Quality Practice
GVP: Good Vigilance Practice GPSP:Good Post-Marketing Study Practice
 Quality assurance
 Quality assurance is carried out on investigational new drugs based on GMP at the development stage, through compliance with GMP and GQP after sales, and by confirming that products are manufactured using appropriate equipment and according to designated procedure manuals. After-sales inquiries regarding quality collected from patients and medical professionals are given the highest priority, and are addressed sincerely and quickly.
Safety management
Drugs can be effective for treating patients (benefits) but can have adverse reactions (risks), and side effects that were not foreseen at the development stage can become apparent after sales. This is why it is important to collect and analyze a wide range of information regarding benefits and risks after a product is launched, and to provide appropriate information swiftly to medical facilities while taking into account the balance between benefits and risks. At Kyorin, we strive to ensure safety and promote proper use by carrying out drug-monitoring activities based on GVP. Post-manufacturing surveillance is carried out adhering to GPSP to collect and evaluate information regarding a drug’s safety and effectiveness after the product is launched. The analyzed information is provided to medical professionals and released in professional publications.
The Kyorin Group’s HOPE100 long-term vision includes the statement that it will “Promote diversified healthcare business expansion and by 2023 be recognized both within and outside as a company that supports sound and healthy lifestyles.” To achieve this, we consider it important to build a sophisticated system for ensuring the reliability of drugs handled by the Group and products sold by the healthcare business. By working to ensure the consistent reliability of Kyorin products and providing users with high-quality products that can be used “with safety and security,” we are gaining the trust of broad sectors of society.

  CSR Activities through Business
Following our corporate philosophy, the Kyorin Group endeavors to develop and supply useful and safe products and services to society with a view toward creating sustainable economic growth and solving social issues. Throughout this process (the value chain that stretches from research and development through the disclosure of product information), KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., the core subsidiary of the Kyorin Group, is committed to respecting human rights and abiding by all relevant laws and regulations including the Act on Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices.

Ethical considerations for human drug research
The company conducts research on humans and research that obtains or applies materials derived from humans with their full consent and in line with the Declaration of Helsinki,* and the relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines of each country. It also conducts ethical education and training for researchers into bioethics and genome research and clinical research, and endeavors to respect the human rights and protect the personal information of research participants. It has created a human tissue research ethics investigation committee, which includes outside experts, to inspect the ethicality and scientific validity of research plans impartially and fairly.
*The Declaration of Helsinki is a set of ethical principles regarding human experimentation that governs doctors and other professionals involved in medical research.
Ethical considerations for the use of animals in trials
To conduct appropriate animal trials from a scientific perspective while taking into consideration the protection and welfare of animals, the company promotes strict adherence to the 3R principles—refinement (reduction of animal distress), replacement (substitution of animal experiments with alternatives), and reduction (decrease in the number of laboratory animals used)—and has established rules based on various policies to protect animals.
Respect for subjects’ human rights, security of personal information, and maintenance of trust during clinical trials
The company conducts clinical trials in line with the Declaration of Helsinki* and relevant laws and regulations governing clinical trials of pharma- ceuticals, including good clinical practice (GCP), while fully taking into consideration the human rights and personal information of trial subjects. Its clinical trial plans are approved after inspection for ethicality and scientific validity by internal and external committees. Moreover, it must give sufficient explanation of items such as the objectives of trials and the methods used, the expected merits and demerits, and compensation in case of damage to the health of subjects, and confirmation is needed that subjects understand the details and have given their consent to participate. In addition, checks are made to ensure that employees involved in trials have been properly educated and trained, that trial institutions respect GCP, and that trials are conducted appropriately.
Disclosure of information related to clinical trials and trial results
The company strives to use clinical trial databases to publicly disclose and improve the transparency of the clinical trial plans that it leads. Going forward, the company will promote the creation of appropriate data access environments for those involved in utilizing clinical trial data, including researchers, and promote the disclosure of information that is useful in scientific progress and innovation.
Stable supply
The pharmaceutical supply chain includes a wide variety of diverse items, including raw materials, intermediates, and pharmaceutical ingredients, and is supported by a large number of suppliers in Japan and overseas. To maintain a stable supply, it is essential to strengthen ties with individual suppliers and ensure close alliances and information sharing. The company has created a stable supply structure based on demand forecasts for each region of the world and the unified management of inventory information and supply plans, making it possible to globally manage every stage of the process from ingredients manufacturing to supply of finished products. Moreover, as one of its risk-hedging policies, it strives to identify multiple alternative suppliers to supplement existing suppliers and different types of transportation routes.
Promotion of the appropriate use of drugs
Mistakes in the use of drugs can damage a patient’s health, while side effects can also occur even when drugs are used correctly. The company’s medical representatives (MR) work to accurately and swiftly provide information such as relevant documentation on appropriate product usage to allow medical professionals to use drugs more effectively and safely. In addition, we collect, analyze, and review information on efficacy and safety gleaned from the use of our drugs, and transmit the results to medical professionals.
Response to inquiries
To promote the safe and effective use of drugs, the company believes it has a responsibility to respond to inquiries from patients and medical professionals by providing highly reliable drug information that is both fair and impartial. With this understanding, it has established the Drug Information Center to handle various questions. The center responded to around 4,000 inquiries in fiscal 2019.
On-site supplier investigations
When selecting a new supplier, we begin transactions only after confirming through an on-site investigation that the supplier has measures in place for legal and regulatory compliance, labor safety, and environmental protection. For existing suppliers, we make regular visits to preserve and improve product quality and maintain a stable supply. In addition, we conduct risk assessments of work environments (including ones to prevent employee exposure to chemical substances) and take measures to reduce waste and lessen the environmental burden from wastewater and exhaust emissions.

Initiatives to Respect Human Rights, Implement Work-Style Reforms, and Develop Human Resources
The Kyorin Group believes it is important for employees to respect the human rights of all people and to act with high ethical standards. To that end, we endeavor to create work environments that respect the diversity, character, and individuality of each and every employee, where they can work in health and safety. At the same time, we aim to be a company that offers strong career fulfillment and encourages all employees to enhance their ethical values and personal
growth. Our corporate actions are rooted in this basic stance.
Respect for human rights
The Kyorin Group is managed with respect for the human rights of all people, and our Compliance Guidelines clearly state, “Along with understanding international norms regarding universally recognized human rights, we will respect the values and character of each individual, and will not engage in any form of discrimination in any situation, regarding each individual as being equal with all others, regardless of position or function.” The Company also respects the individuality of each employee, and has formulated guidelines to prevent harassment, to create a comfortable workplace environment where employees feel at ease. These guidelines cover sexual and power harassment, as well as harassment related to pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare and nursing care leave.
Promoting organization: becoming “the leading company for career fulfillment”
The Group positions valuing employees and empowering people/organizations as the most important challenge under the HOPE100 long-term vision for executing business strategy and realizing achievements. We therefore aim to be “the leading company for career fulfillment,” where employees take pride in their work, have trust in the Company and its organizations, and work in solidarity with their coworkers. We promote the creation and appropriate operation of the human resources management system (hiring, assigning, training, evaluation, transfers, compensation, social welfare, etc.) at each Group company under the basic concepts of our human resources management system.
Basic concepts of the human resources management system
Long-Term Reciprocal Partnership
By continuously fulfilling the responsibilities expected of each other over the long term, the Company and its employees share a common understanding that they are partners for mutual benefit. As employees contribute to the Company’s development, the Company will contribute to rich and rewarding lives for employees.
Mental health
The Kyorin Group provides mental-health education to managers and employees. Our manager training focuses on prevention and early detection of mental illness, by encouraging managers to pay attention to their subordinates and promoting understanding of the specific symptoms of mental disorders. We also encourage employees to gain knowledge about maintaining mental health via our intranet and other means, and have created a system for employees and their families to feel free to ask for help. When a mental health issue arises, the employee’s department, industrial psychiatrists, public health nurses, and Human Resources Department work together to help the employee recover, return to work, and prevent relapse.
Industrial safety and hygiene
The Kyorin Group places the highest priority on the “safety” and “health” of our employees, and we are proactively pursuing activities related to industrial safety and hygiene. One of our EHS activities has been to formulate an industrial safety and hygiene system, and we have set a goal of having zero workplace accidents. As a result of the activities being implemented at workplaces across the Group, the frequency and extent of workplace accidents as measured by rate and severity are well below industry average levels.
Support for employees’ childcare and nursing care
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. supports employees’ daily lives throughout their life cycle, including when they require childcare or nursing care, with the aim of providing an environment in which they are easily able to balance their lives between work and family. We strive to maintain an environment in which employees can feel fulfilled in their work, backed by a healthy home life.

     The Kyorin Group has enacted the “Kyorin Group Health Declaration,” a statement recognizing that our employees are the foundation of our corporate philosophy and long-term vision, and that their physical and mental health is paramount.
The Kyorin Group Health Declaration—Your Health is Kyorin’s Mission.—
As a company that supports sound and healthy lifestyles, the Kyorin Group views the health of its employees as a vital management issue, and is committed as an organization to promoting the health management of each and every employee.
1. To ensure that our employees and their families can live active lives, we pursue the maintenance of their sound physical and mental health by working hand in hand with a health insurance association.
2. We proactively support our employees’ efforts to maintain and improve their health and to further their health awareness.
3. We implement measures to maintain and improve our employees’ health and create safe and comfortable work environments as we aim to build business operations that allow us to fulfill our social mission of contributing to better health.
The general view is that “Health Management®”* is a strategic practice that sees the health management of employees from a business perspective. The Kyorin Group also implements a variety of initiatives to invigorate its organization, including improving the activity and productivity of employees, with an eye toward raising earnings and corporate value from a medium- to long-term perspective. Specific examples include giving health guidance to employees based on regular health examinations and stress checks, controlling long working hours, offering health improvement activities (a combination of walking and social contribution efforts), expanding health management structures, and totally banning smoking in all work spaces.
* “Health Management®” is a registered trademark of the nonprofit organization Kenkokeiei.
* Hourly based paid leave and the job return system are also available for nursing care support     n Expanded nursing care leave and breaks (186 days vs. legally stipulated 93 days)
Promoting the use of paid leave
n Support system for remote nursing care
n Nursing care seminars
 KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. proactively encourages the taking of paid leave, going over and above our legal obligations for paid leave under the Related Acts to Promote Work Style Reform (which requires companies to allow employees entitled to at least 10 days of annual paid leave to take five days). We also promote the taking of three additional days of leave for employees to maintain a good work-life balance to maximize their capabilities.
Job return system
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has created a job return system that provides opportunities for employees who still have a strong desire to work and are seen as vital by their colleagues to come back to their jobs. This system covers employees who have left the Group due to various major life events such as marriage, the job transfer of a partner, pregnancy, childbirth, child-rearing, nursing care, volunteer activities, and overseas study.

 Initiatives on disability hiring
As part of its social responsibilities, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. strives to provide suitable work environments for employees with disabilities to enable them to give full play to their abilities and live independent lives like able-bodied people. We also endeavor to create work spaces that are easy for employees with disabilities to operate in, such as using apps for employees with impaired hearing.
Human resources development
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. supports the growth of its employees by creating structured and systematic educational programs that provide opportunities for both solo learning (autonomous improvement of one’s personality and abilities) and joint learning (mutual growth and support). The structure and mechanisms for solo learning include correspondence courses, referrals for business magazine subscriptions, support for language learning, individual overseas study, support for the acquisition of qualifications, and subsidized external seminars. In joint learning, we offer 10 different types of tiered programs ranging from new employee training to training for management. Functional training is provided by each department to give employees the knowledge and skills required in their roles.

In Harmony with the Environment
One principle of the Kyorin Group’s Charter of Corporate Conduct details its understanding that “the tackling of environmental issues is a mission for all humankind and an imperative component of the very existence of corporations to which it remains voluntarily committed,” and that as a company dedicated to life, it will always use its EHS activity to conduct business operations with due regard for their impact on the global environment and local communities.
In all business operations, the Group promotes the effective use of our limited resources through energy and resource saving, waste reduction, and less use of substances that place a burden on the environment. It has established objectives and targets for these initiatives, reviews them as needed, and remains voluntarily and proactively committed to environmental protection and pollution prevention.
Environmental conservation initiatives
We are actively committed to environmental conservation, focusing on the following major themes: preventing global warming, protecting resources, and living in harmony with the natural environment. We are working to reduce the environmental burden and promote effective use of limited resources by conserving energy and resources, reducing waste, and strengthening our management of chemical substances. KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd. has obtained ISO 14001 certification, an international standard for environmental management systems, at all its plants.
 Basic stance
    Solo learning
Joint learning (tiered programs)
In our efforts to combat global warming by reducing CO2 emissions, we set a target of cutting emissions by at least 4% from the level of fiscal 2015 (30,444 tons) by fiscal 2019 (29,163 tons or below). In fiscal 2019, as our CO2 emissions were 27,477 tons, we achieved our objective. We are now working toward a new target of reducing CO2 emissions from the level of fiscal 2019 by a further average 1.5% annually by fiscal 2023.

Introducing hybrid cars to reduce CO2 emissions
   In harmony with the environment
The Kyorin Group is proactively introducing low-emission cars, hybrid cars, and other environmentally friendly vehicles for its sales force as a way of preventing global warming. As of March 2020, all 963 vehicles used by the sales force met the standard for having low emission (a 75% reduction in emissions from the 2005 standard), and of these, 615 (approximately 64%) are hybrid vehicles, which were introduced in 2004. In addition, these vehicles adhere to the Ministry of the Environment’s “Eco-Driving” guidelines regarding their impact on the environment and traffic safety.
Environmentally friendly R&D Center
In May 2017, the ReHP* technology installed at KYORIN Pharmaceutical’s WATARASE Research Center was awarded an honorable mention in the Kanto chapter of the Japanese Association of Building Mechanical and Electrical Engineers’ carbon neutral prize category for construction equipment that contributes to achieving a low-carbon society. In addition, the energy conservation activities related to this system were awarded the Grand Prize in the Kanto Region Energy Saving Committee’s 2019 Chairman’s Awards. During fiscal 2019, this system reduced electric power consumption by 66,500 kWh and CO2 emissions by roughly 31 tons compared with conventional heat pumps for air conditioning and heating, for approximately 32% in energy savings.
 Reducing the environmental burden through solar power generation
In a move to lessen its environmental burden, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. operates facilities for generating solar power, one form of renewable energy, on its premises. The company currently has two sites in operation in the town of Nogi in Tochigi Prefecture, one installed in fiscal 2013 and the other in fiscal 2017.
Biodiversity
KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd.’s Noshiro Plant participates in a citizens’ volunteer activity to protect the Kaze-no-Matsubara pine forest near the plant, to provide local residents with a place to relax. In fiscal 2019, 24 plant employees removed dead brush as part of an activity to preserve local biodiversity.
In addition, KYORIN Pharmaceutical’s WATARASE Research Center has installed birdhouses in trees adjacent to the Watarase Yusuichi wetlands and confirmed the location of nests as a way to enhance the environment for wild animals in the Center’s grounds.
* A Renewable Energy Heat Pump (ReHP) is a highly efficient heat pump that uses renewable energy, and the ReHP installed at two adjacent buildings (CS and LAB1) at the WATARASE Research Center uses geothermal heat and unused waste heat from a water chiller as a heat source, and circulates heated water in a single loop, which is used by air-conditioning and water-heating equipment, to increase energy efficiency.

Living in Harmony with Society
The Kyorin Group’s Charter of Corporate Conduct calls for it to “actively co-exist with society as a good corporate citizen and to contribute to society’s development.” The Kyorin Group is engaged in a variety of social contributions to achieve its goal of living in harmony with society.
As a manufacturer of new drugs, we aim to contribute to society by developing and supplying useful pharmaceuticals (products and services including clearly superior drugs), while at the same time using our business activities to aid in the resolution and improvement of medical and welfare issues, issues faced by senior citizens, and environmental issues.
We also engage in educational activities to support the health of young people. A healthy next generation will be able to power the creation and sustainable development of the highly livable and vibrant local communities that form the basis of our business activities. We pursue social contribution activities that are in keeping with our mission of being a company that supports sound and healthy lifestyles in a wide variety of ways.
Health education activities
Classroom visits
Since fiscal 2017, the Kyorin Group has planned and organized visits to schools by employees to teach and demonstrate the correct ways of using medicine and washing hands to elementary and junior high school students, to nurture the next generation. During fiscal 2019, head office and Group company employees visited 18 elementary and junior high schools in the communities of our workplaces around Japan. This is one of our social contribution activities that embody our corporate philosophy of “Contributing to better health.”
Work experience programs
Each Group facility offers internships, provides workplace tours and hands-on workshops for junior and senior high school students, and sends staff to teach in classrooms. In fiscal 2019, these programs were held at the head offices of KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., the WATARASE Research Center, and the three plants of KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd.
Health information website for children URL: http://www.karada-kyorin.com (Japanese only)
The Kyorin Group has supported the “Kyorin Group Presents the Great Adventure for the Body’s Secrets” program since 2016, with the idea of supporting healthy lives for the children of the next generation. During fiscal 2018, we launched a portal site related to this program, “Teach Me about the Body’s Secrets!” which shows videos of impure things in the body to deepen the understanding of diseases and how the body works to children from nursery school through early elementary school.
We will continue to work to enable children to have an interest in and enjoy learning about their own bodies.

The Kyorin Group launched the Health Challenge Program in 2017 as a new activity to promote employees’ health and contribute to local communities by donating items that are useful for maintaining health. All Group employees form teams at their workplace and count how many steps they take, competing in terms of points based on the number of steps taken, and health equipment is donated to a social welfare center near the workplaces of the two top teams. In fiscal 2019, 261 teams and 19 workplaces participated, enabling the donation of health equipment such as automated blood pressure meters, cordless bicycles, and elliptical trainers to facilities in Chiyoda Ward in Tokyo and the town of Nogi in Tochigi Prefecture, where the two top teams are located.
Sponsoring sporting events
The Kyorin Group supported the Shimotsuke Soccer Workshop in Nogi for the 20th time in fiscal 2019 with the aim of providing local children an easily accessible opportunity to think about and experience their own health management and improve their skills. Coached by former J.League professional soccer player and current sports journalist Tetsuo Nakanishi, many children enjoy playing soccer energetically each year. Donations are also solicited at the workshop and used to hold events to support the local community.
Local cleanup activities
As a responsible member of the local community, the Group actively participates in cleanups of local districts, including the areas around its business facilities.
• Group companies (head offices, branches, plants, research centers): cleanup activities around business facilities
• KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd. Noshiro Plant: participated in COK20 (cleanup of area formerly named
Kaneyu), Noshiro cleanup, and beach cleanup
• KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd. Shiga Plant: participated in Lake Biwa cleanup
Donations to areas affected by natural disasters
As useful support for those affected by disasters, the Group provided relief goods as detailed below:
• Support for those affected by Typhoon Hagibis in 2019: environmental hygiene supplies (Milton, Rubysta, etc.), daily necessities
(drinking water, towels), etc.
• Support for those affected by heavy rains in western Japan in 2018: environmental hygiene supplies (Milton, Rubysta, etc.),
daily necessities (drinking water, towels), etc.
Support for Great East Japan Earthquake recovery
Since fiscal 2011, KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has supported the Sunflower Project, which brings smiles and cheer to regions affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. In fiscal 2019, the program’s ninth year, 95 employees of the WATARASE Research Center cultivated 300 pots of sunflower seedlings and donated them to the city of Natori in Miyagi Prefecture.
First-aid and lifesaving courses for employees
As part of KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.’s CSR activities, the Company’s approximately 750 medical representatives receive first-aid training covering the necessity of first aid, CPR, the use of AEDs, and ways to stop bleeding. The same lessons were offered at each Group company's head office and at the WATARASE Research Center.

 Financial Analysis
Industry Trends in Japan
During fiscal 2019, the market environment for Japan’s ethical drugs industry remained difficult, resulting in low single-digit market growth. This stemmed from the government’s policy of comprehensively reforming the NHI drug pricing system, the introduction of measures to contain costs for drugs including the promotion of generic drugs and drug price revisions in October (an industrywide average 2.4%) associated with the raising of Japan’s consumption tax.
Given this situation, the Kyorin Group pursued trans- formation under the HOPE100–Stage 2– medium-term business plan (fiscal 2016–2019) with unwavering deter- mination, under a management policy for the plan’s final year of “mobilizing the Group’s collective strengths to bring about transformation,” as we moved forward in the achievement of our targets and in setting a course for continuous growth. At our core ethical drugs business, we focused on the management issues of creating original, globally competitive new drugs, discovering drugs contin- uously, and creating markets through new drugs. We also made a Companywide effort to accelerate the growth of peripheral businesses and achieve low-cost operations, as we strove to achieve our targets and gain greater support and recognition from stakeholders.
Consolidated Operating Results
As for consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019, although growth in major products and newly released products contributed to growth in domestic sales of new drugs, a decrease in prescription of long-listed drugs and a delay in the restart of supplies of a major product resulted in an overall decline from the previous year in domestic sales of new drugs. On the other hand, overseas sales of new drugs and generic drug sales rose, but sales at the ethical drugs business declined overall. Sales at the healthcare business rose, but on a consolidated basis,
net sales declined ¥3,637 million from the previous year, or 3.2%, to ¥109,983 million.
In terms of profit, despite a decline in the cost of sales ratio, lower sales of new drugs resulted in a ¥377 million decrease in gross profit. With a ¥1,092 million increase in SG&A expenses (including a ¥196 million increase in R&D expenses), operating income declined ¥1,469 million, or 16.4%, to ¥7,503 million. Profit attributable to share- holders of KYORIN Holdings, Inc. declined 10.5%, to ¥6,149 million.
Assets, Liabilities, and Net Assets
Current assets as of March 31, 2020, increased by ¥2,154 million from the previous fiscal year-end, with increases in merchandise and finished goods and work in process and decreases in notes and accounts receivable and other current assets. Fixed assets decreased ¥4,028 million, with an increase in machinery and vehicle, net and decreases in investment securities and deferred tax assets. As a result, total assets decreased ¥1,873 million from the end of the previous fiscal year, to ¥171,160 million.
Total liabilities decreased by ¥1,189 million from the previous fiscal year-end, to ¥48,449 million, reflecting increases in accrued income taxes, other current liabilities, long-term debt, and liability for retirement benefits, and decreases in notes and accounts payable, short-term bank loans, and deferred tax liabilities.
Net assets decreased ¥684 million from the end of the previous fiscal year, to ¥122,710 million, including an increase in retained earnings and decreases in the unrealized holding gain on other securities and retirement benefits liability adjustments.
As a result, the shareholders’ equity ratio as of the fiscal year-end was 71.7%, a 0.4 percentage-point increase from the end of the previous fiscal year.
Cash Flows
Operating activities during fiscal 2019 generated net cash in the amount of ¥7,739 million, with major items including ¥8,255 million in profit before income taxes, depreciation and amortization of ¥3,221 million, a ¥5,185 million decrease in notes and accounts receivable, a ¥7,863 million increase in inventories, a ¥1,664 million decrease in notes and accounts payable, and ¥1,513 million in income taxes paid.
Investing activities used net cash in the amount of ¥2,943 million, primarily reflecting ¥2,624 million of outlays for the purchase of property, plant and equipment.
Financing activities used net cash in the amount of ¥5,117 million, with major items including ¥10,000 million for repayments of short-term bank loans, ¥10,180 million in proceeds from long-term debt, and ¥4,346 million paid as cash dividends.
As a result, cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2019 totaled ¥30,509 million, marking a ¥404 million decrease from the previous fiscal year-end.
Outlook for Fiscal 2020
The operating environment for the Group’s core ethical drugs business is expected to be even more challenging in fiscal 2020, as various policies are implemented to curtail medical expenses and drug costs. Against this backdrop, the Kyorin Group has formulated the new HOPE100–Stage 3– medium-term business plan (fiscal 2020–2023) for the achievement of the HOPE100 long- term vision. Under the plan’s statement of “Realization of a growth trend through the pursuit of originality,” we will move ahead boldly with our business strategy and organizational strategy to achieve our targets and gain greater support and recognition from stakeholders. Our management policy for the first year under the plan, ending in March 2021, is to “Take up the challenge of pursuing originality,” which we will do by proactively
accelerating the growth of the new drugs group, expanding the development pipeline, building on drug creation projects, and enhancing our cost competitiveness, as we move forward in setting a growth trend.
In terms of net sales for fiscal 2020, although we antici- pate an effect from the drug price revisions implemented in April 2020 (the 2% range for KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), we also expect a contribution to sales from new products released in fiscal 2019 and growth from the removal of the limit on the prescription period for a major product, and are forecasting a large increase in domestic sales of new drugs. With regard to generic drugs, we plan to release an authorized generic drug and expect sales to grow, and are forecasting significant sales growth for the ethical drugs business.
We are also forecasting profit growth underpinned by a large increase in net sales.
Although we foresee a negligible impact on business results from the spread of infection of the novel corona- virus, many elements of uncertainty remain. We will therefore closely follow developments going forward, and should a revision to our forecasts be deemed necessary, we will promptly release that information.

 Business Risks
The Group promotes its operations within the framework of pharmaceutical administration, in compliance with legal regulations regarding pharmaceutical development, production, and distribution in Japan, such as the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act, as well as various regulatory frameworks of other countries. However, we are aware of the existence of risks that could materially affect our business performance and financial condition, due to various factors including substantial changes in relevant laws, healthcare system reforms, drastic changes in the market environment, and large-scale natural disasters.
Among such risks, those that could materially affect the decisions of investors are described below. Although the Group has taken organizational and systematic measures to minimize risk, the outline does not include every risk or variable that could affect its business.
The forward-looking statements contained therein represent the Group’s judgment as of March 31, 2020.
should the Group’s business activities infringe on the patents of another company or otherwise violate its intellectual property rights, the Group could become involved in legal disputes and have to terminate some business operations, and our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
6. Risks Associated with Lawsuits
The Group, on the advice of experts, manages the litiga- tion risks that occur in its business activities both in Japan and overseas, including those associated with intellectual property rights such as patents, violations of the Product Liability Act, environmental protection issues, and labor disputes. However, should such lawsuits be brought against the Group, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
7. Risks Associated with Alliances
The Group promotes strategic alliances to make efficient use of external capital. Through tie-up agreements with other pharmaceutical companies inside and outside Japan, the subsidiary allocates sales rights for some of its products and collaborates in sales, R&D, and other activities. In addition, the Group strives to maintain and develop ongoing alliance relationships, enhancing these relationships in light of the sales strategies and R&D trends of the tie-up partners. However, should these alliance relationships be ended, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
8. Risks Associated with IT Security and Information Management
Given that numerous IT systems are utilized in business operations, the Group strives to establish IT security measures and a framework for information management by implementing security software and periodic data back-ups, and establishing various information manage- ment rules and thoroughly communicating them to our employees. However, should unforeseeable business disruptions or leakages of information occur due to factors such as system faults or computer viruses, and society’s trust in the Group become seriously damaged, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
9. Risks Associated with Volatility in the Financial Markets
The Group’s business performance and financial condition could be materially affected during import and export transactions due to fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, should fluctuations occur in the amounts of pension assets, retirement benefit obligations, the valu- ation of shares held, etc., due to fluctuations in exchange rates, in interest rate levels, or on the stock market, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
10. Risks Associated with Side Effects
Clinical trials in the development phase of ethical drugs are conducted on only a limited number of subjects. Therefore, should unforeseeable side effects occur after the launch of a drug, its usage could be restricted or, in some cases, its sale could be discontinued, and our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
11. Risks Associated with Large-Scale Disasters
The Group prepares various manuals and conducts drills to prepare for large-scale and other disasters. However, should natural disasters beyond our expectations such as earthquakes or typhoons, accidents such as fires, or pandemics such as influenza occur, these events could result in the closure of plants and the suspension of operations at KYORIN Pharmaceutical Group Facilities Co., Ltd., the Company’s production subsidiary, the Group’s suppliers, or other locations. While the Group has secured a certain amount of inventory to ensure a stable supply, should such plant closings or suspensions extend for a lengthy period, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
12. Risks Associated with Environmental Issues
The Group strives to not only comply with relevant laws and regulations but also to achieve even higher voluntary standards in terms of the environment, health, and safety. It also promotes Groupwide EHS activities that integrate the environmental management system and the industrial safety and hygiene management system. However, should a violation of relevant laws or regulations occur due to unexpected accidents or other events in business oper- ations, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
1. Risks Associated with R&D
Ethical drug development requires substantial R&D invest- ment over lengthy periods, and the success rate for bringing a drug development candidate to market as a pharmaceutical product is low. KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., the Company’s subsidiary, has clarified its priority research areas and has been making efforts to expand its pipeline, by engaging in proprietary drug discovery through cooperation with the WATARASE Research Center and ActivX Biosciences, Inc., in addition to R&D based on open innovation with pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and venture start-ups in Japan and overseas. However, should development be delayed or terminated due to the emergence of unforeseeable side effects, a failure to achieve intended clinical results, or other reasons, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
2. Risks Associated with Stable Supply
The supply of certain products and raw materials to the Group depends on having specific business partners. The Group has secured a certain amount of products and raw materials to ensure a stable supply of its products, and has been striving to secure multiple suppliers of its essential raw materials. However, should manufacturing activities or procurement be delayed or terminated due to unforeseeable circumstances, the stable supply of our products could be adversely affected. Furthermore, while our pharmaceutical products are manufactured within various regulatory frameworks, should quality-related or other problems occur, and recalling our products become necessary, our business performance and financial condi- tion could be materially affected.
3. Risks Associated with Healthcare System Reforms
Japan’s healthcare system, including NHI drug prices, is being revised. In terms of sales, the Group is working to increase the ratio of new pharmaceuticals by maximizing their availability, while in terms of production, it is engaged in initiatives including reforms of the cost structure through a consolidation of its production functions and Groupwide optimization. However, should greater-than-expected NHI drug price revisions be made or changes to the NHI system occur, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
4. Risks Associated with Competition from Other Drugs
In the new drugs business, the Group has been concen- trating its management resources in the specific fields of respiratory, otolaryngology, and urology, and working to enhance its presence there by giving priority to activities that provide information to doctors specializing in these fields. In addition, in the generic drugs business, the Group has been engaged in business development that makes the most of its characteristics by proactively pursuing the market launch of authorized generics. However, should competition from peer products in these fields intensify and the entry of generic drugs after the patent expiration of the original drugs increase, our business performance and financial condition could be materially affected.
5. Risks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights
The Group strictly manages its intellectual property rights and continuously pays close attention to any infringements by third parties. However, should a third party exploit the Group’s technologies and infringe on our intellectual property rights in our market or in a related market, or

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
KYORIN Holdings, Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries For the year ended March 31, 2020
1. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of KYORIN Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) and consolidated subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.
Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2019 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2020 presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on consolidated profit and net assets. Amounts of less than one million yen and thousand U.S. dollars have been rounded down to the nearest million yen and thousand U.S. dollars, respectively, in the presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a result, the totals in yen and U.S. dollars do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of Consolidation and Accounting for Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries and Affiliates
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and significant companies controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. Companies over which the Company exercises significant influence in terms of their operating and financial policies are included in the consolidated financial statements on an equity basis. As of March 31, 2020, the numbers of consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for by the equity method were 6 and 1 (7 and 1 in 2019). During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company deconsolidated Kyorin USA, Inc. which resolved to dissolve and has insignificant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates, which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method, are carried at cost or less. Where there has been a permanent decline in the value of such investments, the Company has written down the investments.
Among the consolidated subsidiaries, Kyorin Europe GmbH and ActivX Biosciences, Inc. close their books of account at December 31 for financial reporting purposes. Their financial statements are used for preparing the consolidated financial statements, and necessary adjustments are made to the consolidated financial statements for any significant transactions between their balance sheet date (December 31) and the consolidated balance sheet date (March 31).
(b) Foreign Currency Translation
The revenue and expense accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The balance sheet accounts, except for the components of net assets are translated into yen at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The components of net assets are translated at their historical exchange rates. Differences arising from the translation are presented as translation adjustments, which are presented as a component of net assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposit with banks withdrawable on demand, and short-term investments which are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of any changes in their value and which were purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
(d) Short-Term Investments and Investment Securities
Securities other than equity securities issued by subsidiaries and an affiliate are classified into other securities. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, directly included in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are stated at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method.
(e) Inventories
Merchandise and finished goods, work in process, raw materials, and some supplies (samples) are mainly stated at cost determined by the gross average method. These inventories with lower profitability are written down to their net realizable value. Supplies except for samples are stated at the last purchase price method.

(f) Depreciation and Amortization (Except for Leased Assets)
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are summarized as follows:
Buildings and structures 3 to 50 years
Machinery and vehicle 4 to 17 years
Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Computer software for
internal use is capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the useful life of three to five years.
(g) Leases
Leased assets are depreciated over the lease term by the straight-line method with no residual value. All finance leases are accounted for in the same manner as sales transactions.
(h) Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.
(i) Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the effective tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
(j) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits
The retirement benefit obligation is calculated by allocating the estimated retirement benefit amount to period of service on the benefit formula basis.
Prior service cost is amortized as incurred by the straight-line method over the average remaining years of service of the employees in the year such cost occurs (10 years).
Actuarial gain or loss is amortized from the year following the year in which such gain or loss is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over the average remaining years of service of the employees in the year such gain or loss occurs (10 years).
Unrecognized actuarial loss and unrecognized prior service costs are, after adjusting for tax effects, recorded as retirement benefits liability adjustments under accumulated other comprehensive income in net assets.
(k) Appropriation of Retained Earnings
Appropriation of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by resolution of the Board of Directors’ meeting for dividend and resolution of the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting for other appropriations (see Note 7).
(l) Accounting Standard Issued but Not Yet Effective
“Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (“ASBJ”) Statement No. 29, issued on March 30, 2018)
“Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued on March 30, 2018)
(1) Overview
The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the United States of America (“FASB”) jointly developed a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (IFRS 15, issued by the IASB and Topic 606, issued by the FASB) in May 2014. Considering that IFRS 15 has become applicable from fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 from fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the ASBJ developed a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued it together with implementation guidance.
The ASBJ’s basic policy in developing the accounting standard for revenue recognition was to establish accounting standards as a starting point in accordance with basic principles of IFRS 15 from the viewpoint of comparability of
financial statements, which is one of benefits of maintaining consistency with IFRS 15, and to add alternative accounting treatments to the extent that they do not impair comparability in cases where common practices and others in Japan should be considered.
(2) Date of application
From the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
(3) Effect of application
The effect of applying the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,” etc. on the consolidated financial statements is currently under assessment.
“Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Statement No. 30, issued on July 4, 2019) “Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories” (ASBJ Statement No. 9, revised on July 4, 2019) “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Statement No. 10, revised on July 4, 2019) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, issued on July 4, 2019)
“Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, revised on March 31, 2020)
(1) Overview
The ASBJ promoted an initiative to enhance comparability of the requirements between the Japanese accounting standards and international accounting standards, primarily in the areas of guidance on the fair values of financial instruments and their disclosures, and issued “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement,” etc., considering the circumstance where the IASB and the FASB have prescribed almost the similar detailed guidance (IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” issued by IASB and Accounting Standard Codification Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” issued by FASB).
The ASBJ’s fundamental policies adopted for developing the “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement,” etc. are, in principle, to implement all the requirements of IFRS 13 from the viewpoint of enhancing the comparability of the financial statements of domestic and overseas companies by prescribing unified measurement methods, and also to prescribe exceptional treatments for individual matters so that comparability would not be impaired while the accounting practices that have conventionally been adopted in Japan are taken into account.
(2) Date of application
From the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
(3) Effect of application
The effect of applying the “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement,” etc. on the consolidated financial statements is currently unknown.

7. Shareholders’ Equity
Japanese companies have been subject to the Companies Act of Japan (the “Companies Act”). The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:
(a) Dividends
Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders’ meeting. The board of directors may declare dividends (except for dividends-in-kind) if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation for companies that meet certain criteria such as:
(1) having the board of directors,
(2) having independent auditors,
(3) having a board of corporate auditors, and
(4) the term of service of the directors is prescribed as one year rather than two years of normal term by its articles
of incorporation.
The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends-in-kind (non-cash assets) to shareholders subject
to a certain limitation and additional requirements.
Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of
incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act also provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury stock. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¥3 million.
(b) Increases/Decreases and Transfer of Common Stock, Reserve and Surplus
The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.
   Unlisted securities and other non-marketable securities are not included in the above schedules as their fair market values are extremely difficult to be determined. The amounts of these securities were ¥640 million ($5,881 thousand) and ¥612 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Sales amounts of securities classified as other securities and the related aggregate gain and loss for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized as follows:

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries mainly operate funds by the highly secured financial instruments such as deposits and highly rated bonds, ensuring the security and liquidity. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries use bank loans as the prime source of financing, and no derivatives are used.
(b) Details of Financial Instruments, Associated Risks and Risk Management
Operating receivables such as notes and accounts receivable are exposed to credit risk. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, in accordance with internal rules, keep track of the adverse financial conditions of the customers in the early stage to mitigate the bad debt by monitoring the major customers’ credit conditions periodically and managing the due date and balance per each customer. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries mitigate foreign currency risk by utilizing foreign currency deposits for operating receivables denominated in foreign currencies and settling payables denominated in the same currencies through the deposits.
Short-term investments and investment securities mainly consist of highly rated bond securities and equity securities of companies with business relationships and are exposed to market risk and credit risk. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries regularly review the fair value and issuers’ financial condition to mitigate the risks.
Operating payables such as notes and accounts payable are mainly due within six months. Certain operating payables are denominated in foreign currencies.
Bank loans and debts are mainly used for the operating fund, fund for capital investments and the funding support for development expenses from Japan Science and Technology Agency (National Research and Development Agency).
Unlisted securities and others of ¥1,255 million ($11,532 thousand) and ¥1,238 million whose fair values are extremely difficult to determine as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are not included in the above tables.
Calculation method of fair value of financial instruments and information about securities are as follows:
Cash and cash in banks and Notes and accounts receivable
The carrying value is deemed as the fair value since it is scheduled to be settled in a short period of time.
Short-term investments and Investment securities
Fair value of equity securities is based on the price on stock exchanges and that of bonds is based on the price on bond markets or the price presented by the counterparty financial institutions. Please see Note 5, Short-Term Investments and Investment Securities, for securities by classification.
Notes and accounts payable and Short-term bank loans
The carrying value is deemed as the fair value since these are scheduled to be settled in a short period of time.
Long-term debt
The fair value of long-term debt is determined by discounting the amount of the total principal and interest at the interest rate assumed when new, similar loans are made.
  
 The redemption schedule for monetary receivables and securities with maturities subsequent to March 31, 2020 is as follows:

KDDI’s Initiatives
KDDI is leveraging the experience, know-how and technological capabilities it has accumulated around the world in the telecommu- nications services business to develop reliable, “Japan-quality” telecommunications services with expanded 4G LTE coverage in Myanmar, Mongolia, and other developing countries. By offering inexpensive and fair access to telecommunications networks, we will increase the number of mobile connections in these countries,
while contributing to economic development and the realization of more comfortable lifestyles. We are also involved in peripheral businesses around telecommunications that contribute to sus- tained growth in these countries. With the aim of eliminating digital divides in international society, we proactively participate in ICT projects and offer technological consultation in developing countries in addition to contributing to the training of technicians through education and training programs in the ICT field.

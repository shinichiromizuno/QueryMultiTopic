Through our education business, we contribute to the development of human resources that will lead the next generation.
  Social issues
• Need for training human resources responsive to globalization
• Insufficient education opportunities for children to thrive in society
• Insufficient learning opportunities for children in developing countries
KDDI’s Vision
KDDI aims to broadly provide venues for children to learn life- long skills through work and social experiences while furnishing them with opportunities to learn foreign languages, with the intention of contributing to the development of a sustainable society by solving issues faced by the young in an increasingly diverse society.
By providing educational opportunities in developing countries, KDDI also contributes to the development of human resources who may guide their countries toward sustained growth.
KDDI’s Initiatives
Through the foreign language education business, the KDDI Group offers services for learning in a new format, blending education with communications services, that can be provided anywhere. Moreover, KDDI offers learning experiences at KidZania based on the concept of edutainment (learning while having fun). In developing countries, KDDI creates opportunities for people to study English, PC operation, and music, subjects that tend to be neglected in these countries.

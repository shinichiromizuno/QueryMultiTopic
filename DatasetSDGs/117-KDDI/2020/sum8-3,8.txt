KDDI has undertaken work style reforms and health management as an important management issue for a long time. To further promote these initiatives, we established the Management Department as an organization dedicated to these causes in January 2019.
We are creating a company where all employees can stay healthy while achieving high performance by having a framework of around 40 internal counselors to conduct two annual interviews with every employee and asses their mental and physical health. With the spread of COVID-19, we formulated a basic policy based on the policies of KDDI Sustainable Action. The first of five items in the policy is “ensuring the safety of customers and employees of KDDI and its affiliates above all else.” To prevent the spread of infections, around 90% of KDDI employees are working from home.
Going forward, we will continue striving to be a company that contributes to the sustainable develop- ment of society and where employees thrive.

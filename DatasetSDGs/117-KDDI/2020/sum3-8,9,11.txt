In Japan, due to the declining population and urban centralization, the issue of regional depopulation will continue to get worse going forward. To address this issue, we at KDDI will continue to help create a society where everyone can live a full life, free of inequality, and regardless of place of residence, through telecommunications.
From March 2020, we began fully offering 5G commercial services. I think we can leverage the char- acteristics of 5G, namely high speed, low latency, and multiple connections, in various fields including remote healthcare and education, agriculture, industry, and smart cities. To build the foundation for this, we began providing 5G commercial services in major cities across Japan from summer 2020, and we aim to offer 5G commercial services in every prefecture by March 2021.
Through the adoption of 5G, we will continue helping to realize a new society that solves the issues confronting rural areas.

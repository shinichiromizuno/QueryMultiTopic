Rural Japan is facing various social issues, such as a declining birthrate, aging population, declining pop- ulation, aging infrastructure, and increasing number of natural disasters. Attempts are being made to realize Society 5.0, which would help solve these issues through ICT. KDDI believes that to make these initiatives sustainable, we need to train the personnel, venture companies, and local companies that will take up the responsibility of solving these issues at the local level. To date, KDDI has worked with over 60 municipalities to solve problems, and the Company is collaborating with regional universities and technical colleges to promote corporate and human resources training for innovation, starting businesses, and DX, by leveraging its track record to date.
In addition, we established the KDDI Regional Initiatives Fund in April 2019 for regional revitalization by providing funding to training companies. Going forward, KDDI will continue to contribute to the sustain- able development of society by working to train human resources that will develop regional areas and shape the future.

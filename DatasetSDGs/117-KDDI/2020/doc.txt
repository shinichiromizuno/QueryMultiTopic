CEO Message
Looking back on the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we see there were myriad environmental changes in the telecommunications industry, such as the amended Telecommunications Business Law going into force, the market entry of a fourth telecommunications provider, and the full start of 5G services.
In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on economic and social activities throughout the world. The new normal born of this unprecedented situation has upended society and simultaneously provided a major opportunity to accelerate change.
Amid this sea change, the entire KDDI Group has come together to help contribute to the sustainable growth of society as stated in the Company Vision and will continue focusing on achieving the goals of the medium- term management plan.
In this message, I will look back on the fiscal year ended Mach 31, 2020 and talk about our COVID-19 countermeasures and KDDI’s post-pandemic future.
              Tomorrow, Together Working with all our partners, we will create new value in the 5G era, aiming to grow sustainably with society.
President, KDDI CORPORATION
                       06 KDDI CORPORATION | INTEGRATED REPORT 2020

Looking Back on the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2020
Accomplishments in the First Year of the Medium-Term Management Plan
Under the medium-term management plan unveiled in 2019, KDDI targets growth of 1.5 times in earnings per share (EPS) by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, compared with the level in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, while sustaining growth in profits. Converting that to compound average growth rate (CAGR) would require around 7% growth per year. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, EPS grew 6.4% to ¥275.69 due to stable profit growth and share buybacks. I think we were able to make a solid step forward in achieving the goals of our medium-term management plan.
In the three years between March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2022, we expected to maximize profit in the final fiscal year by expanding growth domains and taking cost efficiency measures, but the results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 exceeded our initial forecast and internal plan.
Page Link P. 11 Progress Made under the Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2020.3-FY2022.3)
Manifesting Profit Growth in Growth Fields
In the fiscal year ended Mach 31, 2020, the growth fields of Life Design Domain and Business Services segment drove the increase in operating income.
Page Link P. 14 Financial Results Summary
This, I believe, was a manifestation of the accomplishments of our approximately ¥500 billion in growth investments under the previous medium-term management plan (FY2017.3–FY2019.3) with the aim of achieving sustainable growth. In the Life Design Domain, growth investments are connected to expanding the scale of the energy and finance fields.
In addition, in the Business Services segment, we have set up a one-stop system that can offer use of devices, networks, cloud services, and data through growth investments with the aim of helping companies promote their digital transfor- mation (DX). These combined strengths are now contributing to both our core and new businesses, boosting profits.
Formulating “KDDI Sustainable Action”
In 2020, KDDI formulated “KDDI Sustainable Action”—KDDI’s initiatives for the SDGs aimed at 2030 with a deter- mination to continue working to solve various social issues through business going forward. In consideration of the social issues and the business sectors KDDI can contribute to as a telecommunications operator, we revised KDDI’s target SDGs, which were linked with the medium-term management plan, into eight social fields.
We do not view social issues merely as risks; we also consider them opportunities to leverage the unique strengths of KDDI. We strive to solve diverse social issues while raising profit as a business, such as by provid- ing inexpensive, high-quality telecommunications services in developing countries and spurring regional revital- ization using 5G, IoT, and other technologies.

Initiatives of Each Business
Personal Services Segment
In March 2020, we began to offer a commercial 5G service “au 5G” in some areas of 15 prefectures across Japan. We plan to expand the “au 5G” area to major cities in all prefectures from summer 2020 onward. In addition, we began offering smartphone pricing plans for “au 5G” that pair unlimited data with popular enter- tainment content, such as “Data MAX 5G ALL STAR Pack”* and “Data MAX 5G Netflix Pack.” With “au 5G,” users can instantaneously, easily, and freely handle large amounts of data. Under the concept of “UNLIMITED WORLD au 5G,” which is free from conventional restrictions, we will collaborate with partners from various industries to provide a new augmented experience for all facets of life, such as entertainment, sports, and art.
Furthermore, KDDI aims to maximize Group IDs, engagement, and total ARPU by achieving the “integration of telecommunications and life design.” Specifically, we strengthened points of contact with customers (engagement) by working to heighten the appeal of “au PAY,” the smartphone payment service we started in 2019. We will also continue to expand Group IDs, which are the foundation of our existing telecommunications business, through appealing offers anchored to customer perspectives by using big data. Moreover, we have polished up the “au PAY” app to position it as a super app that acts as the entry point to all of a customer’s daily activities as we strive to maximize total ARPU by providing new experience value to customers.

Business Services Segment
Digital transformation (DX) is accelerating at companies across industries and usage areas, and business models themselves are significantly changing. We are stably growing our existing mobile and fixed-line telecommunica- tions businesses. We are promoting the creation of new experience value and businesses unique to the 5G era with various partner businesses as a digital integrator for a time when all things are being incorporated into telecommunications. These efforts are centered around KDDI DIGITAL GATE, which is a business development base for the 5G/IoT era supporting customers’ DX. And through our IoT World Architecture, we will continue helping to build a foundation that is resilient to environmental changes by further expanding IoT in Japan and overseas, as we maintain our efforts to expand the scale of our domestic and international business.
Taking Action Aimed at Diverse Social Issues, COVID-19, and the Post-Pandemic Era
In recent years full-scale digitization has continued to march forward with the advance of 5G, IoT, AI, big data and other technologies, shifting toward a data-driven society that finds greater value in data. KDDI uses these technologies to solve various social issues people are facing, including taking action aimed at COVID-19 and the post-pandemic era, as we promote initiatives to ensure the safety and peace of mind of consumers and to make economic activity sustainable.
To this end, in August 2020, KDDI and KDDI Research, Inc. formulated KDDI Accelerate 5.0, which aims to build a resilient future society in the era of the new normal. We will accelerate the realization of Society 5.0 pro- moted by the government through the utilization of technology and the orchestration of seven fields that support the evolution of business layers, platform layers, and network layers, including 5G networks.
We will create an advanced, open platform for each industry using the resilient 5G/Beyond 5G network that supports the industrial foundations of Japan. Using this environment, we will integrate cyber spaces and physical spaces while working with various corporate partners to combine our knowhow and assets in each sector.
Through these efforts, if we can create new engagement with customers, KDDI will successfully evolve into a recurring, resilient business model.

Transforming into a Company that Puts Human Resources First
To continue outperforming the competition amid a business environment that drastically changes all the time, KDDI employees and organizations will need a high degree of autonomy and growth.
KDDI has long promoted a model of human resources focused on an ideal employee who continues growing given a high degree of autonomy based on management’s policy of putting human resources first. We have now also formulated the Declaration of New Work Styles centered on realizing workstyles that enable each employee to rack up accomplishments without being tied to specific times or places.Under this new approach, each employee will realize a workstyle that is suited to their personal preference, living environment and role in the organization.
In addition, to support these new workstyles, we steadily rolled out a new system for human resources from August 2020 with the purpose of evaluating and praising employees on their accomplishments, endeavors, and abilities (rather than hours worked) and accordingly reflecting these in compensation. We introduced human resource management that clarified the scope of work duties to promote the cultivation of expertise and a remuneration system based on market value. In this way, we will continue aiming to provide various growth opportunities in a wide range of business areas in the KDDI Group while leveraging the strengths of job-focused management.
Furthermore, by promoting internal DX to upgrade our offices and IT environment, we will continue realizing workstyles suited to each employee in a hybrid form combining telework and office work.

The KDDI Group Philosophy as the Basis of Sustainable Management
By practicing the KDDI Group Philosophy, KDDI aims to become a company that is beloved and trusted by all its stakeholders. As a telecommunications operator that provides social infrastructure, KDDI has the important social mission of enabling stable communications services on an ongoing basis, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, regardless of conditions. Furthermore, as a telecommunications operation, our business derives from utilizing radio waves—an important asset shared by all citizens. Accordingly, we recognize that we have the social responsibility to address the issues society faces and earnestly help to resolve them. The KDDI Group Philosophy embodies this corporate stance and our employees’ ideas, and I think this serves as the basis of sustainable management.
As we widely expand our business in Japan and overseas, I feel it is necessary that each business division strengthen collaboration and all employees take action with shared values. Going forward, all employees will continue to share the KDDI Group Philosophy and come together to promote sustainable management by car- rying out the mission.

Aiming to Achieve both Sustainable Growth and Stronger Shareholder Returns
KDDI has stayed true to its basic aim of sustaining growth. Overcoming hardships since its founding in 2000, KDDI has achieved 19 consecutive fiscal years of profit growth. The view that the telecommunications industry is unlikely to grow much more, even on a global basis, is becoming more widespread. Yet, at KDDI, we are ral- lying our ingenuity to meet the challenge of sustaining growth.
October 1, 2020 will mark the 20th anniversary of KDDI’s establishment.
Tomorrow, Together
We will continue to move forward, together with customers, partners, and society at large, sharing a faith in the
future as we aim to both sustainably grow profit and reinforce shareholder returns from a long-term perspective. As we move forward together, I would like to express my sincere appreciation for your continued support and

Regarding shareholder returns, KDDI has steadily increased dividends toward a dividend payout ratio of over 40%, while tak- ing a flexible approach to buying back its own shares.

On the non-financial front, we are enhancing disclosure on our website in an effort to ensure fair and appropriate disclosure of ESG information.

For 2030, we established SDG targets in eight areas, such as build- ing a resilient infrastructure for communication and disaster
Cash Allocation
We continue to prioritize growth investment to sustainably grow profits. We conduct M&A in growth fields and carry out capital investment with the aim of maintaining and enhancing our competitiveness.
We forecast capital investment of ¥610 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, which is roughly level with the previous fiscal year, as we actively pursue 5G investments and reduce 4G investments. Over the medium term, we intend to maintain this investment level of around ¥600 billion.
Financing during the COVID-19 Crisis
Because the impact of COVID-19 on our telecommunications business (a subscription business model) is small compared with our goods-focused businesses (one-time-fee business model), the entire Group’s cash flow has not been seriously affected.
Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
Shareholders and investors are an important source of support and enlighten our understanding of business continuity.
During dialogue, we strive to further everyone’s understand- ing that KDDI aims to ensure sustainable profit growth and stronger shareholder returns as well as making use of the valu- able opinions we receive in management.
We position the building of strong trust-based relationships as the top priority of management and commit to practicing management focused on increasing corporate value, proactively disclosing information, and enhancing communication.

Furthermore, we are striving to be a compa- ny that puts human resources first and attracts a diverse range of talented personnel. By strengthening the training of DX per- sonnel and new work styles for the new normal era, we aim to spur innovation and enhance productivity in an effort to help maximize corporate value.
KDDI considers M&A mainly in terms of: 1) maximizing Group IDs, the basis for “the integration of telecommunications and life design,” 2) maximizing life time value by expanding operating revenue and increasing engagement, 3) providing new value by acquiring additional capabilities for the 5G and IoT era, and 4) expanding global business.
As for shareholder returns, in line with the medium-term management plan, we conduct flexible share buybacks in addition to maintaining a dividend payout ratio of over 40%.
In preparation for a prolonged COVID-19 crisis and further uncertainty, KDDI has ensured operations have more leeway than before when it comes to financing and has secured fund- ing procurement methods from financial institutions, such as commitment lines.

             Our Future 1: Customer-Oriented Value Provision Aiming to Maximize Group IDs
The competitive environment of Japan’s mobile telecom- munications market is changing drastically. For example, MVNOs and other budget smartphones continue to gradually expand, the amended Telecommunication Business Act went into effect in October 2019, and a fourth telecommunications carrier has entered the market.
To sustainably grow under this kind of environment, KDDI aims to further expand earnings by maximizing Group IDs, engagement, and total ARPU.

Aiming to Provide Customer-Oriented Value
We are promoting strategies centered on engagement with the aim of maximizing Group IDs, engagement, and total ARPU, which comprise the axis of KDDI’s sustainable growth.
Engagement refers to trust-based relationships with customers.
If we enhance engagement, customers will more frequently use our services and use them for longer. We can expect that, as a result, the churn rate will improve and Group IDs will fur- ther expand. In addition, we can work to maximize total ARPU in tandem with the expansion of both telecommunications
ARPU and value added ARPU by providing new experience value through further promoting the “integration of telecommu- nications and life design” as a basis for these robust trust- based relationships.
With the aim of enhancing engagement, KDDI will continue operating its businesses with the top priority of building trust- based relationships with customers by improving all points of contact with customers, such as a brilliant network, easy-to- use pricing plans, exciting content, and attractive devices.
 22 KDDI CORPORATION | INTEGRATED REPORT 2020

  Maximizing Group IDs and Enhancing Engagement
To build a robust ID base across the entire Group, KDDI pro- motes three specific initiatives to strengthen its momentum. First, [01] we stem outflow from the Group by leveraging the KDDI Group’s brands, including MVNO, for customers wanting to move from “au” to a budget smartphone. Then, [02] we max- imize Group IDs by more actively making new acquisitions from the highly liquid MVNO market while enhancing the competitive- ness of the KDDI Group brands, including MVNO.
Furthermore, [03] for customers who want to use large capacity telecommunications without stress, we aim to ensure the high quality telecommunications and experience value of “au,” establish a Group-wide circulatory structure by upselling to au, and further strengthening our momentum.
Furthermore, to accelerate these Group strategies, KDDI will integrate “UQ mobile” in October 2020. “UQ mobile” is already used by more than 2 million customers because it provides high-quality yet low-cost services. By creating a double brand with “UQ mobile,” we will first 1) reinforce our sales organization by reorganizing and integrating the nationwide sales organiza- tions and sales channels for “au” and “UQ mobile.” In addition, we will 2) leverage the unique characteristics of both brands to provide easy-to-understand pricing plans that meet customer needs and thereby offer new value. And, finally, we will 3) streamline overlapping tasks and operations with the aim of strengthening our competitiveness through the consolidation of the Group’s management resources.
Aiming to Further Expand Our Growth Area
Deepening engagement with customers while expanding our points of contact will also help further expand our Life Design Domain, which is a growth fields for KDDI.
First, regarding customers who use the KDDI Group’s tele- communications services, we aim to maximize total ARPU mainly by promoting rich content with the shift to 5G while expanding Group IDs, which form our foundation.
In addition, going forward, with a foothold in our alliance with Ponta, which is an open platform, we will continue reinforcing our approach toward new points of contact with customers. Specifically, we want customers to feel the merit of using KDDI’s value added services by using payments and points with the aim of enhancing engagement through “au PAY” and other services, leading to further expansion in growth fields.

Our Future 2: “au PAY” Targets Leading the Way on Going Cashless
By offering “au PAY” smartphone payments, KDDI expands contact with customers and is working to build robust, long-term engagement with customers by using various life design services.
In addition, we aim to continue evolving our services mainly by integrating au WALLET Points into Ponta Points and collaborating with various financial services.
KDDI’s Initiatives in the Settlement and Financial Fields
Smartphones have become an essential tool in people’s lives now. In today’s “smartphone-centric” world, people can conduct and manage settlement and financial services with their smartphone.
KDDI has spearheaded initiatives in the settlement and finance fields ahead of industry peers. Examples include starting Jibun Bank for internet banking specialized for mobile phones in 2008 and developing “au WALLET” as a new settlement function that earns points and can be used at brick-and-mortar stores in addition to online stores thanks to the electronic money card connected with “au ID” in 2014.
Then in 2019, we launched the Smart Money Concept to comprehensively provide “smartphone-centric” settlement and financial experiences to customers with the “au PAY” app serving as an entry point to various services, namely deposits, settle- ments, investments, loans, and insurance. In addition, to realize this concept, we founded au Financial Holdings.

KDDI’s “au PAY” Smartphone Payments
In Japan, the government is promoting cashless payments with a 2025 goal of having 40% of settlements being cashless. In line with this, the market for smartphone payments is significantly expanding due in part to ad campaigns rolled out by telecom- munication companies.
In April 2019, we started smartphone payments using bar- codes and QR codes under the name “au PAY.” As of March 31, 2020, membership rose to 23.5 million with 1.9 million locations where customers can use points and smartphone payments. Our number of members, payment users, participating retailers, and transaction volume are steadily expanding.
Helping Enhance “au” Engagement
One reason KDDI focuses on “au PAY” is to help enhance cus- tomer engagement.
Analyzing the last few years, we see a correlation: the more contact we have with customers, the higher NPS*1 rises. In addition, we discovered that of the numerous life design services we have, “au PAY,” which is used daily by customers, had a particularly large effect.
At au shops, contact with customers is limited to the handset purchase cycle, which is usually once every two or three years. But by expanding services, including the “au PAY” app, “au PAY” card, and “au PAY” market (online shopping mall), we are able to have daily contact with customers.
Furthermore, we aim to build robust, long-term engagement with customers by using tie-up services with long-term con- tracts, such as “au Denki” and financial services, becoming an indispensable part of customers’ lives.

Helping Expand the “au Economic Zone”
Ponta Points (formerly “au WALLET” Points) are given to cus- tomers when they pay “au” telecommunications fees and use “au” services, such as “au PAY” or “au PAY” card.
KDDI is building an ecosystem where points circulate within the “au Economic Zone” by setting up the “au PAY” market as a place to use saved up points.
Going forward, we aim to create a more virtuous cycle for points and maximize the “au Economic Zone” by focusing on “au PAY” to promote the use and charging of “au PAY” card and giving bargains to customers who use saved up points at “au PAY” market.
Use of saved up points
Use and charging of “au PAY” card
Two Initiatives to Expand “au PAY” Contact Points
Carrying Out the “Anybody! Can Get ¥1 Billion Per Week! Campaign”
To raise awareness of “au PAY,” over a seven-week period from February 2020, we carried out a campaign to award “au WALLET” Points equivalent to a maximum of 20% of settlement amounts. That had a significant effect, greatly helping to enhance the presence of “au PAY,” such as by significantly raising aware- ness and getting many non-“au” customers to sign up.
Creating New Contact Points by Integrating Ponta Points
In May 2020, we integrated “au WALLET” Points into Ponta Points, creating a point member base of over 100 million, one of the largest in Japan.
With this member base as a foundation, we combined both groups’ assets, such as KDDI’s advanced technologies and around 14,500 Lawson stores,*2 to continue providing new experience value to customers. In addition, with a foothold in the Ponta open platform alliance, we aim to expand contact with non-“au” customers and further expand transaction volume of settlement and loan.

We will continue connecting “au PAY” to the various settlement and financial services held by the KDDI Group.
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, transaction volume of settlement and loan*4 exceeded ¥6.5 trillion. Going forward, we aim to expand earnings and expand circulation between financial services in part by connecting “au PAY” to the use of securities services from banks and banking services from credit cards.

  2. Upgrading the environment in three layers
To realize KDDI Accelerate 5.0, we will upgrade the environment in three layers.
1. Network Layer:
The network layer forms the base of a new social foundation. To engrain 5G in Japanese society and industry, we need to quickly roll out highly reliable networks based on the latest tech- nologies across the country.
KDDI will introduce the technologies of overseas companies to maintain Japan’s international competitiveness and will lead efforts to adopt world-class advanced technologies in Japan. In addition, KDDI will accelerate the nationwide rollout of its 5G network mainly through proactive forward-looking investments and infrastructure sharing in rural areas.
2. Platform Layer:
The platform layer is built on top of the network layer. It creates unprecedented new value by using cyber spaces to analyze
data collected from physical spaces and to then provide feed- back on forecast results in physical spaces. KDDI will upgrade the open platform of advanced technologies for each industry in Japan through domestic collaboration with Japan’s corporate platforms and venture companies while integrating its 5G network and the advanced cloud technologies of global IT companies.
3. Business Layer:
The business layer is positioned on top of resilient networks and open platforms to create new services and solutions. By inte- grating cyber and physical spaces through open innovation with companies in other industries, we aim to enhance engagement with customers, evolve into a resilient business model. KDDI will accelerate Society 5.0 with the aim of creating economic growth in Japan, as well as an even brighter society for the future.

economic growth in Japan and an even brighter society, burst- ing with vitality, for the future. Against this social backdrop, we put together KDDI Accelerate 5.0 with the aim of contributing to the era of the new normal by actively working to build networks and platforms and to create business models.

  1. Network Layer
   To accelerate Society 5.0, technology evolution is required to further accelerate the integration of physical spaces, where real people and things exist, and cyber spaces, which are the world of computers.
Data is collected from physical spaces, analyzed in cyber spaces, and then fed back into physical spaces again.
This cycle is supported by technologies in seven fields and close collaboration (orchestration) between those technologies.
Technologies in Seven Fields that Support KDDI Accelerate 5.0
The seven technologies refer to network, security, IoT, platforms, AI, XR, and robotics.
Networks connect physical and cyber spaces, and security ensures the safety of both spaces.
IoT sends information collected from physical spaces to cyber spaces. Information accumulated on platforms in cyber space is analyzed by AI, which then provides guidance on how to utilize it in physical spaces.
XR and robotics enable the use of this information in physical spaces. XR makes use of human senses, and robotics physically animates drones and robots.
Repeating these cycles will increasingly optimize social and economic activities.
The proliferation of 5G service will drive the integration of physical and cyber spaces. And when we enter the beyond 5G era, the feedback from cyber spaces to physical spaces will be enhanced. These kinds of changes are being accelerated by research such as AI, XR and robotics that spur changes in human behavior; and the Life Design Business platform that KDDI is promoting.

KDDI’s Sustainability
Under the KDDI Group Mission Statement of “achieving a truly connected society,” KDDI works to solve social issues as an infrastructure company that underpins the information that serves as the basis for society.
Minoru Tanaka Executive Officer of Sustainability
                  In May 2020, KDDI formulated “KDDI Sustainable Action”— KDDI’s initiatives for the SDGs aimed at 2030. In consider- ation of the social issues and the business sectors KDDI can contribute to as a telecommunications operator, we revised KDDI’s target SDGs, which were linked with the medium-term management plan, into eight social fields.
Of the sustainability activities that form the foundation of these initiatives, I will go over our policies on governance, environmental measures, human resources, and human rights in this section.
Governance
By proactively adhering to the Corporate Governance Code and practicing the KDDI Group Philosophy, the foundation of its corporate activities, KDDI endeavors to strengthen corpo- rate governance of all Group companies. In addition, KDDI directly holds meetings with investors on the topics of gover- nance and sustainability as a part of its proactive approach to reflect the voices of our stakeholders in management.
Environmental Measures
With movements to address environmental issues acceler- ating, as demonstrated by the Paris Agreement and the TCFD, specific action plans are urgently needed in Japan to realize a society with zero CO2 emissions. Through our core information communications operations, we contribute to improvements in work efficiency and reductions in the movement of people, helping to reduce CO2 in society and reign in climate change. However, these benefits are coun- tered by the rather large environmental impact caused by telecommunications equipment. Even considering that situ- ation, KDDI formulated the KDDI GREEN PLAN 2017-2030 (in 2017) as well as KDDI Sustainable Action, declaring it will lower the environmental burden of society using ICT with the aim of achieving zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
Human Resources
As the productive population declines in Japan, it is imper- ative that companies provide attractive work environments that enable diverse work styles (times, places, employment types, etc.) so that employees can use their various skills to the fullest, with the ultimate aim of sustaining their growth as businesses and contributing to society. KDDI will continue to promote respect for diversity and work to accommodate various personalities and abilities in its organization. We launched KDDI LEARNING CORPORATION in April 2019 and the learning facility LINK FOREST complex in April 2020. In addition, in April 2018, KDDI announced the KDDI Group Declaration of Health-Focused Management in a message from the President, and then created the Work Style Reform & Health Management Department in January 2019 as an organization focusing on health management. By promoting health management, we aim to establish a “health first” culture that fosters improvements in employee vitality and productivity.
Human Rights
As part of the ICT industry, we face many potential human rights issues, including rights to privacy and freedom of expression, as well as requests from government authorities to disclose customer data for legitimate purposes. We will continue our efforts to identify and address human rights issues in our business activities while furthering understanding among employees of the KDDI Code of Business Conduct and the KDDI Group Human Rights Policy. In March 2020, we conducted human rights due diligence, and we will continue to highlight risks and opportunities in all of KDDI’s businesses, take appropriate action, and continually monitor the effectiveness of those actions to improve even more.
Going forward, we will continue contributing to the sus- tainable growth of society and working to solve social issues unique to Japan and the SDGs while highly valuing communication with our stakeholders.

KDDI Sustainable Action Initiatives
In May 2020, KDDI formulated “KDDI Sustainable Action: Our power to make connections will help create a brighter future for all”—KDDI’s initiatives for the SDGs aimed at 2030 with a determination to continue working to solve various social issues through business going forward.
We analyzed the social issues for 2030 and the sectors where KDDI should focus given its business environment. In consideration of the social issues and the business sectors KDDI can contribute to as a telecommunications operator, we selected eight social issue fields and set targets for 2030.
Below, we describe our initiatives for eight issues.
1. Building a resilient infrastructure for communication and disaster response
Building resilient infrastructure for communications and working to swiftly recover from disasters
2. Conserving the environment
Improving energy efficiency and achieving zero emissions
             Connecting and protecting lives
    Yukiko Habu
Deputy General Manager, Operations Management Department
Operations Division, Technology Sector
KDDI is aiming to enhance mobile telecommunications quality and realize a society that can fully utilize high-quality telecommunications by providing reliable fixed-line and internet services. In the Operations Division, we will continue working together to monitor network operations to enable the provision of telecommunications as a lifeline during natural disasters.
Effects from COVID-19 have driven an increase in teleworking and other data use, along with rapid changes in telecommunications use in Japan. Although overall telecommunications traffic volume has not been affected, daytime fixed-line telecommunications traffic has increased by up to 63%. KDDI has therefore swiftly taken measures to maintain the telecommunications environment. In addition, we fulfilled our social responsibility as a telecommunications operator by working to safely provide a telecommuni- cations environment to the many passengers, crew members, and health care providers on the large cruise ship that arrived in the Port of Yokohama in February 2020.
Going forward, we will continue helping every day to build safe and secure social foundations through telecommunications.

As a KDDI Sustainable Action initiative, KDDI proclaimed its aim of zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Because our businesses possess large-scale infrastructure, we need to ensure both environmental pro- tection and sustainable business operations.
To achieve these dual goals, we must conduct a full-scale review of our energy consumption and take measures to deploy new technologies. We have been working to reduce electric power use by installing an efficient air-conditioning control system and a more efficient interflow and direct flow transformer in 2019. Furthermore, we have begun to consider using fuel cell batteries and installing new energy-efficient air-conditioning technology. In addition, as a medium- to long-term initiative, we review power distribution technology and develop power storage technology. Going forward, we will continue these unceasing efforts to help reduce CO2 emissions for society as a whole.

In Japan, due to the declining population and urban centralization, the issue of regional depopulation will continue to get worse going forward. To address this issue, we at KDDI will continue to help create a society where everyone can live a full life, free of inequality, and regardless of place of residence, through telecommunications.
From March 2020, we began fully offering 5G commercial services. I think we can leverage the char- acteristics of 5G, namely high speed, low latency, and multiple connections, in various fields including remote healthcare and education, agriculture, industry, and smart cities. To build the foundation for this, we began providing 5G commercial services in major cities across Japan from summer 2020, and we aim to offer 5G commercial services in every prefecture by March 2021.
Through the adoption of 5G, we will continue helping to realize a new society that solves the issues confronting rural areas.

Mainly in developing countries in Asia, KDDI is working to help develop industry by pro- viding inexpensive high-quality telecommunications services and upgrading telecom- munications infrastructure with the aim of ensuring there are no residents living outside of our telecommunications area. In Myanmar, from 2014, we have worked to upgrade the telecommunications service environment through a joint business with Myanma Posts & Telecommunications (MPT) and Sumitomo Corporation, thereby contributing to the development of the country. As of March 31, 2020, MPT was No. 1 in market share.
In Mongolia, we have been operating the comprehensive communications carrier MobiCom Corporation LLC since its founding in 1995. Every year, the company is selected for the Top 100 Mongolian Companies, which are chosen by the Mongolian government and Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2019, the company was awarded 17th place, the highest placement among telecommunications providers, signaling a high evaluation.

Rural Japan is facing various social issues, such as a declining birthrate, aging population, declining pop- ulation, aging infrastructure, and increasing number of natural disasters. Attempts are being made to realize Society 5.0, which would help solve these issues through ICT. KDDI believes that to make these initiatives sustainable, we need to train the personnel, venture companies, and local companies that will take up the responsibility of solving these issues at the local level. To date, KDDI has worked with over 60 municipalities to solve problems, and the Company is collaborating with regional universities and technical colleges to promote corporate and human resources training for innovation, starting businesses, and DX, by leveraging its track record to date.
In addition, we established the KDDI Regional Initiatives Fund in April 2019 for regional revitalization by providing funding to training companies. Going forward, KDDI will continue to contribute to the sustain- able development of society by working to train human resources that will develop regional areas and shape the future.

In a society undergoing rapid digitization, a huge responsibility for telecommunications providers is to build a safer society where privacy and security are protected. With adoption of smartphones and cellphones widespread and increasingly younger people using them, KDDI respects UNICEF’s Convention on the Rights of the Child and has been offering the KDDI Smartphone and Mobile Phone Safety Classes at elementary, middle, and high schools across Japan since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. These classes provide children with the means to use their own judgment to avoid risks, enabling them to safely and securely use smartphones and mobile phones.
The cumulative number of classes held is around 33,000, with attendees exceeding 6,110,000. In addition, we hold courses for seniors to learn basic phone functions and ways to use phones safely and securely. These classes have reached a cumulative total of around 1,500, with approximately 27,000 attendees. Going forward, we will continue to carry out these initiatives aimed at building a safe, rich, digital society.

    Kaname Utsumi
Head of Diversity & Inclusion Department, Human Resources Planning Department Human Resources Division
KDDI declared “embracing diversity” as part of the KDDI Group Philosophy and is working to continue building an organization that leverages diversity.
To promote the advancement of women, we set a target of hiring 200 female line managers as of March 31, 2021, and are conducting various training, mentoring, and career design programs.
KDDI promotes the employment and advancement of people with disabilities. We maintained an employment rate of 2.53% for people with disabilities, which is above the legally mandated level, as of June 1, 2020, by establishing a special subsidiary to contract KDDI’s operations and expanding the range of activities, such as operating cafés at offices. We are also proactively working to quickly address LGBT issues. For example, the “au” Family Discount can also be applied to same-sex partners, and internal systems treat same-sex partners and their children as family members.
As an operator who has a public mission, we will continue helping realize a diverse and inclusive society by providing a work environment and services that respect diversity.

KDDI has undertaken work style reforms and health management as an important management issue for a long time. To further promote these initiatives, we established the Management Department as an organization dedicated to these causes in January 2019.
We are creating a company where all employees can stay healthy while achieving high performance by having a framework of around 40 internal counselors to conduct two annual interviews with every employee and asses their mental and physical health. With the spread of COVID-19, we formulated a basic policy based on the policies of KDDI Sustainable Action. The first of five items in the policy is “ensuring the safety of customers and employees of KDDI and its affiliates above all else.” To prevent the spread of infections, around 90% of KDDI employees are working from home.
Going forward, we will continue striving to be a company that contributes to the sustainable develop- ment of society and where employees thrive.

 Climate Change Initiatives
KDDI’s Approach (Low-Carbon Society)
Greenhouse gas emissions, which are the cause of global warming, are steadily increasing every year, and reducing emissions is an issue for the entire human race.
The use of ICT is expected to lead to more efficient oper- ations, including production and expenses, and help reduce the CO2 emissions of customers. On the other hand, due to concerns about a larger environmental burden from data centers and bases in line with the expanded use of ICT, the development and introduction of energy-efficient equipment and machines has become an issue.
KDDI will continue to help reduce CO2 emissions by providing new ICT services with the aim of realizing a low- carbon society.
Climate Change Risks and Opportunities
(1) Risks and Opportunities from Regulations
Among regulations and government policies in each country and region, there are some that impact the business activi- ties of companies, such as energy efficiency standards, car- bon taxes, and emission trading. KDDI believes that these regulations and policies could become a risk for business continuity and growth. We consider the response to these regulations to be an opportunity for business growth by building environmentally friendly bases and providing coun- tries and regions with services connected to reducing soci- ety’s environmental burden and energy efficiency using ICT. (2) Risks and Opportunities from Physical Impact
Larger typhoons and increased precipitation due to global warming have resulted in damage to various regions. Due to their impact on the Company’s telecommunications equipment, we recognize these natural disasters as risks to business continuity. On the other hand, demand has been increasing globally for measures to respond to these natural disasters. KDDI is working to expand business by promoting disaster countermeasures using ICT services, such as emergency response systems and disaster pre- vention systems.
(3) Other Risks and Opportunities
Insufficient response to climate change is a risk to business continuity and invites a deterioration in stakeholder trust and competitiveness in markets. KDDI has announced a long- term goal to mitigate climate change. Providing services that help lower environmental burden leads to an expansion of business and can contribute to Goal 7 (ensure access to sustainable energy for all) and Goal 13 (take specific action to combat climate change) of the SDGs.
Environmental Management
KDDI is currently carrying out its environmental conservation plan KDDI GREEN PLAN 2017-2030. This long-term plan runs until the fiscal year ended March 31, 2031 with the goal of achieving a 7% reduction in the Company’s CO2 emissions in comparison with the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. To achieve this goal, we are working to reduce CO2 emissions by using various reduction methods like renewable energy.
We discuss material issues related to the environment at the Sustainability Committee to demonstrate our position of promoting sustainability overall, including management and the environment. The President is the chair, and the Sustainability Department is the secretariat. The results of the discussions have been reflected in each organization’s goals and rolled out to each division and Group company through the Environmental Subcommittee, which is attend- ed by managers from each sector and Group company that have acquired ISO 14001. The Green Plan Subcommittee, which was established in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, assesses the progress towards the goals of KDDI GREEN PLAN 2017-2030 and promotes various activities.
Aiming for Zero CO2 Emissions by 2050
We strongly promote the shift to renewable energy, aim to achieve zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and reduce society’s environmental burden using ICT.

   Sustainability Report 2020
An overview of all KDDI’s sustainability activities is provided in the Sustainability Report 2020.

 In the two years that I have served as an outside director, KDDI has fulfilled diverse social missions, meeting society’s expectations as an information telecommunications industry leader that provides social infrastructure. Amid the current COVID-19 crisis and many natural disasters, KDDI has met its obligation to proactively engage in emergency activities. Management continues to make substantial investments to maintain information networks and develop advanced data telecommunications technologies. I evaluate these efforts and their consistency highly.
I participate in discussions with tremendous interest. I ini- tially thought a business model should leverage real world
Riyo Kano Outside Director and Independent Director
At KDDI’s Board of Directors meetings, the direction of cor- porate strategies, management issues, and action policies is shared among all directors. In particular, outside directors actively ask questions and provide opinions to enhance medium- to long-term corporate value, fulfilling the manage- ment monitoring function.
Amid this current COVID-19 crisis, KDDI’s businesses are growing in importance. I think that in all aspects of life, from business to leisure activities, people really feel that telecom- munications services are an indispensable lifeline. In addition, I feel the use of data owned by KDDI has played a large role in society mainly by helping prevent the spread of infection.
Shigeki Goto Outside Director and Independent Director
I have engaged in information telecommunications research over many years, and I consider it an honor to be appointed as an independent outside director at KDDI, which is at the center of the information and telecommunications industry.
As a species, humans excel; and yet a single human can only eke out a precarious existence. It was only through communication that humans were able to build society and elevate themselves. Information telecommunications serve as the neural network of modern society. Using 5G services to comprehensively integrate all information into society is expected to greatly benefit humanity.
Although the word innovation is often used to refer to
business experience in the healthcare and materials fields to raise the quality of social life. But KDDI is aiming to merge information telecommunications and daily life together through virtual spaces that enrich our future lives.
Going forward, more than ever, corporate activities will be expected to contribute to the sustainability of society and I think KDDI’s information telecommunications technol- ogies can really help solve such social issues as the declining birthrate, graying population, regional disparities, and envi- ronmental problems. As an outside director, I will continue working hard to participate in discussions while constantly improving myself.
Going forward, amid new lifestyles and an accelerating transformation of society, people want KDDI to fill a role that exceeds the expectations of society.
KDDI is developing comprehensive services, with telecom- munications at the core. To meet drastically changing social needs, swift and bold management decisions are needed in addition to steadfast efforts. As a member of the Board of Directors, which underpins those management decisions, I leverage the sense of balance and legal mind I have cultivated as a lawyer and speak from the position of being an “au” user when speaking at Board of Directors meetings.
technological revolution, Joseph Schumpeter defined it as “new combinations” in one of his early works. The telecom- munications services provided by KDDI are a two-way com- bination. By building a mechanism to circulate valuable information, it is possible to contribute to the growth and development of customers, industries, and society.
My first theme as a researcher was artificial intelligence technology. Afterward, in the internet field, I promoted related technology from Japan to the Asia Pacific region. And I have recently undertaken research in cyber security. I hope to make use of my experiences for KDDI while learning many new things.

         Basic Views on Corporate Governance
As a telecommunications operator that provides social infra- structure, the Company has the important social mission of providing stable communications services on an ongoing basis, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, regardless of conditions. Furthermore, as a telecommunications operator, our business derives from utilizing radio waves—an important asset shared by all citizens. Accordingly, we recognize that we have the social responsibility to address the issues society faces and seek to resolve them through telecommunications.
Attaining sustainable growth and increased corporate value over the medium to long term is essential to achieving this social mission and social responsibility. Furthermore, we strive to engage in dialogue with all our stakeholders, including cus- tomers, shareholders, business partners, employees, and local communities, and work in cooperation to proactively address societal issues. In this manner, we aim to contribute to the development of a safe, secure, and truly connected society.
We recognize reinforcing corporate governance as important to achieving sustainable growth and increased corporate value over the medium to long term. Accordingly, we are in accor- dance with the tenets of the “Corporate Governance Code” defined by the financial instruments exchanges. While maintain- ing transparency and fairness, we endeavor to enhance our structures for ensuring timely and decisive decision-making.
In addition to our corporate credo and mission statement, we have formulated the “KDDI Group Philosophy,” which defines
Changes in the Corporate Governance Framework

perspectives, values, and a code of conduct that officers and employees should share. We conduct activities to promote awareness of this philosophy throughout the Company.
By proactively adhering to Japan’s Corporate Governance Code and practicing the KDDI Group Philosophy, which we consider inseparable from the standpoint of corporate manage- ment, we will endeavor to enhance corporate governance throughout the KDDI Group, including its subsidiaries, to achieve sustainable growth and increased corporate value over the medium to long term.

                    At KDDI, Board of Directors resolutions determine:
• Matters prescribed by the Companies Act or other laws and regulations, • Matters prescribed by the Articles of Incorporation,
• Matters delegated for resolution at the general shareholder meeting, and • Other important management-related matters.
For other important management-related matters, their importance is determined according to such factors as the scale of money, busi- ness, assets, and investment involved.
The Board is composed of directors, including outside directors and independent outside directors. The Board of Directors reaches decisions on a variety of issues, including business plans and important matters outlined in laws and regulations. The Board also conducts supervision in an effort to ensure directors appropriately fulfill their work obligations.
2 Advisory Committees
KDDI has formed a Nomination Advisory Committee and a Remuneration Advisory Committee to discuss with and provide advice to the Board of Directors to maintain both transparency and fairness in the system of nomination of executive candidates and Audit & Supervisory Board member candidates and the level of remuneration for executives.
The Chairman, Vice Chairman and half or more of the members of these committees are outside directors.
3 Corporate Management Committee
Comprised of internal directors, executive officers and others, the Corporate Management Committee deliberates and decides on important matters related to business execution at the Company and its subsidiaries.
4 Audit & Supervisory Board / Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Audit & Supervisory Board members conduct their audit work based on audit policies and plans established by the Audit & Supervisory Board and carry out their work by attending meetings of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Management Committee, and other major internal meetings. The Audit & Supervisory Board receives reports on the audit methods of Audit & Supervisory Board members and their results, discusses them, and offers its opinions, as appropriate, at meetings of the Board of Directors.
5 Internal Audit
KDDI conducts periodic internal audits targeting all the operations of the Group, and regularly reviews the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal controls.
The results of these internal audits are reported to the president and the Audit & Supervisory Board members, along with recommendations for improvement and correction of any problems.

Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Objective of Board of Director Evaluations
To ensure a correct understanding of the current status of its Board of Directors and to work toward continuous improvement, KDDI has its Board of Directors conduct regular annual self-evaluations.
Overview of the Evaluation Process
KDDI verifies the effectiveness of its Board of Directors based on an evaluation by the directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board members. The evaluation is conducted in questionnaire form, combining a four-grade rating scale with free space for comments. This supports our efforts to validate the effectiveness of our initiatives and uncover any areas for improvement from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
The evaluation targets the most recent one-year period and is conducted regularly on an annual basis. The results are reported to the Board of Directors, which then considers future countermeasures.
Key items for evaluation are as listed below.
• Operation of the Board of Directors (including composition,
documentation and explanations, provision of information, etc.)
• Management supervision (including conflicts of interest, risk
management, and management of subsidiaries, etc.)
• Medium to long-term discussions (participation in medium- term management planning, monitoring of plan execution, etc.)
Overview of Evaluation Results
Summary
The Company’s Board of Directors was found to be managed appropriately and functioning effectively.
The following two points were found to be rated particularly highly.
• Deliberations are held with a focused list of agenda items with outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members actively asking questions with an awareness of
Our Future Our Governance Financial Information • Risk Management and Internal Controls • Disclosure and IR
sustainable growth and enhancement of medium- to long-
term corporate value.
• Reports are regularly made on the progress of medium-term
and annual plans and meaningful discussions are held regarding what should be done to achieve the goals.
Improvements over the Previous Evaluation
In the previous evaluation, one stated key issue was that “we will discuss the Company’s social mission and business strate- gies and what kind of company we want to be from various perspectives.” With this in mind, in 2019, we held discussions on our medium- and long-term business strategies, as well as our corporate culture, and outlined our Company Vision: Contributing to the sustainable growth of society. We also announced the social issues we would take up through our businesses and corporate activities.
Future Issues to be Addressed
To expand the size of our business, we will pursue multifaceted expansion into different industries and fields with the telecom- munications business at our core. At the same time, with the understanding that it is important to monitor subsidiaries in par- ticular to enhance the corporate value of the KDDI Group as a whole, we will continue to carry out timely and appropriate monitoring as a Group and consider better forms of supervision.
Decision Standards for Independence of Outside Executives
In addition to the requirements of outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members defined in the Companies Act and the independence standards provided by financial instru- ments exchanges, the Company has formulated its own stan- dards. Specifically, these standards state that people hailing from business partners making up 1% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales or orders placed are not independent. Other matters are given individual consideration depending on circumstances.

Support for Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
In addition to notifying outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members in advance of the schedule and agenda for meetings of the Board of Directors, proposal materi- als are also distributed prior to the meetings to encourage understanding of the agenda items and invigorate discussion at the meetings. Questions are also accepted in advance and are used to enhance explanations on the day of the meeting, in an effort to provide for deepening more substantial deliberations.
Outside of the Board of Directors meetings, we also provide updates on the status of business strategy, management, R&D, and technology.
Regarding business outlines, the heads and general manag- ers of each business headquarters explain the overall picture and issues in detail, and the management status of subsidiaries is regularly reported. We also have opportunities to inspect sites such as in-house exhibitions of research and development results, telecommunication facilities, and monitoring and main- tenance centers. In addition, we report twice a year on corporate ethics and risk management activities.
In order for outside directors to maintain their independence and strengthen their ability to collect information, collaboration with auditors has been strengthened, and regular liaison meet- ings between outside directors and auditors have been held. Auditors also explain audit results to outside directors.
In addition, in order to strengthen information exchange and information sharing among outside directors, we hold liaison

Through these efforts, we are deepening our understanding of KDDI’s business, thereby invigorating discussions on man- agement strategies at the Board of Directors and improving the effectiveness of management supervision and monitoring.
On April 1, 2006, KDDI established the Auditing Office to support Audit & Supervisory Board members, including outside members.
Policy on Strategic Shareholdings
KDDI believes that participating in tie-ups with a variety of com- panies is essential to providing our customers with increasingly diverse and advanced services.
KDDI possesses strategic shareholdings if such possession will contribute to the sustainable growth of KDDI’s business and the medium- to long-term increase of corporate value.
Every year, the Board of Directors reviews all the pros and cons of continuing the possession of each individual strategic holding by judging its significance and economic rationale. When a strategic shareholding is found to have only tenuous significance, we will sell as promptly as possible.
The Company calculates the ratio of the contribution by the issuing company to the Company’s profits within the most recent fiscal year. The economic rationale is verified by comparing the ratio with the valuation of each strategic shareholding at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and confirming whether the ratio satisfies the capital cost standard established by the Company.

Reference: Performance-linked stock compensation and stock price-linked bonuses
Performance-linked stock compensation was introduced from 2015 for the compensation of directors engaged in business execution in order to increase the willingness to contribute to medium- to long-term performance improvement and corporate value improvement.
In addition, from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Company introduced “stock price-linked bonuses” with the aim of providing a strong incentive to achieve medium-term management plan targets, and increasing the linkage between remuneration for Directors and the stock price. In this system, “EPS* growth rate,” which was set as a target figure for the medium-term management plan, and “stock price change rate,” which is directly linked to changes in share price, are used as performance indicators.

Results of Remuneration Advisory Committee Meeting (FY2020.3)
• The Remuneration Advisory Committee met three times, and all members attended.
• They discussed the amount of performance-linked compensation provided in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the fairness of the level of com-
pensation for the Company’s directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, and the general outline of the stock price-linked bonus system.
   Introduction of Stock Price-Linked Bonuses (Activities of the Remuneration Advisory Committee)
As the outside director chairing the Remuneration Advisory Committee, I submit this report.
The committee deliberates general compensation for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Remuneration Advisory Committee met three times and conducted deliberations related to compensation systems for directors suited to KDDI from various perspectives. As a result, we were able to propose the introduction of stock price-linked bonuses. A general outline of that debate follows.
1. Level of compensation for KDDI’s directors
First, regarding the level of compensation for KDDI’s directors, we assessed whether it was commensurate with the expectations and responsibilities of directors and whether it was fair in comparison with the benchmark group of companies while referencing objective survey data from external specialist organizations. We also deliberated about the appropriate level. As a result, based mainly on comparisons with other companies of similar size and in the same industry in Japan, we advised that compensation be revised to a composition that is appropriate for the work duties of directors who are responsible for executing business in response to a mandate from shareholders.
2. Composition of compensation for KDDI’s directors and selection of KPIs
Compensation for KDDI’s directors had been composed of basic compensation, performance-linked bonuses, and performance-linked stock compensation. When revising the composition, we considered it from the direction of introducing a new compensation system that is more directly linked to the stock price and enhancement of medium- to long-term corporate value.
As a result, we advised adopting the
following two KPIs.
(1) EPS growth rate
In the medium-term management plan,
we target growth of 1.5 times in EPS by
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025,
compared with the level in the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2019. We established
an indicator of year-on-year EPS growth
rate as an incentive to support the
achievement of this plan.
(2) Stock price change rate
We established the indicator of stock price change rate to incorporate market evaluations of operating results and corporate activities and enhance the connection with stock price. Furthermore, “stock change rate” means relative evaluation with the TOPIX growth rate, not the change rate of KDDI’s stock price. In this way, we can make fair evaluations based on overall changes in the stock market.
This is how we introduced stock price-linked bonuses with the aim of strongly motivating achievement of the medium-term management plan goals and enhancing the connection between stock price and compensation for directors.
I believe the mission of this committee is to consider forms of compensation that are connected with sustainably enhancing corpo- rate value over the medium to long term. We will continue to contribute to the sustainable growth of the KDDI Group.

  Compliance
Compliance Policy
We recognize that in order to fulfill our social responsibilities through our business activities, raising compliance awareness throughout the Group is a fundamental issue of corporate management.
As a global corporate group, we continue to further enforce our group-wide compliance framework.
KDDI Group Compliance and Enforcement Framework
We created the KDDI Code of Business Conduct to support ethical behavior and ensure that every employee cultivates a compliance mindset. To ensure that the Code is shared and practiced, it is published on the intranet enabling employees to check it whenever they are unsure what action to take.
Also, we established the KDDI Group Business Ethics Committee as a decision-making body for KDDI Group’s compliance related matters. The committee holds a meeting once every half-year, and in addition to assessing the conditions of Group companies, it builds and supports enhancement of compliance frameworks. The committee is also responsible for helpline issues, corruption prevention and compliance issues such as breaches of competition laws.
In addition, the report on their activities is made available to all employees via the intranet.
KDDI Group Compliance and Enforcement Framework
The KDDI Group Business Ethics Committee conducts investi- gation of the issues reported as required while protecting priva- cy, and when the problems are detected, the committee members as well as the management team and the Audit & Supervisory Board members receive the report and take cor- rective actions along with measures to prevent recurrence.

Preventing Anti-Competitive Behaviors
The KDDI Code of Business Conduct defines rules that prohibit anti-competitive behaviors, and we make efforts to ensure that all employees comply with competition laws.
In addition to competition laws, we stipulate that local laws and regulations in each country and region on labor, tax, the environment, monopoly and consumer protection must be examined thoroughly to ensure full compliance.
Under the KDDI Guidelines for CSR in Supply Chain, we demand our business partners not engage in any activities that inhibit fairness, transparency or freedom of competition. However, in March 2020, KDDI and UQ Communications became subject to administrative guidance issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications as their sales agencies were alleged to engage in improper sales practices involving excessive price discounts on cellular phone terminals in violation of upper limits stipulated by the Telecommunications Business Act. In line with this administrative guidance, the ministry demanded that thoroughgoing measures, including the provision of proper instructions to agencies, be taken to prevent recurrences.
In response, we are currently undertaking such initiatives as providing all agencies with follow-up explanation of the revised Telecommunications Business Act, implementing online training for agency staff, and mandating that agencies appoint manag- ers in charge of compliance with legal guidelines.
Excepting the issues reported above, there were no legal actions against us concerning anticompetitive or monopolistic conduct in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We will fully adhere to relevant regulations and continue appropriate busi- ness operations.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we received 469 reports and inquiries, but there were no reports of serious issues that lead to disciplinary action or require external announcement.

         Risk Management and Internal Controls
In the ever changing business environment, the panies face are more diverse and complicated. We define factors and events that negatively
achievement of our business goals as risks and
enforcing risk management a material business
order to be sustainable and responsible to society, we promote risk management initiatives throughout the KDDI Group.
Our Risk Management and Internal Control
We have established a system to centralize the management of risks, which we define as factors that have the potential to block the achievement of our business goals, with the Corporate Risk Management Division at the core.
Furthermore, we are working to promote risk management throughout the KDDI Group, including subsidiaries, in order to realize continuous growth of the entire Group.
We have appointed 28 Internal Control System Managers within KDDI and 44 at Group companies, as well as 6 Internal Control System Directors to oversee their activities. Under their leadership, we introduce and run internal control systems, car- rying out risk management activities, and run operational quality improvement activities to foster a company culture in which risks are less likely to arise.
Risk Management Activity Cycle
In order to prevent critical events for the Company, we at KDDI consider that it is important to recognize signs of danger and implement preventive measures before the situation worsens. Based on this idea, we follow the PDCA cycle for risk manage- ment. We also have an organizational framework for risk man- agement in place to ensure any risks we find will be addressed promptly and appropriately.

We regularly examine information about risks to identify significant risks that seriously influence corporate business, and discuss measures to reduce such risks and their impacts as much as possible in case we face them. In order to ensure the achieve- ment of our business goals, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we selected 25 significant risks based on issues that manifested in the past and changes in the business environment, and held internal audits based around risk prediction, reduction of significant risks, as well as risk approach. The selected signif- icant risks include cyberattacks, which are becoming increas- ingly complex, global businesses and issues relating to new business fields we are entering such as e-commerce, finance and accounting, and energy, which aim to make the Integration of Telecommunications and Life Design a reality. We have also identified risks arising from the expansion of the Group through M&A as significant risks and have implemented more robust measures against them.
In order to minimize information security risks, we have also established a common standard applicable group-wide to improve the level of information security across the Group including newly joined Group companies.
The status of these significant risks is also reflected on busi- ness risks that are revealed in the Securities Report* since it relates to finance as well. *Japanese only

    Disclosure and IR
Fundamental Thinking
The Company is fully committed to undertaking fair and timely disclosure in an easily understandable manner of any informa- tion that could have a material bearing on the investment deci- sions of investors. Such disclosure is conducted on an ongoing basis, and is focused on the requirements of shareholders and investors. The Company’s policy in this regard is in line with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and the Securities Listing Regulations of Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. governing the timely disclosure of information concerning the issuers of publicly listed securities. KDDI discloses its IR Basic Policy* on its website, explaining such matters as fundamental thinking regarding IR activities and the system for disclosing pertinent information. In particular, KDDI has set up a Disclosure Committee that concentrates on determining what information should be disclosed with the goal of improving business trans- parency and supplying appropriate information to the public.

Earnings presentation meetings were held quarterly to allow management to directly communicate the Company’s results. KDDI also held individual and small group meetings with investors
from Japan and overseas, and participated in various confer- ences and seminars for individual investors sponsored by securities companies for better communication.
KDDI takes the opinions expressed by shareholders and investors seriously, communicating them not only to manage- ment but also to employees in general. Such opinions are considered an extremely valuable reference in the formation of business and management strategies.

Mobile Communications Subscriptions
As of March 31, 2020, cumulative mobile communications sub- scriptions in Japan totaled 184.80 million,*1 up 4.0% year on year. The mobile market continues to grow, driven by the spread of smartphones, further advances in the trend of single users owning multiple devices, and increased use in business, including IoT.
Of this total, the KDDI Group’s share expanded 0.7 points year on year to 31.7%*2 (around 58.64 million contracts).
There has also been continued growth in the number of service contracts for MVNO,*3 up 14.7% from a year earlier to 24.65 million.*1 The percentage of SIM card-based contracts reached 10%.*4

   non-telecommunications business fields, including in settlement, finance, and commerce, to secure new sources of income.
Of these fields, the market for smartphone payments is expanding significantly. To achieve the 40% cashless payment ratio targeted by the government by 2025, we carried out a campaign to give points (cashless point provision business, October 2019 to June 2020), which became a tailwind.
In April 2019, KDDI began smartphone payment services under the name “au PAY.” These services are expanding steadily as demonstrated by members exceeding 23.50 million and point-accepting locations surpassing 1.90 million as of March 31, 2020.

 In addition, KDDI will continue providing new experience value to customers through “the integration of telecommunica- tions and life design” by developing the life design business with concentric rings entailing commerce, finance, energy, entertainment, and education, around a core of the domestic telecommunications business and its customer base.
Furthermore, we aim to achieve sustainable growth in Japan and overseas by leveraging the knowhow we cultivated in Japan mainly in the consumer business in Myanmar and Mongolia.
Fixed-Line Telecommunications Business Domain
As of March 31, 2020, the number of fixed-line broadband subscriptions was up 2.4% year on year to 41.20 million.*1
The market for fixed-line broadband service continues to expand gradually, driven by sales of discount bundled mobile and fixed-line services and the opening of new markets by new operators using the wholesaling fiber access service of NTT East and NTT West. In addition, we expect the fixed-line broadband service business to remain firm due in part to increased demand, including for telework, remote learning, and video streaming, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The number of KDDI’s domestic broadband subscriptions (FTTH subscriptions + CATV services for RGU households) slightly increased at 10.11 million, up 1.9% year on year.
By cross-selling FTTH and CATV to the au and the Group’s MVNO services, we expect the KDDI Group customer base to continue growing stronger and expanding.

         Market Conditions for Corporate Customer Businesses
To avoid economic losses due to a shortage of IT personnel and the increase in legacy systems, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry released the Guidelines for Promoting Digital Transformations in December 2018, and initiatives to promote DX are being advanced across Japan.
Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of size, all companies (small, medium, and large) are expected to further accelerate DX going forward. KDDI will continue helping customers realize DX while working with diverse partner com- panies and providing next-generation technologies, such as 5G, IoT, and AI.

     The decline in handset sales revenue was offset by an increase in total ARPA revenue, MVNO revenue, and the consolidation impact of ENERES and Jibun Bank, as well as Business Services segment revenue. As a result, operating revenue grew 3.1% year on year to ¥5,237.2 billion.
Operating Income
Up 1.1%
Higher income in the growth fields of Life Design Domain and
Business Services segment offset the decline in income brought about mainly by temporary factors that reduced profit in the first half, impairment losses focused on COVID-19, and costs expended for sustainable growth. As a result, operating income rose 1.1% to ¥1,025.2 billion.
Furthermore, both the Life Design Domain and the Business Services segment saw income increase more than 20% year on year.

YOY Up 3.6% ¥639.8 billion
Profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent increased 3.6% year on year to ¥639.8 billion, reflecting growth in operat- ing income and a decline in non-controlling interests, despite an increase in income tax due to increase in profit before income tax.

Total Assets

Total assets were ¥9,580.1 billion, an increase of ¥2,249.7 billion
from the previous fiscal year-end. The increase reflects greater assets in the financial business after making Jibun Bank a sub- sidiary, increased right-of-use assets in accordance with the adoption of IFRS No. 16, and growth in receivables due to the diversification of installment sales methods for au mobile phone handsets.
Total Equity
Up ¥246.2 billion
Total equity was ¥4,859.1 billion, up ¥246.2 billion, mainly due
to an increase in retained earnings associated with the increase in profit and an increase in non-controlling interests, which out- weighed the transfer of capital surplus from retained earnings and cancellation of treasury stock in May 2019.

     Free cash flows amounted to ¥712.4 billion, up ¥397.4 billion from the previous fiscal year due mainly to a decrease in au handset inventory and a smaller increase in receivables from installment sales in addition to an increase in revenue after making Jibun Bank a sub- sidiary and higher EBITDA following the adoption of IFRS No. 16.
Net cash provided by operating activities was ¥1,323.4 billion, ¥293.7 billion more than in the previous fiscal year. The increase mainly reflects an increase in trade and other receivables and the effects of adopting IFRS No. 16, despite increased outflows from the financial business.
Meanwhile, net cash used in investing activities was ¥611.0 billion, ¥103.6 billion lower than in the previous fiscal year. The decrease mainly reflects an increase in proceeds from acquiring control of subsidiaries and an increase in proceeds from the financial business, despite an increase in outflows due to acquir- ing shares of affiliates and an expansion in capital expenditures.

Personal Services Segment (Years ended March 31)
The Personal Services segment provides services to individual customers.
In Japan, KDDI aims to provide new experience value by expanding and coordinating various life design
services, including those related to commerce, finance, entertainment, and education, while focusing on conventional telecommunications services, chiefly under the "au" brand, such as those related to smartphones, cell phones, FTTH, and CATV.
Overseas, we use know-how cultivated in Japan to actively engage in business with individual customers, especially those in Myanmar, Mongolia, and other Asian regions.
Overview of Operations in the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2020
Operating revenue increased 3.3% year on year to ¥4,568.0 billion. A decrease in mobile handset revenue was offset mainly by higher revenue from “au” total ARPA*1 and MVNOs and the effects of consolidating ENERES and Jibun Bank.
Operating income fell 1.3% year on year to ¥872.7 billion, due mainly to expenses incurred for sustainable growth and
temporary factors suppressing profit*2 in the first half despite a 22.4% year-on-year increase in operating income in the life design domain that exceeded initial forecasts.

We expect au total ARPA to continue expanding from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 onward driven mainly by “au Denki” ARPA and value-added ARPA.

au Churn Rate
The au churn rate increased in the first half due to a temporary surge in demand ahead of a consumption tax hike and the amendment of the Telecommunication Business Act in October 2019, but the rate fell significantly in the second half as the overall liquidity of the market declined. As a result, the full-year rate was 0.72%, down 0.04 percentage points year on year.
To reduce the au churn rate, KDDI continues to enhance engagement with customers.

Launch of “UNLIMITED WORLD au 5G”
In July 2019, KDDI began offering the smartphone pricing plan “au Data MAX Plan.”*1 The plan has been well received as Japan’s first*2 unlimited monthly data plan,*3 and the percentage of people signed up for this and other high-volume data plans is steadily growing. In addition, we began offering the Kaetoku Program in February 2020 with the aim of making it easier to get the latest smartphones. This is the first fixed residual value smartphone purchasing program offered by a telecommunica- tions carrier in Japan.*4
In this way, KDDI is steadily moving ahead with revisions to its pricing schemes for the 5G era.

Alliance with OTT Services in the 5G Era
For “au,” KDDI offers many unique original plans that combine data telecommunications and entertainment content.
In March 2020, we announced we would offer the Data MAX 5G ALL STAR Pack from June 2020, pairing unlimited data*3 with popular entertainment content (Netflix (basic plan), Apple Music, YouTube Premium, and TELASA).

This is a plan that only KDDI can offer because the Company has garnered attention in the life design domain since early on, steadily building good relationships with over-the-top (OTT) media services.
KDDI can offer customers an attractive service lineup, and “au” acts as the distributor for OTT services. By pairing OTT services with “au” telecommunications plans, which have a churn rate of less than 1%, customers can use these services for the long haul, making these plans a win-win for us both.
KDDI will continue working hard with our various partners to
develop and offer services that meet customer needs.
*1 The offering of this plan ended on September 30, 2019. The “au data MAX Plan-Netfix Pack” and the “au data MAX Plan Pro” were launched on September 13, 2019 and November 1, 2019 respectively.
*2 The first pricing plan for 4G LTE smartphones implemented by a Japanese MNO, based on KDDI’s own research, as of July 23, 2019.
*3 There are limits on data volumes for tethering and other functions. There are telecommunications speed restrictions for high-traffic times, video services, streaming services, and more.

Then, in March 2020, KDDI began offering “au 5G’ commercial services in some areas of 15 prefectures across Japan.
The four 5G smartphone pricing plans we offered with the launch of “au 5G” were ¥1,000 more expensive than similar 4G plans (however, we had a promotional offer that discounted ¥1,000 from the monthly fee for 25 months from the month of signing up), and we anticipate an expansion in medium-term Total ARPU.
In addition, we will continue promoting 5G with all our strength, such as by steadily launching sales of a wide lineup of seven devices, including high-spec models that have 8K high-quality cameras and mid-range ones with selective functions.

Creating New Experience Value
The Shibuya 5G Entertainment Project was launched in January 2020 to create new experience value for the 5G era. The project consists of KDDI, Future Design Shibuya, the Shibuya City Tourism Association and 50 other participating companies. In addition, in March 2020, we announced the launch of the video streaming platform TELASA with our joint venture partner, TV Asahi Corporation, and the start of au 5G LIVE, a service that enhances the concert-viewing experience. We will continue accelerating augmented experiences in various domains using 5G and XR technologies.
Virtual Shibuya
In April 2019, KDDI consolidated Jibun Bank to further strengthen cooperation with the financial business.
In addition, from February 2020 we integrated our settlement and commerce services under the “au PAY” brand. In February and March, we held a promotional campaign to raise aware- ness of “au PAY,” in which we gave away up to ¥1,000,000,000 per week.
The campaign had a large effect. “au PAY” memberships grew from 22.40 million to 23.50 million, and many non-“au” customers signed up.
KDDI is actively working to promote use of “au PAY” by posi- tioning it as a super app that increases contact with customers.
Furthermore, in December 2019, we finished reorganizing the financial business within the Group.*5 We are further accel- erating the smart money concept as a financial group that has consolidated securities, life insurance, other types of insurance, banking, settlement, and asset management.
Through these efforts, the Group’s transaction volume of set- tlement and finance exceeded ¥6.5 trillion in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, and we were able to achieve our medium-term targets ahead of schedule. We will continue expanding conve- nient financial services that can be used on smartphones and meeting various financial needs through “au PAY.”
*5 au Financial Holdings Corporation now holds shares in au Kabucom Securities Co., Ltd., au Insurance Co., Ltd., and Lifenet Insurance Company formerly held directly by KDDI.
Expanding the Global Business
The Myanmar telecommunications business, operated jointly by KDDI Summit Global Myanmar Co., Ltd. and Myanma Posts & Telecommunications, is working to increase customers’ digital life experience value by enhancing entertainment content, pro- viding bundled packs of data and value-added services (videos, games), and becoming the official partner of Myanmar’s popular “Myanmar Idol” contest.
In addition, MobiCom Corporation LLC, which is a compre- hensive communications carrier in Mongolia, was awarded the highest prize of “The best player of ICT EXPO 2019” at the ICT EXPO 2019, which was sponsored by Mongolia’s telecommuni- cations and information technology ministry and the telecom- munications regulations committee.
    Solving Social Issues through the Telecommunications Business
Social • Resilient responses to abnormal weather phenomena • Infrastructure cut off during natural disasters
 issues
• Reducing society’s environmental burden through ICT • Digital divide impacting the weakest in society
 “Achieving a truly connected society” is the ultimate goal of the KDDI Group Mission Statement. To this end, as a tele- communications operator that provides social infrastructure, the Company has the important social mission of providing stable communications services on an ongoing basis, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, regardless of conditions. We have a social responsibility to continue earnestly helping address various social issues.
In recent years, Japan has suffered major damage from increasingly large cyclones due to abnormal weather phenom- ena. KDDI uses a lot of electricity, mainly for telecommuni-
cations equipment, and is shifting toward renewable energy. We are working to achieve zero CO2 emissions, which are a greenhouse gas, by 2050 and maintain lifelines by upgrading overall recovery and support systems across land, sea, and air to prepare for intensifying large-scale disasters.
Going forward, we will actively roll out 5G services in a variety of fields, such as remote healthcare and education as well as mobility. Through the telecommunications busi- ness, we will contribute to the overall development of soci- ety by working to reduce the information gap and stimulate regional revitalization through innovation.

The Business Services segment mainly provides a wide range of corporate customers in Japan and overseas with TELEHOUSE brand data center services and a variety of solutions encompassing network and cloud services, smartphones and other devices.
In collaboration with partner companies and using 5G, IoT, and other technology, we create new value through digital transformations with customers by providing one-stop services and solutions that help customers develop and expand their businesses on a global scale.
For small and medium-sized corporate customers in Japan, our consolidated subsidiary, the KDDI MATOMETE OFFICE GROUP, is building a regional support network offering close contact throughout Japan.
Overview of Operations in the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2020
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, operating revenue expanded 4.2% year on year to ¥923.5 billion. This increase mainly reflected higher revenue from mobile and fixed-line tele- communications business, including IoT-related sales, and higher revenue from domestic Group companies, including KDDI MATOMETE OFFICE CORPORATION and KDDI Evolva, Inc.
Operating income climbed 20.8% to ¥147.5 billion, thanks to a significant increase in income from the mobile telecommu- nications due to a steady expansion in contracts as well as an increase in income from all domains, including the fixed-line telecommunications business, domestic Group companies, and the overseas business.

  Key Initiatives in the Business Services Segment
Accelerating Customers’ DX
In the Business Services segment, we are currently working to support the DX of customers, and these efforts are creating a virtuous cycle, such as contributing to the profit growth of the core telecommunications business (not just growth domains).
To promote DX more concretely, in September 2018 we opened the business development base KDDI DIGITAL GATE in the Toranomon area of Tokyo. Due to increasing customer needs, we also opened locations in Okinawa Prefecture (Naha) and Osaka Prefecture (Osaka City) in September 2019.
The total number of companies visiting KDDI DIGITAL GATE has exceeded 350.
Through activities at these locations, we support the growing sophistication of business and solve issues confronting various industries and companies.
Developing Global Business
From March 2020, KDDI began providing the Global IoT Package to companies working to roll out 5G and IoT globally. It is a one-stop package that provides everything from the col- lection of data to storage, visualization and utilization.
This service is the first package service of the IoT World Architecture we announced in June 2018 and provides one-stop service for cloud servers, telecommunications connections, and telecommunications devices. This services adopts the structure of Toshiba Digital Solution Co., Ltd.’s Meister RemoteXTM in its IoT cloud service, which quickly realizes data storage and visu- alization. In addition, telecommunications connections are pro- vided by SORACOM’s global roaming SIM cards.
The service enables use of a set encompassing highly expandable cloud services, global roaming services and devices authorized by the Radio Act in addition to single-device use. We have therefore enabled customers developing global business to achieve rapid business transformation using IoT.
Going forward, the KDDI Group will continue promoting cus- tomers’ digital transformations centered around the IoT World Architecture with Toshiba Digital Solutions and other partners.
 KDDI DIGITAL GATE OSAKA
KDDI DIGITAL GATE OKINAWA
    In addition, from March 2020 KDDI began to steadily offer 5G solutions for corporations. These include 5G, high-resolution video and AI. In March 2020, we introduced “au 5G” services at JFE Steel Corporation and JFE Steel’s East Japan Works (Chiba Region). We announced that we are promoting the shift to a smart factory and stable operations of steel works using 4K video and other technology.
In this way, we will continue helping realize a sustainable society by using the latest ICT, including 5G.

        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
KDDI Corporation and its Subsidiaries
1 Reporting Entity
KDDI CORPORATION (“the Company”) was established as a limited company in accordance with Japanese Company Act. The location of the Company is Japan and the registered address of its headquarter is 2-3-2, Nishishinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. The Company’s con- solidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 comprise the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“the Group”) and the Group’s interests in associates and joint ventures. The Company is the ultimate parent company of the Group.
2 Basis of Preparation
(1) Compliance of consolidated financial statements with IFRSs
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as prescribed in Article 93 of Ordinance on Consolidated Financial Statements as they satisfy the requirement of a “specific company” set forth in Article 1-2 of Ordinance on Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Basis of measurement
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis except for the following significant items on the consolidated statement of financial position:
• Derivative assets and derivative liabilities (measured at fair value)
• Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
• Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income
• Assets and liabilities related to defined benefit plan (measured at the
present value of the defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of the plan asset)
(3) Presentation currency and unit of currency
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the currency of the primary economic environ- ment of the Company’s business activities (“functional currency”), and are rounded to the nearest million yen.
The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen and, solely for the convenience of the readers, have been translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of ¥108.83=U.S.$1, the approximate exchange rate on March 31, 2020. These translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts actually are, have been or could be readily converted into U.S. dollars at this rate or any other rate.
(4) Use of estimates and judgement
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assump- tions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions are based on the management’s best judgments, through their evaluation of various factors that were considered reason- able as of the period-end, based on historical experience and by collect- ing available information. By the nature of the estimates or assumptions, however, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effect of adjusting accounting estimates is recognized in the fiscal year in which the estimates are adjusted and in the subsequent fiscal years. Estimates that may have a risk of significant adjustment of
The Group’s major business and activities are “Personal Services” and “Business Services”. From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the four reporting segments of Personal Services, Life Design Services, Business Services, and Global Services were reorganized into the two reporting seg- ments of Personal Services and Business Services based on their manage- ment approach, consolidating them based on the allocation of management resources and their performance evaluations. For the details, please refer to “(1) Outline of reporting segments” of “5. Segment information”.
carrying amounts of assets and/or liabilities in the subsequent fiscal years and the underlying assumptions are as follows:
Regarding the preparation of consolidated financial statement for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Groups makes the accounting estimates and assumptions that the impact of COVID-19 continues through the first half of 2020 and makes judgements that there are no material impact at this time by considering structural improvement and measure against change of business environment even assuming. However, if the judgements is reviewed based on the change of future conditions, it maybe affect significant impact on consolidated financial statement for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
i. Estimates of useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and right-of-use assets Property, plant and equipment is depreciated primarily using the
straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life that reflects the period in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. The depreciation charge for the period could increase if an item of property, plant and equipment becomes obsolete or repurposed in the future and the estimated useful life becomes shorter.
Intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized on a straight-line basis in principle to reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future eco- nomic benefits are expected to be consumed by the Group. Estimated useful life of the customer relationships acquired in a business combi- nation is determined based on the cancellation rate. The intangible assets related to the customer relationships are amortized over the use- ful life. Should actual sales volumes fail to meet initial projected volumes due to changes in the business environment etc., or should actual use- ful life in the future be less than the original estimate, there is a risk that amortization expenses for the reporting period may increase.
The content related to estimates of useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets are described in “3. Significant accounting policies (5) Property, plant & equipment, (7) Intangible asset and (8) Leases”.
ii. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill and right-of-use assets
The Group conducts impairment tests to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets including goodwill and right-of-use assets. Calculations of recoverable amounts used in impairment tests are based on assump- tions set using such factors as an asset’s useful life, future cash flows, pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates. These assumptions are based on the best estimates and judgments made by management. However, these assumptions may be affected by changes in uncertain future economic conditions, which may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
The method for calculating recoverable amounts is described in “3. Significant accounting policies (9) Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets” and “8.
      64 KDDI CORPORATION | INTEGRATED REPORT 2020

Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets”.
iii. Evaluation of inventories
Inventories are measured at historical cost. However, when the net real- izable value (“NRV”) at the reporting date falls below the cost, inventories are subsequently measured based on NRV, with the difference in value between the cost and NRV, booked as cost of sales. Slow-moving inventories and those outside the normal operating cycle are calculated at NRV that reflects future demand and market trends. The Group may experience substantial losses in cases where NRV drops as a result of deterioration in the market environment against the forecast.
The content and amount related to evaluation of inventories are described in “3. Significant accounting policies (15) Inventories” and “10. Inventories”.
iv. Recoverability of deferred tax assets
In recognizing deferred tax assets, when judging the possibility of the future taxable income, the Group estimates the timing and amount of future taxable income based on the business plan.
The timing when taxable income arises and the amount of such income may be affected by changes in uncertain future economic con- ditions. If there are differences between the actual amounts and esti- mated amounts, this may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
The content and amount related to deferred tax assets are described in “3. Significant accounting policies (24) Income taxes” and “16. Deferred tax and income taxes”.
v. Measurement of defined benefit obligations
The Group has in place various post-retirement benefit plans, including defined benefits plans. The present value of defined benefit obligations on each of these plans and the service costs are calculated based on actuarial assumptions. These actuarial assumptions require estimates and judgments on variables, such as discount rates. The Group obtains advice from external pension actuaries with respect to the appropriate- ness of these actuarial assumptions including these variables.
The actuarial assumptions are determined based on the best esti- mates and judgments made by management. However, there is the possibility that these assumptions may be affected by changes in uncertain future economic conditions, or by the publication or the amendment of related laws, which may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
These actuarial assumptions are described in “3. Significant account- ing policies (16) Employee benefits” and “17. Employee benefits”.
vi. Collectability of trade and other receivables
The Group has estimated the collectability of trade and other receiv- ables based on the credit risk. Fluctuations in credit risk of customer receivables may have a significant effect on the amounts recognized the allowance for receivables on the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
The content and amount related to collectability of trade and other receivables are described in “3. Significant accounting policies (12) Impairment of financial assets” and “32. Financial Instruments”.
vii. Valuation technique of financial assets at fair value without quoted prices in active markets.
The Group has used valuation techniques to utilize the inputs unobserv- able in the market when assessing the fair value of certain financial instruments. Unobservable input may be affected by changes in uncer- tain future economic conditions, which may have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in future periods if it becomes necessary to review.
The content and amount related to fair value of financial assets are described in “3. Significant accounting policies (11) Financial instru- ments and (13) Derivatives and hedge accounting” and “33. Fair value of financial instruments”.
viii. Provisions
The Group recognizes provisions, including asset retirement obligations and provisions for point program, in the consolidated statement of financial position. These provisions are recognized based on the best estimates of the expenditures required to settle the obligations, taking into account risks and uncertainty related to the obligations as of the current year end date. Expenditures necessary for settling the obliga- tions are calculated by taking all possible future results into account; however, they may be affected by unexpected events or changes in conditions which may have a material impact on the Group’s consoli- dated financial statements in future periods.
The nature and amount of recognized provisions are stated in “3. Significant accounting policies (17) Provisions” and “20. Provisions”.
(5) Application of new standards and interpretations
The Group applies the new standards and interpretations listed below from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
• IFRS 16 “Leases”
The Group has applied the following standard from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
IFRS Newly established contents
The Group has applied IFRS 16 in accordance with the transition elections available, and therefore retrospectively recognized the cumu- lative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of April 1, 2019.
With the application of IFRS 16 from the first quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the accounting policies related to leases will be changed in the following ways.
As a lessee
Lease liabilities in lease transactions are measured as the current dis- counted price of the unpaid portion of the total lease amount on the start date of the lease. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities at the initial adoption is 0.156%. Right-of- use assets are initially measured as the initially measured lease liability amount adjusted mainly for initial direct costs and prepaid lease fees. Right-of-use assets are consistently depreciated and amortized over the period of the lease.
Lease fees are allocated to finance costs and the repaid portion of remaining lease liabilities in order to ensure interest rate stays at a cer- tain level of for the remaining lease liabilities. Finance costs are present- ed separately from depreciation costs related to right-of-use assets in the consolidated statement of income.
In determining whether or not a contract is a lease or whether or not a contract contains a lease, the actual content of the contract is the deciding factor, even if the contract does not take the legal form of a lease.
Furthermore, regarding leases that end in 12 months or less and leases that include a small amount of underlying assets, the related lease fees are recognized as an expense by either the straight-line method over the period of the lease or another consistent basis.
As a lessor
For leases that transfer the risk associated with owning an asset and most of the economic value, the Group categorizes these kinds of leas- es as finance leases. For finance leases transactions, we suspend the recognition of the underlying assets categorized as leases on the start date of the leases. Instead, in the consolidated statement of financial position, we recognize the assets whose ownership was acquired through finance leases as accounts receivable in an amount equal to the net unrecovered amount of the lease investment.

        In addition, for leases that do not transfer the risk associated with owning an asset and most of the economic value, the Group categorizes these kinds of leases as operating leases. For operating leases transactions, the Group records the leased assets in the consolidated statement of financial position and recognize the received lease fees as revenue in the consolidated statement of income using the straight-line method over the period of the lease.
The difference between the undiscounted future minimum lease payments payable under operating leases as of March 31, 2019 and lease liabilities recognized as of April 1, 2019 is as follows:
  Undiscounted future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of March 31, 2019 Adjustments by discounting the future minimum lease payments payable under operating leases above Discounted future minimum lease payments under operating leases as of April 1, 2019

  Upon the application of IFRS 16, leases that were previously classified as operating leases are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabili- ties. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities also include finance leases that were previously recognized as property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other financial liabilities. The change in the accounting policy mainly resulted in an increase of right-of-use assets by ¥393,170 million (U.S.$3,613 million) and lease liabilities by ¥391,844 million (U.S.$3,601 million), while in a decrease of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets by ¥79,989 million (U.S.$735 million), other financial liabilities by ¥84,158 million (U.S.$773 million) and retained earnings by ¥181 million (U.S.$2 million), respectively as of April 1, 2019.
(6) Standards not yet adopted
The following new standards and amendments announced by the approval date of the consolidated financial statements are not mandatory as of March 31, 2020. They have not been early adopted by the Group.
  Standard IFRS 17
The title of standard Insurance contracts
Mandatory adoption (from the fiscal year beginning)
January 1, 2021
To be adopted by the Group from
Fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
Outline of new standards and amendments
IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4, which currently permits a wide variety of practices in accounting for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 will fundamentally change the accounting by all entities that issue insurance contracts and investment contracts with discre- tionary participation features.
  All the standards and amendments above will be reflected to the consolidated financial statements for the relevant fiscal year described above. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the application and estimate is currently not available.
 3 Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the reporting periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
(1) Basis of consolidation
i. Subsidiaries
(a) Consolidation of subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. An entity is consolidated as the Group controls it when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when control is obtained and deconsolidated from the date when control is lost.
Intragroup balances and transactions, and unrealized gain or loss arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to con- form to the Group’s accounting policies, when necessary.
(b) Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a change of control
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for by the Group as equity transactions. The dif- ference between fair value of any consideration paid and the proportion acquired of the carrying amount of the subsidiary’s net assets is record- ed in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests without losing control are also recorded in equity.
66 KDDI CORPORATION | INTEGRATED REPORT 2020
(c) Disposal of a subsidiary
When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value on the date when control is lost, with the changes in the carrying amount recognized in profit or loss. The fair value will be the initial carrying amount when the retained inter- ests are subsequently accounted for as associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
(d) Unification of reporting period
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of subsidiaries whose closing dates are different from that of the Company. For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, such subsidiaries prepare financial statements based on the provisional accounts as of the Company’s closing date.
ii. Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group does not have control but has significant influence over the financial and operating policies through participation in the decision-making of those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investment in an associate is initially recorded at cost and its amount is adjusted to recognize the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate from the date on which it has significant influence until the date when it ceases to have the significant influence is lost.
 
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amount previous- ly recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss, where appropriate. When the Company’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its carrying amount of interest in the asso- ciate, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill recognized on acquisition. Accordingly, goodwill is not recognized and not tested for impairment separately. Gross amount of investments in associates is tested for impairment as a single asset. Specifically, the Group evalu- ates whether there is objective evidence which indicates that the invest- ment may be impaired or not on a quarterly basis. When objective evidence that the investments in associates are impaired exists, those investments are tested for impairment. Unrealized gains or losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates. The accounting policies of associates have been changed to conform to the Group’s accounting policies, when necessary.
iii. Joint arrangements
The Group enters into joint arrangements when the Group has joint control of a business or entity.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
For the purpose of accounting, joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint agree- ment whereby parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
When a joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation, the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in relation to the arrangement are recorded directly in the financial statements. On the other hand, when a joint arrangement is classified as a joint venture, net assets related to the arrangement are recorded in the financial statements using the equity method.
(2) Business combination
The Group accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisi- tion method. Consideration transferred to acquire subsidiaries is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred by former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. Consideration transferred also includes fair values of any assets or liabili- ties resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Each identifi- able asset acquired, liability and contingent liability assumed in a business combination is generally measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Non-controlling interests are identified separately from those of the Group and are measured as the non-controlling shareholders’ propor- tionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. For each acquisi- tion, the Group recognizes the acquiree’s non-controlling interests either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the amount recognized for acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs, including finder’s fees, legal, due-diligence and other professional fees, are charged to expense when incurred.
Where the aggregate amount of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisi- tion-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, such excess is recorded as goodwill. Where the aggregate amount of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previ- ously held equity interest in the acquire is less than the fair value of acquired subsidiary’s net assets, such difference is recognized directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is not complete by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs, the Group recognizes in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Subsequently, the Group retrospectively adjusts the provisional amounts recognized on the date when control is obtained as measure- ment period adjustments to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the date when control is obtained and, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized for the business combination. However, the measurement period shall not exceed one year from the date when control is obtained.
(3) Segment information
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the inter- nal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The board of direc- tors that makes strategic decisions has been identified by the Group as the chief operating decision-maker.
(4) Foreign currency translation
i. Functional currency and presentation currency
Foreign currency transactions of each group company have been trans- lated into their functional currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of transactions upon preparation of their financial statements. The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in Japanese yen, which is the functional currency of the Company.
ii. Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the spot exchange rate of the date of transaction or the rate that approximates such exchange rate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the fiscal year end date. Non-monetary items at fair value denominated in foreign curren- cies are translated at an exchange rate as of the date when their fair values are measured.
Exchange differences arising from the translation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized as profit or loss. However, exchange differences arising from the translation of equity instruments measured through other compre- hensive income and qualifying cash flow hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.
iii. Foreign operations
For the purpose of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations, including goodwill, identified assets and liabilities, and their fair value adjustments resulting from the acquisition of the foreign operations, are translated into presentation currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the fiscal year end date. Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen, the presentation currency, at the average exchange rate for the period, unless the exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period.
Exchange differences arising from translation of foreign operations’ finan- cial statements are recognized as other comprehensive income. In cases of disposition of whole interests of foreign operations, and certain interests involving loss of control or significant influence, exchange differences are accounted for as profit or loss on disposal of foreign operations.
(5) Property, plant and equipment
i. Recognition and measurement
Property, plant, and equipment of the Group is measured on a historical cost basis and carried at its cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The acquisition cost includes costs directly attribut- able to the acquisition of the asset and the initial estimated costs related to disassembly, retirement and site restoration, as well as borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.

     In cases where components of property, plant, and equipment have different useful lives, each component is recorded as a separate property, plant, and equipment item.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognized as expenses during the financial period in which they are incurred.
ii. Depreciation and useful lives
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated mainly using the straight- line method over the estimated useful lives of each component. The depreciable amount is calculated as the cost of an asset less its residual value. Land and construction in progress are not depreciated. In cases where components of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, each component is recorded as a separate property, plant and equipment item.
The estimated useful lives of major components of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
Communication equipment
Expenditure on development is recognized as intangible asset in the case where the expenditure is able to be measured reliably, product or production process has commercial and technical feasibility, the expen- diture probably generates future economic benefits, the Group has intention to complete the development and use or sell the asset, and has enough resources for their activities. In other cases, the expenditure is recognized as expense when it is incurred.
ii. Depreciation and useful lives
Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives of major components of intangible assets are as follows. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized.
Machinery
Antenna equipment
Toll and local line equipment Other equipment
Buildings and structures Others
9 years 10–21 years 5–21 years 9–27 years 10–38 years 5–22 years
The amortization methods, estimated useful lives are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, and if there are any changes made, those changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
(8) Leases
For the year ended March 31, 2019
At the inception of the lease contract, the assessment whether an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease is made based on the sub- stance of the agreement. Assets are subject to lease if the implementa- tion of an agreement depends on use of certain assets or groups of assets, and the right to use the assets is given under such agreement.
Lease transactions are classified as finance leases whenever all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets are substantially transferred to the Group (lessee). All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In finance lease transactions, leased assets are recognized as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the aggre- gated minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Lease obligations are recognized as “Other short-term financial liabilities” and “Other long-term financial liabilities” in the consolidated statement of financial position. Lease payments are apportioned between the finan- cial cost and the reduction of the lease obligations based on the effec- tive interest method. Finance cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated using straight-line method over their estimated useful lives if there is reasonable certainty that the ownership will be transferred by the end of the lease term; otherwise the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives.
In operating lease transactions, lease payments are recognized as an expense using the straight-line method over the lease terms.
For the year ended March 31, 2020
At the inception of the lease, the Group determines whether the lease includes a lease or lease. Whether or not the contract includes a lease is determined based on whether or not the right to control the use of the identified asset is transferred to the consideration and exchange for a certain period of time.
When the contract includes a lease, right-of-use assets is initially rec- ognized at the amount calculated by adding or subtracting the initial direct cost to the initial use of the lease liability. Lease liabilities are ini- tially recognized at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at the inception of the lease.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the period from the inception of the lease to the end of the useful life of the assets or the end of the lease term, whichever is earlier.
Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at an amount that reflects the interest rate on the lease liability, the lease payments made and, where applicable, the review of the lease liability or any change in the
The depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, and if there are any changes made, those changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
iii. Derecognition
Property, plant and equipment is derecognized on disposal. The profit or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognized.
(6) Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree on the date of acquisition.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a busi- ness combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for inter- nal management purposes.
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment annually and if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impair- ment. For the impairment, please refer to “(9) Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets.”
(7) Intangible assets
i. Recognition and measurement
The Group applies the cost method in measuring intangible assets, excluding goodwill. Those assets are carried at its cost less accumulat- ed amortization and impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost at initial recognition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill and are measured at fair value at the acquisition date when such assets meet the definition of intangible asset and are identifiable, and their fair values can be measured reliably.
Expenditure on research activities to obtain new science technology or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized as an expense when it is incurred.

terms of the lease.
(9) Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and right-of-use assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Group determines whether there is any indication that carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and right-of-use assets may be impaired. If any indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, the impair- ment test is undertaken annually or more frequently if events or circum- stances indicate that they might be impaired. A cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
When the impairment test shows that the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allo- cated to the cash-generating unit or group of units, and then to the other assets of the unit or group of units pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit or group of units. Any impair- ment loss for goodwill is recognized in profit or loss and is not reversed in subsequent periods.
For assets other than goodwill, the Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized in prior years has decreased or extinguished. An impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impair- ment loss may be reversed and there has been a change in the esti- mates used to determine an asset’s recoverable amount. When an impairment loss recognized is reversed, carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to its updated estimated recoverable amount. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized, to the extent the increased carrying amount does not exceed the lower of the recoverable amount or the carrying amount (net of depreciation and amortization) that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recog- nized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as other income.
(10) Non-current assets held for sale or disposal group
An asset or group of assets of which the carrying amount is expected to be recovered primarily through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use is classified into “Assets held for sale”. To qualify for classification as “non-current assets held for sale”, the sale of a non- current asset must be highly probable and it must be available for immediate sale in its present condition. Also, management must be committed to a plan to sell the asset in which the sale is to be complet- ed within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, and the criteria set out above are met, all assets and lia- bilities of the subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former sub- sidiary after the sale.
Assets held for sale is measured at the lower of its “carrying amount” and “fair value less cost to sell”. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets classified as “assets held for sale” are not depreciated or amortized.
(11) Financial instruments
i. Financial assets
(a) Recognition and measurement of financial assets
The Group recognizes a financial asset when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group initially recognizes trade and other receivables on the date of transaction. At initial
recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction cost of a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized as profit or loss.
(b) Classification of non-derivative financial assets
Classification and measurement model of non-derivative financial assets are summarized as follows. The Group classifies financial assets at ini- tial recognition as financial assets measured at amortized cost, equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(i) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset that meets both the following condition is classified as a financial asset measured at amortized cost.
• The financial asset is held within the Group’s business model whose
objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. • The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset measured at amortized cost is initially recognized at fair value plus transaction cost directly attributable to the asset. After initial recognition, carrying amount of the financial asset measured at amortized cost is determined using the effective interest method, net of impairment loss, if necessary.
(ii) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other compre- hensive income
The Group makes an irrevocable election to recognize changes in fair value of investments in equity instruments through other comprehensive income, not through profit or loss. A gain or loss from fair value chang- es will be shown in other comprehensive income and will not be reclas- sified subsequently to profit or loss.
An equity instrument measured at fair value through other compre- hensive income is recognized initially at fair value plus transaction cost directly attributable to the asset. After initial recognition, the asset is measured at fair value with changes in fair value included as “financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income” in other com- prehensive income. Accumulated gains or losses recognized through other comprehensive income are directly transferred to retained earn- ings when equity instrument is derecognized or its fair value substantial- ly decreased.
Dividends are recognized as “finance income” in profit or loss.
(iii) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
When any of the above-mentioned conditions for classification of finan- cial assets is not met, a financial asset is classified as “at fair value through profit or loss” and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.
A financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss is rec- ognized initially at fair value and its transaction cost is recognized in profit or loss when incurred. A gain or loss on a financial asset mea- sured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in profit or loss, and presented in “finance income” or “finance cost” in the consolidated statement of income for the reporting period in which it arises.
The Group does not designate any debt instrument as at fair value through profit or loss to remove or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch.
(c) Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognizes its financial asset if the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or the Group transfers substan- tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. Any interests in transferred financial assets that are created or continuously retained by the Group are recognized as a separate asset or liability.

ii. Non-derivative financial liabilities
(a) Recognition and measurement of financial liabilities
The Group recognizes financial debt when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. The measurement of financial debt is explained in (b) Classification of financial liabilities.
(b) Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
A financial liability other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss is classified as a financial liability measured at amortized cost.
A financial liability at amortized cost is initially measured at fair value less transaction cost directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. After initial recognition, the financial liability is measured at amortized cost based on the effective interest rate method.
(c) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognizes a financial liability when the financial liability is extinguished, i.e. when the contractual obligation is discharged or cancelled or expired.
iii. Presentation of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position only when the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(12) Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognizes 12-month expected credit loss as provision for doubtful receivables (non-trade receivables) when there is no significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. When there is a signifi- cant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, expected credit losses for such remaining life of the financial assets are recognized as provision for doubtful receivables. Whether credit risk is significantly increased or not is determined based on the changes in default risk. To determine if there is a change in default risk, following factors are considered. However, the Group always measures provision for trade receivables which do not include any material financial component at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses.
• External credit rating of the financial asset
• Downgrade of internal credit rating
• Operating results, such as decrease in sales, decrease in working
capital, asset deterioration and increase in leverage
• Reduced financial support from the parent company or associated
companies
• Delinquencies (Overdue information)
Expected credit losses are measured based on the discounted pres- ent value of the differences between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be received.
(13) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value as on the date on which the derivative contracts are entered into. After initial recognition, deriva- tives are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period.
The Group utilizes derivatives consisting of exchange contracts and interest swaps to reduce foreign currency risk and interest rate risk etc.
The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates derivatives as cash flow hedge (hedges to the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction).
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the rela- tionship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
Our Future Our Governance Financial Information • Analysis of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
• Consolidated Financial Statements • Corporate Overview / Stock Information
with their risk management objectives and strategies to conduct various hedge transactions.
At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group assess whether the derivative used in hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Specially, when the Group assess whether the hedge relationship is effective, the Group assess whether all of the following requirements are met:
(i) There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and
the hedging instrument.
(ii) The effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that
result from that economic relationship.
(iii) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that
resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actu- ally hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed on an ongoing basis and about whether the hedging criteria described above are met.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. Cumulative profit or loss recognized through other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss on the same period that the cash flows of hedged items affects profit or loss.
If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objec- tive for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, an entity should adjust the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship so that it meets the qualifying criteria again (rebalancing).
After rebalancing, in cases where no longer meet the requirements of hedge accounting or hedging instruments are expired, sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting will be discontinued.
In the case that the hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative profit or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized in other comprehensive income when the hedge was effective will remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs. When forecast transactions are no longer expected to arise, the accu- mulated amount of profit or loss recorded in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Aggregated fair values of hedging instrument derivatives whose maturities are over 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities, and those whose maturities are less than 12 months are clas- sified as current assets or liabilities.
(14) Cash and cash equivalents
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, demand deposits and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash and subject to insignificant risk of change in value and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are shown within in current liabilities.
(15) Inventories
Inventories mainly consist of mobile handsets and materials / work in progress related to construction.
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost is generally calculated using the moving average meth- od and comprise all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net real- izable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any estimated cost to sell.

(16) Employee benefits
i. Defined benefit plans
The Group primarily adopts defined benefit plans.
The asset or liability recognized on the consolidated statement of
financial position in relation to the defined benefit pension plans (defined benefit asset or liability) is the present value of the defined benefit obli- gation less fair value of the plan assets at the end of the reporting peri- od. The defined benefit obligation is determined annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The dis- count rates are on the basis of the market yields of high-quality corpo- rate bonds at the end of the reporting period, that are denominated in the currency in which the benefit will be paid, which is corresponding to estimated timing and amount of future benefits are to be paid.
Defined benefit cost includes service cost, net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset), and remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset). Service cost and net interest are recognized in profit or loss. Net interest is determined using the discount rate described above. The remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest). Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income when incurred, and past service costs are recognized as profit or loss.
The Group recognizes remeasurements of all the net defined benefit liability (asset) resulting from its defined benefit plans in other compre- hensive income and reclassifies them immediately to retained earnings.
ii. Defined contribution plans
Certain subsidiaries of the Group adopt defined contribution plans. Contribution to the defined contribution plans are recognized as expenses for the period over which employees provide services.
In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi- employer pension plans, and recognize the payments made during the fiscal year as profit or loss and contribution payable as a liability.
iii. Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled and recognized as an expense. Bonus and paid annual leave accruals are recognized as a liability in the amount estimated to be paid under these plans, when the Group has legal or constructive obligations to pay them and reliable estimates of the obligation can be made.
(17) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that outflows of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and reliable estimates of the obligation can be made. To determine the amount of a provision, the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a pretax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability where necessary. Unwinding of the discount over time is recognized in finance cost.
(18) Share-based payment
i. Stock options
The Group has equity-settled stock option plans as incentive plans for its directors and employees. Stock options are measured at fair value at the grant date, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes or other models.
The fair value of stock options at the grant date is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, based on the estimated number of stock options that are expected to vest, with corresponding amount recognized as increase in equity.
ii. Executive compensation BIP trust and stock-granting ESOP trust
The Group has introduced the executive compensation BIP (Board Incentive Plan) trust and a stock-granting ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) trust. These plans are accounted for as equity-settled share based payment and the shares of the Company held by the trust are included in treasury stock. The fair value of the shares of the Company at the grant date is recognized as expenses over the period from the grant date to the vesting date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus. The fair value of the shares of the Company granted is determined by adjusting the market value, taking into account the expected dividend yield of the shares.
(19) Equity
i. Common stock
Common stocks are classified as equity. Proceeds from the Company’s issuance of common stocks are included in common stock and capital surplus and its direct issue costs are deducted from capital surplus.
ii. Treasury stock
When the Group acquires treasury stocks, the consideration paid, net of direct transaction costs and tax, is recognized as a deduction from equity. When the Group sells treasury stocks, differences between the carrying amount and the consideration received upon sale are recognized as capital surplus.
(20) Revenue
i. Mobile telecommunications services
The Group generates revenue mainly from its mobile telecommunica- tions services and sale of mobile handsets. The Group enters into mobile telecommunications service agreements directly with customers or indirectly through distributors, and also sells mobile handsets to
its distributors.
Revenue from the mobile telecommunications services primarily
consists of basic monthly charges and communication fees (“the mobile telecommunication service fees”), and commission fees such as activa- tion fees. The mobile telecommunication service fees and commission fees such as activation fees are recognized on a flat rate basis and on a measured rate basis when the services are provided to the customers, whereupon the performance obligation is fulfilled. Discounts of commu- nication charges are deducted from the mobile telecommunications service fees on a monthly basis.
Furthermore, the consideration for transactions related to revenue from mobile telecommunications services is received between the billing date and approximately one month thereafter.
Revenue from the sale of mobile handsets comprises proceeds from the sale of mobile handsets and accessories to customers or distributors.
The business flows of the above transactions consist of “Indirect sales,” wherein the Company sells mobile handsets to distributors and enters into communications service contracts with customers through those distributors, and “Direct sales,” wherein the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company sell mobile handsets to customers and enter into communications service contracts directly with the customers. Revenue in each case is recognized as described below.
Revenue from the sale of mobile handsets is received within approxi- mately one month following the sale to the distributor or other vendor.

            Highlights Our Management Our Value
• The Japanese Market and KDDI • Analysis of the Consolidated Statement of Income • Analysis of Capital Expenditures and Cash Flows • Performance Analysis by Segment
(a) Indirect sales
As the distributor has the primary obligation and inventory risk for the mobile handsets, the Group sells to the distributors, the Group consid- ers distributors as the principals in each transaction. Revenue from the sale of mobile handsets is recognized when mobile handsets are deliv- ered to distributors, which is when control over the mobile handsets is transferred to the distributor and the performance obligation is fulfilled. Certain commission fees paid to distributors are deducted from revenue from the sale of mobile handsets.
(b) Direct sales
In direct sales transactions, revenue from the sale of mobile handsets and revenue from service fees, including mobile telecommunications service fees, are considered to be bundled. Therefore, contracts that are concluded for a bundled transaction are treated as a single contract for accounting purposes. The total amount of the transaction allocated to revenue from the sale of mobile handsets and mobile telecommuni- cations service fees is based on the proportion of each component’s independent sales value. The amount allocated to mobile handset sales is recognized as revenue at the time of sale, which is when the perfor- mance obligation is determined to have been fulfilled. The amount allo- cated to mobile telecommunications service fees is recognized as revenue when the service is provided to the customer, which is when the performance obligation is determined to have been fulfilled.
In both direct and indirect sales, activation fees and handset model exchange fees are deferred as contract liabilities upon entering into the contract. They are not recognized as a separate performance obligation, but combined with mobile telecommunications services. They are recog- nized as revenue over the period when material renewal options exist.
The consideration of these transactions is received in advance, when the contract is signed.
Points granted to customers through the customer loyalty program are allocated to transaction prices based on the independent sales val- ues of benefits to be exchanged based on the estimated point utiliza- tion rate, which reflects points that will expire due to future cancellation or other factors. The points are recognized as revenue when the customers utilize those points and take control of the goods or services, which is when the performance obligation is considered fulfilled.
ii. Fixed-line telecommunications services (including the CATV business)
Revenue from fixed-line telecommunications services primarily consists of revenues from voice communications, data transmission, FTTH services, CATV services and related installation fees.
The above revenue, excluding installation fee revenue, is recorded when the service is provided, fulfilling the performance obligation. Installation fee revenue is recognized over the estimated average contract period based on the percentage remaining.
The consideration for these transactions is received between the billing date and approximately the following month.
iii. Value-added services
Revenue from content services mainly comprises revenue from informa- tion fees, revenue arising from payment agency services, revenue through advertising businesses, agency fees on content services, and revenue from the energy business, etc. Revenue from information fees is the revenue from membership fees for the content provided to cus- tomers on websites that the Group operates or that the Group jointly operates with other entities. Revenue arising from payment agency services comprises the revenue from fees for collecting the receivables of content providers from customers as the agent of content providers together with the telecommunication fees. Electric power revenue is the revenue generated from electric power retail services. These revenues are recognized as the service is delivered based on the nature of
each contract.
The Group may act as an agent in a transaction. To report revenue
from such transactions, the Group determines whether it should
present the gross amount of the consideration received from custom- ers, or the net amount of the consideration received from customers less payments paid to a third party. The Group evaluates whether the Group has the primary obligation for providing the goods and services under the arrangement or contract, the inventory risk, latitude in estab- lishing prices, and the credit risk. However, the presentation being on a gross basis or a net basis does not impact profit for the year.
The Group considers itself to be an agent for payment agency services, advertisement services and certain content services described above because it earns only commission income based on pre-determined rates, does not have the authority to set prices and solely provides a platform for its customers to perform content-related services. The Group thus does not control the service before control is transferred to the customer. Therefore, revenue from these services is presented on a net basis.
The consideration for these transactions is received within approximately one to three months after the performance obligation has been fulfilled.
iv. Global services
Global services mainly comprise solution services, data center services and mobile telephone services.
Revenue from data center services comprise the service charges the Group receives for using space, electricity, networks or other amenities at its self-operated data centers in locations around the world. In gener- al, contracts cover more than one year, and revenue is recognized for the period over which the services are provided.
The consideration for these transactions is basically billed before the performance obligation is fulfilled and is received approximately one month after billing.
Revenue from mobile telephone services comprises revenue from mobile handsets and mobile telecommunication services. Revenue from the sale of mobile handsets is recognized at the time of sale of the handsets, when the performance obligation is determined to have been fulfilled. Revenue from mobile telecommunication services is recognized at the time the services are provided to the customer, when the perfor- mance obligation is determined to have been fulfilled.
v. Solution services
Revenue from solution services primarily consists of revenues from equipment sales, engineering and management services (“the solution service income”). The solution service income is recognized based on the consideration received from the customers when the goods or the services are provided to the customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled.
Payment for any performance obligation is received between the billing date and approximately one month later.
(21) Finance income and costs
Finance income mainly comprises interest income, dividend income, exchange gains and changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment (shareholders’ right) is established.
Finance costs mainly comprise interest expense, exchange losses and changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. Interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method.
(22) Other non-operating profit and loss
Other non-operating profit and loss includes gain and loss on invest- ment activities. Specifically, gain and loss on step acquisitions, gain and loss on sales of stocks of subsidiaries and associates and gain and loss on deemed disposal are included.

(23) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a qualifying asset, which takes a substantial period of time before it is ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of such asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period they incurred.
(24) Income taxes
Income taxes are composed of current and deferred taxes and recognized in profit or loss, except for taxes related to items that are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the taxation authorities on the current year’s taxable income, plus adjustments to the amount paid in prior years. To deter- mine the current tax amount, the Group uses the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the fiscal year in the countries in which the Group operates and earns taxable income or losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are, using asset and liability meth- od, recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the consolidated financial statements and their tax base, and tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. However, no deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on following temporary differences:
• Taxable temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of
goodwill;
• Temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and
liabilities related to transactions other than business combination, that
affects neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit (loss); and
• Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsid- iaries and associates, where the Group is able to control the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized on all deductible temporary differ- ences, unused tax loss carryforwards and tax credits to the extent that
4 Business Combinations
Jibun Bank Corporation
i. Overview of business combination
KDDI acquired the 608,614 shares issued via third party allocation by Jibun Bank Corporation (“Jibun Bank”) on April 1, 2019. As a result, KDDI owns 1,408,614 shares (63.78%) in Jibun Bank, making Jibun Bank a consolidated subsidiary.
ii. Main objectives of business combination
KDDI now provides Jibun Bank with access to the big data, digital mar- keting resources and customer base that it has cultivated to date. We also continually create points of contact with customers and help strengthen the service offerings for customers’ different life stages with the aim of maximizing the corporate value of Jibun Bank.
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences etc. can be utilized. Deferred tax liabil- ities are recognized on taxable temporary differences. Carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to realize all or part of the benefit of the deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences will reverse, based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.
(25) Dividends
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, dividends to owners of the parent company are recognized as a liability for the peri- od over which the dividends are approved by the owners of the parent company.
(26) Earnings per share
The Group discloses basic and diluted earnings per share (attributable to owners of the parent) related to common stock.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to common stockholders of the parent by the weighted average number of common stocks outstanding during the reporting period, adjusted for the number of treasury stocks acquired. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit attributable to owners of the parent and the weighted average number of common stocks outstanding, adjusted for the number of treasury stocks, are further adjusted based on the assumption that all dilutive potential com- mon stocks are fully converted. Potential common stocks of the Group are related to BIP trust and ESOP trust.

5 Segment Information
(1) Outline of reporting segments
The reporting segments of the Group are units of the Group of which separate financial information is available, and which are periodically monitored for the board of directors to determine the allocation of the business resources and evaluate the performance results.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Group reporting seg- ments were reorganized into the two reporting segments of Personal Services and Business Services based on their management approach, consolidating them based on the allocation of management resources and their performance evaluations.
The Personal Services segment provides services to individual customers.
In Japan, KDDI aims to provide new experience value by expanding and coordinating various life design services, including those related to com- merce, finance, energy, entertainment, and education, while focusing on conventional telecommunications services, chiefly under the “au” brand, such as those related to smartphones, cell phones, FTTH, and CATV.
Overseas, we use know-how cultivated in Japan to actively engage in business with individual customers, especially those in Myanmar, Mongolia, and other Asian regions.
The Business Services segment mainly provides a wide range of cor- porate customers in Japan and overseas with “TELEHOUSE” brand data center services and a variety of solutions encompassing network and cloud services, smartphones and other devices, and the KDDI “IoT Worldwide Architecture”, which supports customers’ IoT businesses.
For small and medium-sized corporate customers in Japan, our con- solidated subsidiary, the KDDI MATOMETE OFFICE GROUP is building a regional support network offering close contact throughout Japan.
In collaboration with partner companies and using 5G, IoT, and other technology, we support customers’ digital transformation by providing one-stop services and solutions that help customers develop and expand their businesses on a global scale.
Accordingly, the segment information for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 have been presented based on the segment classification after this change.
(2) Calculation method of revenue, income or loss, assets and other items by reporting segment
Accounting treatment of reported business segments is consistent with “3. Significant accounting policies”.
Income of the reporting segments is based on the operating income.
Inter segment transaction price is determined by taking into consider- ation the price by arm’s length transactions or gross costs after price negotiation.
Assets and liabilities are not allocated to reporting segments.

   The Group evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets at recognition by considering the possibility to utilize a part or all of deductible tem- porary differences or tax loss carryforwards for future taxable income.
The Group considers the planned reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as expected future taxable income and tax planning for evaluating the recoverability of deferred tax assets, and recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that future taxable income is expected.
Deferred tax assets for tax losses in certain subsidiaries are ¥5,027 million and ¥5,878 million (U.S.$54 million), respectively, as of March 31, 2019 and 2020.
All deferred tax assets related to these losses were determined recoverable as taxable income exceeding the tax losses is expected.

 The contract liabilities are earned from activation fees related to mobile communications services and “au HIKARI” brand services. Points granted to customers through the customer loyalty program are allocated to transaction prices based on the independent sales values of benefits with the advance payment.
Regarding revenue recognized for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, ¥130,694 million and ¥145,731 million (U.S.$1,339 million) were included in outstanding contract liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year, respectively. This is immaterial to the amount of profit recognized from performance obligations fulfilled (or partially fulfilled) in the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020.

        (3) Transaction amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations
The transaction amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations were ¥153,830 million and ¥132,240 million (U.S.$1,215 million), respective- ly, as of March 31, 2019 and 2020. Most of these performance obligations comprise earnings from activation fees related to mobile communications services and “au HIKARI” brand services, and they are expected to be recognized as profit within approximately five years, when the services are pro- vided and performance obligations are fulfilled. In addition, the Group adopts the simplified method from paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 as a practical expedient and has not included information related to remaining performance obligations that have an original expected duration of one year or less.
 (4) Assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers
The Group’s assets recognized from contract costs are as follows:
Costs to obtain contracts Costs to fulfill contracts
Millions of yen March 31, 2019
¥361,437 51,401
Millions of yen March 31, 2020

 The portion expected to be recovered from the incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers and the costs directly related to fulfilling con- tracts is capitalized and recorded under contract costs in the consolidated statement of financial position. Incremental costs to obtain contracts comprise costs to obtain contracts with customers that would not have been incurred had the contracts not been obtained.
Incremental costs to obtain contracts that are capitalized are mainly sales commissions to agencies like au shop incurred when contracts are obtained. Costs to fulfill contracts mainly comprise necessary set-up and other fees incurred between the receipt of an application and the start of services. These capitalized costs comprise incremental costs that would not have been incurred had telecommunications contracts not been obtained. Furthermore, when capitalizing these costs, only the amount expected to be recovered is recognized after taking into account the estimat- ed contract period for the telecommunications contracts. The resulting assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over two to three years in line with the main estimated contract period for users of each service.
The Group determines the recoverability of capitalized contract costs when they are capitalized and reevaluates this each quarter. Specifically, the Group determines whether or not the book value of the assets exceeds the remaining amount of consideration the company expects to receive based on the telecommunications contract over the estimated contract period less the costs directly related to providing the service that have not yet been recognized as expenses. If the scenario used in estimates and assumptions changes, an impairment loss related to the asset is recognized in net profit or loss. This could therefore have a material impact on the value of assets capitalized from contract costs. Accordingly, the Group regards these estimates as material.
The amortization costs incurred from these assets in the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020 amounted to ¥176,228 million and ¥198,880 million (U.S.$1,827 million), respectively , and there were no impairment loss.

32 Financial Instruments
(1) Risk management
The Group’s operating activities are subject to influence from the busi- ness and financial market environment. Financial instruments held or assumed in the course of business are exposed to risks inherent in those instruments. Such risks include (i) Credit risk, (ii) Liquidity risk and (iii) Market risk. The Group has a risk management program in place to minimize effects on the Group’s financial position and results of opera- tions through establishing an internal management system and using financial instruments. Specifically, the Group manages these risks by using methods as described below.
i. Credit risk management
(a) Credit risks of financial assets owned by the Company
Credit risk is the risk that a party to the Group’s financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Group by failing to discharge its contractu- al obligation. Specifically, the Group is exposed to the following credit risks. Trade, lease, other receivables and loans for financial business of the Group are exposed to the credit risk of our customers. The debt securities held for surplus investment are exposed to the issuer’s credit risk related to the deterioration of its financial condition. In addition, derivatives used by the Group to hedge exchange risk and interest rate risk and bank balances are exposed to the credit risk of the financial institutions that are counterparties to these transactions.
(b) Responses to the risk owned by the Company
With regard to credit risks to the customer, the Group has a system in place for assessing credit status as well as performing term administra- tion and balance management for each counterparty based on the credit management guidelines of each Group company.
With regard to lease, other receivables and loans for financial busi- ness, the Group determines there has been a significant increase in credit risk of the financial assets since initial recognition in case the cash collection of the financial assets was delayed (as well as the case of request for grace period) after the trade date. However, even when late payment or request for grace period occurs, the Group does not deter- mine that there has been a significant increase in credit risk if such late payment or request for grace period would be attributable to temporary cash shortage, the risk of default would be low, and the objective data such as external credit ratings reveals their ability to fulfill the obligation of contractual cash flow in the near future.
With regard to debt securities, the Group determines there has been a significant increase in its credit risk since initial recognition when the Group evaluates the risk of default is high based upon rating informa- tion provided by major rating agencies.
Expected credit loss is recognised and measured thorough transac- tions and financial information available in the course of such credit risk management, while taking macroeconomic condition such as the num- ber of bankruptcies and actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the debtor into consideration. Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment.
A default occurs when a debtor to a financial asset fails to make con- tractual payments within 90 days of when they fall due.
• Analysis of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
• Consolidated Financial Statements • Corporate Overview / Stock Information
       106 KDDI CORPORATION | INTEGRATED REPORT 2020
The Group directly writes off the gross carrying amount of the credit- impaired financial assets when all or part of the financial assets are eval- uated to be uncollectible and determined that it is appropriate to be written off as a result of credit check.
The Group’s receivables have no significantly concentrated credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
The Group considers that there is substantially low credit risk resulting from counterparty default because counterparties of the Group’s deriva- tives and bank transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions. For surplus investments and derivative transactions, the finance and accounting department, following internal rules of each Group company and accompanying regulations that prescribe details, arranges to have each transaction approved by an authorized person as designated in the authorization regulation on a transaction-to-transaction basis so that the Group can minimize credit risk. Counterparties to those transactions are limited to financial institutions with high credit rating.
Measurement of expected credit losses on trade receivables
As trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component, the Group measures loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses until the trade receivables are recovered. With regard to performing trade receivables, loss allowance is recognized by estimating the expected credit losses based on historical credit loss experience and forward-looking information for the age of each
trade receivables.
Measurement of expected credit losses on lease, other receivables and loans for financial business
When credit risk related to lease and other receivables has not increased significantly since the initial recognition at the end of the reporting period, the Group calculates the amount of loss allowance of the financial instruments by estimating the 12-month expected credit losses collectively based upon both historical credit loss experience and forward-looking information.
On the other hand, when a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition as of the end of fiscal year is presumed, the Group estimates the lifetime credit losses on the financial instruments individu- ally and measures the amount of loss allowance based on historical credit loss experience and forward-looking information.
Measurement of the expected credit losses on other investments (debt securities)
When credit risk related to debt securities has not increased significantly since initial recognition at the end of the reporting period, the Group calculates the amount of loss allowance of the financial instruments by estimating the 12-month expected credit losses.
On the other hand, when a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition as of the end of fiscal year is presumed, the Group estimates the lifetime credit losses on the financial instruments and measures the amount of loss allowance based on historical credit loss experience and forward-looking information.

        The Group is exposed to liquidity risk that the Group may be unable to meet the obligations such as notes and trade payables.
The Group finances necessary funds through bank borrowings and bond issuances, in the context of its capital expenditure project mainly to conduct tele-
communications businesses. Any excess funds incurred are invested in short-term deposits etc.
Most of the trade and other payables are payable within one year. The Group’s current liabilities including such trade payables are exposed to liquidity risk at
the time of settlement, however, the Group avoids the risk using methods such as monthly financial planning review conducted by each Group company. In addition, to manage liquidity risk, the Group aims for continuously stable cash management through monitoring account activity by preparing monthly cash flow projection, and maintains liquidity at certain level. The Group has short-term deposits etc. which is considered to be readily convertible into cash to address liquidity risk. Please refer to “Note 14. Cash and cash equivalents” for details.
Long-term financing is conducted following approval by the Board of Directors of the annual financial plan prepared by the finance and accounting depart- ment. The Group minimizes its liquidity risk by entering into a number of long- and short-term unextended commitment line contracts with domestic dominant financial institutions and leading financial institutions in foreign countries in addition to uncommitted credit facilities.

iii. Market risk management
 Market risk management consists of (a) Exchange risk management, (b) Interest rate risk management and (c) Price risk management of equity instruments. Certain subsidiary manages market risk by measuring their using risk volume using Value at risk (VaR) on a daily basis and VaR as of March 31, 2020 is ¥1,652 million (U.S.$ 15 million).
(a) Exchange risk
The Group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation risk (“exchange risk”) resulted from translating foreign currency denominated trade receivables arising from transactions that the Group conducted using non-functional currencies into their functional currencies at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of reporting period.
The Group also operates in foreign countries. Currently, the Group is developing international businesses through capital contribution and estab- lishment of joint ventures in Asia (Singapore and China etc.), North America and Europe etc. As a result of these international operating activities, the Group is exposed to various exchange risks primarily related to U.S. dollar, Euro and Hong Kong dollar.
Certain subsidiary hedges exchange fluctuation risk by adopting forward exchange contracts as derivative transactions. The purpose is to fix the exchange fluctuation for broadcasting right related to foreign program. For derivative transactions, the Company develops implementation plans on a transaction-to-transaction basis following internal rules approved by the Board of Directors, and obtains approval as stipulated in the authorization regulation, before conducting the transactions. The Group’s policy is to use derivative transactions only to avoid risk and conduct no speculative transactions in order to gain trading profits.
(i) Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate
Sensitivity analysis of the impact of the 10% appreciation of Japanese yen against U.S. dollar, Euro and Hong Kong dollar at the end of each fiscal year against profit before tax of the Group is as follows.
This analysis is on presumption that all other variables (balance, interest etc.) are held constant, and the sensitivity analysis below does not contain impacts of translation of financial instruments denominated in functional currencies, and impacts of translation of revenues and expenses, assets and liabilities of foreign operations into presentation currency.

 Interest rate risk is defined as the risk that market interest rate fluctuation results in changes in fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows arising from financial instruments. Interest rate risk exposure of the Group mainly relates to payables such as borrowings or bonds, and receivables such as interest-bearing deposits. As amount of interest is influenced by market interest rate fluctuation, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from changes in future cash flows of interest.
The Group finances funds through bond issuance at fixed interest rate in order to avoid future interest payment increase, primarily resulting from rising interest rate.
Certain subsidiaries stabilize their cash flows by using interest rate swap transactions to minimize interest rate risk on borrowings.

¥
 Notes: 1. Since the Group runs the borrowing (hedged item) and interest rate swap transaction (hedging instrument) in the same amount, hedge ratio of interest rate swap transaction is one-to-one.
2. The Group does not have any non-effective portion of the hedge.
(c) Price risk management of equity instruments
Price risk of equity instruments is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk). The Group is exposed to such price risk as it holds equity instruments.
To manage price risk arising from those equity instruments, the corporate finance and accounting department documents policies of investment in the equity instruments and the entire Group complies with those policies. For material investments, it is obliged to report to and obtain approval from the Board of Directors in a timely manner. To manage those equity instruments, the Group continuously reviews its holdings through monitoring market value and financial condition of the issuer (counterparty) taking into account the market condition and the relationship with the counterparty.
(i) Sensitivity analysis of price of equity instruments
Sensitivity analysis of the impact of the 10% decrease of price of equity instruments at the end of each fiscal year against other comprehensive income of the Group (before tax effect) is as follows:
This analysis is on presumption that all other variables (balance, exchange rate etc.) are held constant.
For the year ended March 31 2019 Accumulated other comprehensive income (before tax effect) ¥(8,009)

    (2) Capital management
The Group seeks to realize sustainable medium- and long-term growth and maximize its corporate value. To achieve those objectives, the Group’s basic policy for equity risk management is to maintain ade- quate equity structure while monitoring capital cost, along with
maintaining current fund-raising capability and ensuring financial sound- ness. Major performance benchmarks used by the Group to manage its equity are Ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent and debt / equity ratio (“D/E ratio”).
 Ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent and D/E ratio at the end of each fiscal year are as follows:

As of March 31, 2020, the Group meets the material capital controls applicable to the Group (excluding general rules such as the Companies Act etc.).

 33 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The financial instruments that are measured at fair value are classified into 3 levels of fair value hierarchy according to the observability and signifi- cance of the inputs used for measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:
• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
• Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
The Group determines the hierarchy of the levels on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
(1) The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
i. The hierarchy of the fair value
The following table presents the classification by fair value hierarchy of the financial assets and financial liabilities recognized at fair value on the con- solidated statement of financial position.

 Any significant transfers of the financial instruments between levels are evaluated at each period end. There was no significant transfer of the finan- cial instruments between levels for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020.
ii. Measurement method of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities
(a) Equities
Listed equities are based on the prices on exchange and within level 1 of fair value hierarchy.
Unlisted equities are calculated by the valuation technique based on the discounted future cash flows, valuation technique based on the market prices of the comparative companies, valuation technique based on the net asset value and other valuation techniques, and are within the level 3 of fair value hierarchy. Unobservable input such as dis- count rates and valuation multiples are used for fair value measure- ments of unlisted equities, adjusted for certain illiquidity discounts and non-controlling interest discounts, if necessary.
(b) Securities for financial business
Securities for financial business are measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets if such prices are available, and are classified as level 1 of fair value hierarchy. If such prices are unavailable, they are measured using the prices based on available information like brokered markets and the valuation technique based on the discounted future cash flows using discounted rates reflecting risk free rates and credit spreads, and are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy according to observability of inputs.
iii. Reconciliation of level 3
The following table presents the movement of financial instruments within level 3 for the year ended March 31, 2019.

(c) Derivatives
(i) Exchange contracts
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the end of each fiscal year, with the resulting value discounted back to present value. The financial assets and financial liabilities related to exchange contracts are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(ii) Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are calculated by the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the interest rate adjusted for the remaining period until maturity and credit risk. The financial assets and financial liabilities related to interest rate swaps are classified as the level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(d) Investment trusts
Investment trusts are measured using quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets based on market approach, and are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.

   Fair value measurements of unlisted equities are performed by a management department independent from sales departments in accordance with the prescribed rules. Fair value measurements including fair value models are examined for the adequacy by periodically evaluating the business descriptions and the availability of business plans of the companies issuing the equities, as well as comparative listed companies.
v. Quantitative information related to assets classified as level 3

The fair value of government bonds is estimated based on quoted price. Government bonds are classified as level 1 of fair value hierarchy.
(b) Loans for financial business
The fair value of loans for financial business is measured at the present value calculated by discounting each portion of future cash flows classi- fied by period, for the corresponding remaining maturity using the appli- cable interest rate considering credit risk. Loans for financial business are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(c) Monetary claims bought
The fair value of monetary claims bought is measured using quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets based on market approach and is measured at the present value calculated by discount- ing each portion of future cash flows classified by period, for the corre- sponding remaining maturity using the applicable interest rate considering credit risk. Monetary claims bought are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(d) Borrowings
For borrowings with variable interest rates, the carrying amount is used as fair value, as the rates reflect the market interest rate within a short term and there is no significant change expected in the Group entities’
34 Commitments
(1) Purchase commitments
credit conditions after financing. For borrowings with fixed interest rates, fair value is estimated by discounting the total of principal and interest using the current interest rate adjusted for the remaining maturi- ty period of the borrowings and credit risk. Borrowings are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(e) Bonds payables
For bonds payable with quoted price, the fair value is estimated based on quoted price. For bonds payable without quoted price, the fair value is calculated by the present value of future cash flows discounted using the interest rate adjusted for the remaining maturity period and credit risk. Bonds payables with quoted price are classified as level 1 of fair value hierarchy and bonds payables without quoted price are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.
(f) Deposits for financial business
For demanded deposits of the deposits for financial business, amounts payable on request at the year-end closing date (carrying amount) are considered to represent fair value. The fair value of time deposits is measured at the present value calculated by discounting each portion of future cash flows classified by period. Discount rate is the interest rate used when accepting new deposits. Also, the contract principal and interest of time deposits classified is measured at the amounts after classification. Deposits for financial business are classified as level 2 of fair value hierarchy.

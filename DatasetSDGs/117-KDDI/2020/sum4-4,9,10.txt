Mainly in developing countries in Asia, KDDI is working to help develop industry by pro- viding inexpensive high-quality telecommunications services and upgrading telecom- munications infrastructure with the aim of ensuring there are no residents living outside of our telecommunications area. In Myanmar, from 2014, we have worked to upgrade the telecommunications service environment through a joint business with Myanma Posts & Telecommunications (MPT) and Sumitomo Corporation, thereby contributing to the development of the country. As of March 31, 2020, MPT was No. 1 in market share.
In Mongolia, we have been operating the comprehensive communications carrier MobiCom Corporation LLC since its founding in 1995. Every year, the company is selected for the Top 100 Mongolian Companies, which are chosen by the Mongolian government and Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 2019, the company was awarded 17th place, the highest placement among telecommunications providers, signaling a high evaluation.

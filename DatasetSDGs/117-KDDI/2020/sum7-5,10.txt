KDDI declared “embracing diversity” as part of the KDDI Group Philosophy and is working to continue building an organization that leverages diversity.
To promote the advancement of women, we set a target of hiring 200 female line managers as of March 31, 2021, and are conducting various training, mentoring, and career design programs.
KDDI promotes the employment and advancement of people with disabilities. We maintained an employment rate of 2.53% for people with disabilities, which is above the legally mandated level, as of June 1, 2020, by establishing a special subsidiary to contract KDDI’s operations and expanding the range of activities, such as operating cafés at offices. We are also proactively working to quickly address LGBT issues. For example, the “au” Family Discount can also be applied to same-sex partners, and internal systems treat same-sex partners and their children as family members.
As an operator who has a public mission, we will continue helping realize a diverse and inclusive society by providing a work environment and services that respect diversity.

In a society undergoing rapid digitization, a huge responsibility for telecommunications providers is to build a safer society where privacy and security are protected. With adoption of smartphones and cellphones widespread and increasingly younger people using them, KDDI respects UNICEFâ€™s Convention on the Rights of the Child and has been offering the KDDI Smartphone and Mobile Phone Safety Classes at elementary, middle, and high schools across Japan since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. These classes provide children with the means to use their own judgment to avoid risks, enabling them to safely and securely use smartphones and mobile phones.
The cumulative number of classes held is around 33,000, with attendees exceeding 6,110,000. In addition, we hold courses for seniors to learn basic phone functions and ways to use phones safely and securely. These classes have reached a cumulative total of around 1,500, with approximately 27,000 attendees. Going forward, we will continue to carry out these initiatives aimed at building a safe, rich, digital society.

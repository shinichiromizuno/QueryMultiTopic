As a KDDI Sustainable Action initiative, KDDI proclaimed its aim of zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Because our businesses possess large-scale infrastructure, we need to ensure both environmental pro- tection and sustainable business operations.
To achieve these dual goals, we must conduct a full-scale review of our energy consumption and take measures to deploy new technologies. We have been working to reduce electric power use by installing an efficient air-conditioning control system and a more efficient interflow and direct flow transformer in 2019. Furthermore, we have begun to consider using fuel cell batteries and installing new energy-efficient air-conditioning technology. In addition, as a medium- to long-term initiative, we review power distribution technology and develop power storage technology. Going forward, we will continue these unceasing efforts to help reduce CO2 emissions for society as a whole.

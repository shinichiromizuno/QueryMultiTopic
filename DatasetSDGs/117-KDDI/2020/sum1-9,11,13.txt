KDDI is aiming to enhance mobile telecommunications quality and realize a society that can fully utilize high-quality telecommunications by providing reliable fixed-line and internet services. In the Operations Division, we will continue working together to monitor network operations to enable the provision of telecommunications as a lifeline during natural disasters.
Effects from COVID-19 have driven an increase in teleworking and other data use, along with rapid changes in telecommunications use in Japan. Although overall telecommunications traffic volume has not been affected, daytime fixed-line telecommunications traffic has increased by up to 63%. KDDI has therefore swiftly taken measures to maintain the telecommunications environment. In addition, we fulfilled our social responsibility as a telecommunications operator by working to safely provide a telecommuni- cations environment to the many passengers, crew members, and health care providers on the large cruise ship that arrived in the Port of Yokohama in February 2020.
Going forward, we will continue helping every day to build safe and secure social foundations through telecommunications.

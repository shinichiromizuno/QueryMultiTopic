Aichi 2020 Environmental Action Plan 
We formulated the Aichi 2020 Environmental Action Plan, a statement of policies and plans for environmental actions from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020. The plan adopts three core themes for the direction of our environmental action based on environmental management: “building a low-carbon society,” “building a resource-recycling society” and “achieving harmony with nature.” By reinforcing management from a global perspective that extends to consolidated subsidiaries, we are contributing, as a sustainable company, to society and the global environment.

The Aichi Steel Group has established medium- to long-term targets around three environmental issues—“building a low-carbon society,” “building a resource-recycling society” and “achieving harmony with nature”—and is working to achieve those targets. Through these efforts, we are achieving efficient use of energy and resources and, through harmony between the global environment and manufacturing and by providing products and services with low environmental impact, we are contributing to a sustainable global environment.

Environmental activity promotion system 
We formulated the “Environmental Action Plan” in June 1993, and the “Aichi Steel Environmental Charter” in June 1996. In order to achieve our goals, we are actively rolling out new initiatives. In light of the increasing global trend to ban, restrict, and control certain chemical substances contained in products, we revised the “Aichi Steel Environmental Charter” and management system in February 2017 to strengthen our management of chemical substances. 
Environmental guidelines 
In order to promote environmental management activities, we have drawn up a set of Environmental Management Regulations. Its content can be broadly divided into four parts: 1) Items related to promoting environmental management; 2) Items related to compliance with and management of environmental regulations (laws, ordinances, agreements,

In order to promote these revisions, we have established a new organizational system. The Environmental Working Group now oversees four subcommittees, the Global Warming Prevention Committee, the Aichi Steel Group Environmental Committee, and promotes a variety of activities aimed at environmental conservation. In addition, we are currently working to ensure that all consolidated subsidiaries that operate production sites are ISO 14001-certified.

Fiscal 2019 targets and results 
Based on the “Aichi 2020 Environmental Action Plan,” we pursued reductions in carbon dioxide to achieve the targets of “The Japan Iron and Steel Federation’s Commitment to a Low Carbon Society” (Phase 1). Total CO2 emissions were reduced through a combination of reduced production and improved operations.

■ Factors behind changes since last fiscal year 
Participation in “All-Toyota Green Wave Project” activities 
Aichi Steel is participating in the “All-Toyota Green Wave Project” activities being implemented by the Toyota Group and other affiliated companies as part of efforts to coexist with nature. This project includes a range of activities to “connect communities toward harmony with nature.” We are undertaking activities that contribute to restoration of ecosystems by connecting people with other people and activities and linking habitats. 
▲Participation in All-Toyota activities (maintenance of Izu-numa, a wetland area registered under the Ramsar Convention) 
* Molten slag cooling down material: A car recycling sub-material that is added to control the slag components, reduce the temperature as a cooling material, and curtail explosive boiling. 
Forest-developing volunteers 
We use large amounts of water in our steel production. For this reason, since 2006 we have carried out twice-yearly forest cultivation activities in Nagano Prefecture, which is the source of Aichi Prefecture’s service water. We recruit volunteer employees to take part in improvement cutting and thinning activities aimed at creating healthy forests, and in the process deepen our interactions with local residents. In 2019, we signed an Adopt-A-Forest Promotion Program agreement with Otaki Village in Nagano Prefecture to develop a broad area of about 12 hectares of forest into the FOREST of AICHI STEEL GROUP.

Energy saving through logistics optimization 
In accordance with the Energy Saving Act revised in April 2006, we have been working on efficient environmentally-friendly logistics optimization activities after understanding the flow of distribution and reviewing issues. 
More specifically, we are visualizing off-premise logistics routes and volumes, and promoting logistics improvements 
Contributions to end-of-life car recycling 
In accordance with the End-of-Life Car Recycling Act, which came into effect in 2005, the Toyota Group has been working towards total recycling. Aichi Steel is cooperating with Toyota Metal Co., Ltd. to improve recycling and develop recycling technology for glass parts, which have been the most difficult. 
We introduced silica sand into steel making slag generated in electric furnaces as a molten slag cooling down material*, 
from the perspective of streamlining routes, modal shifts (from land transport to sea transport), and improving loading rates. 
From fiscal 2006 to 2019, we achieved a 17% reduction in CO2 emissions per unit from logistics. 
but we focused on the similarities between silica sand and the glass components and made it possible to achieve the same effects by mixing silica sand with waste glass, and it is now possible to recycle waste glass as a car recycling sub-material. 
As a result, the end-of-life car recycling rate increased to 99.8%. 
Forestation to create a forest for beetles 
Since fiscal 2012, we have been creating a forest for beetles. We have been planting a broadleaf forest in about 20,000 m2 of Nakashinden green spaces around our plant and creating an environment in which beetles and other creatures can live their natural life cycles. We have been working with the Chita Peninsula Ecosystem Network Council and members of the Student Action Committee NPO to grow the trees. In fall every year, we also hold a large harmony-with-nature event called “Mori Mori event” where employees and their families participate in various activities, including programs held in collaboration with other organizations and companies, tree cultivation activities, release of rare medaka (Japanese rice fish), and planting of wheat. 
We have also started new initiatives in addition to the 
Nakashinden green spaces. We are currently developing an ecosystem network across the entire Chita Peninsula, cultivating trees using bamboo charcoal from bamboo groves we are maintaining at the town of Mihama, and an initiative in collaboration with the Higashiura Natural Environment Learning Forest to jointly research the beetles and foxes that are attracted to, and symbolic of, Nakashinden green spaces.

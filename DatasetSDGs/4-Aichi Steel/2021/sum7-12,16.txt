  Executive management structure changed to strengthen governance
 To create a governance system that can handle difficult competitive environments, we changed our executive management structure to focus on “roles” that can achieve faster decision-making and speedier business execution.
We started by eliminating the original Officer and Executive Officer positions, establishing a new Executive Officer position that sits above Senior Chief as an employee position, and
Roles of each position
reducing executive ranks and numbers from 34 to 12 to simplify the structure. In addition to the roles of General Manager and Company President, we established a new Officer position, instead of the previous person in charge of a division, in order to further accelerate decision-making and business execution.
Evolution of corporate governance
Over the years, Aichi Steel’s corporate governance structure has constantly evolved to improve the effectiveness of the directors and strengthen governance to manage businesses with a high level of fairness, transparency, and efficiency. With the rapidly changing business environment of recent years, from the once-in-a-century transition of the automotive industry to efforts toward carbon neutrality, we have implemented further reforms, including simplification of the executive management structure and adoption of a new Executive system, to accelerate decision-making and business execution. Going forward, we will continue these efforts to accurately understand the business environment and strengthen governance.

Corporate governance structure
Aichi Steel uses an Audit & Supervisory Board. This system concentrates authority and responsibility for business execution to the Board of Directors, as the ultimate body for management decision making, and assigns the role of audit and supervision of the Board of Directors to the Audit & Supervisory Board and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, which are independent of the Board of Directors and business execution. We believe this system achieves appropriate management decisions and execution of duties while providing sufficient organizational checks and balances.
We employ two independent outside Directors and two outside Audit and Supervisory Board Members, with extensive experience and broad insights as managers, who supervise and audit the execution of duties of the directors, and we develop systems that function effectively to ensure objectivity and neutrality of management oversight.
Internally, we also develop and properly operate systems to ensure the appropriateness of our operations in line with the Internal Control System Basic Policy.

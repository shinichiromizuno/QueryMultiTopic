In the case of fires in places where large numbers of people gather, such as office buildings, department stores, schools, and hospitals, fire prevention equipment such as fireproof shutters and doors can stop a fire from spreading for certain period of time, by sealing off areas in response to signals from smoke and heat detectors. Waterproof shutters and doors provide flood prevention functions at the time of typhoons and localized torrential rains, and keep buildings from being inundated. These products protect people and property from disasters, and provide safe spaces.

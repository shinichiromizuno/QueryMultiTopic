To ensure that the Sanwa Groupâ€™s products function properly as access systems, numerous resources are required, from development and production to installation and maintenance. Through efforts to respect human rights and diversity, and ensure health and safety, we are creating workplaces in which all of our stakeholders, including employees, affiliated companies, and suppliers can work with peace of mind, and developing human resources who are capable of driving the growth of the Group. We believe that these initiatives support the foundation of our business and constitute an investment in sustainable growth.

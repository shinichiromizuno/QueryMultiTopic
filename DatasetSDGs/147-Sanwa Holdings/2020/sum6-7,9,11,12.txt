Products such as heavy duty shutters, sheet shutters, and overhead sliders are required to be effective in improving productivity at factories and warehouses by ensuring that workers follow appropriate routes and making the frontlines of production and logistics friendly to both the environment and people.
In addition to fireproofing functions, shutters that open and close rapidly improve work efficiency, and a thermal insulation function that allows temperatures to be managed provides comfortable spaces, contributing to energy saving as environmental products. These products are indispensable for the development of areas such as e-commerce, which have seen significant growth in recent years.

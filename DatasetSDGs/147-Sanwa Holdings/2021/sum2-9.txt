     Performance Test Center supporting manufacturing with the latest equipment and high testing quality
CASE
The Group’s Performance Test Center conducts tests on the Group’s products as well as products procured domestically and overseas to assess quality, performance, and safety, and to evaluate manufacturing technology. Various product tests can be conducted in our own facility utilizing the latest large-scale equipment, enabling the timely development and improvement of products based on requests from customers and society. In addition to acquiring the ISO/IEC17025 certification (an international standard that certifies the technical capabilities of testing laboratories), we centralize and manage highly accurate testing data for use in research and development. We also provide tours from external companies, government agencies, and industry groups, as well as training programs for new employees. We will continue our efforts to raise the level of testing quality to contribute to improved quality in product development and manufacturing.
With one of the world’s largest refractory furnaces, the Performance Test Center conducts fireproof performance tests (preliminary tests for certification and research tests) for fireproof equipment and specified fireproof equipment. Smoke generated in fire resistance tests is discharged after passing through a secondary incinerator to reduce environmental impact.

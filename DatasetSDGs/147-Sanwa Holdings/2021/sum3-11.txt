Continuing to make architectural history with 100 years of stainless-steel technology and manufacturing capabilities CASE
As a pioneer in the field of metal construction products in Japan, Sanwa Tajima, founded in 1918, has been providing entrances, curtain walls, and fittings made of various metals, including stainless steel, copper alloys, aluminum, and titanium, to enhance the value of buildings and improve the appearance of urban areas.
Today, we are also involved in the restoration of historical buildings, for which there are no blueprints, and decorative metalwork for religious buildings, requiring skilled craftsmanship.
These are made possible by the power of manufacturing backed by the technology and experience that Sanwa Tajima has cultivated over the years. We will continue to challenge ourselves with our mastery of technology and new ideas and strive to develop and create
architectural spaces.
In collaboration with Kidsdoor, a non-profit organization that provides learning support to families in need, design department staff of Sanwa Tajima have been teaching art classes to children every year since fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2020, we held activities online, due to the impact of COVID-19, to make Christmas wreaths.

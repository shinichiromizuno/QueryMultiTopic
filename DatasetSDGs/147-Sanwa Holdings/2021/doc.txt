PDCA SAKURA
The employees of the Sanwa Group, not satisfied with the current situation, maintain a critical mindset in doing their jobs in order to continue to pursue their best work. We review results in terms of whether or not we did things as originally planned. If not, we think about the reason why we didn’t get the intended results. Getting back to the basics such as increasing good aspects and improving bad ones is part of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. PDCA SAKURA represents this concept as the Sanwa Group symbol. We even planted PDCA SAKURA cherry blossom trees on the grounds of main Group facilities.

  Message from the Chairman
In messages to our employees, I tell them on various occasions that two kinds of reliability are important for our Group in order to fulfill our mission. Specifically, as a public entity in society, a company is strictly required to have both reliability in achieving performance targets as a listed company, and reliability in its management structure including compliance and governance. We believe that this is similar to the ESG concept, which is now a major trend in the way companies operate around the world.
The world is now facing global issues that cannot be solved by a single country, such as decarbonization, human rights and racial issues. Such issues are no longer problems for the political system alone but should be seen as shared responsibilities of companies operating globally. Companies have set long-term goals for carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and 2050 and through their business are trying to achieve a sustainable society by contributing to correcting inequalities in issues such as human rights among countries and regions.
The Group also feels the need to keep pace with the world toward a sustainable future by boldly tackling these issues in collaboration with customers, partner companies, and other members of the supply chain.
I hope that our shareholders, investors and all of our stakeholders will continue to offer the Group their advice and encouragement.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 1

A History of Value Creation
Manji Takayama founded Sanwa Shutter in 1956 with a fundamental ethos of passion, trust and diligence. Since then, Sanwa Shutter expanded into the door business in the 1960s and thoroughly implemented its “Multi-Product Sales Strategy” into a wide range of product lines. Furthermore, under the leadership of the current Chairman, Toshitaka Takayama, we have added two more pillars through the introduction of our full- time service in the 1980s and initiatives for globalization since the 1990s, thus achieving growth and development based on the three pillars of multi-product sales, globalization, and service. The Sanwa Group formulated its mission, values and principles of business in 2002. Since then, we have continuously passed along the Group spirit of contributing to society by providing safety, security and convenience, all of which are symbolized by the three rings of the corporate emblem.
Entry into the shutter industry
 Sanwa Shutter Manufacturing began manufacturing lightweight shutters in 1956 near the Sanwa Market in Amagasaki, Hyogo. Despite being a latecomer to the market, we established a leading position in the shutter industry in the 1960s. Our production capacity grew to a world-class level with the rapid construction of six factories.

 Multi-Product Sales
First Step toward Multi-Product Sales
The Sanwa Group’s multi-product sales strategy began with its entry into the door business in the late 1960s. Focusing on fields where we could apply the know-how we cultivated in the shutter business, existing production facilities and sales and installation networks, we began producing made-to-order steel doors. We rapidly rose to the top of the industry.
Globalization
Gaining a Foothold Overseas
In 1974, we entered into a technical tie-up with Overhead Door Corporation (North America; ODC), and began manufacturing and selling overhead doors. In 1986, we established Sanwa Shutter (H.K.). in Hong Kong, making us the first in the industry in Japan to focus on overseas markets.
Service
Service is Our Responsibility as a Manufacturer
Shutters play an important role in crime prevention and fireproofing, and we have established an integrated responsibility system from sales, installation, and maintenance. In 1983, the Company deployed the industry’s first 24-hour full-time service nationwide. As a result, a system is now in place to respond immediately to emergency requests.
Expanding the Multi-Product Strategy
We have promoted the multi-product sales strategy through acquisitions to further broaden our value. The first company we acquired was an aluminum facade sales company in 1984. That was followed by the acquisitions of manufacturers of automatic door operators, partitions, and stainless steel building products. By acquiring quality companies with established brands, we accelerated our multi-product sales strategy.
Business Expansion by Penetrating the North American Market
In 1996, we acquired tie-up partner ODC. Through the addition of new businesses boasting leading shares in North America into the Group, we proceeded with collaborative product development and sales, as well as expansion into new markets.
Mandatory Statutory Inspections of Fire Prevention Equipment and Disaster Response Measures
A periodic inspection report system for fireproof shutters and doors became mandatory in Japan due to a partial amendment of the Building Standards Act in 2016. Accordingly, we worked to secure and train service personnel, and strengthened our response to recovery from large-scale natural disasters which have become a frequent occurrence in recent years.
Development of Products that Respond to Climate Change Risks We will launch waterproof and windproof products to respond to increasingly severe natural disasters and strengthen our efforts to reduce the impact of disasters caused by climate change, thereby contributing to the building of a sustainable society.
Establishment of Three-ProngedPlatform: Japan, U.S.A., Europe
In 2003, we acquired Novoferm Group (NF), making the European market our third cornerstone. We started to grow into a leading global brand by pursuing business and regional diversification, in addition to expanding and growing our core businesses through the development of multiple product types.
Expanding Overseas Service Business
NF Group acquired service companies in France and the UK. These acquisitions will expand the service provision areas and allow us to leverage synergies from our existing sales and service network.

Aspiring to be a Major Global Player
Formulating the Sanwa Global Vision 2020 in 2013, we set out to offer products and services that provide safety, security and convenience to customers worldwide as a major global player in the access systems industry.

 President’s Message
  I am committed to working together with our stakeholders to create
a new era of safety, security,
and convenience.
Yasushi Takayama
Representative Director, President
We continue to value our mission to “contribute to society by providing safety, security, and convenience,” which we consider our purpose. We are once again reminded of the vital nature of our mission due to such factors as the recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), heightening climate change risks, and increasing occurrences of disasters.
Our products have protected buildings and the people who live in them against various occurrences. Originally, their main purposes were to protect buildings and people from fires and crimes. However, in recent years, especially in Japan, the intensity of short, sudden, torrential, and concentrated downpours, locally called “guerrilla rainstorms,” and typhoon-force winds has increased. This year, there was unprecedented widespread flooding. Waterproof and windproof products have come to take on greater significance in providing protection against natural disasters.
 Among the things the company has accumulated since its founding, what will change and what will not change in the present era?

P.24-27
The knowledge, experience, and product expertise that we have accumulated through our efforts to date are the assets of the Group, and represent one of the strengths that we have leveraged in our business. The Water Guard and Wind-Resistant Guard series are among the group of products that have seen high demand in response to severe natural disasters. While antibacterial products that are effective for infection control in the current COVID-19 pandemic have existed in our product lineup from before, going forward, I think it is necessary to focus on such non-contact product domains. Specifically, our newly released products include electric toilet stalls and doors equipped with parcel drop-off lockers. There is no doubt that the strengths we have cultivated so far are the reason we can respond quickly to the demands of society in this way. I believe that combining what we have inherited from our predecessors with our unique present-day strengths to implement the PDCA cycle in the field enables us to steadily continue with our operations. We will continue to provide "safety, security, and convenience” in response to the needs of society and strengthen our products that embody our mission.
In fiscal 2020, the focus of our countermeasures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was to ensure the safety of employees and improve the work environment so that they can perform their duties with peace of mind. In addition to screening the health of our employees by measuring their temperatures and disinfecting the office areas, we have thoroughly implemented other basic measures to prevent the spread of infections. They include the installation of plexiglass partitions to prevent respiratory droplets from spreading and recommending to employees that they work from home. It can be said that the pandemic has not had a significant impact on our business as a whole because of the success of each employee's actions in adhering to infection control measures.
One factor behind this is the fact that we had introduced a remote working system before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of our work-style reform initiatives. At present, digitalization has progressed within our Group with the use of the Web and tablet devices, for example. In the case of a construction site, however, it is not realistic to do without visiting the premises. Still, we have introduced a system that enables efficiency and optimization to be practiced in areas such as installation management and digitalization of materials. While there are still many areas to be tackled to support sustainable growth, we are steadily responding to the requirements of adapting to the new normal.
The Company operates in many parts of the world, and each country and region is characterized by a different construction environment.
In Japan, due to the concentration of large-scale property completions in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2020 and 2021 have been an off-season period and there are few urban redevelopment projects. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the service sector, such as hotels and retail, is still struggling, there is an unprecedented surge in demand for large-scale logistics facilities due to the expansion of the e-commerce business. In addition, corporate capital investment is expected to recover, albeit gradually. Based on an analysis of the environment in each of these fields, although we expect to face a little difficulty over the short term, we recognize that overall construction demand in Japan in the medium and long term will hold up over the longer term, due mainly to many redevelopment projects planned from 2022 to 2025 centered in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka.

At the same time, the Group is actively working on a multi-product strategy to expand our strategic product line to include items other than our core products. Although we are making progress with this strategy by strengthening collaboration with domestic group companies, I feel we are still struggling. Moreover, maintenance services, which are an area where we had maintained a high growth rate over the past few years, have been greatly affected by COVID-19 due to restrictions on activities involving person-to-person contact. We are focusing on getting them back on a growth track as soon as possible.
In the U.S., meanwhile, a recovery trend has been seen, beginning as early as last summer. Housing demand is strong in particular, and the market remains robust even in fiscal 2021. In non-residential segments, such as warehousing, the recovery is not yet as good as in the housing sector, but we are expecting recovery driven by housing demand. However, we are not optimistic because of risks and instability factors, including interest rate fluctuations. Furthermore, the introduction of the new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which was temporarily delayed due to the impact of the pandemic, was resumed in stages from 2021 and is currently proceeding smoothly.
Initially, Europe was the region where demand had most markedly slumped. European countries imposed more stringent infection control restrictions than most other regions, which led to a delay in the integration of operations with Robust AB, which we acquired in fiscal 2019. Gladly, with the easing of restrictions, the markets in Europe are beginning to recover, although slowly.
In the Asian region, even though the impact of COVID-19 was limited in fiscal 2020, we see a delay in establishing our business foundation. Because the Asian business is a major pillar of our future global strategy, we will actively invest various management resources and strive for sound business expansion. The Group, as a whole, needs to address the issue of steel prices, which are soaring worldwide, as a top priority. In addition to the main materials such as steel and aluminum, others such as urethane materials and electronic components, as well as logistics costs, need to be adequately addressed.
In the fiscal year under review, we prioritized our response to the COVID-19 pandemic at all our operations globally. And accordingly, we decided to postpone the announcement of our Long-Term Vision and Mid-Term Management Plan by one year in order to complete the strategies and measures that could not be executed. Some strategies could have been implemented, and others could not under the unprecedented circumstances, so based on these, we would like to start anew from fiscal 2022, and we are currently engaged in concrete discussions in that respect.
Additionally, we revised our ESG Materiality Initiatives ahead of formulating our next Long-Term Vision. Our previous set of ESG Materiality Initiatives was focused on responding comprehensively to the demands of society, but under our revised initiatives, we have clarified the fields where we want to direct our attention and renewed the details to focus on those areas. On the issue of climate change, which we regard as especially important, we announced a CO2 emissions reduction target to be achieved by 2030, and we are also proceeding with the formulation of other KPIs to be announced at the same time as the next Mid-Term Management Plan.
From the perspective of adapting to and mitigating climate change risks, we will strive to expand our offerings of products that minimize damage from

typhoons and floods, which are growing in intensity, as well as products featuring improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. In this way, as a goal unique to our company, we want to make a commitment to supply products that help mitigate climate change risks and pursue it as a core business.
In our corporate governance efforts, we set up a voluntary Nomination & Compensation Committee this year to further improve management transparency. We will evolve the remuneration for directors into a form that meets the requirements of the times, such as by changing the stock options-based compensation part to a stock-based compensation scheme with transfer restrictions. In addition, we will look into the diversity of the Board of Directors and continue to work on initiatives to flexibly respond to long-term evolution and change.
First of all, I am truly grateful to all of our employees for their hard work in the unprecedented situation brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are not in a situation where we can let our guard down. We need to tighten our resolve and get through it together. We would also like to express our gratitude again to our installers and design/manufacturing partner companies, and we look forward to continuing to deepen our cooperation with them.
We are committed to the principle of “two kinds of reliability, one Sanwa.” To leave a solid track record and build social credibility, we must be “one Sanwa.” Together with our customers, employees, installers, business partners, shareholders/ investors, and local communities, we will aim to create a sustainable society by continuing to contribute to society and increasing corporate value through our core businesses. I ask you all to please watch for further developments from the Sanwa Group.

 FUTURE CHALLENGES
Setting KPIs
 · Corporate Governance · Compliance
The Group identified 20 ESG materialities in 2019 as issues important to stakeholders and which have a significant management impact on the Group. Since then, amid the growing importance of sustainability worldwide, we conducted a review and re-identified 11 ESG materialities in fiscal 2021, in order to further implement initiatives that will lead to the resolution of social issues through our business activities and the enhancement of corporate value by meeting the expectations of stakeholders.
ESG Materiality
Identification Process
ESG issues are identified based on a comprehensive consideration of international frameworks, external initiatives, and guidelines related to sustainability.
The importance of ESG issues to stakeholders is plotted on the vertical axis, based on weights assigned by research organizations such as the FTSE, MSCI and SASB. The importance to the Group is plotted on the horizontal axis following a management review. A materiality map is created based on these results.
We identified 11 ESG materialities by adding elements related to people who support business activities and drive growth, to the elements derived from the materiality map. We organized them into three themes and the Group’s management.
We plan to set KPIs by comprehensively taking into account our targets and indicators of our Long-Term Vision.

 Financial risks
 Events related to financial risks
 The Sanwa Group is engaged in initiatives to express its endorsement of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).
TCFD recommends the disclosure of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets for climate change-related risks and opportunities therefore, the Group is also promoting initiatives in witch align with the TCFD recommendations.
• Governance: Disclose the organization’s governance of climate-related risks and opportunities. Established the Sustainability Committee to formulate policies for addressing climate change
• Strategy: Disclose the organization’s strategy and impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. Conducted analysis of two scenarios, 2°C and 4°C, and calculated the business impact of each
• Risk management: Disclose the assessment and management of climate-related risks
Established a system for reporting recommendations from the Sustainability Committee to the Board of Directors
• Metrics and targets: Disclose the status of KPIs or target management in response to climate change Metrics: Sanwa Shutter Corporation’s CO2 emissions for Scope 1 + Scope 2
Target: 30% reduction by FY2030 (compared to FY2020)
We will also set targets (for the medium term) for net sales of products that contribute to addressing climate change risks with regard to mitigation and adaptation measures.
The Group ensures stable business management by implementing a Group-wide risk management system and working to predict and prevent potential risks, as well as by responding appropriately through measures to counter risks as required for business continuity.
Major risks
Major risks are categorized into “1. Financial risks” and “2. Risks associated with ESG materiality.” The risks and opportunities for each and their countermeasures are described below.

 Strengths of the Sanwa Group and Progress of the Mid-Term Management Plan
The Sanwa Group has been expanding its business as an access systems company with our three strengths: multi-product sales strategy, globalization, and service. In addition, we will continue to enhance our corporate value based on our ESG materiality, which combines social demands with our strengths.
Third Mid-Term Management Plan
(FY2019-FY2021)
     Multi-product sales strategy
Globalization
The Sanwa Group’s multi-product sales strategy began with its entry into the door business in the late 1960s. Focusing on fields where we could apply the know-how we cultivated in the shutter business, existing production facilities and sales and installation networks, we have launched a wide variety of products as a company offering various
access systems.
In 1974, we entered into a technical tie-up with Overhead Door Corporation (North America; ODC), and have since expanded our business globally to Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Asia. We will continue to enhance our presence in each country, aspiring to be a major global player in the access systems industry.
The Sanwa Group supports its customers at every stage, from product development through sales, design, procurement, manufacturing, installation, maintenance and service. We bring safety, security, and convenience to our end users with our high level of expertise.
We are committed not only to our own growth, but also to addressing social issues. We have set priorities we must address in particular, and we will contribute to achieve a sustainable society through our unique strengths.

 Financial Strategies
   Overview of fiscal 2020
While we had continued to increase sales and profit since fiscal 2011, sales, profit, and other management indicators remained flat or declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact last year of COVID-19, although we did exceed the revised forecast.
In Japan, Sanwa Shutter Corporation and other domestic subsidiaries exceeded the revised forecast in terms of profit due to the effects of cost reductions in manufacturing and logistics, despite the impact of decreased volume. In the U.S., profit fell due to changes in the product mix in some areas, although ODC was able to maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a strong housing market in the second half of the fiscal year led to an
Key Figures
increase in volume. At Novoferm in Europe, results exceeded the revised forecast in terms of profit due to successful cost reductions, despite decreases in sales volume due to the impact of COVID-19.
Based on the above, SVA (Sanwa Value Added) amounted to ¥14.0 billion and ¥13.6 billion in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, respectively. We forecast SVA of ¥14.5 billion for fiscal 2021. ROIC and ROE were not significantly affected, and we will continue with our efforts to increase them. For fiscal 2021, we are setting various targets with the aim of returning to the levels of fiscal 2019 and returning to a growth trajectory.
The Sanwa Group is committed to its mission of offering “products and services that provide safety, security and convenience to further contribute to the prosperity of society.” To realize this mission, we believe it is necessary to provide added value that has sustainable social significance. It has been said for a long time that sustainable growth is important for a company. This remains true today. This unchanging principle has been rooted in the Sanwa Group to present, even before it was demanded by society. Although COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the Group, we will continue to develop strategies that enhance corporate value from both financial and non-financial perspectives.

 Engaging in business with an awareness of capital efficiency
 As the executive in charge of the Corporate Planning Unit, I believe that one of my major roles is to balance financial strategies with the strategies of the business divisions. From the perspective of sustainability, we need to implement a well- balanced strategy over the both the short and long term, in order to achieve sustainable growth.
We have adopted SVA as a management indicator and use it as an indicator of the business performance of each Group company and as one of the decision-making indicators regarding M&As. This is because we believe that maximizing
SVA
the overall balance and efficiency between risk and return and sales and costs will enable us to expand our business while also increasing our corporate value.
We recognize our cost of shareholders' equity to remain at 8.0% and our weighted average cost of capital (WACC) at 6.0%. Meanwhile, our ROE level has been maintained at 10% or higher since 2014 and our ROIC level almost on a par with last year, with a widening spread. We will continue to promote efficient and effective corporate management by accumulating shareholder value and corporate value.
SVA has been adopted as our unique indicator of added value since 2001, with the goal of conducting business operations with an awareness of the expected returns of shareholders and creditors.

 Cash flow and management strategy
The Company will strive to optimize and expand its business by effectively allocating free cash flow and utilizing it for growth investment in equipment efficiency and digitalization and for funding M&As. In fiscal 2020, we invested approximately ¥19.0 billion against our initial target of ¥30.0 billion over the two-year period of the Third Mid-Term Management Plan. This is less than, but not far off, our target amount, due to the acquisition of Won-Door Corp. in the U.S., which was carried out in April 2021. In fiscal 2021, we plan to invest approximately ¥15.0 billion in capital investments,
including strategic investments.
Another option is to pay off our debt as we build up our
assets. However, that would slow our growth rate, and we would be left behind in today’s fast-changing market. It is also said that conducting M&A is to buy time. Given our currently high market share, we are not considering any acquisitions of core products in Japan or the U.S. However, we will continue to allocate assets and funds efficiently and aggressively for investments in order to achieve sustainable growth.

(forecast)
 The Company has reduced its borrowings from banks by about half over the past few years. These are not simply matters of capital cost but rather of overall balance. We also took into consideration factors such as our business transaction relationships, timing of capital needs, and bond issuance when we carried out the reductions.
Based on these factors, our ROE and ROIC for this fiscal year amounted to 12.4% and 15.5%, respectively. Although
there was some feedback advising that we should increase borrowings, reduce equity, increase dividends, and execute share buybacks to further increase ROE, we cannot run our management based on theoretical numbers. Our D/E ratio is about 0.3, and our shareholders' equity ratio is in the 40% range. We believe we have currently achieved a good balance from the perspective of our asset composition and soundness.

Special Feature
Responding to the New Normal
   In work places where employees are required to be physically present, such as offices and factories, we avoided the “three Cs” (closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings) and implemented thorough hygienic practices. In addition, regarding desk work, we introduced mobile PCs in fiscal 2019 to promote
the practice of working remotely and to improve work efficiency. As a result, nearly half of the domestic offices were able to adapt to working remotely under the state of emergency. At the same time, the video conferencing system has been upgraded to realize timely information sharing and smooth communication inside and outside the company.
Even at our overseas locations, we made efforts to ensure social distancing, limit the number of people in conference rooms, and measure employees’ temperatures before work.
The common areas are regularly disinfected, plexiglass partitions were installed in the work space, and other safety measures are carried out thoroughly, such as in the employee cafeterias.

As president, my responsibilities in the region include formulating business strategies, communicating with trade unions, and developing educational programs for employees.
In France, most people have avoided going out amid the COVID-19 pandemic, so demand for improving the home environment, such as purchasing new furniture and securing space for work, has increased. Replacing garage doors turns out to also be among such demands and our
COMMENTS
I am delighted that we have been able to overcome obstacles and work safely

As director of human resources at the corporate office of Overhead Door, my job is to provide personnel support to our employees in multiple departments and to manage the facility.
Since the start of the pandemic, though the majority of our employees have switched to working from home, we still had critical members of the team that needed to be in the office.
As case numbers gradually increased in some areas, we were able to reduce the risk of infection in ways such as by

When France went into lockdown in spring 2020, we
immediately started teleworking and videoconferencing
to ensure employee safety and an uninterrupted response
to customers and suppliers. At the start of the pandemic, I received many offers from employees (by phone and email) to help and work towards a quick return to the workplace and was very encouraged.

keeping down the number of team members in our office and by quickly procuring masks, gloves and other essential personal protective equipment and distributing them to employees who needed to be in the office.
We also had to rethink how we organized the work environment, implementing measures such as social distancing in places like cafeterias where people gather, and restricting the number of people who could occupy meeting rooms. The swift establishment of a remote work procedure and the cooperation of team leaders enabled us to manage employee schedules and monitor productivity.

Representative Director and President, Sanwa Shutter Corporation
Fiscal 2020 Review and Initiatives
In fiscal 2020, We greatly expanded our products lineup, including Water Guard Single-Tight Door with strengthened water proofing performance, the Taifu (wind-resistant) Guard series of high wind-load resistant shutters, and in response to the new normal, a toilet booth that automatically opens and closes its door without contact.
In terms of business performance, sales decreased by 5.2% year on year to ¥199.4 billion, as the spread of COVID-19 caused customers to reduce their budgets for small and medium-sized properties and in the maintenance and service segments. However, orders for core products exceeded the levels of the previous year, thanks to a very favorable reception of newly introduced disaster prevention products by customers and the strong demand for warehouse construction backed by demand from people spending more time at home. As for strategic products, numbers of quotation indicate recovery and growth, although orders did not see an increase due to constraints on proposal sales activities by COVID-19. In terms of Group companies, SUZUKI SHUTTER CORPORATION, which joined the group in the second half of fiscal 2019, has been contributing to our performance for the full year since fiscal 2020.
Meanwhile, the introduction of teleworking made effective progress due to a switchover to mobile PCs, which had been underway since fiscal 2019. In addition, the introduction of a logistics management system contributed to reductions in manufacturing and logistics costs, curbing the impact of the sales decline. These efforts resulted in a year on year decrease of 2.8% in operating income to ¥20.5 billion.
HIGHLIGHTS
Establishment of a New Logistics Building at Ota Door Plant
We established a new logistics building on the premises of Sanwa Shutter’s Ota Door Plant, our main factory for doors, with the aim of increasing logistics efficiency and improving quality through thorough management. In the future, we will utilize it as a logistics base for heavy- duty and lightweight doors in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Further, as an initiative toward decarbonization, we plan to make effective use the roof of the new logistics building to install a solar power generation system.
 Next Fiscal Year and Medium- to Long-term Goals
For fiscal 2021, we extended the Third Mid-Term Management Plan by one year to complete the strategies affected by COVID-19.
Firstly, in terms of product development, we will strengthen our ability to respond to customer needs by further expanding our lineup of climate change-response products and disaster prevention products.
In terms of sales, we will focus on receiving orders for core products in the logistics and warehouse construction market, where demand continues to be strong. In addition, we will strengthen design sales activities through Group collaboration, in order to restore orders for strategic products to full cruising speed. In the maintenance and service business, we will focus on making maintenance and repair proposals that address repairs and deterioration due to age after the statutory inspections, which were postponed during fiscal 2020.
In terms of production, logistics, and installation, we will strengthen our supply capabilities by utilizing the logistics management system and construction schedule management system introduced in fiscal 2020, and by further promoting digitalization. We will also raise installation productivity through improved installation methods, including promoting unit construction, and jig development.
In terms of human resources, we will review and strengthen the education and training systems for sales and installation to quickly enable new recruits to join the workforce and improve their ability to execute operations, and further improve our integrated system of development, sales, design, manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, which is one of our strengths.

Kelly Terry
President & CEO, Overhead Door Corporation
Fiscal 2020 Review and Initiatives
In fiscal 2020, we adjusted our business to cope with the spread of COVID-19, switching to telecommuting as much as possible, and taking other safety measures. In addition, we spent the year rethinking the essence of our products and services. We defined four core values: “Our employees are our greatest strength,” “We focus on improving customer satisfaction as much as possible,” “We always do the right thing,” and “We believe we are outstanding and will build a better future.” In response to a sluggish market, we have managed our costs and cashflow well.
From the second quarter, we saw recovery in demand, including demand for renovations of general housing and a surge in new housing and the resumption of commercial projects. Strong performance of new products such as wall- mounted door openers and other related products, increased market share of our main products due to improved service provision, and reductions to operating expenses made in the early days of COVID-19, all contributed to higher operating income than expected, with sales not declining as much as initially estimated.
HIGHLIGHTS
Acquisition of Won-Door Corporation
In April, we acquired Won-Door Corporation, a major manufacturer of fire and crime prevention doors. The company has unique technologies such as accordion horizontal sliding doors, which can handle complex openings. With this acquisition of Won-Door, we will further expand our North American door business as it complements the Group’s business domains and will allow us to take advantage of synergies with Overhead Door’s U.S. sales network. Along with Horton Automatics, Won-Door will form Overhead Door’s Pedestrian Access Solution division, through which we plan to implement strategic integrated operations.

In fiscal 2021, we will mark the 100th anniversary of Overhead Door Corporation’s founding in Hartford City, Indiana. We want to make it a year to celebrate our success to date, commemorating the history of our company, an industry pioneer that invented the overhead door in 1921, the electric garage door opener in 1926, and the automatic sliding door in 1954. In addition, to succeed in the post-COVID world, we have started to invest in tools and human resources, including revisions to our go-to-market (GTM) model.
In the residential sector, we are focused on expanding distribution through specialized channels, design development that has grasped the trends in home renovation, setting up dedicated teams in CRM and consumer sales, significantly bolstering retail and Internet sales, and continuing to develop related smart home technologies. In the non- residential sector, we will expand market share and increase dealer loyalty by introducing new products for warehouses and specific industries, building a team of business development and sales specialists focused on specific and growing industries, evolving our distribution model, and focusing on selling low-cost products using Horton’s products.
We will continue our strategic approach of strengthening our core business by improving our facilities and expanding our scope of business to new products and adjacent fields.

  Pursuing new growth with an extensive line-up and digitalization of customer service
Rainer Schackmann CEO, Novoferm Group
Fiscal 2020 Review and Initiatives
In fiscal 2020, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. With severe lockdowns in several countries and the temporary disruption of all business in Europe, the momentum of growth in recent years unfortunately could not be maintained. However, thanks to the strong second half, we were able to cover our losses in the first half.
Also, the promotion of operational digitalization, which we began in 2019, produced substantial results, especially given the current situation where contact with people must be minimized even when providing services to customers. Our digital network with customers expanded significantly in a short period of time, leading to optimization of our services with a view to the near future. Our growth in Europe from 2021 onwards will be supported by this digital advantage that we cultivated this year.
In addition to these measures, we will introduce new products in almost all areas, in an ongoing effort to expand our market share. Further, we will aim for growth and further expansion in the European region by leveraging synergies with the now integrated Robust Group.
HIGHLIGHTS
Launch of Fireproof Sliding Doors
Novoferm has launched fireproof sliding doors jointly developed by four companies (Riexinger in Germany, Lutermax in France, Alsal in Spain, and Schievano in Italy). The doors are installed in underground and multistory parking lots, and the panels move smoothly and can be opened and closed quickly.
Previously, fire resistance standards and specifications differed in each country in Europe, but in 2019, a Europe-wide fire resistance standard came into effect. Novoferm’s fireproof sliding doors meet this standard, making them usable across Europe. Going forward, we plan to manufacture and sell them throughout the Novoferm Group’s whole region.
 Next Fiscal Year and Medium- to Long-term Goals
To meet our growth goals for the next few years, we will strongly drive the digitalization of our customer service process. In today’s increasingly complex world, it is essential to meet customers’ need to obtain products easily and quickly. The network connecting suppliers and customers is advancing and expanding, and transactions are accelerating more and more. Digitalization reduces error costs and increases time benefits through closer collaboration with those involved.
In addition to high-quality product solutions, networking with building management systems plays an important role. We will focus on this very thing and establish a position as the preferred partner of industry, beyond our framework as a manufacturer. In addition to bolstering our presence in key markets in Western Europe, we will also expand to Eastern Europe and regions adjacent to Europe. Based on our solid brand strength and comprehensive portfolio of high-quality product solutions, Novoferm is well equipped for the next step.

Fiscal 2020 Review and Initiatives
In fiscal 2020, even with the effect of having newly brought Suzuki Shutter (HK) into the scope of consolidation, sales increased only slightly to ¥6.6 billion due to delays in frontline progress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating income decreased to a loss of ¥539 million due to operating losses at Vina-Sanwa (Vietnam) and Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door (China), but excluding special factors, we expect to return to the black with profitable growth from the next fiscal year onwards.
With regard to the joint venture system that had been ongoing in Vietnam, in June 2021, we converted from a collaborative structure with a local company to exclusive ownership with the aim of rapid business strategy rollout.
In China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Indonesia, we are investing in capital to increase production capacity and further reduce costs.
Next Fiscal Year and Medium- to Long-term Goals
Looking ahead to our Vision 2030, which begins in fiscal 2022, we established a new company in China called Sanwa Novoferm Door (Changshu) Co., Ltd. at the beginning of the year. We aim to complete the construction of a door plant by the end of fiscal 2021 and gain market share by doubling our production capacity of hinged doors. In addition, we have started to consider establishing a new plant in order to expand our business performance in the South China area, including Hong Kong.
At Vina-Sanwa (Vietnam), we will make a large-scale new capital investment for a door production system that meets new fire resistance standards, and at An-Ho Metal Industrial (Taiwan), we will introduce new production facilities by the end of fiscal 2021 to increase production capacity for hinge doors. At Pt Sanwamas Metal Industry (Indonesia), we plan to introduce new shutter facilities.

  Synergies among Japan, Europe, the U.S., and Asia
E-commerce is expanding continuously, and as a result, the demand for large logistics warehouses is increasing around the world. Products installed in warehouse openings vary from country to country, but dock levelers are marketed in China, the ASEAN region, and the United States using the earlier European specifications.
Different from fire protection standards in Japan and the U.S., where flame shielding performance is central, in Europe and Asian countries other than Japan, heat shielding performance is emphasized in addition to flame shielding. At the same time, demand for heat shielding performance is rapidly increasing in China, Hong Kong, and ASEAN countries. Accordingly, we are developing standard specifications common to Greater China and ASEAN countries based on heat shielding doors for the European market, which have a proven track record.
In particular, we have received high evaluations for transparent (see-through) shutters supplied to stores in the Hong Kong market, and we have received and are discussing requests to supply equivalent products for stores in North America. Although there are these country-specific characteristics, we are often able to roll out products from the preceding regions to other regions, and we are developing products and accumulating know-how as a group.
Local Management
In the future, we would like to entrust management to local human resources who are familiar with local market characteristics, business practices, and the labor environment. Then, it couldn’t be better if on top of that they share the Sanwa Group’s corporate culture and compliance awareness.
At present, we entrust management in the Asian region to personnel dispatched from Japan, but in addition to the language barrier, these personnel can be unfamiliar with local circumstances, which is not the best management situation for producing results. Regardless of whether the management structure uses local personnel or dispatched personnel, strong involvement of the head office in risk management has become indispensable.
In order to ensure this, we believe that it will be an important issue in the future to ensure that the head office organization functions reliably in product assurance, development and manufacturing guidance, accounting and tax audits, IT system guidance, and compliance guidance.
Medium- to Long-term Policy from Next Fiscal Year
We intend to aim for a structure that enables speedy product development that anticipates market needs. With building materials products such as doors and shutters, which have large differences in the required specifications for each market, it is not practical to develop or provide products that are completely the same worldwide as with automobiles and electronics.
However, if we were to practice hit-or-miss product development with a different design philosophy in each country, we would lag behind in terms of development speed and, at the same time, it would become difficult to thoroughly enforce quality assurance. In addition, in order to enable the development of climate change-response products, which is a global trend, we believe that we must not only enhance the R&D functions of companies in our overseas business, but also have a strong technology development force in the head office organization that can lead the product development of overseas operating companies.

- Solve Social Issues Through Our Business -
Recently, SDGs and other initiatives aimed at the realization of a sustainable society are becoming widespread around the world. In addition, there are increasing needs for preparedness and resilience in order to protect and support safety and security in people’s lives, due to the impact of natural disasters caused by climate change and infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is a wide range of areas where our manufacturing can contribute to building a sustainable and resilient society. The Group’s products, including shutters, doors, and partitions, are designed to prevent, protect, and separate. We will strive to solve social issues through our technology and quality while sustainably improving our corporate value.

   Ensuring and improving quality
The Group works to improve quality and safety, the primary responsibilities of a manufacturer, in all processes from development to sales, production, installation and maintenance. We recognize it is essential to ensure the quality of installation and maintenance, in addition to the quality of the products themselves, in order to ensure that each customer and user can continue to use our access systems, such as shutters and doors, with peace of mind. We will continue with our efforts to improve quality by conducting quality audits and improvement activities, strengthening our management structure and enhancing our skill levels.
The Group, which has a diverse range of global products, lacks uniformity in terms of the characteristics of its business and the products it handles. Therefore, we use product accident numbers, complaint numbers and the amount of related losses as quality indicators in Japan, and the ratio of complaint cost to net sales as quality indicators overseas. Based on these indicators, we strive to make improvements by promoting specific measures such as IT-based quality control, cross- divisional quality meetings, and education and training programs.
In fiscal 2020, we also conducted a customer satisfaction survey among users of our repair request receiving service. We will utilize the results of this survey to improve the quality of our services, including repair services, and further enhance customer satisfaction.
The Sanwa Group’s Quality Objectives
 1. Improve product safety

  CASE
As a pioneer in the field of metal construction products in Japan, Sanwa Tajima, founded in 1918, has been providing entrances, curtain walls, and fittings made of various metals, including stainless steel, copper alloys, aluminum, and titanium, to enhance the value of buildings and improve the appearance of urban areas.
Today, we are also involved in the restoration of historical buildings, for which there are no blueprints, and decorative metalwork for religious buildings, requiring skilled craftsmanship.
These are made possible by the power of manufacturing backed by the technology and experience that Sanwa Tajima has cultivated over the years. We will continue to challenge ourselves with our mastery of technology and new ideas and strive to develop and create
architectural spaces.
In collaboration with Kidsdoor, a non-profit organization that provides learning support to families in need, design department staff of Sanwa Tajima have been teaching art classes to children every year since fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2020, we held activities online, due to the impact of COVID-19, to make Christmas wreaths.

 Manufacturing - Solve social issues through our business -
 Mitigate/adapt to climate change, prevent disaster loss through products and services
Basic approach
The Group addresses the issue of climate change from two approaches: “mitigation” to reduce emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, and “adaptation” to respond to various phenomena that arise as a consequence of climate change. We believe that developing and providing products based on these two approaches will enable us to respond to the risks and create new markets for changing
needs. Floods and wind damage are said to be becoming riskier as climate change progresses. In addition to addressing them, we believe that solving the issues of fires, earthquakes, and other disasters that interfere with our mission a “safe, secure, and convenient” society through our products and services will lead to the realization of sustainable and livable communities.
   Products that contribute to addressing climate change
   Mitigation
The “mitigation” of climate change is to curb the progress of global warming by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
We are contributing to energy reduction in factories and warehouses around the world by developing products that meet the needs of each region in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Asia. These products include high-speed sheet shutters that improve the air-conditioning efficiency of factories and warehouses with their fast opening and closing speeds, and dock levelers that match the height of truck beds at receiving docks to control the inflow of outside air and the outflow of indoor air. Because strict energy-saving and heat-insulating performance are required for Europe, almost all NF Group sectional doors have excellent heat-insulating performance through the use of heat-insulating materials and double-layered panels.
Sanwa Shutter Corporation also offers a lineup of freestanding garages with rooftop greening systems that not only enhance the landscape, but also absorb carbon dioxide, as well as shutter gates for residential use that open and close using solar energy.
High-speed sheet shutters Dock levelers “Coffret Garden” rooftop greening system
Flooding damage caused by large-scale typhoons and localized downpours is increasing due to the impact of climate change. Sanwa Shutter Corporation and SUZUKI SHUTTER CORPORATION offer a wide range of waterproof products such as shutters, doors, and panels designed for inundation depth and installation location.
In addition, as countermeasures against the risk of wind damage associated with the progression of climate change, Sanwa Shutter Corporation is reducing disaster risk at various openings with high-strength shutters and high wind pressure-resistant window shutters that use wind-resistant hooks and wind-resistant guide rails, and ODC with garage doors and wind-resistant window products that have obtained building standard certifications in Florida, a hurricane-prone region.
      Adaption
The “adaption” to climate change refers to responding to the impact of climate change and making preparations to avoid or reduce the damage.

Products that contribute to disaster prevention measures
   Fires
Fires can destroy precious homes, property, and sometimes lives in an instant. It is crucial to minimize damage in the event of a fire.
Earthquakes
Although large-scale earthquakes such as a Nankai Trough Earthquake are expected to cause even more serious damage than that caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, it is impossible for anybody to predict when and where such major earthquakes will occur.
Power outages can occur when flying objects damage electric cables, power poles collapse due to landslides or lightning damages electric cables. It is essential to make regular preparations for lifelines.
The Group's fireproof shutters, fireproof doors, and other fire prevention equipment, as well as fireproof glass partitions, contribute to preventing the spread of fire and creating safe spaces in the event of a fire in office buildings, commercial facilities, schools, hospitals, and other places worldwide where large numbers of people gather.
The horizontal sliding fireproof doors of Won-Door, which joined the ODC Group in April 2021, can be used for openings with complex shapes including curves.
In Japan, in response to a legislated periodic inspection report system for fire prevention equipment, we are striving to maintain the disaster prevention functions of social infrastructure by securing and training fire prevention equipment inspectors.

 In Japan, an earthquake-prone country, it is crucial to have regular countermeasures in place to reduce damage risks. Sanwa Shutter Corporation’s heavy-duty shutters are equipped with anti-sway braces on the shaft bearings and anti-sway collars on both sides of the take-up shaft as standard specifications, in order to reduce the risk of shutter curtains falling. We also have a lineup of earthquake-proof sliding entrance doors that can be opened even if the door frame is bent by an external force such as an earthquake, and self-assembly partitions that ensure privacy in evacuation centers.

 Power outages are inevitable during various natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, and downpours.
Sanwa Shutter Corporation’s shutter power supply system enables users to open the electric shutters even in the event of a power outage by a connection to a battery or power generator. This system can be utilized as a business continuity plan (BCP) measure.
Furthermore, in California, which is prone to natural disasters, it is mandatory for garage door openers to have a battery backup installed. ODC’s battery backup product complies with this regulation.

The Group views human resources as its most important management resource and focuses on the development of human resources capable of creating value by enhancing systems and a work environment that enable each and every employee to maximize their capabilities.
Through efficiency improvements in line with the promotion of digitalization including automated processing of routine tasks, NF Germany aims to maximize the utilization of human resources by transferring resources previously spent on routine tasks to high value-added tasks, such as the development of a training system that will lead to increased corporate value.
In addition, the smartphone application Novo Docu introduced in 2019 covers about 3,000 pieces of information, including catalogs, installation manuals, videos, CAD screens, and product reference prices for all products handled by NF Germany. The application allows employees and installers to smoothly access the information they want, regardless of time or location, and assists them in acquiring knowledge and improving work efficiency.
Sanwa Shutter Corporation is making efforts to pass on the skills of experienced senior workers by having them accompany younger employees on installation and repair visits. Sanwa Shutter is also working to quickly develop its in-house technical staff, whose recruitment began in 2013.
In addition, as part of our global competence development efforts, we are systematically developing human resources who can play active roles on a global scale through our overseas trainee system and the dispatch of employees to overseas Group companies.
CLOSE-UP
(Sanwa Shutter Corporation)
As a company engaged in manufacturing, the Group recognizes that ensuring the health and safety of all people involved in our business activities, including employees, affiliated companies’ employees, and installers is fundamental to our sustainability and our responsibility as a Company.
In order to provide safe, secure, and convenient products and services to customers throughout the world, we believe it is important that our employees and their families are able to lead healthy as well as fulfilling lives, both in their private and working lives.
In order to achieve the priority target of “eliminating all serious injuries and fatalities” and to eradicate occupational accidents, the Group is striving to provide safety education and ensure adherence to rules in line with the annual health and safety action plan, share incidents that nearly become accidents, and improve the work environment to reduce workloads.
At ODC, safety meetings are held monthly to be attended by safety personnel from each plant, where indicators such as the number of occupational accidents are shared and active
discussions are held
on the causes and
countermeasures for
accidents that have
occurred.

Evaluations of Board of Directors’ Effectiveness
The Company has been conducting a questionnaire on the effectiveness of the Board of Directors after the conclusion of the last Board of Directors’ meeting of each fiscal year since the end of fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2020 as well, we obtained responses from all directors, and at the first Board meeting in the following fiscal year, they analyzed and evaluated effectiveness based on the response results. As a result, although there were issues raised, we evaluated that our Board of Directors is functioning effectively. Going forward, we will continue to make improvements to enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.

Specific Measures for Enhancing Business Execution and Supervisory Function
   Management Conference
In accordance with the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure, from the perspective of speeding up management decisions a director was entrusted to make “significant decisions concerning business execution,” excluding matters prescribed by law. Consequently, set up as an advisory body to the delegated director, a Management Conference deliberates and reports on important management issues, and assists the Executive Officer, President in making decisions and strengthening the flexibility of business execution. Discussing (1) matters concerning important business execution decisions delegated by the Board of Directors to the Executive Officer, President, (2) matters deemed necessary by the Executive Officer, President from among the Board of Directors’ meeting agenda items, and (3) other important, management-related matters deemed necessary by the Executive Officer, President, the Management Conference works in conjunction with the Board of Directors in the making of quick and efficient management decisions.
Audit & Supervisory Committee
The Audit & Supervisory Committee met a total of 9 times in fiscal 2020. The directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members monitor the status of business execution by directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members and other executive officers, and report and express their opinions. In this way, we work to ensure legal and appropriate corporate management. We believe the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee has contributed to improving the supervisory function and transparency of the Board of Directors, and thus demonstrates the effectiveness of the Board.

The committee, which was established in January 2021, consists of three or more members selected by resolution of the Board of Directors, and the majority of the members are independent outside directors. The committee, in response to consultation from the Board of Directors, advises the Board of Directors on matters concerning proposals for the election of candidates for directors, etc., the compensation of directors, etc., and the calculation method for individual compensation.
Detailed Supervision/Audits of Business Execution
by Group and Regional PDCA Councils
Group and Regional PDCA Council consists of directors, executive officers and other senior management officers (independent outside directors excluded). At the councils, which convene on a quarterly basis, directors oversee the progress of management plans and provide guidance on management issues, while the directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members audit the status of business execution by executive officers.
Sustainability Committee
The Sustainability Committee is chaired by the Representative Director and President and consists of senior management including directors and executive officers. The committee works to deliberate and promote Group-wide sustainability policies, etc., by focusing on the Group’s quality, risk management, compliance, and social contribution, as well as the increasingly important issue of global environment conservation, and sustainability issues (medium- to long-term sustainability on a global scale) including respect for human rights, work-style reforms, and gender equality.

Directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members
Matters Related to Policies for Determining Amounts of Compensation of Officers or Calculation Methods Thereof Compensation of directors, etc. is intended to contribute to continual improvement of the Company’s business performance and corporate value. The Company designs its compensation system so that the level and structure of compensation are in accordance with the roles and responsibilities required of the Company’s directors, and enable the recruitment and retention of well-qualified people. The compensation of directors consists of base compensation, performance-linked compensation, and restricted stock compensation. However, the compensation of directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members and independent outside directors consists only of base compensation. Furthermore, as a general rule, compensation is not paid to part-time directors (who are paid compensation from consolidated subsidiaries). The total amount of base compensation and performance-linked compensation and the total amount of restricted stock compensation shall be within the total amount determined at the General Meetings of Shareholders.
The details of the policy for determining the compensation, etc. for individual directors are as follows.
a. Base compensation
The base compensation for each director is set for each position based on consolidated performance with reference to the compensation levels of other companies presented by a specialized outside organization and is paid monthly.
b. Performance-linked compensation
Performance-linked compensation is monetary compensation for business execution during the term of office (one year) of directors. A standard amount is set for each executive position based on the Company’s consolidated performance with reference to the compensation levels of other companies presented by a specialized outside organization. The standard amount of this type of compensation is determined by taking into account standard amount indicators and the levels of contribution of each director, evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, and the compensation is paid during the fiscal year following the current fiscal year. As far as serving as a reward that functions as a sound incentive for sustainable growth that reflects the Company’s business performance is concerned, consolidated operating income has been selected as the primary indicator of performance-linked compensation.
c. Non-monetary compensation (restricted stock compensation)
The restricted stock compensation plan is a stock compensation plan aimed at providing incentives to directors for sustainable improvement of the corporate value of the Company as well as promoting further value sharing between directors and
shareholders.
Directors, excluding independent outside directors and
directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members, are eligible, and the specific allocation to each eligible director is decided based on a resolution by the Company’s Board of Directors. Each eligible director shall, by making a contribution in kind of all monetary compensation claims to be provided for granting restricted stock each fiscal year, receive an allotment of common stock of the Company. Furthermore, restricted stock compensation shall be granted as compensation for duties performed during the term of office (one year) of directors within one month after the conclusion of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders that elects the directors. The allotment will be made through the disposition of treasury stock. The transfer restriction period shall be the period from the date of delivery of restricted stock to the time that directors lose their positions as director of the Company or any other positions determined by the Board of Directors of the Company.
d. Policy on proportion of amounts of compensation paid to individual directors for base compensation, performance- linked compensation, and non-monetary compensation
For the proportion of different types of compensation paid to directors, the voluntary Nomination & Compensation Committee is consulted, based on the compensation level benchmarks of companies with similar business scales and those belonging to the same industry and business category as the Company. The Representative Director and President, delegated by the Board of Directors, receives the details of the advice from the Nomination & Compensation Committee and decides the details of the compensation, etc. for individual directors referencing the proportions of compensation for each type of compensation shown in the advice.
e. Matters concerning decisions on the details of compensation, etc. for individual directors
Based on a resolution by the Board of Directors, the Representative Director and President is delegated authority to decide the specific details of the amounts of individual compensation. The scope of that authority covers the amount of base compensation for each director and the evaluation and allocation of performance-linked compensation based on the business performance of the business for which the individual director is responsible. However, so that the Representative Director and President appropriately uses this authority, the Board of Directors will consult the Nomination & Compensation Committee on matters concerning the calculation method, etc. for individual compensation and receive advice from the committee. The delegated Representative Director and President will then consider the details of this advice and decide.

Internal Control System
In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company passed a resolution on its “Basic Policy for Building an Internal Control System” at a Board of Directors’ meeting and is appropriately establishing an internal control system based on that basic policy. Passed by resolution at the Board of Directors’ meeting held on March 27, 2019, the basic policy has been partially revised, as a strengthening measure for the prevention of misconduct. Also, every year, we check the execution status of the internal control system and report the results to the Board of Directors and, via business reports, to shareholders. We will continue to strengthen corporate governance by making improvements.
Group Governance
The Company strives to strengthen governance of the Group by transferring authority to each Group company as deemed appropriate, and verifying the implementation status of the PDCA cycle for measures designed to heighten the “two kinds of reliability” (reliable business performance and reliable management) through the Regional PDCA Councils presided over by the director in charge of that region.
Each Group company autonomously manages itself as an independent enterprise and fulfills management responsibilities by complying with laws and internal regulations and rules. In addition, the director in charge of each region oversees the business decisions and the status of business execution of each company, providing guidance for improving the transparency of business management. This process ensures and promotes proper operations of the Group.
Functions as Corporate Pension Asset Owner
With regard to the pension management system, we established the Sanwa Shutter Corporate Pension Fund. In addition to a full-time managing director, management is undertaken by directors and representatives selected from each Group company. The management of the reserve fund is based on management guidelines established by the corporate pension fund, and important matters, such as decisions on asset allocation policy and recipients entrusted with assets, are resolved by a board of representatives using external consultants. The fund is managed and controlled in an appropriate manner to prevent conflicts of interest between pension beneficiaries and the Company. We carry out stewardship activities that can be implemented as corporate pension funds, such as the assigning of employees familiar with the practical side of the business to the full-time director, the Board of Trustees requiring that each investment institution entrusted with assets fulfills its stewardship responsibilities, and the receiving of reports on the results.
Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
To increase the transparency of its corporate activities, the Group will endeavor to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value by disclosing information in a timely and appropriate manner and reflecting dialogue with shareholders and investors in management.

 Risk Management and Compliance
Implementing Risk Management
The Sanwa Group identifies, analyzes, and evaluates business execution-related risks as well as undertakes measures required to avoid and/or mitigate risks. As an organization dedicated to promoting risk management, the Sustainability Committee reports and deliberates on the Sanwa Group’s basic risk management policies, risk management-related plans, and the progress of initiatives. In addition, the subordinate Quality, Environment and CSR Promotion Council and each Group company’s CSR Promotion Council manage risks by appropriately and rapidly responding to risks that occur during the course of each company’s business activities.
Identify risks at each company (Plan)
Select risks with a high level of importance (Plan)
Plan and implement countermeasures (Do)
Monitor (Check)
Correct and improve (Act)
This cycle is repeated annually to identify and reevaluate risks.
In fiscal 2019, the Information Security Countermeasures Council was established to build an information security system from a global perspective. Furthermore, the purchasing, production, and engineering divisions at each Group company have been monitoring risks throughout the supply chain and providing guidance on improvements to business partners.
In fiscal 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Crisis Management Headquarters was established to gather information from each Group company, provide the necessary support, and give instructions on company-wide policies, including various working arrangements.
Ensuring Thorough Compliance
In order to maintain the trust of society, the Sanwa Group formulated in October 2005 the Compliance Code of Conduct, which outlines specific conduct that must be adhered to based on Our Mission, Our Values, Principles of Business, and the philosophy of the Group. In December 2020, the Compliance Code of Conduct was revised to meet the changing demands
of society, focusing on items such as respect for human rights, ethical behavior, and information security. The revised Compliance Code of Conduct and Case Study Booklet was distributed to all employees in April 2021.

This training features lectures designed to brush up the participants’ knowledge of laws related to our business, such as the Antitrust Law, Construction Business Act, Waste Management and Public Cleansing Act, and Labor Standards Act. It also includes lectures concerning safety obligations, harassment, and risks relating to information security, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and other areas, and thereby fosters
compliance awareness.
In fiscal 2019, the Group Companies in Asia distributed the
Sanwa Group Compliance Code of Conduct translated into local languages and also adopted an internal whistleblowing system (corporate ethics hotline).
Also in North America (ODC) and Europe (NF Group), whistleblowing systems have been established and compliance training is conducted for all employees.

 Interview with an Outside Director
 Akira Gokita
Independent Outside Director
Audit & Supervisory Committee Member
50 SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2021
  On improving the Board of Directors’ effectiveness and establishing a Nomination & Compensation Committee
Sanwa Holdings delegates important business decisions to its President and Representative Director pursuant to the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, based on the Companies Act, and resolutions of the Board of Directors. However, decisions by the President are based on the assumption that the Management Conference, consisting of the directors in charge of business execution, full-time directors, and Audit & Supervisory Committee members, has been consulted, and that the President’s decisions on important business execution based on the Management Conference’s reports have been deliberated on by the Board of Directors as reported matters. Although not being members of the Management Conference, outside directors, including myself, receive materials and minutes of the Management Conference prior to the meetings of the Board of Directors, which aid their understanding of issues and deliberations at the Management Conference and facilitate the discussions of the reported matters at the Board of Directors. Even though the President makes decisions on important business execution, the Management Conference is consulted and reports on such decisions and the Board of Directors deliberates on reported matters. This functions as a system of double checks.
Prior to the meeting of the Board of Directors, copious amounts of agenda materials are distributed to the outside directors, which enable them to fully consider the contents of agenda items before they attend the Board of Directors meeting. At Board meetings, the director in charge is sometimes confronted with harsh opinions, but discussions are always lively and constructive. Our role as outside directors is to take part in these deliberations on agenda items with transparency, as the closest thing to an external eye. I believe that, by following this process correctly, we can ensure the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and reasonable decision-making for business management.
In fiscal 2020, I feel that the relationship between the Board of Directors and the Management Conference, as well as qualitative aspects such as pre-distribution of materials and understanding of issues, have improved. This year, the Company has established a Nomination & Compensation Committee. Three of the five members are independent outside directors. The Board of Directors currently consists of nine directors, of whom five are also members of the Nomination & Compensation Committee. We have established this Nomination & Compensation Committee as a voluntary body, but with the majority of the members comprising independent outside directors, it substantially carries enough weight to match the standards of statutory Nomination & Compensation Committees. I expect it will ensure our decision- making process is transparent and fair.

Corporate governance reforms were initially positioned as systems to improve the productivity and profit of Japanese companies and support management decisions that would enable them to prevail over global companies. In recent years, however, amid drastic changes to the industrial structure due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, including IoT and AI, and increasing globe-spanning environmental changes caused by climate change and COVID-19, the working-age population and Japan's market continue to shrink due to the declining birthrate and aging population. In these current circumstances, we consider even greater world-class governance is required from Japanese companies in Japan.
Sanwa Holdings is a holding company with many subsidiaries in Japan and overseas. We believe that our Group management is expected to create synergies that are more than the simple numerical totals of the corporate values of each Group company, thereby maximizing these synergies.
From this perspective, under the heading of defensive governance, how do we improve the management effectiveness of each Group company? At overseas subsidiaries, we need to provide internal control systems and improve their effectiveness. However, a centralized form of internal control could impair the independence of each subsidiary and eventually damage the Group’s corporate value. It is important that we carry out effective audits while allocating decision- making powers between the head office and subsidiaries and managing subsidiaries on a risk basis. To overcome the seeming trade-off between the strengthening and enhancing of internal controls and the cost of human resources, management, and auditing required for such ends, we will have to further utilize digital transformation (DX) in the future.
From the viewpoint of proactive management, we should also consider a flexible review of our business portfolio. Since we are expanding worldwide, we must consider concentrating investments of management resources in core business fields, expanding our business through aggressive M&A, and spinning off and selling non-core businesses in peripheral fields and those with low growth potential. We must achieve world-class governance on both the defensive side against various risks and the proactive side to increase corporate value.
Future initiatives, including ESG
The latest revision of the Corporate Governance Code makes a clear statement on sustainability including issues associated with society and the environment. This year, we have declared that we will incorporate TCFD into our disclosure framework and further promote SDGs, which are a global goal. As a company in the manufacturing industry, Sanwa can take various measures such as reducing the environmental burden when our products are manufactured and when they are used. There are still many things we can do in relation to climate change, energy issues, work styles and economic growth, technological innovation, and gender equality.
At the same time, we face some challenges. We need to carefully select what we can do and need to do, such as in- house promotion of work-style reforms, women's advancement, and health management including mental health.
Participation by female directors is one approach to improving diversity on the Board of Directors, but of course this does not mean merely appointing a certain number of women as outside directors. I believe that the quality of outside directors in supervisory roles, including myself, is being questioned now. Each outside director has an area of specialization and participates in the Board of Directors on that basis. However, given that outside directors depend on Company executives and employees to obtain the necessary information to fulfill their duties, they need to enhance their skills by deepening their expertise in specialized fields as well as broadening their understanding of fields outside of their specialty, and contribute to effective deliberations at the Board of Directors by making efforts to gather necessary information. I am a former public prosecutor, and now as a lawyer am serving as a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee. I take part in the deliberations of the Board of Directors based on the information gleaned from the audit reports and internal audit reports of subsidiaries as well as the materials of the Management Conference and the Board of Directors. Going forward, I will continue to enhance my skills based on my expertise and experience as a lawyer and focus on understanding the Company’s internal workings. As a diverse member of the Board of Directors, I am committed to strengthening and improving the Sanwa Group’s governance, and thus raising its medium- to long-term corporate value.

 Financial Section and Corporate Data
 12-year Summary
 Consolidated Financial Statements
 Global Network
 Product Information / Corporate Overview
1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements
Sanwa Holdings Corporation (the “Company”) and its domestic subsidiaries maintain their accounts and records in accordance with the provisions
set forth in the Japanese Corporate Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan, which are different from the accounting and disclosure requirements of International Accounting Standards.
The accounts and records of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with maily either International Financial Reporting Standards or US GAAP for the Company’s consolidation process, except for certain items which are required to be adjusted in the consolidation process.
Amounts less than one million yen and one thousand U.S. dollars are rounded down, Therefore, total or subtotal amounts may not correspond with the aggregation of such account balances.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which were filed with the Director of Kanto Local Finance Bureau as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.
The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of the reader, using the approximate exchange rate at March 31, 2021, which was ¥110 to US$1.00.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Scope of Consolidation
At March 31, 2021, the Company had 100 subsidiaries and 11 affiliates.
The scope of consolidation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (FY2020) includes Sanwa Holdings Corporation and its 64 consolidated subsidiaries. Equity method accounting is applied to investments in 2 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 1 affiliate at March 31, 2021 (FY2020).
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Suzuki Shutter (HK) Limited, Suzuki Shutter (Macau) Company Limited, Novoferm Hungaria Kft. and
olla Solution Kft. were included in the scope of consolidation because their significance increased, Norsud Gestion S.A.S. was excluded from the scope of consolidation due to a merger.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Suzuki Shutter (HK) Limited and Suzuki Shutter (Macau) Company Limited were excluded from the scope of application of the equity method and included in the scope of consolidation because their significance increased.
(b) Foreign Currency Translation
All asset and liability accounts of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the respective fiscal year-end and revenue and expense accounts are translated into Japanese yen at average exchange rates during the fiscal year.
Shareholders’ equity accounts of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation differences are debited or credited to the foreign currency translation adjustment or to non-controlling interests in shareholders’ equity.
(c) Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
(d) Short-term Investments and Investments in Securities
The Group adopted the Accounting Standards
for Financial Instruments issued by the Business Accounting Deliberation Council. In accordance with these standards, securities are classified into four categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, equity investments in associates, and other securities. Based on this classification, securities with a maturity of less than one year are included in “Short-term investments” as current assets.
Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable tax, reported in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried
at cost determined by the moving average method. Realized gain and loss and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on other securities are charged to income.
(e) Inventories
Inventories of the domestic consolidated companies are valued at cost, determined by the gross average method (Carrying amount in the balance sheet is calculated with consideration of write-downs due to decreased profitability). The costs of inventories held by foreign consolidated subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost or market value by the first-in, first-out method or the moving average method.
(f) Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Lease Assets)
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 61

Depreciation is computed by the declining-
balance method over the estimated useful lives
of assets, except that the straight-line method is applied to buildings (other than fixtures attached
to the buildings) acquired subsequent to April 1, 1998 and fixtures attached to the buildings and structures acquired subsequent to April 1, 2016. The consolidated subsidiaries outside of Japan adopt the straight-line method for depreciation.
Costs of maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to income in the year incurred, although major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
(g) Amortization of Goodwill
Amortization of goodwill is determined on a case by case basis and is generally amortized over a period not exceeding 20 years.
(h) Leased Assets
Leased assets related to finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership rights are amortized under the straight-line method based on the lease term as the useful life with residual value of zero.
(i) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits
The Group recognizes pension and severance costs for employees based on the estimates of the pension obligations and the plan assets at the balance
sheet date. The benefit formula basis is applied as the method for attributing the expected retirement benefit to periods of service for the calculation of the retirement benefit obligation.
Actuarial differences are amortized principally over a 10-year period, which is within the average remaining service period of employees, using the straight-line method from the fiscal year when the difference was generated. Prior service cost of the domestic consolidated companies is amortized when the prior services cost is generated.
Prior service cost of certain foreign subsidiaries is amortized over a 10-year period.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries have calculated their retirement benefit obligation and retirement benefit expenses based on the amount which would be payable at the year-end if all eligible employees terminated their services voluntarily (the “Simplified Method”).
(j) Revenue Recognition
The Group recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped, which is when title and risk of loss
pass to the customer. The Group recognizes revenue related to installation of products at the time installation is complete.
However, revenues and costs of construction contracts, of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated, are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. To estimate the progress of such construction projects, the Group measures the percentage of completion by
comparing costs incurred to date with the most recent estimate of total costs required to complete the project (cost to cost basis). If a reliable estimate cannot be made, revenues and costs of construction contract are recognized by the completed-contract method.
(k) Research and Development Expenses and Software
Research and development expenses are charged to income when incurred.
Expenditure relating to software developed for internal use is charged to income when incurred, except if it contributes to the generation of income or to the future cost savings. Such expenditures capitalized as assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of five years.
(l) Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statements of income. Deferred income taxes
are recorded to reflect the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
(m) Net Income per Share
The computation of basic net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. The average number of shares used in the computation was 220,881 thousand and 222,852 thousand for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Cash dividends per share shown in the consolidated statements of operations are the amounts applicable to the respective years.
(n) Derivative and Hedging Activities
The Group utilizes derivative transactions related to foreign currency exchange rates in order to reduce their risk exposure arising from fluctuations in these rates and prices, to reduce the cost of the funds financed and to improve their return on invested funds.
Derivative transactions currently utilized by the Group include interest rate swap contracts and currency swap contracts.
Net assets or liabilities arising from derivative transactions are measured at fair value, with unrealized gain or loss included in earnings. Hedging transactions, which meet the criteria of hedge accounting, are accounted for using deferral hedge accounting that requires the unrealized gain or loss to be deferred as a liability or asset until gain or loss relating to the hedge object is recognized.
In addition, certain forward exchange contracts are accounted for using the allocation method and the special method, respectively, which are regulated in the standard. The allocation method requires

 Product Information / Corporate Overview
recognized foreign currency receivables or payables covered by forward exchange contracts to be translated at such contract rates.
The Group has established a control environment, which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and for the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative transactions. The Group does not engage in derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Group is exposed to certain market risks arising from derivative transactions. The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit loss in
the event of non-performance by the counterparties to those transactions. However, the Group does not anticipate non-performance by any of these counterparties, all of whom are financial institutions with high credit ratings.
The Group evaluates hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative changes in cash flows or the changes in fair value of the hedged items with the corresponding changes in the hedging derivative instruments.
The assessment of hedging effectiveness regarding forward exchange contracts, which are accounted for under the above allocation method and special method, is omitted.
(o) Other Significant Matters for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
Application of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System
With regard to the items that were reviewed
in the non-consolidated tax return filing system
in line with the transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System established in the “Act for Partial Amendment of
the Income Tax Act, etc. ” (Act No. 8 of 2020), the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries do not apply paragraph 44 of the Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting (ASBJ Guidance No. 28, issued on February 16, 2018), in accordance with the treatment in paragraph 3 of the “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System” (PITF No. 39, issued on March 31, 2020), and the amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are based on the provisions of the tax law prior to the amendment.
(p) Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020have been made to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
(q) Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective
・Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued on March 31, 2020) ・Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued on March 26, 2021)
・Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, issued on March 31, 2020)
(1) Overview
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) together developed a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition, and released the standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IASB’s IFRS 15 and FASB’s Topic 606) in May 2014. IFRS 15 was applied from fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and Topic 606 was applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Accordingly, the ASBJ’s comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition was developed, and was released along with implementation guidance.
The ASBJ’s basic policy in its development of the accounting standard for revenue recognition was
to establish a new standard incorporating the basic principles of IFRS 15 as the starting point to allow for comparability of financial statements, which is one of the benefits of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15, and to add alternative accounting treatments for any items requiring consideration due to conventional practices in Japan, provided that such treatments do not impair comparability.
(2) Planned Date of Application
To be applied from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
(3) Effect of the Application of the Accounting Standard
The amount of the effect was under review when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
・Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement (ASBJ Statement No. 30, issued on July 4, 2019) ・Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories (ASBJ Statement No. 9, issued on July 4, 2019)
・Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments (ASBJ Statement No. 10, issued on July 4, 2019) ・Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, issued on July 4, 2019)
・Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, issued on March 31, 2020)
SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 63

(1) Overview
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established similar detailed guidance on fair value measurement (IFRS 13, “Fair Value Measurement” and FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement.”) Accordingly, the ASBJ made efforts to ensure the consistency of Japanese GAAP with international accounting standards regarding guidance and disclosure of fair value, primarily for financial instruments, and the Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement was released.
The ASBJ’s basic policy in its development of the accounting standard for fair value measurement was to adopt essentially all of the provisions of IFRS 13 to improve the comparability of financial statements between companies in Japan and overseas by
using uniform measurement methods, and to add alternative accounting treatments for any items requiring consideration due to conventional practices in Japan, provided that such treatments do not significantly impair comparability.
(2) Planned Date of Application
To be applied from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
(3) Effect of the Application of the Accounting Standard
The amount of the effect was under review when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.

8. Retirement and Severance Benefits
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans to provide
for the retirement of employees. The defined benefit pension plans are paid either in a lump sum or as a pension based on the employee’s salary and years of service. In the lump-sum payment plans, a lump sum is paid as a retirement benefit based on salary and years of service.
1. Defined Benefit Pension Plan
For the defined benefit pension plans and lump-sum payment plans of certain consolidated subsidiaries, the simplified accounting method is used to calculate net defined benefit liability and retirement benefit expense.

  10. Financial Instruments 1. Status of Financial Instruments
(1) Policy for financial instruments
In light of plans for financing, the Group raises the funds it requires through bank loans and bond issuance.
The Group manages temporary fund surpluses through financial assets that have high levels of safety. The Group reduces customer credit risk
by applying internal policies for managing credit
risk. Long-term debt and bonds are taken out principally for the purpose of capital expenditure and acquisitions.
The Group limits the use of derivatives to the volume of long-term debt and bonds and actual requirements based on established internal control rules, and does not engage in speculative transactions.
(2) Types of financial instruments and related risk
Trade receivables - notes receivable and accounts receivable - electronically recorded monetary claims - are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers.
The Group holds securities and investments in securities, which are mainly issued by companies who have business relationships with the Group, and these securities are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in market prices. Trade payables - notes payable and accounts payable - mostly have payment due dates within one year.
Bank loans and bonds are taken out principally for the purpose of working capital, capital expenditure and acquisitions, which are exposed to liquidity risk and interest-rate risk.
Currency swap is almost always used as a hedge as a type of derivative transaction.
(3) Risk management for financial instruments
(a) Monitoring of credit risk (the risk that customers or counterparties may default)
In accordance with the internal policies for managing credit risk of the Group, the Group monitors credit- worthiness of its main customers periodically, and monitors due dates and outstanding balances by customer.
To minimize credit risk when entering into derivative transactions, counterparties are limited to financial institutions with high ratings.
(b) Monitoring of market risks
Derivatives mainly include currency swaps, which are used to manage exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of receivables and payables.
Investments in securities, primarily the equity securities of corporations with which the Group does business, are exposed to the risk of fluctuations
in market price. The Group manages this risk by periodically examining market prices and the financial condition of the issuing entities.
The Group executes and manages derivative transactions within the limits of established internal rules and regulations, and reduces credit risk by limiting counterparties to highly creditworthy financial institutions.
(c) Monitoring of liquidity risk for financing (the risk that the Companies may not be able to meet obligations on the scheduled due dates)
(4) Supplementary explanation of items relating to the market value of financial instruments
The Group manages the liquidity risk mainly through the cash-flow plans, which are prepared by the financial department.
In order to achieve more efficient and flexible financing, the Group contracts line-of-credit agreements with certain financial institutions.

Note 1: Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions.
 Assets
(1) Cash and deposits and (2) Notes and accounts receivable, trade and (3) Electronically recorded monetary claims
Since these items are settled in a short period, their carrying value approximates fair value.
(4) Securities and investments in securities
The fair value of equity securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of debt securities is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institutions making markets in these securities.
For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to Note 4. in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Liabilities
(1) Notes and accounts payable, trade and (2) Short- term debt
Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value.
(3) Long-term debt (Long-term debt)
The fair value of long-term debt payable is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of principal and interest. That discount rate is based on the assumed interest rate if a similar new loan was entered into.
Because long-term debt payable with variable interest rates is based on the condition that interest rates are revised periodically and their fair values are almost the same as their book values, the relevant book values are used.
A specially treated interest rate swap is accounted for as an integral part of long-term debt payable, or the subject of hedging, so that the fair value of the swap is stated by being included in the fair value of long-term debt payable.
(Bonds)
The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on market prices when market prices are readily available. The fair value of bonds without market prices is measured as the present value, calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest at a rate determined by taking into account the remaining maturity of each bond and the current credit risk.
Derivative transactions
For information on derivative transactions, please refer to Note 11. “Derivative transactions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Note 2: Financial instruments for which it is extremely difficult to determine market values were as follows:
Millions of yen
Because it is recognized that these do not have market values or that the market values are extremely difficult to determine, they are not included in the chart above.

3. Assumptions Used in Estimation of the Fair Value of Stock Options
Valuation method for estimating fair value was the Black-Scholes model. The major assumptions used for the 2020 stock option plan are as follows:
(a) Estimated volatility was computed by the closing stock prices of common stock in each trading day from July 4, 2011 to July 6, 2020. (b) The remaining period was reasonably estimated.
(c) The estimated dividend was calculated based on the dividend amount applicable to the year ended March 31, 2020.
(d) The risk-free rate was determined based on the rate of Japanese government bonds, for which redemption dates corresponded to the estimated remaining period.
14. Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses included in selling, general and administrative expenses were ¥4,004 million ($36,400 thousand) and ¥4,241 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Research and development expenses included in cost of sales were ¥637 million ($5,791 thousand) and ¥487 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021and 2020, respectively.
15. Income Taxes
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries are subject to several taxes based on income, which in the aggregate resulted in a statutory tax rate of approximately 30.6% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively. Foreign subsidiaries are subject to income taxes of the countries in which they operate.
The effective rates for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 differ from the Company’s statutory tax rates for the following reasons:
Statutory tax rate 30.6% Expenses not deductible for income tax purposes               0.2 Depreciation of goodwill               2.3 Change in valuation allowance               0.6 Other                     (0.8)

   (Method of grouping assets)
The Group, in principle, groups business assets based on the business management organization. Idle assets that are not expected to be used in the future are grouped by individual asset.
(Background to recognition of impairment loss)
As future cash flows of business assets had fallen below the book value, the Company has reduced the book value to the recoverable amount, and recorded the reduction as an impairment loss in extraordinary losses. In addition, the Company had recorded goodwill based on the assumption of excess earning power at the time of acquisition of shares of Sanwa System Wall Co., Ltd., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. However, since the business performance has fallen below the initial business plan, the reduction in the unamortized balance of goodwill has been accounted for as a one-time expense, based on a conservative review of the business plan.
(Method of determining recoverable amount)
The Company measures the recoverable amount of business assets based on the value in use. As negative future cash flows are expected, the value in use is measured at the residual value. In addition, the recoverable amount of goodwill is measured with a value in use of zero.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the Board of Directors Sanwa Holdings Corporation
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Sanwa Holdings Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2021, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended, summary of significant accounting policies, other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2021, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Revenue Recognition (Appropriateness of Periodical Allocation of Sales)
Description of Key Audit Matter How we addressed the matter in our audit
       The Group’s revenue is composed of installation work related to building materials such as shutters and doors, products, and the provision of services. The Group’s recognizes revenue from the transfer of significant risks and rights in such construction work, etc. to the customer. For the most part, revenue is recognized from the completion of work and delivery of products, but for specific construction works that meet certain requirements, revenue is recorded by measuring progress. Depending on the construction property, revenue may go below cost at the completion of the construction, in which case, it may be necessary to record a loss on orders. In addition, changes in the contract amount may occur due to changes in construction specifications.
   In order to consider revenue recognition (appropriateness of periodical allocation of sales), we primarily conducted the following audit procedures:
• We carried out an effectiveness evaluation of the development and operational status of internal controls related to revenue recognition.
• For projects in which sales are recorded according to the progress of the construction, we examined the accuracy of such recording.
• For large sales transactions near the end of the fiscal year and sales transactions sampled from sales offices and branches conducted by rotation during the period, we examined the appropriateness of the periodical allocation and the accuracy of the sales amounts recorded by checking against documented evidence, etc. related to revenue recognition.
 SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 87

   Therefore, due to the diversity of sales projects, there is a risk of inappropriate periodical allocation of sales. Taking into account the importance of financial statements and the characteristics of sales, we have determined this to be a key audit matter.
   • At the end of the fiscal year, we obtained confirmation documents from customers and checked them against the accounts receivable balance.
• For projects in which a loss on construction may occur, we examined the accuracy of the construction loss allocation amount.
 Responsibilities of Management and the Audit and Supervisory Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters required to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
The Audit and Supervisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the Directors’ execution of duties relating to the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
• Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements in not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.

 Product Information / Corporate Overview
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We also provide the Audit and Supervisory Committee with a statement that we have complied with the ethical requirements regarding independence that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Japan, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Audit and Supervisory Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

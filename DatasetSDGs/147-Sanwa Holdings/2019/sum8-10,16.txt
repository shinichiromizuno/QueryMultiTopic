Formulation of the Compliance Code of Conduct
In order to maintain the trust of society, the Sanwa Group for- mulated in October 2005 the Compliance Code of Conduct, which outlines specific conduct that must be adhered to and is based on the Group’s mission, Our Values, Principles of Business, and values.
In January 2006, we distributed to all Group employees the Compliance Code of Conduct booklet, which provides examples and explanations of actual incidents that occurred at individual departments. This booklet has been subsequently undergone revisions as needed in an effort to promote compliance.
Introduction of Internal Whistleblower System
at Companies in China and Asia
Starting in July 2019, we have introduced whistleblower sys- tems (corporate ethics hotlines) at six companies in China and other areas of Asia. We have developed a system that employ- ees can understand through the use of the naタtiイv語e languages (or equivalents) in each region, displaying posters and distributing cards to employees in English, Chinese (simplified, traditional), Vietnamese, and Thai. We
have also appropriately publi-
cized the system and have
worked to increase trust by
keeping reported information
strictly secret and prohibiting
the adverse treatment of sys-
tem users.

PDCA SAKURA
The employees of the Sanwa Group, not satisfied with the current situation, maintain a critical mindset in doing their jobs in order to continue to pursue their best work. We review results in terms of whether or not we did things as originally planned. If not, we think about the reason why we didn’t get the intended results. Getting back to the basics such as increasing good aspects and improving bad ones is part of the PDCA cycle. PDCA SAKURA represents this concept as the Sanwa Group symbol. We even planted PDCA SAKURA cherry blossom trees on the grounds of main Group facilities.

 Concept behind the Integrated Report 2019
  What Direction to Take?
The Sanwa Group is implementing the Third Mid-Term Management Plan com- panywide with the aim of establishing a foundation for leading brands in two years as a major global player. The Integrated Report outlines what the Sanwa Group must do and the direction it should take. We are forging “two kinds of reliability” with our stakeholders while aiming to become a major global player by ensuring reliable business performance and reliable management.
   The Evolution of Sanwa
Multi-product sales and globalization are the two pillars of the Sanwa Group’s strategy. We will provide high-quality products and services worldwide by lever- aging the three strengths that we have cultivated since Sanwa’s foundation: “vertically integrated business model,” “comprehensive solutions” and “global presence.” The Integrated Report highlights what direction the evolution of the Sanwa Group should take as it aims to create long-term value.
   Creating Values through ESG
The value of companies is found in fulfilling their social responsibilities through their businesses. Sustainability is the foundation of ESG, so we will create social value together with our stakeholders by undertaking initiatives signified in the initials of ESG: (E) proactively find solutions to environmental problems; (S) deepen our relationship with society by developing personnel who will lead the next generation and ceaselessly work to improve safety and quality; (G) increase management transparency.
 Editorial policy
To present the Sanwa Group’s management and corporate activities, we have published this Integrated Report. The report is edited in a wholistic manner to include non-financial information such as corporate social responsibility activities in addition to information on management direction and strategy and review of operations. In editing this report, we have referred to the “International Integrated Reporting Framework” proposed by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
Forward-looking statements
This Integrated Report includes forward-looking statements pertaining to expectations, plans, strategies, management goals, future performance, expenses, revenues, income and other forecasts formulated on past experiences. Forward-looking state- ments necessarily entail some degree of uncertainty, and the content conveyed in the results as well as underlying factors identi- fied in the report may differ materially from actual results depending on changes in those factors.
Reporting period
Fiscal years are years ended March 31 of the following calendar year. For example, fiscal 2018 is the year ended March 31, 2019.

The first step toward
multi-product sales
The Sanwa Group’s multi-product sales strategy began with its entry into the door business in the late 1960s. Focusing on fields where we could apply the know-how we cultivated in the shutter business, exist- ing production facilities and sales and instal- lation networks, we began producing made-to-order steel doors. We rapidly rose to the top of the industry.
Gaining a foothold overseas
In 1974, we entered into a technical tie-up with Overhead Door Corporation (U.S.A.; ODC), and began manufacturing and selling overhead doors. In 1986, we established Sanwa Shutter (H.K.) Ltd. in Hong Kong, making us the first in the industry to focus on overseas markets.
The Expanding Multi-Product Strategy
We have promoted multi-product sales strategy through acquisitions to further broaden our value. The first company we acquired was Showa Front Sales Co., Ltd. (now Showa Front Co., Ltd.) in 1984. That was followed by the acquisitions of Showa Kensan Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of automatic door opera- tors; Venix Co., Ltd. a manufacturer of partitions; and Sanwa Tajima Corporation, which manufactures and sells stainless steel building products. By acquiring quality companies with established product brands, we accelerated our multi-product sales strategy.
Business Expansion by Penetrating the
American Market
In 1996, we acquired tie-up partner ODC. Through the addition of new businesses boasting leading shares in the United States into the Group, we pro- ceeded with collaborative product development and sales, as well as expansion into new markets.
  Multi-Product Sales Strategy Globalization
Entry into the shutter industry
Sanwa Shutter Manufacturing Co., Ltd. began manufacturing lightweight shutters in 1956 near the Sanwa Market in Amagasaki, Hyogo. We established a leading position in the shutter industry in 1960s. Our production capacity grew to a world-class level with the construc- tion of six factories.

 PDCA Advances the Multi-Product
Sales Strategy
To vigorously push forward with multi-product sales, in fiscal 2011 Sanwa Shutter Corporation revamped its organization, subdivided regional construction markets mainly by comprehen- sively reviewing the scope of its sales activities, and increased its flexibility in marketing. Our corporate culture of placing the highest priori- ty on implementing the PDCA cycle is the backbone of our daily business activities.
Establishment of Three-Pronged
Platform: Japan, U.S.A., Europe
In 2003, we acquired German Novoferm Group (NF), making the European market our third cor- nerstone. We started to grow into a leading glob- al brand by pursuing business and regional diversification, in addition to expanding and growing our core businesses through the develop- ment of multiple product types.
Product Development in Harmony with Society
We launched environment-conscious and energy saving products and products that use natural energy sources. With these products, along with its extensive lineup of disaster prevention products that provide flood preven- tion, earthquake resistance and other functions, Sanwa Shutter contributes to the sus-

  Under Sanwa Global Vision 2020, we set out to offer products and services that provide safety, security and convenience to customers worldwide as a major global player in the access systems industry. To this end, we aim to: (1) Become definite No. 1 brand in Japan, the U.S. and Europe; (2) Establish a business model for service business; (3) Expand shutter & door business in emerging markets, spotlighting Asia, and make them grow to be top brands; and (4) Promote reali- zation of Group synergy in global markets.

Our Universal Mission and Business Model
The times have undergone monumental changes in the 63 years that have passed since we were estab- lished in 1956. I have a strong sense that we have always responded swiftly to the demands placed upon us through the ages, in methodical fashion, evolving to become the company we are today.
It is the mission of the Company, the overarching concept of the Group, to offer “products and services that provide safety, security and convenience to further contribute to the prosperity of society.” This is what clearly defines our reason for existence. This mission does not change year by year; indeed, it is immutable, and as the shared sense of values held by the Group it is our universal belief that is firmly root- ed in Group companies around the world. In responding to competition in the market environment that is escalating in severity, however, we must certainly take steps to transform ourselves in line with the chang- ing demands from society. This is a management style which takes into account the vision gained by listen- ing to the voices of our shareholders, partners, employees and other stakeholders.
The Company’s business model has steadily evolved in the 60-plus years since our establishment. Japan in particular is characterized by a sales organization that extends to every corner of the nation in a mesh- like network, and through this network we have constructed a vertically integrated business model, from installation to after service. On top of that is our multi-product sales strategy which takes advantage of the channels we have created. Our products are not standardized, but in a novel way of operating they are made-to-order customizations in accordance with customer requests for each individual property. This is a business model that relies heavily on human resources. Consequently, this has been well received for the meticulous care in which we respond to customer needs, and is what lies behind our results, which are represented by the Company’s consistently high share and profitability. This works to hinder market entry from companies in other industries, making the shutter industry a unique market.
From a Japanese Maker of Building Materials to a Major Global Player
The Sanwa Group completed its positioning of factories nationwide in a period of intense growth, which earned an unshakeable position at the top of the industry. Following that, the Company became involved in the steel door business, leveraging its shutter production equipment, as well as its sales and installation network, demonstrating its full-fledged break away from dependence on shutters. This was a critical point marking its first step toward today’s multi-product sales strategy. The Company continued to accelerate this strategy to develop a range of product types, such as residential construction materials and partitions, but then Japan’s economic bubble burst. This was a period characterized by chronic oversupply, and the Company arrived at a time in which it was extraordinarily difficult to maintain the growth it had previously achieved. This was the time when I looked to the future and made a decision of immense importance; we would change course and look to achieve growth through globalization. In 1996, we acquired the
SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 7

What Direction to Take?
Message from the Chairman
Overhead Door Corporation, a U.S. company with whom we had already been in a technical tie-up, then in 2003, we acquired Novoferm (NF) Group of Europe, which gave us a three polar structure in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, respectively. This fiscal year the global structure of the Group is entering a new phase with a four polar structure as we welcome four companies from China and Asia into the scope of consolidation.
Global markets all differ in terms of a specific country’s laws and regulations, ethnic distinctions, climate, history and other aspects. This means that what had been common sense in Japan will not be applicable elsewhere. If we are unable to apply the Group’s business to the character and needs of respective regions, we will not be able extend our roots into a region, and it will be impossible to achieve sustained growth there. Since we started all-out efforts to establish our overseas presence, we have made progress on local- ization, from products to people, and have been persistent in our efforts to become a corporate group that can be accepted in every region of the globe.
Positioning of the Third Mid-Term Management Plan toward 2030
In fiscal 2018, we achieved record-setting net sales of ¥400.0 billion. Our goal is to grow that to ¥450.0 billion by fiscal 2020, the Mid-Term Management Plan’s final year, and we can envisage reaching the ¥500.0 billion mark after that. This will not be a mountain that is easily climbed, but we are resolved to take this difficult path and go to the top. Consequently, the current Mid-Term Management Plan has been formulated as a two-year plan, and we have positioned it as a period in which we aim to secure a founda- tion as a major global player. We are treating this as a period in which we will sow the seeds to realize our next long-term vision, and as a critical two years during which we will calmly and with a critical eye look to the market following 2020, and will consider the path and methods we should take going forward.

Reliable Management Built by Enhanced PDCA Cycle Implementation
One of the strengths of the Sanwa Group is that we are an organization that is intensely diligent and seri- ous. Keeping in mind the spirit of our establishment, namely an organization with comradery, you might say we have a backbone that is flexible enough to respond to the changes of a new age. Furthermore, I will not waver in the implementation of the Plan, Do, Check, Action cycle, which is the linchpin of man- agement. This management cycle has become ubiquitous to our employees worldwide, and I am con- vinced that it is this hands-on realization of PDCA’s speed that secures our ability to execute the strategies of the plans we make, and it is the secret to realizing the Sanwa Group’s vision and seizing upon success.
“Two Kinds of Reliability, One Sanwa” to Achieve the Next Long-Term Vision
Achieving our challenging long-term goals will require management’s strong belief and resolve. I use the expression “two kinds of reliability” to capture the essence of this thought. First, there is raising the reli- ability of business performance that is driven by the growth of each business, and next, there is boosting the reliability of the management foundation, which consists of safety, quality, corporate governance and other aspects. It is through these, I believe, that we can grow relationships of trust with our customers and partners, and fulfill the future dreams of our over 10 thousand employees around the world.
Among the approximately 10 thousand employees in the Sanwa Group, over half account for human resources with diverse nationalities. Among those as well, more than any other, the greatest topics we have are the sharing of vision and goals, and the building of relationships of trust. One thing I am con- stantly considering is our human resources, specifically, nurturing them and making use of their efforts in fulfilling ways so that we can link each and every employee’s growth to the prosperity of the Company. At the same time, we need to be a Group that allows employees to dream. My belief is that to achieve sus- tainable management nothing is possible without supporting the human talent that will comprise the next generation. Please look forward to the evolution of management that forges ahead to increase corporate value for the Group’s continued growth as “one Sanwa.”

What Direction to Take?
Sanwa Value Creation Model
Realizing our social responsibility through our business activities and gaining the understanding of our stakeholders by providing safety, security and convenience to further contribute to the prosperity of society is very meaningful for the Sanwa Group, which is a company that continues to earn the trust of society. To this end, we share with our stakeholders a complete picture of our value creation process and reveal the details of Sanwa Group value creation activities on pages 10-11.
 1 External Environment and Social Issues External Environment
Sanwa Group products have a wide range of uses at businesses and facilities vital for people’s daily lives, such as detached hous- es, housing complexes, commercial facilities/offices, medical/ welfare facilities, and factories/warehouses in 25 countries and regions worldwide. Accordingly, we need to respond appropri- ately to changes in economic conditions and market trends in regions where Sanwa Group operates, including Japan, North America, Europe, and Asia. Meanwhile, we undertake business activities by identifying business growth opportunities that help to solve global social problems.
Social Issues
The Sanwa Group contributes to society by providing safety, security, and convenience. Protecting customers from disasters and accidents, and bringing convenience and comfort to cus- tomers in their daily lives is the Sanwa Group’s mission. To con- tinue to deliver that value, our access systems must meet the expectations of customers at all times. To meet this responsibili- ty, introducing a diverse array of management resources into our business activities while realizing safety, security and conve- nience worldwide is our approach to becoming a major global player in the access systems industry.
2 Input Technology/Manufactured Capital
The Sanwa Group focuses on product categories that are expected to see growth over the long term, and also invests in systems to reduce manpower, streamline operations and
improve product reliability. In Japan, we newly established the Osaka plant as our western Japan production base for partitions in April 2018. In North America, we expanded the Matamoros plant (Mexico), which manufactures automatic doors and door openers, in May 2019. In Europe, we enhanced production capacity in 2018 by upgrading Alpha plant (Netherlands), which manufactures industrial sectional doors, and Wykroty plant (Poland), which makes dock levelers.
Intellectual Capital
The Sanwa Group maintains proprietary technological develop- ment processes for its businesses and products that boast high market shares. Leveraging our know-how in the access system domain in R&D activities, we are realizing multi-product sales that extend beyond shutters and doors. In addition, we are engaging in development that promotes increases in quality, security, and installation while reducing costs, have built a R&D system for Group companies since venturing overseas, and are sharing and effectively using core technologies.
Human Capital
The Sanwa Group continues to grow and develop together with its employees by engaging in personnel training from the per- spective of increasing product quality and underpinned by our growth strategies. Our staff of around 10,000 employees and over 3,800 installers is a management resource that plays a vital role in supporting the Sanwa Group’s growth. We focus on respecting the diversity among our employees, enhancing sys- tems and working environments that enable staff members to maximize their abilities, and personnel training that is the driv- ing force behind individual creativity.
Financial Capital
The Sanwa group maintains healthy earnings and a stable financial position while engaging in disciplined fiscal manage-

ment. We take capital efficiency into consideration, particularly focusing on ROE and SVA. We will return profits to stakeholders by prioritizing the strategic investment of cash flows generated through sound financial management toward sustainable growth from 2020 and further promoting management aimed at increasing corporate value.
Social and Relationship Capital
The trust of our stakeholders forms the basis of our business activities. The Sanwa Group has a broad array of stakeholders that include affiliates, dealers and other trading partners, inves- tors, employees, and local communities. The Sanwa Group has continued to exist by expanding its businesses globally, realizing a high level of social responsibility, and meeting the great expectations of its stakeholders over the long term.
Natural Capital
The Sanwa Group engages in business activities in harmony with the global environment and local communities in order to help achieve a sustainable society as a good corporate citizen. The Group engages in environmentally oriented business activi- ties as well as providing eco-friendly products and services as a global comprehensive construction materials company. In addi- tion, we work to reduce greenhouse gases such as CO2 to appropriately address climate change risks while helping achieve a sustainable society.

development, production and sale of products, but also extend to installation and maintenance and service. Meeting those responsibilities and realizing safety, security and convenience worldwide through strict adherence to PDCA as part of the Group’s proprietary management is our approach to becoming a major global player in the access systems industry.
4 Output & Outcomes
We intend to achieve our Medium-Term Plan targets by strategi- cally keeping abreast of trends in value creation. We will aggres- sively allocate resources in order to maximize the impact of each initiative. Management is committed to establishing leading brands as a major global player for our stakeholders by imple- menting the Medium-Term Plan.
Value Provided to Society
The Sanwa Group aims to provide value to our stakeholders by leveraging the Group’s uniqueness in keeping with its mission and management philosophy. There are two kinds of reliability: “reliable business performance,” which gains the trust of stake- holders by achieving performance targets, and “reliable man- agement,” which is built through a sincere corporate character that gains the trust of society through strict adherence to safety, quality, and corporate governance and compliance. Based on this, we will contribute to society through the provision of secu- rity, safety, and convenience by promoting ESG-oriented busi- nesses in cooperation with each division.

Operating income in fiscal 2018 rose 11.5% year on year and 0.3% compared with the initial target to reach the Company’s projec- tion. As a result, operating income ratio— which had remained flat from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2017—rose 0.4 points year on year to 7.7% in fiscal 2018. The Company targets operating income ratio reaching 10% over the medium to long term.
* Excluding amortization of goodwill
The Sanwa Group focuses on product fields anticipated to grow over the long term and engages in investment to increase product reliability. Capital expenditures (including tan- gible and intangible) amounted to ¥12,367 million in fiscal 2018. The amount of invest- ment in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 increased on large-scale strategic investment but remained on par with depreciation and amor- tization as usual.

The Company views financial health as important, and one criterion for evaluating this, debt/equity ratio, has been steadily declining after peaking in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2018, debt/equity ratio was 0.38, falling below the initial estimate of 0.40. In light of current interest rate conditions, debt/equity ratio is expected to remain in sufficiently safe territory for the time being.
The Company’s unique indicator, Sanwa Value Added (SVA) is important for indicating profit- ability in relation to shareholders’ equity and general business invested capital (including liabilities). In fiscal 2018, SVA exceeded the initial forecast of ¥10.3 billion. Consequently, ROIC reached 15.0%. The Company targets SVA of ¥15.9 billion and ROIC of 16.4% in fiscal 2020.
Our policy is to allocate free cash flow, excluding dividends paid, for growth invest- ments such as M&A and strategic capital investments. However, if there are fewer strategic investments and our cash position becomes larger than expected, we will specif- ically consider using it for shareholder returns, such as stock buybacks.

Note: CO2 emissions are calculated from the consump-

In fiscal 2018, we reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 7% despite increased sales by installing energy-saving equipment, promot- ing energy conservation companywide, and a decrease in the utility CO2 emission factor.
Installers are the source of the Sanwa Group’s competitiveness. We are adding more install- ers every year to handle construction of large buildings and inspection of fire prevention equipment. We will continue to focus efforts on securing employees and training to upgrade their skills to prepare for an expected additional increase in the maintenance and service business as regular fire prevention equipment inspection systems go into full swing in Japan.
Frequency rate is an indicator of the frequen- cy of casualties from labor accidents and shows the number of casualties per million actual working hours. The frequency rate at the Group’s domestic factories in fiscal 2017 was 0.8, below the manufacturing industry average, and while rising slightly to 0.9 in fis- cal 2018, remains low.

  Sanwa Global Vision 2020: Third Mid-Term Management Plan Strategies
Under the Sanwa Group Third Mid-Term Management Plan, which covers the two-year period from FY2019 to FY2020, we are working towards the goal of establishing the foundation for becoming the top brand as a major global player. In particular, I would like to focus on explaining the positioning of the region-specific strategies that form the core of the Management Plan.
Based on the results of the First Three-Year Plan (FY2013- FY2015), we defined the three-year period covered by the Second Three-Year Plan (FY2016 to FY2018) as one in which the Sanwa Group will strengthen its competitiveness as a major global player. During FY2018, the final fiscal year of the Second Three-Year Plan, net sales tracked the figures announced at the start as planned, but profits fell short of the initial targets pri- marily due to a higher than expected rise in steel prices and var- ious costs. However, the Group recorded record high numbers for net sales and operating income.
Despite continued expansion, our businesses in Japan experi- enced a backwards slide in performance due to market factors. Overseas, however, residential doors and door openers served as drivers for continued growth in both volume and quality for our businesses in North America. In Europe, the success of structural reforms led to greater sales in the industrial door busi- ness, primarily, and helped businesses here achieve wide-spread improvements in profitability. Our businesses in China and Asia maintained profitability for two consecutive years, but the speed of growth remained lower than expected.
“Two years to establish the foundation for becoming the top brand as a major global player” is the Sanwa Group’s goal for the Third Mid-Term Management Plan. As part of this goal, the Group is aiming to become a central global presence as a major global player in the access systems industry and is aiming to expand our position as a top brand from G7 markets, as we stand today, to G20 markets. Over the long term, we will pro- mote system standardization in cooperation between produc- tion, sales, and installation, and focus heavily on improving business efficiency for the purpose of working towards overall optimization.
Among net sales by product for our businesses in Japan during fiscal 2018, maintenance and service experienced the strongest growth at approximately 15%. This business is already one of the Group's strengths, but we foresee greater growth when the new periodic inspection reporting system for fire pre- vention equipment goes into full effect in fiscal 2019.

What Direction to Take?
Third Mid-Term Management Plan
 L Japan
The status of orders in fiscal 2019 remains robust following sim-
ilar levels during the previous fiscal year. Meanwhile, the tight supply-demand balance has deepened labor shortages at every level, including manufacturing, logistics, and installation. Although a combination of concentrated deliveries and natural disaster recovery response was one factor, in fiscal 2018 the occurrence of delivery management problems made it clear that the Group’s supply systems do not stand on a firm footing. Currently, we are focusing our energies on efforts to solve this problem.
As a fundamental strength of the Group, the supply chain was the highlight setting us apart from our competition. Currently, however, product supply capability and labor short- age problems have emerged as urgent challenges, so will be taken up as important themes in the new Mid-Term Management Plan.
Meanwhile, against a backdrop of rising raw material, logis- tics, and installation costs, we are no longer able to avoid pass- ing these increases on to customers. In this respect, as well, we will proceed with an awareness of our status as price leader and as the top brand in the industry.
Although it may seem obvious, in fiscal 2019 we will keep in mind our goal of delivering high-quality products and properly installing these as scheduled. And we will tighten cooperation between manufacturing, sales, and installation, in particular, to achieve a high level of added value. Moreover, we will work to further promote multi-product sales by expanding strategic growth products such as partitions, stainless steel doors, auto- matic doors.
L North America
North America has experienced strong market conditions over
the past few years, allowing the door and door opener divisions to achieve steady growth in sales. Through fiscal 2020, we will continue working to expand our core businesses to achieve our targets for net sales and profit. Still, there are many challenges in strategic sectors, and problems remain for introducing and operating ERP*1, restructuring downstream strategies, and undertaking other measures.
In fiscal 2018, we began operating an ERP system at our main shutter plant, but problems occurred when modifying the workflow in response to the system’s introduction. As such, this measure has not progressed as expected. In terms of down- stream strategies, we are investigating frameworks for how we will implement these strategies for sales, installation, and ser- vice operations, and we will exchange information with our dis- tributors as we move forward with a sharper focus. In terms of the organization, we are considering returning sales and instal- lation professionals to the door division as part of restructuring from a long-term perspective.
In consideration of introducing new products to and expand- ing the product lineup for existing businesses, we will investi- gate adding product groups that we do not currently supply. Another important initiative will be working to generate syner- gy, for example by expanding the product lineup through M&As and deploying expertise related to products sold in Europe to the North American market.

    L Europe
During fiscal 2018, our businesses in Europe saw a steep rise in
the industrial door business. This gain led to an overall net sales growth of 10.7% on a euro basis and helped maintain robust growth of 30.0% in operating income. One feature of the European market is that it is not shifting towards an oligopoly. The shutter market in Japan is dominated by the top three com- panies, which hold approximately 90% of market share, while the North American market is also dominated by the top three or four companies, which hold 70-80% of market share. In Europe, however, the top three companies, including our own, account for only 50% of the market. The European market is also composed of many countries and different markets. Our sales over the past three years have been robust, and despite moderate market growth, we feel there is still plenty of room to expand our share of the market. During fiscal 2020, the final fiscal year of the Third Mid-Term Management Plan, we have set a target of expanding net sales by just over 8% compared with fiscal 2018. The priority policies include further strengthen- ing the industrial and hinged door businesses, expanding sales throughout the European region, and expanding our share of the garage door business. Along with expanding and strength- ening existing businesses through these policies, we will work to reform operational processes (estimate and ordering process digitalization, efficient systemization of production, logistics, and sales) through digitalization.
There are also still untapped, attractive regions within the European market, so we will proceed with M&As in a way that fills in these parts of the mosaic.
Measures
L China/Asia
Starting in fiscal 2019, Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door, Sanwa
Shutter (H.K.), and An-Ho Metal Industrial (Taiwan), among our businesses in China, and Vina-Sanwa (Vietnam), among our businesses in Asia, were brought into the scope of consolida- tion. The scale of sales in Asia as a whole is still small at just over ¥10 billion (including unconsolidated businesses), so including these businesses in our consolidated accounts has only now just brought us to the starting line. In China, we will consider the three companies: Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door for shutters, Novoferm Shanghai for doors, and Sanwa Shutter (Hong Kong) and their integration into a single operation to expand business.
In other regions of Asia, we will work to expand the facilities at Sanwamas Metal Industry in Indonesia as our second location after Vietnam. Both of these countries have large populations and a growing middle-income group. We will also investigate expanding into other ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Myanmar.
L Strengthening service segments: Expanding added value in this division with remark- able growth
Consolidated net sales for our service businesses in fiscal 2018 reached ¥49 billion, making for significant growth of 1.5 times the net sales recorded in fiscal 2015, the first year of the Second Three-Year Plan. We aim to increase consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 to ¥55 billion, 12.2% growth compared

 with fiscal 2018. Our strategy here consists of two essential parts, namely (i) providing service businesses that meet the needs of customers in regions throughout the world, including Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Asia, and (ii) working to cultivate new customers and expand the business model. In Japan, a new periodic inspection reporting system for fire prevention equipment will go into full effect starting in fiscal 2019, which we expect to drive further growth. The service segment includes businesses that utilize the strengths of the Sanwa Group. Along with investigating M&As, we hope to grow by demonstrating the brand power of a leading manufacturer.
L Reforming work styles and improving pro- ductivity: Improving efficiency by utilizing systems
Work-style reforms are a requirement of the times and a theme that we cannot avoid. For this reason, we are employing AI, IoT, and other systems in all sales, design, manufacturing, installa- tion, maintenance, and management processes in order to improve the efficiency of business. Including the systemization and digitalization of ODC and NF, as discussed as part of the region-specific strategies on the previous page, we believe that we can advance work-style reforms in a more beneficial direc- tion by strengthening global initiatives. As a result, we feel these initiatives will help raise productivity and contribute to expanded profits.

  Capital Policy: ¥30 billion in strategic investments over two years
From cash flows, we will allocate ¥30 billion to strategic investments for growth and steadily expand SVA and ROIC in order to build up corporate value.
In fiscal 2001 we adopted SVA as a performance indicator, and work with a particular awareness of capital cost and capital effi- ciency, not simply profit and loss, in North America and Europe.
After reaching ¥12.7 billion in fiscal 2018, SVA is expected to reach ¥15.9 billion in fiscal 2020. Moreover, ROIC reached 15.0% in fiscal 2018 and is forecast to reach 16.4% in fiscal 2020. With both indicators steadily rising under the current Mid-Term Management Plan, we feel this signifies we are accu- mulating corporate value.
Among performance results, for some time our approach has been to emphasize the operating income ratio. Although the actual operating income ratio for fiscal 2015 during the First Three-Year Plan was 7.3% and the actual ratio for fiscal 2018 during the Second Three-Year Plan was 7.7%, our target is to achieve 10%. By increasing the operating income ratio, we expect to further improve ROE and other indicators.
In terms of strategic investments, we plan to allocate approxi- mately ¥30 billion to capital investments and M&As over the two fiscal years of 2019 and 2020 with a focus on promoting multi-product sales, strengthening service businesses, and

growth sectors where synergy effects are anticipated. Specifically, we expect to provide approximately ¥20 billion in strategic investments for M&As and ¥10 billion for equipment.
Shareholder returns were set at an annual dividend of ¥32, as initially forecast. In fiscal 2019, we plan to raise the annual divi- dend by ¥2 to ¥34 (eight consecutive years of dividend increas- es: planned). The payout ratio for fiscal 2018 was 34.4%, with a target of 35% for fiscal 2020.

What Direction to Take?
Third Mid-Term Management Plan
  ESG Message: Key Issues of human resource development and safety
Under the concept of ESG, we place particular importance on human resource development and work to expand systems that enable employees to reach their full potential. Ensuring safety will also influence the future of the company. We will earn the trust of society through uncompromising safety, quality, and compliance.
The perspectives of Environment (E), Social Responsibility (S), and Governance (G), in short ESG, are essential to sustainable corporate growth. Since our founding, we have valued reliability and trust, and have undertaken related initiatives as a matter of course long before ESG became a focus of the market. Although we naturally emphasize all of these themes, we con- sider those involving Social Responsibility (S) to be of particular importance. In fact, of the 20 key issues that we have identified and undertake, 10 of these fall within the scope of Social Responsibility. Although some of the aspects related to human rights, labor practices, and consumer issues are somewhat abstract and vague, we feel that clearly defining the direction of these measures is a key point because this is also an area in which the understanding of people changes continuously.
Increase Sanwa’s “two kinds of reliability” through cooperation among all divisions to promote important ESG issues, and link this to sustainable growth into the future

Two Kinds of Reliability
Reliable Management
A sincere corporate culture that earns the trust of society through safety, quality, corporate governance and thorough compliance
  
 Among issues of Social Responsibility (S), human resource development is of particular importance. Historically, our employees have held a high sense of professional awareness and morals, so our turnover rate has also tended to be low. These types of human resources are our most important man- agement resource, and we make every effort to establish sys- tems that allow our employees to reach their full potential. In addition to our employees, the installation technicians that ulti- mately ensure quality are similarly important. This field is also being affected by aging, which has made it difficult to secure personnel. Likewise, we see our challenge as firmly approaching this issue by enhancing the training system and putting other systems into place. Our business is unique in that we rely heavily on outsourcing to affiliated companies for not just installation, but also for the design and production divisions. Without these partners, our business would not stand. Under our spirit of valu- ing all of those who help create the Sanwa Brand and our sense of working together towards a common goal, going forward we will continue to act by combining our capabilities within this strong relationship of trust.
The second area is safety. We constantly strive to reduce acci- dents at manufacturing and installation sites to as close to zero as possible. Work sites that are rife with accidents do not attract good people, so we also tackle this challenge with an aware- ness of its relationship to our future.
Our growth foundation stands on Two Kinds of Reliability. In short, these are Reliable Business Performance and Reliable Management. The latter refers to earning the trust of society through uncompromising safety, quality, governance, and com- pliance. Instead of approaching both of these with the same weight, we place a greater emphasis on the latter.
In terms of Environment (E), we implement initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gases and waste as a matter of course, but we also believe it is our responsibility as a manufac- turer to develop and provide eco-friendly products that contrib- ute to energy savings and waterproof products that protect life and property from global warming related flood damage. At the same time, we also feel that developing and providing these products is a business opportunity in the face of climate change.
Finally, in terms of Governance (G), we are aware that we must consciously increase the transparency of decision-making. We hope to earn a greater level of trust among all our share- holders and other stakeholders as we work towards sustainable growth.

The Evolution of Sanwa
Multi-Product Sales
A company founded for the manufacture and sale of lightweight shutters, Sanwa Shutter entered the door business in the latter half of the 1960s—by accurately anticipating the changes and needs of the market brought about by the high growth after the war—and since then has been promoting multi-product sales. We will continue to provide diverse products as a major global player in the access systems industry that will advance in leaps and bounds in the global market.
Japan’s first skyscraper, the Kasumigaseki Building, was com- pleted in 1968, and high-rise buildings were constructed one after another at the start of the 1970s. In line with this trend, demand for fireproof doors increased rapidly, and we quickly entered the door business and rapidly expanded our market share. From the 1980s, we promoted diversification of product types through M&A, acquired leading companies with a strong brand presence in each field and worked on multi-product sales, starting with the Showa Front Co., Ltd. for store fronts, Showa Kensan Co., Ltd. for automatic door engines, Venix Co., Ltd. for partitioning products, Sanwa Tajima Corporation for stainless steel products, and Sanwa System Wall Co., Ltd. for wooden school partitioning. The number of Sanwa Group sub-
sidiaries in Japan currently stands at 17 companies. As a result, we have a wide product lineup, including shutters, steel doors, entrances, door openers, garage doors, partitions and industrial sectional doors, and are ranked No. 1 in the industry in terms of the number of products that contribute to safety and security as well as to convenient lifestyles. It is our belief that providing products and services that provide safety, security, and conve- nience to society leads to the resolution of social issues and, as a result, the Company’s value creation. We aim to solve the problems in people’s social lives such as those listed below by providing to society a wide variety of product groups cultivated through our product diversification strategy.

 Why Was Sanwa Group Able to Establish
its Global Position?
 Since we established Sanwa Shutter Hong Kong in 1986, the Sanwa Group has been pursuing global expansion ahead of other Japanese companies in the industry. As a major global player in the access systems industry, we have now secured a strong pres- ence in 25 countries and regions worldwide. So why were we able to accomplish this? Firstly, we were quick off the mark within the industry when it comes to focusing atten-
 tion on overseas markets and establishing ourselves in those locations. Next, from the latter half of the 1990s to the 2000s, we acquired the top manufacturer in North America and the No. 2 manufacturer in Europe, and with both localization and PDCA promotion we worked to create a firm foundation in both of those regions. With an eye on 2020 we are raising our profile in the global markets in which the Sanwa Group conducts business, and continuing to pursue expansion and to strengthen our presence across all regions, thus becoming a truly major global player.
The Basis of Sanwa Group Growth
Focusing on Overseas Markets Where There Is Room to Grow
Established in 1956, the Sanwa Group announced its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s Second Section in 1963, the first company to do so, even though we were a latecomer to the industry. The funds we procured were allocated to investments for growth, and we aggressively grew our presence nationwide, becoming the manufacturer with the top share of Japan’s shutter market. However, looking to the long term, we determined that major growth would be difficult within the confines of the Japanese market. Given this, over the decade of the 1990s we began to look in earnest and consider setting up a presence in overseas markets.
Aiming to Achieve North American Market Penetration through a Corporate Acquisition
In 1974, we had already entered into a technical tie-up with Overhead Door Corporation (ODC) of the U.S. when we conclud- ed a licensing agreement with that company to sell our respec- tive products in both Japan and the U.S., and to mutually announce both companies’ newly developed technologies. From
this point until the 1990s we worked to accumulate U.S. market research in the firm belief that success in expanding overseas would not be easily forthcoming without an understanding of that market’s cultural characteristics. Market penetration will be difficult by merely bringing Japanese building materials as is to overseas locations that differ in terms of culture, climate, and weather. We reached the conclusion that M&A would be the most suitable way to achieve development, and consequently set out to find a partner company that we could consider a good match for Sanwa.
The Acquisition of ODC, the First Step on the Road to Overseas Expansion
In our approach to a corporate acquisition, we had as a primary consideration the selec-
tion of a company with
which we had chemistry.
Given that, the conclu- sion we decided upon was to acquire ODC, the company that since 1974 we had entered into a

acquisition was approximately ¥51.7 billion, which was close to 30% of our net sales in fiscal 1996, that being roughly ¥187.5 bil- lion. This was the largest deal in Japan’s building material industry at the time. At that point ODC boasted the top share of the mar- ket for commercial overhead doors and shutters, had net sales of $550 million (over ¥60 billion) and operated with approximately 400 distributors across the U.S. This acquisition marked our first full-fledged step toward globalization.
A Three-polar structure in Japan, the U.S., and Europe with the Acquisition of NF Group
The 2003 acquisition of the Novoferm (NF) Group, a venerable manufacturer of doors and shutters in Germany, secured for the Sanwa Group a three-point presence, namely in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The NF Group is a long-standing manufacturer, established in 1955, with manufacturing bases that consisted of its core site in Germany, together with others in France, Holland, Italy and Spain. Its sales network spanned all regions of Europe, occupying a position as a leader among major companies.
U.S. and in Europe as well with the acquisitions of Alpha Deuren International B.V. of the Netherlands and Norsud Gestion S.A.S, of France among others, and secured the No. 2 share in Europe’s industrial door, garage door and steel door field.
Thorough Localization, PDCA
We were aware that to generate maximum post-acquisition syn- ergies, before taking on product or technology issues, we would need to have mutual understanding and communication. Based on the relationships of trust we had cultivated, we raised the level of interest toward our respective products and technologies, and developed a process to cooperatively tackle the required localization. In addition, to quickly get up to speed at a high level, the Sanwa Group mission of “safety, security and conve- nience,” as well as PDCA would as a general rule need to be thoroughly engrained outside of Japan as well. This became the foundation of our path to becoming a major global player.

 The Challenges of Achieving Growth
A Briefing from the Executive Officer Responsible for Global Business Unit
   L Bold decision to early on establish
an overseas presence
Still tasks for a truly major global player
I’d like to discuss the topic of globalization in the Sanwa Group. If I were to be asked, “Is the Sanwa Group already a truly global company?” my response would be: No. Likely our investors would think that there are still things that could be done, so we must pick up the pace and become a truly global company.
That said, looking back at things now, the accomplishment of making two major acquisitions, the early-stage acquisition of ODC in North America in 1996 and the 2003 acquisition of Novoferm (NF) Group in Europe, were bold decisions for management to have made. What is important to remember is that acquiring companies that we already had lengthy rela- tionships with did not go smoothly owing to coincidence. When we made the two acquisitions we already had a thor- ough understanding of what those companies were about, and the results of our careful considerations led to success.
In addition to the remarkable foresight of Sanwa Shutter, a company that at that time operated domestically in Japan, certainly the results we have achieved today reflect the per- sistent efforts to find solutions to each of those big issues that existed below the surface, unexposed, following the acquisitions.
L Making capital expenditures without hesitation, and charging ahead
on acquisitions
When I first became involved in Sanwa Group’s international business around 2015, I did not have the impression that there was management being conducted to respond to mar- ket needs. The first thing I applied my efforts to was getting local management to understand the importance that they would need to somehow quickly gain an awareness of mar- ket needs to respond with maximum speed to get ahead of our competitors. The next thing I had them take another look at was the product lineup and production equipment.
We are a manufacturer so of course we aim to run at full capacity, but at the time, in both the U.S. and Europe, the equipment had certainly seen better days. This was due to it being the period after the Lehman shock and a prolonged era of caution with regard to capital expenditures. I was very active in having local management consider, then take action to develop new products that met market needs, and to introduce equipment that could make those products with high productivity.
It seems that we Japanese do not have as detailed an understanding of overseas operations as the local people. For that reason, rather than acting like a know-it-all, it is import- ant to leave daily management up to the local team, and on the other hand, give them clear guidance on the fundamen- tals of management policy and strategy. For example, telling them “The mountain you should climb this year is not Mt. Takao, and it is not Mt. Fuji either. Your goal is Mt. Tanigawa.” However, “You can climb the southern face or the northern face. That’s up to you.” This is what I mean.
L North America (ODC): Low-share products should capture a 30% share, and in Japan as well, introduce new
products we have not dealt with before
Management issues such as the following come up with regard to North America. The first is the introduction of ERP. We have been deploying Oracle’s integrated system since 2013, but this is taking more time than expected, and deployment expenses are ballooning. According to plans completion is still years away, however we are applying quite a large amount of human resources to shore things up, and it is a struggle.
The second issue is do we somehow raise to a 30% share of the market those products that are below that level, and to do that, developing concrete measures and then implementing them. Also, the U.S. is an immense market that can be broadly categorized into East, Central and Western areas, but within these, it is becoming important also have a strategy to some- how raise the share of regions with a low market share.
 
   The third issue is entering into new business domains. Is that what in Japan we would call “multiple product types?” This is not entering completely different types of industry, but we are setting our sights on lines with growth potential in the access systems industry. To offer one example, I would definitely like to get into the security door business where a door does not open for just anybody, but only those people whose identity can be confirmed. If there was a good com- pany that stood out from the crowd, I would really like to acquire it.
L Europe (NF): Expanding to unserved areas, and anticipating ongoing two-digit growth
For the past few years in Europe we have been making solid progress, with double-digit growth every year. Market share is lower than that in the U.S., so there is still room for growth. It is possible that we will continue to see double-dig- it growth, and we are setting goals so as to definitely reach net sales of one-billion euros by about 2023.
We currently have the 20 EU nations as our home market for Europe, but within that we would like to fill in those areas where we do not yet have a presence, and are now tar- geting the UK, Northern Europe and Eastern Europe. Perhaps we will move into those areas organically, or gain a presence through the corporate acquisition process. Following that is the expansion of existing product sales. As one way to do that, “bundling” multiple products together for sale is a way that is proving effective.
L China/Asia: Achieving synergies amongst each country’s operating companies, promoting localization of management
To tell the truth, there are many issues in Asia and there is a mountain of things that should be done. Differing from the paths taken leading to the establishment of business in the U.S. and Europe, there was no acquisition process, rather, almost all of the locations in Asia have been newly estab-
lished. There are also many cases where we leveraged cus- tomers in Japan that were themselves setting up operations in Asia. When the Japanese companies pull out, though, we have been faced with the difficulty of contraction to business scale. The conventional approach had been to conduct busi- ness based on the strategy tailored to each country, but from now we are changing our stance and endeavoring to take ASEAN as a single market. Within the ASEAN region there is also a preferential tax system and we will try out product flexibility in the region. By treating China, Hong Kong and Taiwan as “Greater China,” we are not thinking of each indi- vidual company’s profits on an independent basis, but this is a policy in terms of mutual accommodation. On the other hand, when discussing sales’ strategy it is important to be clear about whether the main targets are Japanese compa- nies, local companies, or both.
Furthermore, we urgently need to put in place a manage- ment structure, and with regard to the short term, the issue is to localize management. In 2018 we went from a minor investment of 18.88% in the Indonesian business, to a 51% majority investment and appointed an Indonesian national as the president. Whether or not this will be successful will be the touchstone, and if it does generate positive results, I would like to try something similar in other markets as well.
We have set from ¥20 billion to ¥25 billion as our sales tar- get in China and the rest of Asia for 2023. Although the region accounts only for a nominal percent of all markets, I would like to hike this by about 10%. Looking only at Japanese company customers, we need to be above at least a 50% share among Japanese general contractors that have a presence in China and ASEAN regions.

 FY2018 Business Performance and FY2019 Outlook
 FY2018 Net Sales Increased 6.4%
Year on Year to ¥234.0 Billion
The main company, Sanwa Shutter Corporation, engaged in measures to increase quantity and improve quality while responding to natural disaster demand and recorded net sales of ¥198.6 billion (an increase of 6.0% year on year). Operating income totaled ¥18.34 billion (an increase of 7.2% year on year), but there were major issues on the supply side—including coordination problems between manufacturing, installation and logistics as well as cost increases—and as a result the initial fore- cast of ¥19.5 billion was not reached and remained an issue.
Japanese subsidiaries recorded net sales of ¥35.4 billion (an increase of 9.0% year on year) and operating income of ¥1.21 bil- lion (an increase of 4.6% year on year). Although each subsidiary improved on its sales results from the previous year, a lack of growth for the Sanwa System Wall and the impact of cost increas- es resulted in operating income not reaching the initial forecast of ¥1.5 billion.
For FY2019, Sanwa Shutter Corporation is forecasting net sales of ¥208.0 billion (an increase of 4.7% year on year) and
Japanese subsidiaries ¥43.5 billion (an increase of 22.9% year on year). Sanwa Shutter is forecasting operating income of ¥20.2 billion (an increase of 10.1% year on year), and Japanese subsidiaries ¥2.42 billion (an increase of 98.9% year on year).

Business Strategy
A Look Back at Our Second Three-Year Plan
Tasks: Dedicated System for Strategic Products and Stabilization of Logistics and Installation System
In our business in Japan, we focused on growth by maintaining profit from core products and by multi-product sales initiatives and on strengthening the service business. In the case of our core products, we implemented measures to cover increases in raw material costs, such as for steel, and in variable costs by passing them on in increased sales prices, but these did not fil- ter down sufficiently. We also experienced problems on the sup- ply side, thus our initial profit plan was not achieved. With regard to the multi-product sales initiatives, we have made progress with the establishment of a dedicated system for stra- tegic products, such as partitions, entrances, and exteriors, but this has not yet led to the establishment of a foundation for

L Expansion of Core Business
In our core business, we will work to improve marginal profits by promoting business-specific customer strategies while strengthening the revenue base. We will also increase our domi- nance over other companies by strengthening our unrivalled product appeal.
L Expansion of Growing Business
In growing business, we will aim to expand our business domains by realizing growth strategies while implementing a strategy to defeat rival manufacturers in competition for market share. Specifically, we will strengthen synergies through cooper- ation among domestic Group companies and put school parti- tion specialist Sanwa System Wall on track as we aim to expand the partition business. We will also strengthen our development capabilities and product appeal to exceed those of specialized manufacturers.
L Expand Service Business
In the service business, we are planning to expand our share of the legal inspections market, expand the maintenance business from legal inspections, maintain and expand the foundation of our general repair and maintenance business, and thus steadily grow the business.
growth. The strengthening of dedicated systems and the estab- lishment of stable logistics and installation systems remained as outstanding issues.
In the service business, we advanced improvements of busi- ness structure and business expansion. We responded to the periodic inspection reporting system for fire prevention equip- ment, introduced in accordance with the revision to the Building Standards Act that has been in force since June 2016. As a result of having aimed to maintain a market share of 50% or more, the maintenance and service business increased signifi- cantly by ¥8.6 billion (a 137.8% increase) to ¥31.6 billion over the three-year period. There was still a shortage of maintenance personnel, however, and retaining sufficient personnel remained an issue.

L Strengthening of Manufacturing, Logistics, Installation Structures
We are working to strengthen our supply systems by utilizing the latest IT systems, such as AI and the IoT, for business expan- sion. In manufacturing, we will promote production efficiency by maintaining production lead times, strengthening our manu- facturing capabilities, and systematization. In logistics, we will pay close attention to keeping to delivery deadlines and to maintaining and expanding our transport capacity by strength- ening our logistics management systems. In installation, we will focus on developing a training system to retain installation per- sonnel and improve our installation capabilities.
L Reforming Employee Safety Awareness, Strengthening the Product Quality Control Framework
We are working to reform employee safety awareness and strengthen management systems while aiming to eradicate occupational accidents. We are also aiming to improve our cor- porate brand by maintaining product quality.
L Productivity Improvements, Work-Style Reforms
We will work to drastically improve productivity through opera- tional efficiency and process standardization, which will lead to work-style reforms.

Value Creation for Business Expansion
Expansion of safe, secure products for use in event of disaster: “Airote” steel door with opening force reduction mechanism launched
Sanwa Shutter Corporation launched its “Airote” steel door, which features a mecha- nism that allows the door to open with minimal force to facilitate firefighting and ensur- ing a safe escape route in the event of a fire. This product is a steel door for installation in rooms with special evacuation staircases or in emergency elevator lobbies. By means of a mechanism that divides the door into front and rear sides, “Airote” creates a gap to relieve the difference in pressure, thereby enabling the door to be opened with minimal force. Under normal circumstances it acts as single door, and in the event of a fire, the door can be opened by a mechanism that releases the connection between the front and rear of the door, thus we have added to our lineup of products that ensure ease of operation and safety.
Promoting Domestic Group Optimization
The “Airote” door facilitates firefighting and safe evacuations.
          From fiscal 2019, we have consolidated four companies: Showa Kensan Co., Ltd., Tajima Metal Work Co., Ltd., Hayashi Kogyo Co., Ltd. and Sanwa Electronics Engineering Co., Ltd. Our aims are to improve our capabilities in the manufacture and sale of automatic doors and of mailboxes, which are positioned as multi-product sales initiative products, and improve our capabilities in the manufac- ture of our core shutter and door products, while strengthening the management of the entire domestic group. We will work to speed up business expansion in Japan by sharing issues and strategies and demonstrating synergies through closer collaboration, such as in the development of new customers. We are targeting total net sales from these four companies of ¥6.2 billion and oper- ating income of ¥600 million in fiscal 2019, and total net sales of ¥7.8 billion and operating income of ¥ 700 million* in fiscal 2020.

 Factors in Co-creating Value with Stakeholders
Development of Safe, Secure Service Providers: Fire Prevention Equipment Periodic Inspection Skills Contest Held
The periodic inspection reporting system for fire prevention equipment, which became mandatory following the revision to the Building Standards Act, has been fully opera- tional since June 2019. In connection with this, to improve maintenance inspection skills, Sanwa Shutter Corporation held a contest in May 2019 that brought together top-class installers from each region to pit their skills against each other. The top installers com- peted on all 22 technical items, including preparation and inspection work as well as manners. The main purpose is to work to improve the technical level and manners of installers, but one of the contest’s other aims is to record the work processes of the best people for training purposes, share those processes with installers across the country, and standardize them.
In the years to come, we will continue to provide social safety, security and conve- nience by improving the maintenance inspection and repair techniques of each and every one of our installers and building relationships of trust with our customers.
Improvements in Productivity by Installation Labor-Saving
Sanwa Shutter Corporation has made progress with its installation labor-saving efforts. These include its integrated-shutter installation method, by which the shafts and slats of heavy shutters are assembled in advance at the factories and then brought in. This is a “flameless” installation method, by which doors are attached without using welding, and employs a process of connecting all electrical components beforehand. At the pres- ent time, the Company has more than 3,800 installers, but shortages of manpower are expected to become more serious in the years to come due to the ongoing aging of the population. Labor-saving installation therefore enhances safety and productivity at con- struction sites and ensures high quality through efficient work.

 Fiscal 2018 results and fiscal 2019 forecasts
On a US$ basis, fiscal 2018 sales were up 4.9%
year on year to $1,056.6 million.
In the North American business, sales improved 3.4% year on
year to ¥116.6 billion, while operating income was flat (±0.0%)
year on year at ¥8.78 billion. Sales expanded by ¥3.9 billion (an 11,5,5000 increase of 3.5% year on year) more than initially expected.
While higher sales prices served to offset the increase in raw
material costs, operating income declined ¥0.25 billion (a
decrease of 2.8% year on year), falling short of our initial fore-
cast, due largely to weaker-than-expected sales volume.

Looking back on the Second Three-year Mid-Term Management Plan
 The strengthening of sales channels has produced a certain amount of positive effects in the mainstay door business, and we have been able to achieve QCD (quality, cost, delivery) improvements in manufacturing operations. We also pursued aggressive overseas development, including the project in Lima in South America, and moved forward with the restructuring

    L Targeting profit growth through a strengthening of the core businesses
While housing starts in the US are expected to remain flat from fiscal 2018 in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, we expect capi- tal investment to remain firm. Based on these external condi- tions, we target ODC sales in fiscal 2020 rising 6.5% from fiscal 2018 to ¥124.2 billion, with operating income rising 19.0% compared to fiscal 2018 to ¥10.45 billion.
With the goal of expanding our market share in residential and commercial doors, we intend to strengthen our upstream businesses and promote improvements in distributor support. Focusing on metropolitan areas and the west coast, where our market share is relatively low, we are working to improve quality and capacity through a shift to automated production in line with our goal of completing the introduction of ERP systems.
We are also considering expanding into the security as a peripheral business to our core business.
L Expanding our business model and strengthening our service operations
We are working to improve added value, as well as expand our business model and develop new customers, by providing ser- vices with a close connection to the local communities. Efforts to strengthen the services business in North America are focused mainly on Creative Door Services (Canada), with direct- ly managed sales offices (NS) being restructured as part of the Door Business. We are also working to expand the number of automated door plants through M&A and improve profitability through the introduction of a field service system.

Creating value to expand our business
Expanding supply capacity in door openers and automatic doors at our plant in Mexico
The expansion to increase production capacity at our plant in Matamoros, Mexico, where we manufacture automatic doors and door openers in the North American region, was completed in May 2019. The expansion was aimed at increasing capacity in the automatic door and door opener businesses and proved successful in greatly enhancing production capacity. With the goal of further improving production efficiency, we intend to close our Baltic facility in the US and consolidate door opener production at the Matamoros plant. In line with expectations for economic growth and favorable construction investment in the North American market, we intend to focus on improving efficiency and further expanding capacity so that we can effectively meet the expected increase in demand as we enter peripheral business domains, including the access control equipment business.
Co-creating value with our stakeholders Enhancing customer/partner engagement
The sales system in North America is focused on selling products through distributors, and not directly to end users. The distributors, dealing mainly in Overhead Door Corporation (ODC) products, play an important role in creating value for the group. ODC celebrated the 98th anniversary of its founding in 2019, and its distributors, with a sales network of about 400 companies throughout the US, are often referred to as “Ribbon Distributors” in line with ODC’s ribbon logo. With the goal of continuously strengthening its relationships with the Ribbon Distributors, ODC uses feedback gained from regular dialogue and information exchanges with the distributors to improve product quality and develop new products. The 2019 National Ribbon Distributor Meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona was a large-scale event, with about 700 participants from 220 distributorships.

L Targeting further advancement through promotion of digitalization
With the goal of advancing operational reform, we are promot- ing continued efficiency improvements through the NF3.0 Project, as well as enhanced efficiency in sales, services, produc- tion, and distribution through a shift to digitalization in line with the launch of the NF4.0 Project. We are also enhancing head office functions to support growth across Europe, includ- ing through the establishment of a new internal auditing department.
L Targeting continued strength from fiscal 2018, improved profit margins
Numerical targets for fiscal 2020 include sales of ¥73.4 billion and operating income of ¥4.32 billion. With growth investment in residential and non-residential construction expected to slow over the next two years, we do not expect robust sales growth and along with the impact of exchange rates the outlook is for low growth. On the other hand, profit margins in the business are lower than they are in the US and Japan, and we have accordingly set a target for operating income growth over two years of 12.8%.
As part of our strategy aimed at an expansion in the core businesses, we target enhanced production capacity in dock levelers and an expanded lineup of high-speed sheet shutters, as well as a strengthening in the service and spare parts busi- nesses, and an expansion in sales in the industrial doors busi- ness. In the hinged doors business, we aim to strengthen our upstream strategies while advancing synergies with Robust, which we acquired in 2019, and expand sales channels in the Northern European, Southern European, and Eastern European markets. Likewise, we aim in the garage door business to expand sales channels in the Southern European, and Eastern European markets by bolstering our brand strength.

   Basic Strategies

 Creating value to expand our business
Expanding into areas in Europe where our market share is relatively low
In May 2019, the NF Group acquired all shares of Robust AB, which is developing the hinged door business in Sweden, Norway, and the UK. The hinged door business in Northern Europe and the UK, and in particular for security and fire doors, is very important and is expected to show favorable growth over the next several years. The Robust AB acquisition allows the NF Group to bolster its hinged door business and target further growth through the maximization of group company synergies. The acquisition also allows us to further penetrate the Northern European market and enhance our presence in areas where our market share has been to date relatively low.
Robust AB recorded fiscal 2018 sales of about ¥3.28 billion and had 175 employees.
  Operational process reforms that co-create value with stakeholders
Launching the NF4.0 digitalization project
One of the key themes in the Sanwa Group’s Third Mid-Term Management Plan is the launch of the NF4.0 project promoting digitalization in the European business. The project aims at the digitalization of operations in Europe as a whole in order to improve produc- tion and operational efficiency in the sales, manufacturing, and management divisions throughout the region. Realization of NF4.0 could allow digitalization of the quote and ordering process, where the needs of the customers are at their highest. We are also work- ing to achieve enhanced efficiency and optimize the operational process models in produc- tion and distribution. In sales, digitalization would allow us to provide added value in a variety of ways, including by displaying product delivery and arrival dates, providing proper- ty-related information, as well as information on all offered products, and linking our sys- tem to that of the customer.

Third Mid-Term Management Plan
Fiscal 2020 Targets
¥7.3 billion ¥0.34 billion
L Aiming for Further Business Expansion by Bringing China and Asia Businesses Within the Scope of Consolidation
In our China Business we will take action to strengthen our door business and our business targeting logistics facilities to realize business synergies within the East China region where Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door and Novoferm (Shanghai) are located. We also will work to strengthen cooperation between Sanwa Shutter (Hong Kong) and Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door to expand business in the South China region. We aim to grow business in Taiwan with efforts to boost production capac- ity. We have set consolidated net sales targets for the China Business in fiscal 2020 at ¥5.6 billion, and for operating income, the target is ¥0.3 billion.
Value Creation for Business Expansion Integrated Management in the Asian Region
In October 2018, we took a controlling interest in PT. Sanwamas Metal Industry of Indonesia, hiking our investment from 18.88% to 51.02%. Leveraging this development, we will integrate management among Asia’s ASEAN region. Up until now, the primary method of business development was for each country in the ASEAN region to conduct local production for local sales. However, as an element of the plan going forward, we will make progress on an optimized strategy that takes all of the ASEAN region into consider- ation and construct a flexible structure that moves beyond such a framework that places restrictions on each country.
The mutual supply of products produced in the plants of each country and consolidation of production bases will work to promote business growth in each country, and together with that, we aim to expand sales to markets that have the potential for future economic growth, even if they currently do not have sales functions.
Co-creating Value together with Stakeholders Seizing Upon Synergies in the China Business
Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door has captured a large-scale order for Sanwa Group products to support a construction project to build the Mongolia-Japan Teaching Hospital in Mongolia’s capital of Ulaanbaatar, which is the first medical university hospital for that country. This project was undertaken as part of the Japanese government’s Official Development Assistance (ODA), with construction having commenced in 2015, and com- pleted in the summer of 2019. Under this project we delivered shutters, overhead sliders, doors, partitions, and sash products.
Ulaanbaatar is known for having the lowest average temperature of any of the world’s capitals. In winter, temperatures fall below minus 40°C so the sash used here employ a dis- tinctive three-panel glass. Patient rooms feature the “Smood” sliding doors manufactured by Novoferm (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and installation was cooperatively conducted by Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door and Novoferm (Shanghai). We will continue to integrate management operations in the China and Asia businesses to capture synergies amongst each company.

 In the Asia Business, we will work to optimize productivity across ASEAN through the development of production bases. Vina-Sanwa is to undertake various efforts, including the raising of production capacity and taking action on measures to strengthen installation capabilities, while Sanwamas Metal Industry is to steadily enhance equipment. We have set consoli- dated net sales targets for the Asia Business in fiscal 2020 at ¥1.7 billion, and for operating income, the target is ¥40 million.
Three companies in the China Business (Shanghai Baosteel- Sanwa Door, An-Ho Metal Industrial (Taiwan), Sanwa Shutter (Hong Kong)), and one in the Asia Business (Vina-Sanwa) will come under the scope of consolidation from fiscal 2019. Leading up to fiscal 2020 we will focus efforts on further expanding the scope of consolidation.

Decision-Making Process for Key ESG Issues (Materiality)
In light of international trends and the business environment in which Sanwa Group operates, and given the vigorous efforts companies are making to take global action toward achieving a sustainable society in recent years, the Sanwa Group has used the following process to identify those ESG priority issues (materi- ality) upon which we should be applying our energies.
         STEP 1 Identify ESG Issues
Along with creating broad catego- ries of ESG classification based on ISO 26000, we identified issues tak- ing into consideration external evaluations, trends and other infor- mation with regard to each respec- tive broad category.
STEP 2 Categorize Issues and Specify Key Issues
  Upon organizing the identified ESG issues, we assessed degree of impor- tance based on the dual tracks of relevance to stakeholders and to the Company, then based on that, specified priority issues to tackle.
STEP 3 Confirm Appropriateness
Made comprehensive decision of priority issues based on delibera- tions at the quality, environment and CSR promotion meetings and the CSR Promotion Council.

        In 2007, the Sanwa Group formulated its “Sanwa Group Environmental Policy,” and strived to reduce the volume of energy it consumed and the waste it produced. Climate change has for the past few years become an issue garnering attention. On one hand this means such risks as rising costs for supplies and increasingly stringent CO2 emissions regulations, while on the other, it presents an opportunity for business growth with environmentally friendly products that contribute to a sustainable society, and by providing disaster prevention products with qualities that help prevent water damage and that stand up well to abnormal weather conditions.
Sanwa Group, developing its business globally, is bolstering its efforts to address an issue that is gaining worldwide attention, namely “human rights.” Eliminating discrimination and harassment based on nationality, gender, age, disability or other characteristic will lead to the creation of a workplace that is free-spirited and open, high motivation among employees and the fostering of loyalty, while also raising corporate competitive capabilities and generating a stream of innovation.
Sanwa Group requires a multitude of labor capabilities, from development to installation, so that its building materials and building opening products can exert functionality as access systems. This is why the Company seeks to create workplaces where people can carry out their duties with peace of mind given the initiatives taken to remedy long working hours, and that have respect for the diversity and occupational safety of employees. Moreover, at the foundation of business is the fostering of human talent that will be a driver of corporate growth, and this will be a source of competitiveness.
Sanwa Group conducts business activities based on its mission of “providing safety, security and convenience to further contribute to the prosperity of society.” We support the lifestyles of people and the places they live, on a 24-7 basis. Continuing to do that into the future requires providing products and services that contribute to safety, security and convenience, as well as the pursuit of quality assurance and customer satisfaction. This is the Company’s raison d’etre and is at the core of how we differentiate ourselves.
Sanwa Shutter Corporation, comprising the core of the Group, was the industry’s quickest player off the mark in building a nationwide production and sales network, which has become the cornerstone of our business. We now conduct business activities deeply rooted in local communities in regions throughout the world. Product development that takes into account local characteristics, co-existence with communities, and contributing to society through our core business will link to the development of both local society and the Sanwa Group.
Sanwa Group is a global corporation with Group companies in Japan, the U.S., Europe and Asia, and amid escalating corporate competition, we are boosting corporate value through efforts to build highly transparent management systems, strengthen compliance, and conduct proper risk management. We work to achieve lively communication with various stakeholders, and believe it important to perform business activities while listening to such voices.
Sanwa Group conducts business activities that are supported by a wide range of stakeholders, including partners and suppliers, installers, as well as design and factory support companies. As we move into the future, we have a firm understanding of the importance of building relationships that are just and fair, as well as ethical, so as to grow and develop together with these stakeholders, and to pursue being a company that is trusted by society.

Creating Values through ESG
Sustainability Management Approach
Stakeholder Engagement
In pressing forward with CSR activities, we focus on dialogue with a diverse range of stakeholders. The points made and information that emerge from such dialogue that are deemed to be of importance to Company operations are provided as feedback to top management.
Dialogue with Customers
Sanwa Group products are used in the openings of a wide variety of structures, from buildings, condominiums, factories, and warehouses, to schools, medical and welfare facilities, and others to support the lives of people on a daily basis. Together with responding to the diverse comments and requests of customers with a nationwide network of over 250 locations and a 24-7 repair service, the opinions acquired at our customer centers are shared throughout the Group, which leads to improved products and services.
Dialogue with Employees
In addition to briefings on corporate strategy and vision provided by top man- agement to employees, we convey the importance of promoting CSR and com- pliance through internal newsletters that are issued four times a year as well as messages sent by e-mail. Sanwa Shutter Corporation’s management team, led by the president, visits the approximately 10 locations twice a year to explain strategy and policies, and to exchange opinions. In addition, the Employee Awareness Survey and internal whistle blower system work to improve organiza- tional climate and eradicate improper behavior.
Dialogue with Partners
The “Sanwakai” group, consists of roughly 110 companies that are Sanwa Shutter’s suppliers, factory support companies and other partners, facilitates the sharing of information and takes QCDE* initiatives to the next level through syner- gies gained from mutual suppliers. The Company is pursuing long-term mutual development based on strengthened ties and as one of the activities of the “Sanwakai” we are bringing together a purchasing group, consisting of suppliers that enables reduced costs and improved quality, and a manufacturing group of factory support companies that has priority goals of raising quality and performing safety activities, among others.
* QCDE: An abbreviation for Quality, Cost, Delivery and Environment
ESG Data
Dialogue with Shareholders and Investors
We are striving to achieve sustainable growth and to raise corporate value by disclosing information in a timely and appropriate manner, and reflecting the content of the dialogue we have with all of our shareholders and investors back to management. We hold financial results briefings on a biannual basis, and individual IR meetings over 200 times a year, while also holding an international road show to North America, Europe and Asia, as well as briefings to individual investors and plant tours to institutional investors, among other activities. We publish the “Integrated Report” annually.
Dialogue with Installers
We make concerted efforts to raise installation quality and enhance engagement with the over 3,800 installers who are the lifeline of the Company in their sup- port of safety, security and convenience through access systems. Installers can pick up information on installation quality and occupational safety conveyed at regular monthly occupational safety meetings, and in addition to all types of training and contests, we provide long-service awards, and support for benefits packages. We also publish a biannual public relations magazine catering to installers, among other initiatives.
Dialogue with Local Communities
As a good corporate citizen, the Sanwa Group uses product materials produced in local prefectures and conducts activities deeply rooted in local communities, such as factory tours and Sanwa Environmental Day, in which 1,500 people par- ticipate every year. In addition, the Group seeks solutions to societal problems in the course of its business activities, including the development of products that are environmentally friendly and that serve to support disaster prevention, while also actively performing work to contribute to society, such as conducting dona- tion drives and volunteer activities.

  Sanwa Shutter Corporation works to reduce waste by providing on-site guidance at high-emissions locations and promoting recycling at factories. Moreover, improvements made to the coating lines at the Ota Door Plant and Hiroshima Plant
during fiscal 2017 served to improve the
adhesion rates of paint and reduced the
amount of waste coating. An-Ho Metal

Human Resource Initiatives
The source of corporate value creation lies in the full participation of every employee. As measures designed to utilize a diverse range of human resources, the Sanwa Group promotes the active role of women, culti- vates global competence, mobilizes senior workers, and employs those with disabilities. These measures develop human resources that can drive growth and maximize the capabilities of the organization.
  Policy
The Sanwa Group creates new value that contributes to the resolution of customer and social issues by nurturing an organizational culture that respects and embraces the diversity of each employee. In addition, the Group focuses on the development of human resources capable of creating value by enhancing systems and work environments that enable employees to maximize their capabilities.
Human Resource Development
Sanwa Shutter Corporation introduced a new training system called the “Sanwa Professional Human Resources Training Plan.” Through job rotations over the course of two years, this system provides new college graduates who entered the company in fiscal 2019 with the opportunity to learn about the Company’s core operations of sales, installation, factory work, and design. The goal of this system is to ensure closer cooperation between production, sales, and engineer- ing, as well as to train human resources that can make decisions through a comprehensive, optimized field of view.
Moreover, the Sanwa Holdings Corporation Global Human Resource Planning Division takes the lead in cultivating global com- petence, and works to increase the speed of training based on the two educational pillars of overseas practical training and e-learning.
During fiscal 2018, 12 managers from Group companies in China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam were invited to Japan to participate in the Asia Group Company Manager Training program, which educates participants on the Sanwa Group Mission, Values, and PDCA, among others. This program spreads Sanwa Group’s DNA throughout the Asian Region while promoting the localization of the Asian business.

Some of these programs include welding training and product installation qualification training.
In addition, the Group utilizes practical skill training videos at safe- ty meetings and training sessions throughout Japan as a means of horizontally deploying inspection skills and expertise. Winners of the “Fire Prevention Equipment Regular Inspection Skill Contest” who achieved outstanding results appear in these videos for this purpose.

Respect for human rights is a social responsibility of corporations, where human rights must be respected among all stakeholders, not only employees. The Sanwa Group stands firmly for the respect of human dig- nity, and recognizes the diverse set of values held by individuals. The Group respects individual character and personality, and goes beyond the requirements of the law in presenting a stance that does not endorse discrimination, child labor or forced labor.
 The Sanwa Group respects the character and individuality of each person from the perspective of respect for Policy humanity and conducts business activities giving due consideration to the human rights of all stakeholders,
including customers, shareholders and employees.
 Increasing the Awareness of Human Rights

Harassment Training Seminar
 The Sanwa Group is committed to conducting business activities under its mission of providing safety, security and convenience to further contribute to the prosperity of society. Aside from the obvious of providing product safety, ensuring a safe working environment for employees, a major asset of the Sanwa Group, is also a critical issue. The Group promotes safety education and on-site improvements at all factories and installation sites.
  Policy
As a company engaged in manufacturing, the Sanwa Group recognizes that ensuring the health and safety of employees is fundamental to our sustainability and our responsibility as a Company. Thus, the Group does its utmost to create a work environment that takes mental and physical wellbeing into consideration based on the notion that this is the responsibility of the company.
Manufacturing Site Initiatives
The Sanwa Group works to raise safety awareness and strengthen its management system in line with its annual health and safety action plan as a means of eliminating occupational accidents. A safety note- book covering matters related to safety such as safety-related laws, risk prediction activities and training, and safe operation guidelines has been translated into six languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Vietnamese and Indonesian) for the Group’s foreign workers, which have been increasing in number in recent years.
In addition, the Sanwa Shutter Corporation Shizuoka Plant has introduced work-assistance suits for the purpose of reducing the physical burden on the backs of its workers that handle doors. The Group will continue to strive towards improving the work environ- ment and work efficiency in aims of reducing the burden on its diverse range of workers, including women and the elderly.
Installation Site Initiatives
The Sanwa Group takes steps to prevent and eliminate occupational accidents through regular, continuous safety education at installation sites. Similarly, during safety-related meetings throughout Japan the Group also holds presentations regarding actions that can be taken to prevent accidents. These presentations are made by those who have been involved in occupational accidents.
In addition, installation managers provide “Job dispatch training” to all installation technicians using “ Job dispatch card” These cards provide advanced instructions regarding the site conditions and rules for the purpose of eliminating occupational accidents and accidents where installation is at fault as a result of insufficient information provided beforehand and insufficient planning.
Shanghai Baosteel-Sanwa Door sends dedicated supervisors involved in the safety of the company to randomly selected installation sites to check the clothing of installation technicians and the on-site facilities.

Quality Initiatives
Enhancing quality management for products and pursuing safety is the primary responsibility of manufac- turers. The Sanwa Group undertakes initiatives to improve product safety, installation quality, service, and traceability for the purpose of preventing the recurrence of product-related accidents. By striving to improve quality and safety in these ways, the Group secures the trust and satisfaction of its customers around the world.
  Policy
The Sanwa Group works to improve quality and safety, the primary responsibilities of a manufacturer, in all processes from development to sales, production, installation and maintenance.
Further Improving Product Quality
The Sanwa Group promotes measures aimed at achieving the quality targets set by each company. Group companies in Japan confirm the progress towards these targets during the Quality, Environment and CSR Promotion Council, held once every six months.
Sanwa Shutter Corporation holds product quality and safety meet- ings every month in order to prevent the recurrence of complaints and product-related accidents. Meanwhile, the Purchasing Department directly visits suppliers for head office purchases to monitor quality and propose improvements. In particular, the Group is strengthening its supply chain quality management framework, for example by making annual visits to suppliers that handle door open- ers and other core functional components.
Overhead Door Corporation works to ensure quality by employing quality managers that provide training and guidance to pre-shipment inspectors and by implementing other measures related to quality improvements. Meanwhile, Novoferm (Germany) shares the response history for quality-related problems at each company within the Group in working to improve the overall level of quality.
Novoferm (Shanghai) has established a quality management framework in which three dedicated quality inspectors check dimen- sions and perform an external checks on the attachment of clasps and paintwork.

“Safety Pledge Day” Initiative
The Group has designated March 26, the date of a fatal revolving door accident in 2004 at Roppongi Hills Mori Tower in Roppongi, Tokyo, as “Safety Pledge Day.” On this date, everyone involved with the Sanwa Group thinks about and renews their commitment to safety. To ensure the lessons of this tragic accident are not forgotten, as well as for use in safety education and training inside and outside of the company, the revolving door involved in this incident has been preserved in working condition.

NTimeline of Corporate Governance Reforms
The Company’s Second Three-Year Plan of Sanwa Global Vision 2020, our long-term management vision, was launched in 2016, the year the Company marked the 60th anniversary of its establishment. In that same year, we transitioned to a com- pany with an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure under the Companies Act with the aim of further strengthening cor- porate governance to build a corporate structure trusted by society and befitting of a major global enterprise. In the years to come, we will maintain a system to ensure the appropriateness of operations, while striving to enhance corporate governance and build highly transparent group management.

Corporate Governance Structure
The details of specific measures to enhance our business execution and supervisory functions are set out below. By adopting this sys- tem, we believe that we can establish a system to ensure the appropriateness of operations and enhance corporate governance.
Establishment of Management Conference in accordance with delegation of business to director (CEO)
In accordance with the transition to a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee structure in 2016, from the perspective of speeding up management decisions a director (CEO) was entrusted to make “significant decisions concerning business execution,” excluding matters prescribed by law. Consequently, set up as an advisory body to the delegated director (CEO), a Management Conference deliberates and reports on important management issues, assists the CEO in making decisions and strengthening the flexibility of business execution. Discussing (i) matters concerning important business execution decisions delegated by the Board of Directors to the CEO, (ii) matters deemed necessary by the director (CEO) from among the Board of Directors’ meeting agenda items, and (iii) other important, management-related matters deemed necessary by the director (CEO), the Management Conference works in conjunction with the Board of Directors in the making of quick and efficient management decisions.
Detailed supervision/audits of business execution by Group and Regional PDCA Councils
Group and Regional PDCA Councils consist of directors who are not Audit & Supervisory Committee members, directors serving as full-time Audit & Supervisory Committee members and senior management such as executive officers. At the councils, which convene on a quarterly basis, directors oversee the progress of management plans and provide guidance on management issues, while the directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee mem- bers audit the status of business execution by executive officers.
Group CSR Promotion Council
To enable the Group to carry out CSR activities, such as ESG, risk management, and compliance, in an integrated manner, a Group
CSR Promotion Council has been established, chaired by the exec- utive officer in charge of the Corporate Planning Unit at Sanwa Holdings. Convening four times a year, deliberating and reporting on the status of themes that include Group-wide CSR policies and ESG initiatives, Group-wide risk assessment and countermeasures as well as compliance measures, the Group CSR Promotion Council works to improve and avoid damage to corporate value. Further- more, each Group company has a CSR Promotion Committee in place that plans and promotes activities that are integrated with the workplace and works to promote CSR activities.
Status of Compliance with the
Corporate Governance Code
We are responding to the principles prescribed in the Corporate Governance Code of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. However, the following principle is not implemented for the following reason set out below.
Principles Not Implemented and Reasons
(Principle 4-10-1: Establishment of an Independent, Voluntary Advisory Committee)
Each of the Company’s directors is working to actively stimulate deliberations by the Board. Independent outside directors engage in lively discussions, stating their opinions based on their advanced insight, specialized knowledge and global expe- rience. The Board receives appropriate recommendations from our independent outside directors. The Audit & Supervisory Committee (comprising three members, two of whom are inde- pendent outside directors) verifies the candidates for director and director compensation and other matters discussed at meetings of the Board of Directors and, at times, expresses its opinion as part of a framework that aims to strengthen the independence, objectivity and accountability of the Board of Directors. To enhance objectivity and transparency going for- ward, we will conduct multi-faceted investigations into the option of establishing a voluntary advisory committee.

Establishment of Corporate Governance Guidelines (Established July 1, 2019)
Established to fulfill our responsibilities to all our shareholders, these guidelines clarify the Company’s basic approach to corpo- rate governance. We clarify what the Company specifically has to address to achieve sustainable growth and increases in cor- porate value over the medium to long term.
Please see the section “Corporate Governance Guidelines” posted on our website.

Group Governance
The Company strives to strengthen governance of the Group by transferring authority to each Group company as deemed appropriate, and verifying the implementation status of the PDCA cycle for measures designed to heighten the “two kinds of reliability” (reliable business performance and reliable man- agement) through the Regional PDCA Councils presided over by the director in charge of that region.
Each Group company autonomously manages itself as an independent enterprise and fulfills management responsibilities by complying with laws and internal regulations and rules. In addition, the director in charge of each region oversees the business decisions and the status of business execution of each company, providing guidance for improving the transparency of business management. This process ensures and promotes proper operations of the Group.

The Sanwa Group shall ensure that each Group company is fully aware of our mission, our values, our principles of business and our Compliance Code of Conduct to enable the appropriateness of operations in light of optimal benefit for the Group while respecting the autonomous and independent management and responsibilities of each entity. The Group shall promote whole- some and efficient corporate group activities through a Group- wide compliance system, quality assurance system and risk management system, etc.
Sanwa Group companies are managed autonomously as inde- pendent companies and fulfill their management responsibilities in compliance with laws and internal regulations and rules. To ensure and promote the appropriateness of operations, the direc- tor responsible for each Group company monitors the operational decisions and status of business execution at each company, pro- vides guidance, issues recommendations and reports to the Board of Directors to improve business management transparency. Regional PDCA Council meetings and other meetings are held to formulate management policy, management targets and yearly business plans based on pertinent two-way discussions with each group company.
An executive officer or employee of the Company or an executive officer or employee appointed by the Company takes on a posi- tion as director or Audit & Supervisory Board member at each group company to ensure the legality and effectiveness of man- agement.
The Sanwa Group requires Group companies to seek preliminary consultation or approval on certain matters concerning business execution, as well as to submit follow-up reports, in accordance with the Group Company Management Regulations and the standards of respective regulating authorities for companies in Europe, the United States and Asia.

Result of Evaluations of Board of Directors’
Effectiveness (Overview)
The Company has been conducting a questionnaire on the effec- tiveness of the Board of Directors at the conclusion of Board of Directors’ meetings since the end of fiscal 2017. In the same year, we obtained responses from all directors, and at the first Board meeting in fiscal 2018 they analyzed and evaluated effectiveness based on the response results. As a result, although there were issues raised, we evaluated that our Board of Directors is func- tioning effectively. In fiscal 2018, we worked on the “early advance distribution of Board meeting materials” for the purpose of enhancing discussion. Having received evaluations saying that we could improve, we decided to continue the evaluations and newly provide other information and improve the secretariat sys- tem. An overview of the results for fiscal 2018 appears below.
Evaluation Process
Evaluation Method: Compilation of questionnaire results, implementation of comparative aggregation with previous year The results of the questionnaire were reported at a Board of Directors’ meeting and, based on the response results, the eval- uation with regard to the Board’s effectiveness was confirmed. (Content that could be evaluated)
• As regards management of Board of Directors’ meeting proceed- ings, lively discussions are taking place
• Sufficient time is being given for discussion
Initiatives arising from fiscal 2017 results
• Improved with regard to early distribution of materials for Board
meetings
(Points to be improved)
• Sufficient provision of information other than Board of Directors’
meeting materials
• Improvement of secretariat system
(Other opinions expressed)
There were opinions given on the establishment of a voluntary com- mittee on nomination and compensation and increasing diversity on the Board of Directors.
Based on the above results, we will continue to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of a Board of Directors best suited to the Company.
Policy for Selection of Outside Directors
We appoint outside directors based on our overall judgment of a number of considerations using information such as candidates’ career histories and the relationship of their previous employers with the Company. Judgment criteria include whether there are any issues regarding their independence from the Company, and whether the candidates are qualified to perform the monitoring and supervision functions that the Company requires of outside directors based on their personality, insight and background.
Independence Criteria for Outside Directors
The Company stipulates independence criteria for outside offi- cers. For details, please see the Company’s website.
URL: http://www.sanwa-hldgs.co.jp/english/csr/effort/governance/ pdf/Independence_Criteria_for_Outside_Officers.pdf
The Company decided to retain Mr. Yasuda as a director because of his contribution to further strengthening the Board of Directors. Mr. Yasuda is able to provide keen insight based on his wealth of experience and many years as a global corporate manager and involvement in corporate management as an outside officer.
Mr. Yonezawa has been involved in corporate management for many years as a company manager, and has global experience and in depth understanding of management and economics. On that basis, the Company believes he can provide appropriate advice and recommendations from an independent standpoint regarding the Company’s management in general. He was thus deemed qualified as an outside director serving as an Audit & Supervisory Committee member
Mr. Gokita has many years of experience as a prosecutor and lawyer, and has applied his extensive experience and knowledge as a legal professional to the management of the Company. He has thus been selected as an outside director to serve as a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee.

Supplementary Explanation
Reasons for Selection
                 q
Until 2017, Mr. Yasuda received compensation as a member of the Company’s Independent Committee for Takeover Defense, but the amount of compensation did not exceed ¥1 million per year. The Company thus determined that he meets the independence criteria for outside directors and has no conflict of interest with ordinary shareholders. In addition, the Independent Committee for Takeover Defense was dissolved due to the abolition of anti-takeover measures, and the above compensation has not been paid to Mr. Yasuda since 2017.
                    q
q
Mr. Yonezawa is a former employee of Marubeni-Itochu Steel Inc. (MISI), which has a business relationship with the Group. The Group and the MISI Group have transactions involving the Sanwa Group’s purchase of raw materials and the sale of Sanwa Group products. However, the amount of transactions between the Sanwa Group and the MISI Group accounted for less than 1% of the Sanwa Group’s and the MISI Group’s annual consolidated net sales in each of the past three fiscal years. Therefore, the Company determined that Mr. Yonezawa satisfies the independence criteria for the Company’s outside directors and has no conflict of interest with ordinary shareholders.
                        q
q
The Company had a legal consultation agreement with Mr. Gokita until December 2015, but the contract has since been terminated. For the duration of the agreement, the monthly legal fees paid to Mr. Gokita were ¥100,000 (there was no payment for compensation outside of the advisory agreement). Therefore, the Company determined that Mr. Gokita meets the independence criteria for the Company’s outside directors and has no conflict of interest with ordinary shareholders.

Compensation of Directors
Matters related to the policy regarding the determination of the amounts of director compensation and their calculation meth- ods are as follows.
Policies for Determining the Compensation and
Amounts of Compensation of Directors and
Audit & Supervisory Committee Members
With regard to the compensation of directors (excluding direc- tors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members), a director delegated by the Board of Directors (Representative Director and Chairman [CEO] Toshitaka Takayama) determines the compensation for each director (stock options are deter- mined by the Board of Directors) based on the policies below, which are set by the Board of Directors. (Stock options, most recently implemented in June 2018, are determined by the Board of Directors.) The Company does not currently have a vol- untary compensation committee, but the Audit & Supervisory Committee has the authority to verify and form opinions, from policy decisions with regard to compensation to the amounts decided, thereby ensuring objectivity and transparency. The pol- icy for determining compensation for directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members will be determined based on the following policy, in consultation with directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members.
Policies for Determining Compensation of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Committee Members
L Basic Concept of Compensation for Directors Compensation of directors and Audit & Supervisory Committee members is intended to contribute to continual improvement of the Company’s business performance and corporate value. The Company designs its compensation system so that the level and structure of compensation are in accordance with the roles and responsibilities required of the Company’s directors and Audit & Supervisory Committee members, and enable the recruitment and retention of well-qualified people.
L Compensation of Directors
(1) Compensation of directors (excluding directors serving as Audit &
Supervisory Committee members)
The compensation of directors consists of base compensation, performance-linked variable compensation, and stock options.
NOverview of Compensation (Fiscal 2018)
Directors (excluding directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members and outside directors)
Directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members (excluding outside directors)
Outside directors (excluding Audit & Supervisory Committee members)
Outside directors (Audit & Supervisory Committee members)
The compensation of outside directors, however, consists only of base compensation. The total amounts of base compensation and performance-linked variable compensation shall be within the limits of the total compensation determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The total amount of stock options shall be within the limit for stock options, also determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
(2) Compensation of directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members
Comprises only base compensation, the total amount of which shall be within the limit for the amount of compensation deter- mined by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
(3) Base compensation
The basic compensation for each director (excluding directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members) is set for each position based on consolidated performance with reference to the compensation levels of other companies presented by a specialized outside organization. The compensation for each director serving as an Audit & Supervisory Committee member is determined by discussion among the Directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members, also with reference to the com- pensation levels of other companies presented by a specialized outside organization.
(4) Performance-linked compensation
For performance-linked compensation, a standard amount is set for each executive position based on the Company’s consolidated business results with reference to the compensation levels of other companies presented by a specialized outside organization. The standard amount of this type of compensation is determined by taking into account standard amount indicators and the levels of contribution of each executive director, evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively. As far as serving as a reward that functions as a sound incentive for sustainable growth that reflects the Company’s business performance is concerned, consolidated operating income has been selected as the primary indicator of performance-linked compensation, the amount of which is calculated on that indicator basis following the Company’s set standards.
(5) Stock options
Stock options are provided to further raise the incentive of direc- tors (excluding directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members and non-executive directors) to increase the Company’s corporate value by sharing not only the benefits from stock price increases but also the risk of stock price declines with shareholders. The number of stock options allotted to each direc- tor (excluding directors serving as Audit & Supervisory Committee members and non-executive directors) is decided by the Board of Directors, taking the director’s duties into consideration.

sustainable growth based on the consolidated performance of the Company as a whole.

Strategic Shareholdings
Strategic shareholdings are shares of business partners that the Company holds to build good business relationships with them and improve its corporate value from a medium- to long-term perspective through the smooth promotion of business. The rationality of strategic shareholdings is compared and verified by the Board of Directors for the holding benefits (dividends received + business transaction benefits) and capital cost against the acquisition price (current weighted average cost of capital [WACC] = 6%) for each share. As occasion demands, the Company considers selling stocks for which there is insuffi- cient rationale while regularly scrutinizing the benefits of all such shareholdings and determining whether they remain appropriate.
Investment stocks held for purposes other than net invest- ment totaled 46 shares, worth ¥12,396 million (as of the end of March 2019).
Internal Controls System
In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company passed a resolution on its “Basic Policy for Building an Internal Control System” at a Board of Directors’ meeting and is appropriately establishing an internal control system based on that basic policy. Passed by resolution at the Board of Directors’ meeting held on March 27, 2019, the basic policy has been par-

tially revised, as a strengthening measure for the prevention of misconduct. Also, every year, we check the execution status of the internal control system and report the results to the Board of Directors and, via business reports, to shareholders. We will continue to strengthen corporate governance by making improvements.
Functions as Corporate Pension Asset Owner
With regard to the pension management system, we estab- lished the Sanwa Shutter Corporate Pension Fund. In addition to a full-time managing director, management is undertaken by directors and representatives selected from each Group compa- ny. The management of the reserve fund is based on manage- ment guidelines established by the corporate pension fund, and important matters, such as decisions on asset allocation policy and recipients entrusted with assets, are resolved by a board of representatives using external consultants. The fund is managed and controlled in an appropriate manner to prevent conflicts of interest between pension beneficiaries and the Company. We carry out stewardship activities that can be implemented as cor- porate pension funds, such as the assigning of employees famil- iar with the practical side of the business to the full-time director, the Board of Trustees requiring that each investment institution entrusted with assets fulfills its stewardship responsi- bilities, and the receiving of reports on the results.
Individual Investor Briefings
For the purpose of deepening their understanding of the Company, we hold company briefings for individual investors. At these events we provide easily understood explanations of the business and future prospects.

In Institutional Investor magazine’s 2019 All-Japan Executive Team Rankings (best Japanese companies for IR ranking), Sanwa Holdings ranked third in the Most Honored Companies category in the construction sector, and ranked second in the Best IR Program Combined category.

Based on its risk management regulations, the Sanwa Group identi- fies, analyzes, and evaluates business execution-related risks as well as undertakes measures required to avoid and/or mitigate risks. As a organization dedicated to promoting risk management, the Group CSR Promotion Council reports and deliberates on the Sanwa Group’s basic risk management policies, risk management-related plans, and the progress of initiatives. In addition, the subordinate Quality, Environment and CSR Promotion Council and each Group company’s CSR Promotion Council manage risks by appropriately and rapidly responding to risks that occur during the course of each company’s business activities.

     Establishment of the Information Security Countermeasures Council
In June 2019, we established the Information Security Countermeasures Council chaired by the executive officer in charge of the Corporate Planning Unit in order to enhance and promote security countermeasures during emergencies. The Information Security Countermeasures Council identifies securi- ty risks Group-wide (including overseas operations); investi- gates, formulates and implements various measures to maintain and increase security levels; and aims to formulate security mea- sures based on the latest information received mainly from external organizations. In addition, we have established the
NSanwa Group Information Management System
24-hour telephone/email hotline Virus 110 as a concrete securi- ty measure, distributed security goods to raise awareness of information security, and plan to conduct e-learning-based training programs.
 Going forward, we will work to further enhance information security counter- measures through multilay- ered initiatives in both hard and soft areas.

Formulation of the Compliance Code of Conduct
In order to maintain the trust of society, the Sanwa Group for- mulated in October 2005 the Compliance Code of Conduct, which outlines specific conduct that must be adhered to and is based on the Group’s mission, Our Values, Principles of Business, and values.
In January 2006, we distributed to all Group employees the Compliance Code of Conduct booklet, which provides examples and explanations of actual incidents that occurred at individual departments. This booklet has been subsequently undergone revisions as needed in an effort to promote compliance.
Introduction of Internal Whistleblower System
at Companies in China and Asia
Starting in July 2019, we have introduced whistleblower sys- tems (corporate ethics hotlines) at six companies in China and other areas of Asia. We have developed a system that employ- ees can understand through the use of the naタtiイv語e languages (or equivalents) in each region, displaying posters and distributing cards to employees in English, Chinese (simplified, traditional), Vietnamese, and Thai. We
have also appropriately publi-
cized the system and have
worked to increase trust by
keeping reported information
strictly secret and prohibiting
the adverse treatment of sys-
tem users.

The Sanwa Group ensures compliance with laws, corporate ethics, internal regulations and rules as an important foundation to garner trust and meet the expectations of society.

Creating Values through ESG
Interview with an Outside Director
QWhat are the issues with regard to corporate governance, and what in your personal experience can you bring to the Board of Directors?
The role of the Board of Directors is moving to strengthen functions from conventional “management decision making” to “management oversight.” I would like the Board of Directors to fulfill a robust oversight function.
Firstly, allow me to state, in general terms, what is constantly in my thoughts.
From 2010 onward, the term “internal control” came into common use within the governance structures at
certain listed companies, and in corporate governance it has now come to be something that everyone talks about. However, originally this came about due to the pressure applied by the government (public administra- tion), and it appears that a lot of companies are satisfied that, for the time being anyway, they have cleared the Governance Code standards.
I previously served at a trading house, and the structure of the business was such that in addition to distribu- tion and logistics that focused on trade, both in Japan and overseas, I was also involved in the business opera- tions across a number of different industries, and performed at the top level of management. Sanwa Group is in the manufacturing industry, and every day I keenly feel a difference in corporate culture varying from company to company. The essence of each company’s strategy is the corporate culture, philosophy, and climate that each company has cultivated, and I believe that people outside a company that have not learned or experienced these can only make their decisions based on economic rationalization. As money circulates around the world, on the other hand, we have come to a point where we need to secure transparency at Japanese companies as well. Consequently, the execution of voting rights by outside directors is in response to a diverse range of stakeholder’s expectations, and as a desirable corporate function, we will ideally strike a good balance with those who are actually implementing management. In line with the evolution of governance, we think that the more execution and management separate, the more that the traditional role carried out by the Board of Directors will transition from a “management decision making function” to an “oversight function.” I think that having a firm hand in performing such an oversight function is one of the most critical roles of an outside director.
QHow do you see the mission of an outside director? As a member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, please tell us about the Company’s audit system.
The three outside auditors each have their own respective skills and experience, and based on that, we offer our frank opinions to those who execute management.
Among the outside director members, my role is to voice my thoughts at the Management Conference and Board of Directors’ meetings, primarily on risk management, based on my personal experience in corporate man- agement gained in overseas business, and as an Audit & Supervisory Committee director. Another member of that committee, Outside Director Gokita is an attorney-at-law who offers up sharp questions, mainly on legal matters, and also gives his straightforward opinions to CEO Takayama.
There’s also Outside Director Yasuda, who is not a member of the Audit & Supervisory Board Committee, who consults on matters of management at overseas corporations in a range of industries, and provides comprehen- sive opinions from a broad perspective. From that perspective there are now three outside directors of nine in total, and I think that this ratio strikes a good balance. It’s necessary to have half or more of the Audit & Supervisory Committee directors be outside directors, and currently two of the three members are outside direc- tors. The other member, Director Zaima, is in charge of accounting and finance matters, so in that sense, each of the three members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee have different yet complimentary skills, and I believe that it has an exceptional composition.

Outside Director (Audit & Supervisory Committee Member)
QWe are now in our first year of the Third Mid-Term Management Plan. Please outline your views on the plan.
Based on my experience, mid-term management plans are by their very nature formulated in line with a focus on qualitative factors, like strategy, and it’s my opinion that quantitative factors, such as numerical targets, are in the end just rough guides. Now we are working on the Third Mid-Term Management Plan, and in line with the com- pletion period of Sanwa Global Vision 2020, this is a two-year plan that to a certain extent unavoidably focuses on quantitative numerical targets. However, I hope that from the next mid-term management plan our emphasis will be on content such as a qualitative strategy which we will aggressively work to achieve.
QWhat do you think are the priority issues that we should be pursuing, especially now that we are experiencing steady business results?
Priority issues to tackle are these three initiatives–growth in overseas markets, the nurturing of our human talent, and strengthening governance.
I see the following three points as issues we are now facing. First, there is achieving further growth in overseas mar- kets. It’s well understood that the industry that we operate in, that is to say, the construction business, cannot expect to achieve significant growth in demand in Japan on account of the country’s declining population. Consequently, I believe that we should emphasize overseas markets in our growth strategy. As a way to go about doing that, certain- ly aggressively conducting M&A operations with outstanding projects would be an effective policy.
The second point is nurturing our human talent. Fostering growth in people who can pick up capabilities from a wide and varied range of venues requires that focus efforts based on a methodical support of employees’ career paths. I suppose one topic of discussion will be strengthening our human resource planning functions in HD.
The third point is to strengthen governance. As a global corporation it is necessary that we conduct institution- al reform with the separation of the execution of duties and management, and work to accelerate decision mak- ing. Perhaps this will come in the next stage. Stakeholders, particularly investors, apply a bit more pressure every year, and investors are becoming ever-more severe in the way the speak about a responsibility to supervise man- agement. From that perspective, with things such as ROE and ROA, it will also be important to improve indicators of management efficiency.
As a stakeholder advocate, I intend to sincerely say what is needed for the Sanwa Group.

Financial Section and Corporate Data
Financial Review (As of March 31, 2019) Business Overview
The final fiscal year is approaching for the Second Three-Year Plan—“three years to strengthen our com- petitiveness as a major global player”—of Sanwa Global Vision 2020, our long-term management vision. Accordingly, in Japan we are continuing to focus on enhancing existing businesses, strengthening and expanding businesses through tie-ups, and responding the new periodic inspection reporting system for fire prevention equipment along with operating Osaka plant (partition business) and enhancing diversified product supply capacity. In North America, we are working to enhance our foundation and increase market share by strengthening support for core door business distributors and sales offices, releasing new prod- ucts, and pursuing product-specific channel strategies. In Europe, we acquired Bolton Gate Services in January 2018 to strengthen services operations in the U.K. while working to further expand the industrial sectional door business by focusing on enhancing Alpha Deuren International’s factories, generating syner- gies with Norsud, and expanding sales of production capacity for dock levelers, a strategic product.

Consolidated earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were as follows: sales increased 6.3% year on year to ¥409,990 million, operating income rose 11.5% to ¥31,593 million, ordi- nary income increased 9.1% to ¥30,437 million, and profit attributable to owners of the parent company grew 14.4% to ¥20,910 million.
Operating income/operating income ratio
Operating income rose 11.5% year on year to ¥31,593 million. Operating income ratio increased 0.4 points to 7.7%
Profit attributable to owners of the parent company
Profit attributable to owners of the parent company grew 14.4% year on year to ¥20,910 million.
Segment Overview for the Fiscal Year under Review
Japan
Net sales increased 5.5% year on year to ¥219,559 million owing to higher revenues for heavy-duty shutters and other core products as well as the maintenance and service business. Segment profit rose 7.0% year on year to ¥22,258 million due to rises in volumes and successful reflection of higher steel pric- es in sales prices.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2019
+¥3.27 billion

North America
Net sales reached ¥116,574 million, up 3.4% year on year (up 4.9% on a local currency basis), due to strong sales in the main- stay door and door opener businesses. Segment profit increased 2.3% year on year to ¥8,409 million as a result of the successful reflection of higher steel prices in sales prices and improved pro- ductivity at the door opener business.
Europe
Net sales increased 13.2% year on year (up 10.8% on a local currency basis) to ¥73,394 million, a major gain due to steady progress in existing businesses and the consolidation of BGS. Segment profit rose 36.1% year on year to ¥3,658 million owing to the successful reflection of higher steel prices in sales prices and large contributions particularly from volume growth.
* Segment sales/profits are before elimination of inter-segment transactions.
Capital Expenditures
In principle, we make capital investments necessary for main- taining and continuing existing businesses within the range of depreciation and amortization. The Sanwa Group focuses on product categories that are expected to see growth over the long term, and also invests in systems to reduce manpower, streamline operations and improve product reliability. Capital expenditures (including intangible assets) totaled ¥12,367 mil- lion (including strategic capital expenditures) in fiscal 2018. By segment, expenditure was ¥2,571 million in Japan, ¥3,978 mil- lion in North America, ¥5,803 million in Europe, and ¥14 million in other regions. Primary investments in each region went toward renewing equipment at each plant, acquiring produc- tion equipment, molds and other items, and improving IT-related infrastructure.
R&D Expenditures
R&D activities in fiscal 2018 involved work to develop new products and improve existing products while enhancing their product lineup for each application market, promoting shifts to platforms, consolidating products, materials and parts, improv- ing quality, safety and workability, and implementing cost-cut- ting measures. R&D expenditures totaled ¥4,611 million.
Financial Position
Total assets as of March 31, 2019 were ¥338,432 million, up ¥6,745 million from the end of the previous fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to the acquisition of fixed assets and rises in accounts receivable and inventories. Total liabilities decreased ¥3,736 million to ¥176,828 million mainly due to the repayment of loans and redemption of bonds. Net assets increased ¥10,481 million to ¥161,603 million mainly due to an increase in retained earnings.
As a result, the shareholders’ equity ratio increased 2.2 points from the end of the previous fiscal year to 47.4 %, indicating that financial position remains healthy.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents (“cash”) decreased ¥1,285 million from the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥47,977 million. Cash flows by category for the fiscal year under review are sum- marized as follows.
Net cash provided by operating activities totaled ¥24,271 mil- lion due to an increase in net profit before income taxes (compared with ¥26,532 million in the previous fiscal year).

Financial Section and Corporate Data
Financial Review
Net cash used in investment activities totaled ¥13,677 million (compared with ¥13,172 million in the previous fiscal year) mainly due to the acquisition of fixed assets.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled ¥11,349 million (compared with ¥20,505 million in the previous fiscal year) mainly due to the repayment of borrowings and payment of dividends.
Shareholder Returns
In order to further promote management aimed at increasing corporate value while also improving the corporate culture and strengthening the management foundation, the Sanwa Group’s basic policy is to maintain a stable dividend payout ratio and dis- tribute profits based on consolidated performance. Our guide- line for profit distribution specifies a target payout ratio of 35% of profit attributable to owners of the parent company.
Our basic policy is to distribute surplus funds twice per year in the form of interim and year-end dividends. For fiscal 2018, we paid a year-end dividend of ¥16 per share (¥32 per share includ- ing interim dividend). The Company will utilize internal reserves for M&A and other strategic investments, capital expenditures, and reduction of interest-bearing debt.

Outlook
We expect Japanese economic conditions to remain weak due to a tapering off of domestic demand growth driven by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics as well as the consump- tion tax hike. Despite a slightly slower growth in housing starts, we expect the U.S. economy to remain steady mainly owing to an autonomous, private sector-driven economic recovery and boosts from tax system reforms. The European economy will likely continue to slow due to weaker economic growth in each European country and housing market sluggishness.
Against this backdrop, the Sanwa Group expects new record- high sales and profits by implementing the following measures during the second year of establishing a foundation for leading brands as a major global player ahead of the initial year of the third mid-term management plan, Sanwa Global Vision 2020. As a fundamental core business strategy, in Japan we will strengthen systems to expand our businesses as a comprehen- sive construction materials company with an established posi- tion in each business field. In North America, we will focus on increasing market share in core businesses and rebuilding downstream integrated business strategies. In Europe, we will continue to pursue industrial door business expansion and garage door market share growth. In addition, we will work to strengthen services fields and expand our business models in Japan, the United States and Europe while enhancing our busi- ness foundation in China and the rest of Asia.

SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION
INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 71

Financial Section and Corporate Data
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Sanwa Holdings Corporation and Subsidiaries For the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018
1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements
Sanwa Holdings Corporation (the “Company”) and its domestic sub- sidiaries maintain their accounts and records in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Corporate Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan, which are dif- ferent from the accounting and disclosure requirements of International Accounting Standards.
The accounts and records of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards or US GAAP for the Company’s consolidation process, except for certain items which are required to be adjusted in the consolidation process.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Scope of Consolidation
At March 31, 2019, the Company had 92 subsidiaries and 14 affili- ates.
The scope of consolidation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (FY2018) includes Sanwa Holdings Corporation and its 51 con- solidated subsidiaries. Equity method accounting is applied to invest- ments in 7 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 2 affiliates at March 31, 2019 (FY2018).
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Bolton Gate Services Ltd. and two other companies were included in the scope of consolida- tion because the Company acquired additional shares of their stock, and Bemo Brandschutzsysteme GmbH was excluded in the scope of consolidation because it was filed for liquidation.
(b) Foreign Currency Translation
All asset and liability accounts of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the respective fiscal year-end and revenue and expense accounts are translated into Japanese yen at average exchange rates during the fiscal year.
Shareholders’ equity accounts of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation differences are debited or credited to the foreign currency translation adjust- ment account in shareholders’ equity or to the Non-controlling inter- ests in consolidated subsidiaries in the consolidated balance sheets.
(c) Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
(d) Short-term Investments and Investments in Securities
The Group adopted the Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments issued by the Business Accounting Deliberation Council. In accordance with these standards, securities are classified into four categories: trading securities, held-to-maturity debt securities, equity investments in associates, and other securities. Based on this classifi-
Amounts less than one million yen and one thousand U.S. dollars are rounded down. Therefore, total or subtotal amounts may not correspond with the aggregation of such account balances.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which were filed with the Director of Kanto Local Finance Bureau as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.
The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of the reader, using the approxi- mate exchange rate at March 31, 2019, which was ¥110 to US$1.00.
cation, securities with a maturity of less than one year are included in “Short-term investments” as current assets.
Securities held by the Group are all classified as other securities. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable tax, report- ed in a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost determined by the moving average method. Realized gain and loss and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on other securities are charged to income.
(e) Inventories
Inventories of the domestic consolidated companies are valued at cost, determined by the gross average method (Carrying amount in the balance sheet is calculated with consideration of write-downs due to decreased profitability). The costs of inventories held by for- eign consolidated subsidiaries are stated at the lower of cost or mar- ket value by the first-in, first-out method or the moving average method.
(f) Property, Plant and Equipment (Excluding Lease Assets)
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is com- puted by the declining-balance method over the estimated useful lives of assets, except that the straight-line method is applied to buildings (other than fixtures attached to the buildings) acquired subsequent to April 1, 1998 and fixtures attached to the buildings and structures acquired subsequent to April 1, 2016. The consolidat- ed subsidiaries outside of Japan adopt the straight-line method for depreciation.
Costs of maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to income in the year incurred, although major renewals and improve- ments are capitalized.
(g) Amortization of Goodwill
Amortization of goodwill is determined on a case by case basis and is generally amortized over a period not exceeding 20 years.
72 SANWA HOLDINGS CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT 2019

(h) Leased Assets
Leased assets related to finance lease transactions that do not trans- fer ownership rights are amortized under the straight-line method based on the lease term as the useful life with residual value of zero.
(i) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits
The Group recognizes pension and severance costs for employees based on the estimates of the pension obligations and the plan assets at the balance sheet date. The benefit formula basis is applied as the method for attributing the expected retirement benefit to periods of service for the calculation of the retirement benefit obliga- tion.
Actuarial differences are amortized principally over a 10-year peri- od, which is within the average remaining service period of employ- ees, using the straight-line method from the fiscal year when the difference was generated. Prior service cost of the domestic consoli- dated companies is amortized when the prior services cost is gener- ated.
Prior service cost of certain foreign subsidiaries is amortized over a 10-year period.
Certain consolidated subsidiaries have calculated their retirement benefit obligation and retirement benefit expenses based on the amount which would be payable at the year-end if all eligible employees terminated their services voluntarily (the “Simplified Method”).
(j) Revenue Recognition
The Group recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped, which is when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The Group recognizes revenue related to installation of products at the time installation is complete.
However, revenues and costs of construction contracts, of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated, are recog- nized by the percentage-of-completion method. To estimate the progress of such construction projects, the Group measures the per- centage of completion by comparing costs incurred to date with the most recent estimate of total costs required to complete the project (cost to cost basis). If a reliable estimate cannot be made, revenues and costs of construction contract are recognized by the complet- ed-contract method.
(k) Research and Development Expense and Software
Research and development expenditure is charged to income when incurred.
Expenditure relating to software developed for internal use is charged to income when incurred, except if it contributes to the generation of income or to the future cost savings. Such expendi- tures capitalized as assets are amortized using the straight-line meth- od over their estimated useful lives of five years.
(l) Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statements of operations. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
(m) Net Income per Share
The computation of basic net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. The average number of shares used in the computation was 224,979 thousand and 225,761 thousand for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cash dividends per share shown in the consolidated statements of operations are the amounts applicable to the respective years.
(n) Derivative and Hedging Activities
The Group utilizes derivative transactions related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in order to reduce their risk expo- sure arising from fluctuations in these rates and prices, to reduce the cost of the funds financed and to improve their return on invested funds.
Derivative transactions currently utilized by the Group include interest rate swap contracts and currency swap contracts.
Net assets or liabilities arising from derivative transactions are measured at fair value, with unrealized gain or loss included in earn- ings. Hedging transactions, which meet the criteria of hedge accounting, are accounted for using deferral hedge accounting that requires the unrealized gain or loss to be deferred as a liability or asset until gain or loss relating to the hedge object is recognized.
In addition, certain forward exchange contracts and certain inter- est rate swap transactions are accounted for using the allocation method and the special method, respectively, which are regulated in the standard. The allocation method requires recognized foreign cur- rency receivables or payables covered by forward exchange contracts to be translated at such contract rates. Under the special method, interest rate swap transactions are accounted for as if the interest rates under those transactions were originally applied to underlying borrowing.
The Group has established a control environment, which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and for the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative transactions. The Group does not engage in derivative transactions for trading purposes. The Group is exposed to certain market risks arising from derivative transactions. The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of non- performance by the counterparties to those trans- actions. However, the Group does not anticipate non-performance by any of these counterparties, all of whom are financial institutions with high credit ratings.
The Group evaluates hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumu- lative changes in cash flows or the changes in fair value of the hedged items with the corresponding changes in the hedging deriv- ative instruments.

Financial Section and Corporate Data
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
The assessment of hedging effectiveness regarding forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap transactions, which are accounted for under the above allocation method and special meth- od, is omitted.
(o) Other Significant Matters for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
Adoption of Consolidated Tax Return Filing System
(p) Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of the financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 have been made to conform to the presenta- tion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
(q) Changes in Accounting Policies
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have applied IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Cumulative effects of applying IFRS 15 have been added to or deducted from the opening retained earnings at March 31, 2018 in accordance with the transitional treatment prescribed in IFRS 15.
As a result of this change, the opening retained earnings at April 1, 2018 increased by ¥401 million. The effects of applying the accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were immaterial.
3. Cash and Deposits
(r) Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective
• Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued on March 30, 2018)
• Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued on March 30, 2018)
(1) Overview
This is a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recogni- tion. Revenue is recognized by applying the following five steps.
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obliga-
tions in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a per-
formance obligation
(2) Planned Date of Application
To be applied from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022
(3) Effect of the Application of the Accounting Standard
The amount of the effect was under review when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
The balances of cash and deposits reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2019 and 2018 were reconciled to the balances of cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 as follows:

8. Retirement and Severance Benefits
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans to provide for the retirement of employees. The defined benefit pension plans are paid either in a lump sum or as a pension based on the employee’s salary and years of service. In the lump-sum payment plans, a lump sum is paid as a retirement benefit based on salary and years of service.
1. Defined Benefit Pension Plan
(1) Changes in Retirement Benefit Obligations (excludes application of simplified accounting method)
For the defined benefit pension plans and lump-sum payment plans of certain consolidated subsidiaries, the simplified accounting method is used to calculate net defined benefit liability and retire- ment benefit expense.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
11. Financial Instruments
1. Status of financial instruments
(1) Policy for financial instruments
In light of plans for financing, the Group raises the funds it requires through bank loans and bonds issuance.
The Group manages temporary fund surpluses through financial assets that have high levels of safety. The Group reduces customer credit risk by applying internal policies for managing credit risk. Long-term debt and bonds are taken out principally for the purpose of capital expenditure and acquisitions.
The Group undertakes interest rate swap transactions as a hedg- ing instrument for certain long-term debt to reduce such risk and fix interest expense for debt bearing interest at variable rates.
The Group limits the use of derivatives to the volume of long-term debt and bonds and actual requirements based on established inter- nal control rules, and does not engage in speculative transactions.
(2) Types of financial instruments and related risk
Trade receivables - notes receivables and accounts receivable - elec- tronically recorded monetary claims - are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers.
The Group holds securities and investments in securities, which are mainly issued by companies who have business relationships with the Group, and these securities are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in market prices. Trade payables - notes payable and accounts pay- able - mostly have payment due dates within one year.
Bank loans and bonds are taken out principally for the purpose of working capital, capital expenditure and acquisitions, which are exposed to liquidity risk and interest-rate risk.
Currency swap and the interest swap transactions are almost always used as a hedge as a type of derivative transaction.
(3) Risk management for financial instruments
(a) Monitoring of credit risk (the risk that customers or counterpar- ties may default)
In accordance with the internal policies for managing credit risk of the Group, the Group monitors credit worthiness of its main custom- ers periodically, and monitors due dates and outstanding balances by customer.
To minimize credit risk when entering into derivative transactions, counterparties are limited to financial institutions with high ratings. (b) Monitoring of market risks
Derivatives mainly include Currency swaps and interest rate swaps, which are used to manage exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of receivables and payables, and from changes in interest rates of bank loans.
Investments in securities, primarily the equity securities of corpora- tions with which the Group does business, are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in market price. The Group manages this risk by periodi- cally examining market prices and the financial condition of the issu- ing entities.
The Group executes and manages derivative transactions within the limits of established internal rules and regulations, and reduces credit risk by limiting counterparties to highly creditworthy financial institutions.
(c) Monitoring of liquidity risk for financing (the risk that the
Companies may not be able to meet obligations on the scheduled
due dates)
The Group manages the liquidity risk mainly through the cash-flow plans, which are prepared by the financial department.
In order to achieve more efficient and flexible financing, the Group contracts line-of-credit agreements with certain financial institutions.
(4) Supplementary explanation of items relating to the market value of financial instruments
The Group calculates the fair value of financial instruments based on market prices, or by using reasonable estimates when market prices are not available. These estimates include variable factors, and are subject to fluctuation due to change in the underlying assumptions. The contract amounts of derivatives are not an indicator of the mar- ket risk associated with derivative transactions.

Financial Section and Corporate Data
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Assets
(1) Cash and deposits and (2) Notes and accounts receivable, trade and (3) Electronically recorded monetary claims
Since these items are settled in a short period, their carrying value approximates fair value.
(4) Securities and investments in securities
The fair value of equity securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of debt securities is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institutions making markets in these securities.
For information on securities classified by holding purpose, please refer to Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Liabilities
(1) Notes and accounts payable, trade and (2) Short-term debt Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value.
(3) Long-term debt
(Long-term debt)
The fair value of long-term debt payable is calculated by applying a discount rate to the total of principal and interest. That discount rate
is based on the assumed interest rate if a similar new loan was entered into.
Because long-term debt payable with variable interest rates are based on the condition that interest rates are revised periodically, their fair values are almost the same as their book values, the rele- vant book values are used.
A specially treated interest rate swap is accounted for as an inte- gral part of long-term debt payable, or the subject of hedging, so that the fair value of the swap is stated by being included in the fair value of long-term debt payable.
(Bonds)
The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on market prices when market prices are readily available. The fair value of bonds without market prices is measured as the present value, calcu- lated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest at a rate determined by taking into account the remaining maturity of each bond and the current credit risk.
Derivative transactions
For information on derivative transactions, please refer to Note 12. “Derivative transactions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation method for estimating fair value was the Black-Scholes model. The major assumptions used for the 2018 stock option plan are as follows:
 Major assumptions Estimated Volatility a Estimated remaining period b Estimated dividend c Risk-free rate d
2018 plan
32.1%
10 years
¥30 per share 0.03%
                   (a) Estimated volatility was computed by the closing stock prices of common stock in each trading day from July 7, 2008 to July 9, 2018.
(b) The remaining period was reasonably estimated.
(c) The estimated dividend was calculated based on the dividend amount applicable to the year ended March 31, 2018.
(d) The risk-free rate was determined based on the rate of Japanese government bonds, for which redemption dates corresponded to the estimat-
ed remaining period.
15. Research and Development Expenses

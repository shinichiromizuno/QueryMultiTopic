Special steels are produced by adding chromium, nickel, and other elements to steel to give it special properties such as hardness, strength, toughness, or resistance to wear, heat, and corrosion, depending on the use. As they are employed in critical parts and key components of industrial products in a wide range of sectors—from automobile to railway, construction machinery, electronic products and ICT equipment—high quality and reliability are required. Demands for special steels are growing increasingly diverse and sophisticated as their end products become more advanced in functions and more environmentally friendly. The Group has been providing high quality special steel products that adequately meet such needs, using the“advanced clean steel technology”it has developed over the years.
The major end users of the Group’s products are in automotive, industrial machinery, and construction machinery industries. Some of the Group’s products are delivered directly to car makers, while others are first sold to manufacturers of bearings, parts and other firms along the supply chain to be processed into various parts and components, and eventually reach the car assemblers. In recent years, international competition in the special steel industry has been growing ever tougher as our rivals ramp up their production capacity and upgrade quality and technologies.
Against this background, the Group has been pursuing sustained growth, despite adverse circumstances, through efforts such as (i) establishing a robust corporate structure by strengthening our business foundations, (ii) aiming for further technological advancements by strengthening R&D and quality competitiveness, and (iii) promoting
“Sanyo Special Steel—the Confident Choice”as a global brand. We have invested in the reform of production structure centering on the clearing of bottleneck in our No.2 Bar & Wire Rod mill in order to respond to the shift towards products in smaller diameter and orders in small lots, and to improve productivity and quality. We have also raised the ratio of independent outside directors to the total number of directors on board to one-third in order to enhance the independence, objectivity and accountability of our Board of Directors. In addition, we have set up a Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee comprising the Representative Director (Chair)
and independent outside directors. We are constantly introducing new products and technologies that are in keeping with the trends—such as the shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and other new technologies as well as changes in demand—applying advanced clean steel technology, in which we have the edge, and the fruits of basic research. Add to this, we are promoting“Sanyo Special Steel—the Confident Choice”as a global brand in our overseas operations, including through acquisition of Ovako in Sweden and Mahindra Sanyo Special Steel Pvt. Ltd. in India as our consolidated subsidiaries.
The Group currently faces an extremely challenging business environment in which we cannot expect an early recovery of the global economy that is mired in a severe situation due to the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, the changing ways of life, growing disparity between advanced and developing countries, and other factors are likely to cause drastic transformation in industrial structures across the world.
With these situations in mind, the Group believes that it must build a robust corporate structure that turns out profits without failure in any business environment. The entire Group will continue working to rigorously cut fixed costs, improve the product mix, and reduce variable costs, so as to secure the margins and boost its earning power. We will further enhance our overseas business to build a strong global network that is prepared to cope with the prospective trend of users to increase purchase of locally manufactured products. We are committed to enhancing our products’appeal and our development capability —with focus on advanced clean steel technology, our strength area—expanding our technological advancements to meet the needs of each buyer in each region on a global scale in the post-COVID-19 era, and also reaping the benefits of synergy among Sanyo Special Steel, Ovako and Nippon Steel at an early stage.
Furthermore, there has been a rapid spread in the idea of focusing on SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) and ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance) set out by the United Nations, with companies being required to contribute to a sustainable society.
We regard climate change as a
issue that has immediate consequences to the survival of mankind. The Group has already been engaged in efforts towards reducing CO2 emissions by switching fuel types, and employing energy-saving measures, among others. In October 2020, we joined the“Challenge Zero”initiative led by the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) and published our initiatives toward realizing a decarbonized society. We will keep on driving innovation that contributes to reducing GHG emissions from our business activities and making decarbonized society a reality.
There is, however, one more thing that the Group must keep in mind if it is to continue growing. It is that all of our employees stay mentally and physically healthy. Safety and health are the essential prerequisite that deserve the highest priority of the Group as a manufacturer in conducting its business activities. All of the Group companies both in Japan and abroad will continue working together to create a working environment that allows each and every employee to carry out their day to day work with a sense of satisfaction while staying safe and in good health.
We believe that building up confidence among all our stakeholders is a value that the Group should protect moving forward; it is something that we aim to achieve by promoting sincere, fair, and transparent corporate management through our philosophy of“Confidence-based Management,”which aims to establish the“Confidence of Society,”“Confidence of Customers,”and“Confidence among People.”
The Group will continue practicing“Confidence-based Management”as we aim not only to achieve sustainable growth in our own operations in a rapidly changing business environment but also to continue to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. It is my hope that this report will provide an insight into the activities of the Group, and we look forward to your continued support and assistance.

    Financial Highlights
- Profit Distribution Policy and Dividends for FY2019
Our basic policy on profit distribution is to reward our shareholders by increasing the profits available for distribution while strengthening our business foundation. Concerning dividend payment, we intend to meet our shareholders’ expectations, primarily by distributing profits based on periodic business performance, while giving due consideration to both the payout ratio and the amount of funds required for investment and other activities to enhance our corporate value. Dividends from surplus are based on a consolidated payout ratio of 25-30% and are paid at the end of the 2nd quarter
Consolidated Results
Business performance
and the end of fiscal year according to our profit distribution standard based on our consolidated business performance.
In FY2019, dividends of 15.5 yen per share, or 855 million yen in total, were paid. With a view to enhancing shareholder returns and improving capital efficiency, we acquired 1,730 thousand shares of treasury stock for 255 million yen and recorded a retirement of a total of 2,930 thousand shares of treasury stock, including the 1,200 thousand shares already held. Owing to the recording of 3,717 million yen loss attributable to owner of parent, it is with deep regret that we suspended the payment of year-end dividends.
   - Operating results
During the fiscal year under review (April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020), the Japanese economy recovered at a moderate pace on the back of improvements in personal consumption and employment situation. Nevertheless, the future remains unclear in light of the spread of COVID-19 since January, on top of the impact of US-China trade conflict on the global economy and the economic slowdown in China and other emerging countries.
In the special steel industry, the destocking by customers in machine tools, robots and semiconductor manufacturing equipment sectors that had begun in the latter half of 2018 grew into an industry-wide trend covering the key demand industries including automotive, industrial machinery and constructionmachinerysectorsinthesummerof2019.This led to a decline in orders in the second half of the fiscal year, causing in the production volume of special hot-rolled steels to remain below the 2018 levels.
The Group sales for the fiscal year increased by 76,634 million yen year-on-year to 262,453 million yen, despite a decline in sales volume on a non-consolidated basis. This was partially driven by the consolidation of sales of Ovako, our consolidated subsidiary in Sweden, in FY2019, among others. In terms of profits, the operating income fell 11,540 million yen from FY2018 to a loss of 1,417 million yen, owing to factors such as the decline in Sanyo Special Steel’s non-consolidated operating income due to a drop in sales volume and rise in the price of supplementary materials, a fall in the operating income of consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the write-off of goodwill
small lots, and to improve productivity and quality.
Total liabilities stood at 145,760 million yen, down 28,285 million yen year-on-year, owing to a decrease in trade notes and accounts payable and also loans and commercial papers. Trade notes and accounts payable decreased due partially to a decline in sales and subsequent drop in production, as well as a fall in the price of raw materials and fuels. Loans and commercial papers decreased as a result of allocating the cash flow gained from operating activities, such as the decrease in tradenotesandaccountsreceivableandinventories,tothe repayment of loans payable and redemption of commercial
papers.
Total net assets were 182,203 million yen, falling by
17,997 million yen year-on-year. This was mainly due to the
recording of loss attributable to owners of parent, purchase
and retirement of treasury stock, as well as the decline in
accumulated other comprehensive income owing to fluctuations
As a result, net D/E ratio (ratio of interest-bearing debt <after deducting cash and deposits> to total net assets) as of the end of FY2019 was 0.27 (0.34 as at end FY2018).
- Cash Flows
Regarding the Group’s cash flows in FY2019, our operating activities generated 39,425 million yen, while investing activities used up 12,463 million yen and financing activities used up 21,093 million yen.
As a result, the balance of cash and cash equivalents as at the end of FY2019 stood at 27,220 million yen (down by 5,427

Participating in the“Challenge Zero”Initiative for the realization of a Decarbonized Society
In October 2020, we became a participating member of the“Challenge Zero”initiative led by the Japan Business Federation (hereinafter, Keidanren).
“Challenge Zero”is an initiative jointly led by Keidanren and the Government of Japan that aims to proactively publicize and support innovative actions taken by companies and organizations towards a "decarbonized society" which the Paris Agreement (the international framework on climate change) sets as a long-term goal.
In line with the thrust of“Challenge Zero”to solve social issues through business-led innovations, we are working to generate innovation that aim to contribute to reducing GHG emissions and realizing decarbonized society.
 increaser part, and the generator part. Since the bearings of each part have different rotation speeds, loads, lubrication conditions, and so on, each part has a unique usage environment. In addition, because the bearings are used in ever-changing weather conditions, they are in a rolling fatigue environment where the conditions are constantly unstable. The fatigue mechanism of bearings used in these environments has not been clarified yet due to the complex influencing factors. We aim to figure out the mechanism by combining the most-advanced rolling fatigue test method and simulation technology. Furthermore, we plan to model the cracking behavior (generation —> transmission —> fracture) and based on the findings, to develop a long-life bearing steel for which life can be quantitatively predicted, and to aim for commercialization.
(4) Effect of the realization of this challenge
We will work on development and commercialization of bearing steel for wind power generation that can obtain stable long-life property by realizing this challenge, and contribute to the expansion by improving the reliability of wind power generation equipment.

Innovation Challenge 2
Reduction of CO2 emissions in various industrial furnace operations by developing high-strength heat-resistant steel tubes for heat exchangers
  Outline
Industrial furnaces for heating and heat-treatment used in the steel and ceramics industries utilize so-called fossil fuels such as LNG, heavy oil or coke, and are one of the major CO2 emission sources. In order to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, the furnaces are equipped with waste heat recovery devices to improve their energy efficiency. While the heat conversion type recuperator (Fig. 1) is widely used as a waste heat recovery device for industrial furnaces, it is required to improve the heat recovery efficiency of the device, which leads to further reduction. We will contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society by developing high-strength heat-resistant steel tubes for heat exchangers that can improve energy efficiency and expanding their application to industrial furnaces.
 Description
(1) Specific challenges
Most of the recuperators are installed in the flue. As shown in Fig. 1, the combustion air is heated (preheated) by the heat of the exhaust gas through the heat transfer tubes, which improves the energy efficiency of the furnace. Since the heat transfer tube is exposed to both high temperature and corrosive combustion gas, and combustion ash, the tube material is particularly required to have high temperature strength (creep strength) and high temperature corrosion resistance.
The exhaust gas is generally cooled down before recuperators by gas dilution to the durable temperature level of the heat-transfer tubes in order to prevent the tubes from thermal damage (creep deformation). In other words, heat loss occurs due to restrictions on material properties, and there has been a room for efficiency improvement here.

   Innovation Challenge 1
Contribution to zero CO2 emissions by developing bearing steel for long-life wind power generation
Outline
Recently, the demand for zero CO2 emissions against the power generation business is rapidly increasing all over the world. Wind power generation shown in Fig. 1 has begun to be recognized as one of the effective measures, and is spreading mainly in Europe.
One of the major issues for expanding wind power generation equipment is to make it highly reliable equipment that can continuously and stably generate power. This is synonymous with reducing equipment maintenance frequencies, and in order to achieve this, it is required to suppress troubles during operation. That is, bearings, which are the core components of wind power generation equipment, are required to have high reliability.
Therefore, based on the high-cleanliness technology for steel that we have cultivated so far, we aim to develop bearing steel for wind power generation that can obtain stable long-life property. Furthermore, we will contribute to zero CO2 emissions by its implementation and spread.
Description
(1) Details of challenges in the expansion of wind power generation equipment
There are two major issues for its expansion. One is the reduction of initial equipment costs. Since it is required to generate stable power with high efficiency, the equipment is often installed in mountainous areas with good wind conditions or at sea, which ends up with a large initial cost. As for Japan, the lack of land suitable for wind power generation has forced us to choose the sea, which costs more to install than the ground, and for this reason it has not been as widespread as in other
  countries. Currently, technological development of offshore power generation for cost reduction is being carried out at a rapid pace in various fields.
Another issue is the reduction of the frequency of equipment maintenance. In order to improve power generation efficiency or to increase the diameter of the wind turbine to generate higher power, the generator power rotating part (main shaft in the hub, speed increaser and generator) of the core part is installed in a high place with low maintainability. Operation costs would become higher if a trouble unexpectedly occurs in this vital part. Therefore, we are required to secure stable and long-life quality for bearing steel used in the power rotating part in the
(2) Challenge goal
With the background shown above, developing a heat transfer tube steel that can be used in a temperature environment higher than the current level can be an effective measure for improving energy efficiency in industrial furnaces. Therefore, we will work on development and commercialization of a heat-resistant steel tube that has equivalent high-temperature corrosion resistance to existing steel but has significantly improved creep strength, as shown in Fig. 2, and we aim to make this developed steel usable in an exhaust gas environment that is about 100 degree Celsius higher than the current level.
   heart of the wind power generator.
(2) Challenge goals
In order to overcome the above-mentioned issues, we have set the following two points as contributions from the material supply side.
1) We will visualize the bearing fatigue (rolling fatigue) mechanism in an environment unique to wind power generation equipment, which has not been clarified at present.
2) Based on the obtained mechanism, we will develop a long-life bearing steel that can quantitatively predict the life and then supply it to the market.
(3) Specific challenge toward the goals
As shown in Fig. 2, the power rotating part, which is generally the key to power generation, is composed of three parts: the spindle part, the speed
Main shaft
Ultra large spherical roller bearing, etc.
Yaw gearbox
Tapered Roller Bearings, etc.
Nacelle
Gearbox
Cylindrical Roller Bearings, etc.
Generator
Insulation bearing (megaohm), etc.
Fig. 1, A wind power generation facility
(3) Specific challenge toward the goal
To achieve the goal, we will adopt the unique structure control (precipitation control of intermetallic compounds) that we have found. In addition, this development requires precise structure control throughout the process from the steel tube manufacture to the customer's use in the furnace, and the structure prediction by simulation is adopted along with the confirmation by the experiment, which is the conventional development method.
(4) Effect of the realization of this challenge
It has been estimated that the industrial furnace equipped with the developed steel tube would have a CO2 reduction effect of approximately 10% compared to the conventional steel tube.

   Environmental Management
 Sanyo Special Steel formulates an environmental policy that forms the basis of the company’s environmental conservation activities. Based on this policy, we create plans to improve environmental conservation and use environmental management systems in initiatives to tackle global warming, recycle by-products, and help prevent environmental pollution in a bid to mitigate environmental risks.
In addition, we not only help recycle metal resources by manufacturing products using scrap iron as the main raw material, but we also promote goods that are manufactured to help reduce the burden on the environment, using components and mold dies that have a longer life and are smaller in size and lighter in weight.

 ■Environmental policy
(Philosophy)
We recognize that environmental issues such as global warming; air, water, and soil contamination; and waste problems are serious issues shared by all of humanity. As a company located in a richly endowed environment that faces Himeji Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a national treasure of Japan in the north, and the Setonaikai National Park in the south, we are committed to caring for the preservation of the environment and contributing to building a sustainable society in every stage of our business activities.
(Policy)
Bearing in mind that we are a company with plants that manufacture and sell special steel and non-ferrous metals, we undertake environmental management based on the following policy.
1) We will contribute to the recycling of metal resources by manufacturing steel products using iron scrap as the main raw
material.
2) In addition to complying with laws, regulations, and agreements related to the environment, we will make ongoing
efforts to enhance our environmental management framework to improve our environmental performance, and we will
responsibly control any business activities that may have an adverse impact on the environment.
3) We will make efforts to reduce our impact on the environment in all stages of our business activities, and we will actively promote resource and energy savings, the recycling of byproducts and reduction of waste material, and the control of pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions to contribute to conservation of the environment and mitigation of climate change. Moreover, we will strive to prevent environmental pollution by developing products that will contribute
to reducing our impact on the environment.
4) In our environmental conservation activities, we will pay particular attention to the education of each and every
employee in environmental awareness.
5) To achieve this environmental policy, we will set environmental targets and review them at least once a year, and we
will revise these targets as necessary.
6) We will ensure that all employees are thoroughly familiar with this environmental policy through education and training,
and we will appoint the General Manager of Environmental Management as the Environmental System Management Officer.
      ◦Compliance with regulatory standards  (Water Pollution Prevention Act, and the Air Pollution Control Act, etc.)
   ◦Attainment of regulatory standards in all items (No violations of, or deviation from, laws, regulations or agreements.)
           Self-Assessment: The level to which targets have been achieved are classified under 3 stages ○○○:Plans have been met ○○:Good progress is being made to achieve plans
○:Further initiatives will be undertaken to achieve plans
Environmental accounting
We collated costs for environmental conservation initiatives undertaken in FY2019 in accordance with guidelines from the Ministry of the Environment.
Maintenance and administration costs for environmentally-friendly equipment such as dust collection units &water treatment facilities and the cost of recycling/disposing of byproducts amounted to approximately 2.6 billion yen. We also invested approximately 400 million yen in the improvement of dust collection units &water treatment facilities and in energy-saving initiatives such as changing lighting to LED.

   Acquisition of ISO14001 Certification
We have acquired ISO14001 Certification (the international standard for environmental management systems) at principal mill in Himeji, our manufacturing base. We make continued efforts to establish this standard through our annual internal audit and external audit. During the internal audit, junior staff members are also in attendance at audit sites, which helps them understand the environmental management system. We are also making efforts to improve the system. We also focus on on-going training to facilitate the smooth change from one generation to another of internal auditors. In 2017, an external audit reviewed our transition to ISO14001:2015 and assessed that our Environmental Management System was being properly maintained and effectively utilized, allowing us to complete migration to the standard.
Promotion of the Environmental Management System
The Environmental Conservation Committee
Each year we hold a meeting of our Environmental Conservation Committee to enhance environmental management and mitigate environmental risk. The Committee is chaired by the Executive Officer in charge of the Environment Division, and its members also include the General Manager
of the Production Division and the General Manager of the Administration Division, and it discusses the formulation of basic guidelines on environmental conservation and matters on basic initiatives. The contents of the Committee’s discussions are reported to the Board.
Environmental Liaison Meetings
Once a month, an Environmental Liaison Meeting is held to share information on the environment; those attending include the Chief Officer for Environmental Systems, executive officers, and department heads. The meetings collate information on the matters listed below and attempt to mitigate environmental risks.
(i) Status of responses to points identified in environmental
We believe that raising every employee’s awareness of the environment is important in tackling our environmental conservation activities, and we conduct regular training for new employees and grade-based environmental workshops. We have also established a reward program to encourage employees to obtain qualifications related to environmental conservation such as those for pollution prevention managers, and we have also been working to have employees calculate carbon footprints for their own households.

  Initiatives to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions
Sanyo Special Steel is involved in efforts to reduce CO2emissions (one of the greenhouse gases (GHG)) as part of its initiatives on climate change. Under our medium-term business plan (2017-2019), we aim to cut CO2 emissions by 2.6% compared to BAU (business as usual - the scenario where no special measures are taken) by 2020. Results for FY2019 show a reduction of 3.38% has been achieved, and we are making renewed efforts to achieve the target for FY2020. In addition, we have continued to promote energy- saving initiatives such as the switch in fuel from heavy crude oil to LNG, increased use of regenerative burners for heating furnaces, and the use of inverters in large motors (revolution controlled), and through these initiatives, we have reduced unit emissions of CO2 by 9% per ton of crude steel in comparison with FY2005. As a result of these initiatives, we have been recognized as an“ S-class”business operator (the top rank for companies making outstanding energy-savings) for the fives consecutive year under the assessment program run by the Ministry of the Economy, Trade and Industry, a program that grades and classifies business operators.
In October 2020, we joined“Challenge Zero,”a project led by the Japan Business Federation that encourages businesses to take up the challenge of creating innovation for a decarbonized society.
We have published our innovation challenges,“Contribution to zero CO2 emissions by developing bearing steel for long- life wind power generation”and“Reduction of CO2 emissions in various industrial furnace operations by developing high- strength heat-resistant steel tubes for heat exchangers.”(Details of innovation challenges can be found on pages 11-12 of this report.).

Reducing the load on the environment when transporting products
Reducing CO2 emissions does not just involve manufacturing processes but also essential initiatives on the logistics front. We believe that the choice of transportation method when shipping products is a particularly important point for reducing the load on the environment on the logistics front. Consequently, we are working to promote the use of rail transport and freight ships on the assumption that product quality can be ensured; rail transport allows CO2 reductions to be reduced by around 90% compared to transportation by truck, and freight ships provide a reduction of around 80% compared to the same. Of all the shipments that Sanyo Special Steel makes itself, transport by freight ship accounts for a significantly higher percentage than the average for the manufacturing sector.
Special steel products created from recycled materials
We use electric arc furnace steel-making (which uses iron scrap as a main ingredient) to manufacture special steel, contributing to the recycling and effective use of iron resources. Scrap iron accounts for around 80% of our raw materials, and if materials recycled internally are included, around 95% of our raw materials are recycled products.
Initiatives to reduce by-products
In FY2019, the amount of by-products generated by our production activities was 203,000 tons, and the amount processed, including the volume sold, was 212,000 tons. By-products include electric furnace slag, scale, dust, brick waste, and sludge. Based on the 3 R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) concept, we encourage recycling of these by-products and, of the amount processed in FY2019, approximately 89% was either recycled or reduced down by incineration, with the remaining amount, approximately 11%, finally being disposed of in landfills. Moving forward, we will work to expand the use of by-products in new applications in order to reduce disposal in landfills.

Recycling slag from electric arc furnaces
We promote the recycling of electric furnace slag generated as a by-product of the manufacturing process, and by ensuring reliable quality in the product and responding to a diverse range of needs, we have been able to maintain a 100% recycling rate of this resource. Our electric furnace slag products are used mainly as roadbed material for roads and as an asphalt aggregate instead of natural resources such as stone and sand. Moving forward, we expect it to be used as a raw material in
“inhibitors”to control foam expansion of molten steel and by local authorities as a recycled aggregate for paved surfaces.
 We use pressurized steam-aging facilities to pressurize our furnace slag products to the highest level in Japan in a process that effectively stabilizes any expansion in the products. In addition, we use a classification machine that can sort electric furnace products into six stages simultaneously, from coarse-grained aggregate to fine grains, and multi-functional classification equipment made up of a granulator that chamfers aggregate particles to adjust grain size and improve resistance to wear. Using these manufacturing processes, we provide customers with high-quality electric furnace slag products.
 Moving forward, we intend to focus on realizing a sustainable society as we continue to comply with the Nippon Slag Association’s“Guidelines for Management of Iron and Steel Slag Products”and not only deploy management systems across all areas including manufacturing, quality, and sales, but also submit to reviews by third-party organizations to enhance management systems and further improve reliability.

   Moves to Reduce the Load on the Environment
  Efficient use of water resources
Water is vital for the manufacture of our products. It is used to cool steel and equipment, and also as a source of power for equipment. Although our manufacturing base (Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture) does not lie in an area assessed by WRI Aqueduct to be facing high water stress, we reuse more than 90% of the water employed in our production process, in recognition of the fact that water is a limited resource. We also have our own source of water (groundwater) in addition to water supply from the industrial waterworks. Contaminated water that has been used in the factory is sent to an on-site treatment facility to be purified. After this, the purified water is reused in the factory, while the remainder undergoes further treatment before being released into public waterways. At the point where the water drains into public waterways, there is a system that takes automatic measurements to constantly monitor pH levels, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen, and phosphorus, and if levels go beyond our voluntary in-house management standards then an alert is issued to allow the person in charge to deal with the issue in a prompt manner. In addition, the water is regularly analyzed for harmful substances, etc., by an external organization as part of our efforts to manage water quality and prevent water pollution.

Sulfur oxide emissions
  At facilities that generate soot and smoke, we have
achieved SOx (sulfur oxide) emissions well below the levels 40 66.5 agreed on with the Himeji City council by switching the fuel
from heavy crude oil with high sulfur content to LNG (town 30
gas) which contains almost no sulfur. In a bid to reduce NOx 57 (nitrogen oxide) emissions, we are using low NOx burners 20
and implementing proper combustion controls, among other
initiatives. We have also introduced units that automatically 10 measure NOx in a system that enables us to constantly monitor
heating furnaces, which produce large volumes of emissions.
Furthermore, revisions to the Air Pollution Control Act in
April 2018 stipulated that operators should voluntarily reduce
emissions of mercury concentrations in exhaust gases from
electric steel-making furnaces. Sanyo Special Steel regularly
measures and records mercury concentrations in accordance
with the voluntary standards recommended by the Japan Iron 300 and Steel Federation to confirm that the concentrations meet 250 voluntary control standards.
In terms of dust collection facilities, we are working on 200 158.9 initiatives to increase and enhance equipment capacity, such 150
as the installation of dust collection units in continuous casting 100

   Confidence with Customers 
    Quality
Quality assurance is about creating a process that allows us to accurately grasp the needs of customers and provide a reliable supply of products that meet those needs, and is directly linked to our corporate philosophy of“Confidence-based Management.” The Group has established a quality management system based on ISO9001:2015, and we promote quality control activities that create product quality by integrating our sales division, engineering division, production division, and quality assurance division to ensure that we satisfy product standards such as JIS and various overseas standards. Furthermore, quality assurance is not just about controlling product quality; it also about ensuring that the quality management system, which is a key part of our corporate structure, can respond to environmental changes such as globalization and changing customer needs, and also address the need to make improvements to realize a more efficient structure. The Group aims to continue to be an enterprise that enjoys sustainable growth by placing emphasis not only on product quality controls but also on maintaining and improving the quality management system, which forms the cornerstone of the Group’s quality assurance system.
Quality Assurance System
The Quality Assurance Department plays a central role in the quality management system maintained and managed by Sanyo Special Steel, which forms the cornerstone of our quality assurance system. The process for product quality control is developed through collaboration between various divisions. The Sales Division gains an understanding of customer needs, the Engineering Division then reflects these requirements in the manufacturing designs, and the Production Division creates the final product based on these designs. In addition, Sanyo Special Steel continues to work to provide products that inspire ever-more confidence, using its Quality Assurance Department (an independent department responsible for all aspects of quality assurance) to provide checks and balances in a bid to optimize and enhance quality assurance functions. The Quality Assurance Committee meets regularly and is chaired by the Director in Charge of Quality Assurance. The Committee discusses basic policy and plans concerning quality assurance for the fiscal year and implements improvement activities such as
“systematic improvements in key issues,”“prevention of
quality complaints,”“enhancement of quality assurance,”and“improvements in customer satisfaction levels.”
Quality Assurance Initiatives
Under ISO9001:2015, individual organizations need to conduct operational risk assessments to address new requirements fo“r risk and opportunity initiatives.”Based on issues at Sanyo Special Steel that have been identified through these assessments, we have been rolling-out a medium-to-long term PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) plan in a bid to upgrade our quality assurance. Specifically, we are working to improve our quality management system by continuously updating our quality manuals, implementing quality patrols, and sharing information between organizations through internal quality audits. In addition, we are promoting educational activities including lectures on quality issues in November, which is the National Quality Month, aimed at raising the quality awareness of employees.
Understanding and reflecting customer needs
Once a year, we survey our customers to have them assess us on QCDD (Quality, Cost, Delivery, Development). We analyze the results and extract any points with low scores for improvement, leading to even higher customer satisfaction. Furthermore, in order to understand the needs of customers in a timely manner, we hold meetings to exchange technical ideas with customers and we also take part in exhibitions, both in Japan and overseas. We not only present detailed information on the products and new technologies we have developed, but we also collect information on customers’ latest needs, which is then used to develop and improve our products.
Promotion of skill transfer activities
On April 1, 2015, Skill Succession Group was established. This group specializes in the succession of skills and is involved in the planned and systematic training of employees who will succeed to the relevant roles.
FY2019 was the final year of the three-year activity plan established in FY2017. We have successfully achieved the plan’s activity targets through continued efforts that included one-on-one trainings (pairing up employees imparting the skills with those learning them), the creation of training materials, and the enhancement of award programs to improve motivation.
The“Activities to Prevent Recurrence of Accidental Stoppages”* commenced in FY2019 are beginning to yield results, with an operator succeeding in preventing a facility problem.
The Skills Successionactivities were added to the commitments of our Mid-term Business Plan from FY2020 onward, giving these activities more weight to carry.
*Activities to address production suspensions and facility halts by adopting the Skills Succession approach in the whole process, up to completion, of recurrence prevention measures, from identifying causes to drawing up countermeasures.
Promotion of TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) activities
The entire production division is working on TPM activities with the aim of thoroughly eliminating losses and waste due to equipment breakdowns and problems, increasing production efficiency, and providing a reliable supply of products.
In terms of activities, we have not only set up the“TPM School”as a place to provide training on basic knowledge about equipment and machinery to develop human resources with a good understanding of the equipment, but we are also creating common-interest groups for individual work categories on topics such as quality improvement, productivity improvement, safety, and cost to allow us to carry out improvements every day. By the end of August this fiscal year, 97 people had attended the TPM School, with total attendance at 1,800 since the School started, to acquire the basic skills and knowledge useful for autonomous maintenance. In addition to this, the outcomes of improvement activities are announced at in-house TPM contests held four times a year in a bid to enhance TPM activities.
Moreover, we are conducting IoT application training at the TPM School and promoting the introduction of IoT at manufacturing sites in order to further improving productivity and stabilize operations.

  Declaration of Partnership Building
Sanyo Special Steel announced a Declaration of Partnership Building that aims to improve value addition throughout our supply chain by working together to co-exist and co-prosper with our supply chain partners.
The Declaration of Partnership Building is an initiative for which the framework and system has been affirmed by the“Council on Promoting Partnership Building for Cultivating the Future”comprising representatives from the business circles and the labor organizations as well as related ministers and promoted by the Cabinet Office and the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency.
The initiative aims to: prevent SMEs and small enterprises from“bearing burdens caused by unfair trade conditions”and continuing to advance efforts for encouraging companies to introduce appropriate trade practices, while taking into consideration impacts of the COVID-19; and
to encourage companies to build new partnerships involving
efforts for increasing value added across supply chains and open innovation across business scales, groups and borders, and others.
We will continue strengthening partnership ties with our suppliers to seek mutual development as business partners.
          Procurement
The Group promotes procurement activities based on its Basic Procurement Policy, ensures compliance with laws and social norms, conducts fair and equitable transactions widely, with an open-door policy regardless of whether it be in Japan or overseas, and promotes environmentally-friendly procurement activities with our suppliers. These days we are required to contribute to the sustainability of society in various forms as part of our corporate social responsibility. The Group has identified principles for“sustainable procurement”such as accountability, transparency, respect for human rights, and ethical behavior in the procurement of raw materials and services, and these principles are reflected in our procurement decisions. In addition, we strive to maintain and improve mutual understanding and trust with our suppliers as we aim for mutual development as business partners; and through stronger partnerships, we endeavor to realize“sustainable procurement”that will contribute to the sustainability of business operations for all our suppliers.
Implementation of a supplier awards (to strengthen partnerships)
Sanyo Special Steel believes that building good trading relationships with suppliers is essential for sustainable procurement and values its partnerships with suppliers. As part of this, we have set up an award scheme for suppliers. Under the supplier award scheme, we comprehensively evaluate a number of factors to select suppliers who have attained outstanding achievements and present them with an award. The scheme covers raw materials, various other materials, maintenance, and outsourcing services supplied to each division, and the factors used in evaluations include the quality, cost competitiveness, delivery deadline management, business status of the supplier, environmental measures taken, and service provided with regard to transactions carried out with Sanyo Special Steel over a fixed period of time. In fiscal 2020, we also commended six companies that made outstanding achievements.
Procurement of ferro-alloys considered to be“conflict minerals”
“Conflict minerals”indicate four minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its neighboring countries; these are tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and they are referred to as 3TG (from their initials). There are concerns that some of the profits from the trade in 3TG are used as a source of funding for militia groups, contributing to human rights violations and conflict. While we purchase tantalum and tungsten needed in the manufacture of special steel, we check through our suppliers that any purchases are“DRC conflict-free”(i.e. not used to fund militia groups.) In addition, if customers ask whether our products are“DRC conflict-free,” then we issue a statement declaring them to be so using the“Conflict Mineral Report Template.”

  Responsible procurement
  Initiatives for the construction of a reliable procurement framework
Sanyo Special Steel factories are usually in production 24 hours a day. Consequently, with the collaboration of our suppliers, we use a 24-hour system to take delivery of scrap iron (our main raw material). We also procure the required amounts of ferro- alloys and supplementary material when needed. In anticipation of the risk of disruptions to supplies due to disasters and other factors, we try to gain an understanding of production conditions, production locations, delivery routes, and other information for our key procurement items through initiatives such as visiting our suppliers’factories. We also regularly share information on procurement items with suppliers, and we have established a sustainable production system for times of emergency by securing prompt replacements in the event of an emergency and by holding an appropriate amount of stock on our premises.

To materialize these, the Group is working to prevent occupational accidents, provide mental health care and promote a good work-life balance, among other initiatives, to develop an environment where various talents can play an active part. In addition, and most importantly, as a manufacturing company, we are committed to creating a safe workplace. Furthermore, the Group needs personnel who can“think autonomously,”regulating themselves and thinking and acting independently. The requirements for this are self-direction and the spirit to take on a challenge. In order to realize this, under our basic policy of“developing employees and make full use of their potential,”we not only offer various training in accordance with job role and career, but we have also adopted a personnel system that encourages a strong desire for self-growth and the achievement of goals in our employees and allows them to always challenge high-level problems.
Creating a work-friendly environment
Active participation of women
We have set a goal to raise the ratio of female staff to 25% by the end of March 2028, utilizing them as a valuable asset. To achieve this goal, we have increased the areas where women play an active role by systematically recruiting female employees and expanding the range of their work, while introducing a system that allows women to continue working by alleviating pressure on them during life events by offering childcare leave, childcare allowances, and shorter working hours. In addition, we have been conducting inhouse training to promote awareness of female employees and create an organizational culture that makes it easier for them to play active roles.
As a result of these efforts, the percentage of female staff stood at 13.8% as of March 2020.

We held a management training session targeting those in managerial positions, who are the candidates for future senior management, with focus on thinking matters through so as to let the participants develop“strategic thinking”skills required of a senior management. We have been conducting this training with the aim of developing personnel who are capable of taking a risk to make the right decision and judgement even in a situation where the perspective is uncertain, and looking across the company and business from a viewpoint of total optimization. In the latest training session, which was themed“developing a business vision for 2033 (the 100th anniversary of our foundation)”(future prediction), participants thoroughly analyzed the present state, made suppositions on possible changes that might happen from different angles and without being bound by precedent, and discussed new business models, which they presented before the management team. Believing that development and growth of human resources are crucial to the company’s sustained growth, we will continue efforts towards this.
■ Training for newly-appointed Associate Managers
Sanyo Special Steel conducts grade-based trainings to let our employees acquire the skills and mindset required for each particular job grade. In FY2019, we held a training for newly-appointed Associate Managers, targeting the grade of employees who were in a gap period between trainings. The main purpose of this training was to make those who had been newly-appointed as Associate Manager, a core position in each workplace, realize their role as a candidate for the next generation of leaders. We aimed to boost their ability to assist their supervisor and draw support from other members, develop their leadership required to guide the organization, and raise their management capability as future candidates for managerial positions. We will continue improving and offering grade- based trainings.

    Achieving a work-life balance
To achieve a work-life balance means to perform one’s duty at work with a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction while at the same time have a free and diverse choice of lifestyle options in terms of family and community life. The“Work-Style Reform Related Bill,”a package of legislation to give a push towards better work-life balance, has been implemented one by one since April 2019.“Work-style reforms”such as the prohibition of long working hours, properly managed working hours, and the obligation for employees to take certain number of annual leave days have become increasingly important in terms of achieving a work-life balance. Sanyo Special Steel promotes Wednesdays as“no-overtime days”and promotes increased productivity in a bid to reduce overtime hours, as well as to improve the rate of paid leave taken. In terms of the amount of paid leave taken in particular, the figure at Sanyo Special Steel has already exceeded 70% (77.9% in FY2019), in contrast to the national average (51.1%); and we are working to keep this figure above the target of“achieving 70% by 2020” set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Furthermore, as well as encouraging employees to take blocks of paid leave or incremental leave and establishing a system that exceeds statutory requirements for maternity leave, childcare leave, and nursing care leave, etc., we are also striving to achieve a work-life balance for each and every employee by creating a work environment and culture that makes it easier to take these leaves.
Promoting health-conscious management
At Sanyo Special Steel, we view employee health management from a business point of view and invest in health initiatives based on the Industrial Safety and Health Act in order to help revitalize the organization by improving employees’energy and productivity. Mental and physical disorders among employees not only cause a fall in productivity but may also lead to an outflow of human resources as employees take leaves of absence or leave the company. Employees are provided with statutory health examinations, metabolic tests, health advice, and similar resources, as well as on-going mandatory stress check-ups since FY2016. The results of tests on staff members are used to conduct an aggregated analysis, and employees with high levels of stress are advised to see an occupational physician. In addition, we have a mental health help-desk, provide treatment to help employees stop smoking, and also provide dietary counseling among other initiatives. Moving forward, we aim to be a company that inspires ever-more confidence as we continue to place the highest priority on the health and safety of our employees (a major assumption of our corporate philosophy of“Confidence-based Management”) and promote the creation of workplaces that improve the mental and physical health of our employees and allow them to work in an energetic manner.
Creating
As a manufacturing enterprise, our Group believes that“safety”should be afforded top priority above all. Evidence of this is the way that employees greet each other with“Keep Safe!”to impart a sense of safety in one another. In order to put our corporate philosophy of“Corporate-based Management”into practice, our goal is to achieve“no accidents at all over the year”under the Group’s safety activities. We believe that we need to achieve a total absence of accidents throughout the year across the entire Group in order to build relationships of trust with various stakeholders and to achieve sustainable growth for the Group. All employees need to work together on safety activities, and if even one person is left out, then the goal cannot be achieved. There are no short-cuts in safety activities. Our objective is to achieve a whole year that is totally free of accidents by building up safety activities in the Group day-by-day to create a workplace where all employees are safe and can work with peace of mind.
            Occupational health and safety activities - to ensure safety -
     Extend employment program
Sanyo Special Steel has established an extended employment program for employees who have reached the age of 65. Making active use of certain older staff members who are healthy, wanting to work, and capable of performing their jobs is consistent with the concept of diversity. Employees who are deemed necessary in the performance of work and from the viewpoint of technology and skills transfer as of the time they turn 65 stay on in extended employment as“senior citizen partners.”As of April 1, 2020, there were 46“senior citizen partners”active across various work sites.
Employment of Disabled Persons
We promote the employment of people with disabilities in a bid to achieve a society where everyone can enjoy an active working life.
We not only promote recruitment initiatives in conjunction with Hello Work (the Japanese government’s Employment Service Center) and special support schools, etc., but we are also constantly making efforts to improve the work environment in both hard and soft aspects. In addition, any employee certified as disabled after joining the company is offered support to keep working, with consideration given to his/her work content and working hours. As of June 1, 2020, we had 24 employees with disability playing an active role in a range of work sites.
Safety and health management
Sanyo Special Steel has in place a Safety and Health Committee chaired by the general safety and health manager (Executive Officer in charge of Safety & Disaster Prevention Office) that works to secure safety and security of employees in the workplace. The Committee meets every month to discuss matters such as basic measures to avoid danger to the safety and health of employees, the cause of industrial accidents and measures to prevent their recurrence. Since majority of the members are the labor union representatives in accordance with law, the committee reflects the opinion of workers in the safety and health policies. The state of safety-related activities for each month is checked by the Corporate Policy Committee, while the summary of safety and health activities for the whole year is reported to the Board. We are constantly making progress through effective use of PDCA cycle (planning, implementing, monitoring/supervising, and taking steps for improvement).
Simulated experience training center for safety
We have established a simulated experience training center for safety that allows us to simulate dangers in a bid to eradicate occupational accidents. In 2018, 2,655 employees were trained at the center, and to date the total is 23,736. In 2018, we installed VR (virtual reality) equipment to give a more realistic experience. Moving forward, we will add new training content to allow us to consider the importance of hazard avoidance with our members of staff.
Grade-based training
Safety knowledge, risk behavior, and sensitivity to hazards, etc., vary for each age group and grade. Therefore, we need to conduct specialist training for each respective grade. For the training targeting rehired employees (between ages 60 and 64) and senior citizen partners (ages 65 and above) in 2020, we included employees of the members of our suppliers’ organization.
The new 3S activities
The 3S activities in Sanyo Special Steel had been addressing issues that had caused accidents or problems that had been found during patrols.
In addition, under the existing system for 6S certification, activities had been seen to increase temporarily in the period leading up to certification but had not truly taken root as ongoing efforts. These issues prompted us to put in place a structure for the new 3S activities in which everyone from section managers to workers on site take part in making improvements in the workplace, starting from around themselves, to find and eliminate waste in things, space, and time, towards the goal of creating an efficient, worker-friendly, and safe workplace that is free of any obstacles to hamper workers’flow of movement, as well as an environment that enables its maintenance. So far, one section has obtained a certificate while other sections are working towards it.

  Safety Proposal Making System
We have launched a Safety Proposal Making System aimed at strengthening measures to prevent accidents by inviting proposals on ways to identify unsafe spots in each workplace, ideas for safeguarding, and methods for working in safety, based on which we implement improvements. Sourcing proposals from workers who are actually working on site is not only effective in developing specific safety measures but also promises improvement in the workers’safety consciousness while preparing a proposal. We believe that the system will turn into a safety activity of truly bottom-up nature, which forms the core of our safety activities. In FY2019, 92 safety proposals were made.
Moreover, we designate Safety Pros from among team leaders of work sites who are expected to lead by example in initiating improvement in work operations and environments of the team. In this way, we are working to raise safety awareness and create a synergy with the Safety Proposal Making System.
Activities of Safety Promoters
Sanyo Special Steel has been running the Safety Promoter activities since 2016 with the goal of“bringing true safety”through an integration of top-down style and bottom-up style safety activities. We select young to mid-career employees from each workplace and educate them on accurate safety knowledge and the importance of adherence to rules, and thereby train personnel who can independently judge on safety and take action.
Young and mid-career employees who are designated as a Safety Promoter will patrol the work sites of their own as well as of others, through which they notice the strengths and weaknesses of their own workplace and hone their sensitivity to recognize hazards. They also engage in risk assessment activities to sort out hazardous works, all of which are combined with improvement measures for facilities to put in place a state of substantial safety.

Disaster prevention initiatives
             Risk management in emergency situations
Many employees work at our company, where we have various types of facilities and equipment. In addition to establishing a regular fire and disaster prevention management system, we take various steps to prevent accidents and stop the spread of (minimize) damage when a disaster does occur. For example, we have developed manuals in preparation for possible plant accidents such as fires or explosions and natural disasters such as earthquakes, and we hold regular disaster drills, among other measures.
The basic policy for FY2018 was“to aim to raise awareness of fire and disaster prevention measures through drills and training and create a workplace culture and staff well able to respond to disaster situations,”with the following four points set as priority items.
“Enhance fire and disaster prevention management”
“Enhance management of facilities at high risk of fire, explosion, or leakage” “Improve capacity to respond to disasters through on-going
training and drills for fire and disaster prevention”
“Enhance disaster prevention measures by using specialist disaster
prevention teams.”
Based on these priority management items, we have been working hard to enhance and strengthen disaster prevention management systems to prepare for emergencies while, at the same time, conducting on-going activities that emphasize increased awareness of disaster prevention.
Initiativestoheightendisasterpreventionandreadinessawareness
To further enhance disaster prevention and readiness awareness among staff, the company holds workshops each year targeting supervisors and officers responsible for hazardous materials as well as workshops for fire prevention officers and disaster prevention officers. We are making efforts to improve the level of control of small and minute amounts of hazardous materials at licensed facilities by providing direct instruction to workplace managers and those responsible for handling hazardous materials and high- pressure gas.
At the workshop for supervisors and officers responsible for hazardous materials held in July, participants were reminded of the types of hazardous materials regulated under the Fire Service Act and the current state of hazardous materials facilities, etc., on our factory premises. We also raised their awareness of their responsibilities and duties as supervisors and responsible officers.
At the workshops for fire prevention officers and disaster prevention officers held in September, participants were reminded to carry out disaster prevention management inspections (once a year) in each workplace using a voluntary inspection check sheet to prevent shelves and cabinets from toppling and items from falling. They also deepened their understanding of the need of first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and AED in saving lives from disasters, accidents or sudden sickness.
Regarding the management of facilities, we worked on 3S activities in licensed facilities for hazardous materials and high- pressure gas equipment, with June and March designated as the months for improving controls in the licensed facilities, and October as the designated month for improving controls on high-pressure gas equipment. Moving forward, we will continue to promote further awareness of disaster prevention issues among employees through these disaster prevention training programs and control enhancement activities.
In FY2018, we started holding a first-aid course for operating managers. The course provided training on critical care/ cardiopulmonary resuscitation (chest compressions/use of AED), preventing blood loss, and other first-aid related topics with help from nurses.
Conducting disaster drills
The equipment and hazardous materials used at our company differ from workplace to workplace. Furthermore, awareness of disaster prevention, as well as experience in disaster prevention, varies widely among employees, not to mention new employees participating in disaster prevention training for the first time. In addition, the scale of a disaster may require coordination with affiliated companies. In view of this, when conducting disaster prevention drills, we identify appropriate emergency situations to ensure that drills are more specific and practical.
Typical disaster prevention drills in FY2019
In FY2019, we conducted a large number of drills, including a large-scale earthquake disaster drill, a joint factory disaster drill with the Shikama Fire Department, and initial firefighting drills at each workplace.
We conducted a major earthquake disaster drill on September 2 based on the scenario of a huge earthquake with epicenter in the Nankai Trough that has caused disruption of lifeline systems providing power, water, gas, and transportation. The goal of the drill was to“walk home.”At the beginning of the drill, participants evacuated to the primary evacuation point to be accounted for, and then moved on to a car park on the factory premises, split into groups according to the direction of their homes, formed up in lines, and started walking towards home (up to the factory gates). When a large earthquake actually occurs, it is highly likely that transport facilities would be in a chaos and roads disrupted. Through these drills, we will continue working to raise awareness and readiness of the employees.

On November 22, we held a disaster drill at the metal powder factory in conjunction with the Shikama Fire Department, based on the scenario of a fire occurring at the plant. In assumption of an oxygen deficiency hazard due to the leakage of inert gas, in addition to smoke from the fire, we exercised a series of operations from first- aid fire fighting by our occupational fire-fighting unit to fire fighting by the self-defense fire brigade and the public fire brigade, rescue and first-aid treatment of the injured, and setting up a Disaster Response Headquarters to collect information and give out instructions. Moving forward, we will continue to work towards improving our awareness and response skills to help prevent fires/disasters in the workplace by practicing these kinds of disaster drills.

 Introduction of a system to account for the safety of employees
For a company to properly continue business in the event of a large earthquake and other wide area disasters, it is important that it quickly grasp the situation and safety of its employees and others concerned.
As part of our business continuity program (BCP) in anticipation of earthquakes and other wide area disasters that are happening often across Japan in recent years, Sanyo Special Steel introduced a system to account for the safety of our employees in August 2020.
In the event of a huge earthquake and other disasters, it would be difficult to confirm and consolidate information on employees’ safety and whereabouts by phone or other conventional means. The system will allow us to do this swiftly and put the information into use in taking measures required to continue business.

 Corporate Governance
The Group practices a basic philosophy of“Confidence-based Management”and, by supplying useful steel products to society at large, we aim to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term as we support the development of the global economy, while also building a recycle-oriented society and focusing on environmental conservation. In order to establish a management platform required to achieve this goal, we are working to upgrade our corporate governance.
Fundamental thoughts on corporate governance
In order to ensure further confidence among our stakeholders, including shareholders, consumers, and the local community, Sanyo Special Steel has developed a corporate governance structure suited to the Group’s business, and we will work to enhance corporate governance in a bid to improve efficiency, soundness, and transparency in our management.
Overview of corporate governance
Sanyo Special Steel is a company with an Audit and Supervisory Board, which supervises how directors execute their duties, and a Board of Directors that consists of nine directors including four outside directors (of which, three are independent outside directors). The Board of Directors meet regularly (at monthly meetings) and as required (at ad hoc meetings) to decide important matters concerning the execution of business. We also have in place company-wide committees and meetings to discuss important operational matters such as the Board of Directors’meetings, which facilitate efficient decision-making on management and the Corporate Policy Committee (held twice a month in principle), which deals with important matters to discuss, the Risk Management Committee, which aims to ensure thorough compliance and further enhancements in corporate governance; the Security Trade Control Committee; and the Rewards and Sanctions Committee. Aiming to set a clear division of responsibilities between“deciding policies and overseeing the management”and“executing business,”as well as to be able to make swift decisions amid the changing and diversifying business environment, we have adopted the executive officer system.
With regard to audits by the company auditors, the Audit and Supervisory Board makes an auditing policy for each year and conduct the audits as needed according to the policy. An audit is carried out by the four members of the Audit & Supervisory Board, including two full-time outside members, with a broad perspective and covering not only the performance of duties by the Directors but also the state of risk management, compliance and other matters pertaining to internal control. Based on its results, an audit opinion is presented to the Representative Director and also to other business execution divisions as needed. In order to prepare for a case where the number of Audit & Supervisory Board Members falls below the required number stipulated by laws and regulations, we have appointed one Substitute Audit & Supervisory Board Member.
To improve the functions of the Board of Directors, we also conduct analyses and evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness. We do this through a questionnaire survey targeting Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board Members on all aspects of the Board of Directors, from its composition to the way it is run, the state of discussions, and how the cooperation with outside directors is going, among other topics. The Board then assesses the outcome of the survey.

  Strengthening the corporate governance system
・ Three independent Directors took office, making up one-third of the board
Aiming to have a system for agile decision making to keep up with the changes in business environment and for effective corporate governance, Sanyo Special Steel ensures that its Board of Directors has the right size in relation to its business lineup and challenges, and a well-balanced and diverse mix of members in terms of experience, knowledge and expertise. We also have independent directors, from whom we expect opinions and oversight of our management from objective and expert viewpoints. With effect from June 26, 2020, three of the nine members or one-third of our Board of Directors are independent independent directors. As a listed company with a parent company, we will continue upgrading our governance in conformity with the principles of the Corporate Governance Code.
・ Establishment of the Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee
We have set up a Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee, a non-statutory advisory body comprising the Representative Director and President and all (three) of the independent outside directors.
This has enabled us to seek the appropriate involvement and advice of our independent outside directors on matters of particular importance regarding the nomination and compensation of directors responsible for corporate management, and thereby enhance the independence, objectivity and accountability of our Board of Directors towards a further improvement of its governance function.
・ Increase and improve discussions with outside directors
Our outside directors have been joining the regular meetings between the Representative Director and the members of the Audit & Supervisory Board. In addition to this, we have created new platforms for exchange of views between internal and outside directors, and between outside directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, so as to facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of understanding between our outside directors and other members via communication with these groups.
・ Training sessions for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
We offer training sessions by guest lecturers to the members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board on their responsibilities required by the Companies Act and other crucial laws and regulations, various systems relevant to our business, and other topics. These trainings are designed to provide them with continuous opportunities to earn the knowledge they need and deepen their understanding.

 Internal Control Systems
         Compliance System and Risk Management System
Sanyo Special Steel has established the“Guidelines for Corporate Behavior”that prescribe the standards of behavior we should follow as a corporation, and a“Code of Conduct”as guidance on conduct to be observed in the course of business activities within the framework of the Guidelines for Corporate Behavior. Moreover, we make efforts to ensure all officers and employees are thoroughly familiar with these standards. (Guidelines for Corporate Behavior and Code of Conduct can be found on pages 41-42 of this report.)
We are building a system to promote compliance by prescribing in our company rules the placement of a compliance help-desk, regular meetings of the Risk Management Committee, and other matters.
Sanyo Special Steel will endeavor in the future to cultivate higher ethical standards by regularly conducting employee education on the necessity and significance of complying with various laws, regulations, and rules in corporate management and will make efforts to maintain and improve the management health of not only Sanyo Special Steel but also of the Group as a whole. Sanyo Special Steel is also committed to putting into practice its mission to“fulfill our social contribution through business”by promoting business activities rooted in high ethical standards.。
We have set up an Internal Control Department responsible for planning and auditing internal controls, as well as functional departments responsible for risk management in individual sectors to form an organizational structure to run the internal control system in the Group. In addition, we have assigned risk management officers to each department and group company; these officers are responsible for planning and promoting autonomous internal control activities in their respective departments/companies. Based on this organizational structure, we operate the internal control system as described below.
  1
Internal control plans
4 Assessments and improvements
The Internal Control Department and the Director in charge
of respective functional departments report on the operational status of the internal control system to the quarterly meeting of the Risk Management Committee, and to the Board of Directors; in addition, these reports are also shared with individual departments/group companies at the quarterly meetings of risk management officers.
The Director in charge of Internal Control Department assesses the effectiveness of the internal control system based on information such as the status of internal control activities implemented and the results of internal audits, and once the results of assessments are compiled, they are reported to the Risk Management Committee and the Board of Directors.
Based on the assessment results, we formulate improvement initiatives to help make the internal control system more effective, and these initiatives are reflected in the internal control plan for the following fiscal year.
5 Training and raising awareness
We have set up courses on internal controls through grade- based training and other methods to provide training for executives and employees of Sanyo Special Steel and its group companies. Furthermore, we are pro-actively working to raise awareness of internal control concepts and improvements in workplace culture, among other topics, through talks between the Internal Control Department and respective departments/ group companies.
6 Links with outside directors, corporate auditors, and accounting auditors Independent outside directors, as members of the
Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee—a body independent from the Board of Directors and other organs —discuss overall issues related to the appointment and compensation of executives, the content of which, as well as opinions, are reported as needed to the Board of Directors via the Representative Director and President.
As members of the Risk Management Committee, the outside directors and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board attend the Committee meetings, where they present and exchange opinions. Outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members also hold regular meetings with the Representative Director and other attendees, through which smooth and appropriate mutual exchange of information is maintained. In terms of interaction with the accounting auditor, we submit regular reports on the operating status of the Risk Management Committee, as well as assessment results on internal controls pertaining to financial reporting, and exchange opinions.
Each year, we formulate a Group-wide internal control plan based on amendments to statutory laws and regulations and changes in the business environment This plan contains basic policies; plans for different functions such as safety, the environment, disaster prevention, and quality; internal audit plans; and training plans. Each department and group company then formulates their respective plans based on the Group-wide plan.
 ■Compliance help-desk (Whistle-blowing system)
We have set up a compliance help-desk to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of circumstances or actions that violate, or appear to have violated, statutory laws, social norms, company rules, or similar regulations.
The help-desk can be used by anyone, including Sanyo Special Steel Group employees, casual workers, temporary workers, and suppliers’ employees, as well as their families, and it provides a system for consultation to ensure that no-one has to handle problems alone—whether these concern issues that are difficult to solve in the workplace or troubles that people are unable to discuss with anyone else.
Consultations and reporting may be done anonymously, and no-one will suffer to his/her disadvantage as a result of any consultation or report.
It is company policy to respond promptly and appropriately to any consultation or report.

Sanyo Special Steel’s individual departments and group companies implement their own, autonomous internal control activities in accordance with internal control plans, based on the nature of their business operations and inherent risks. Specifically, they develop operating regulations, manuals, and other materials and conduct training. They also conduct self- inspections and carry out improvements to operations based on the results. In the event of an accident, disaster, or situation that risks violating the law, the department or group company concerned immediately reports the fact to the Internal Control Department; in addition, corrective measures, such as measures to prevent any recurrence, are taken in collaboration with associated departments. Furthermore, the Internal Control Department gathers these cases together and shares them within the Group, allowing individual departments and group companies to carry out inspections to check for similar risks.
3 Internal audits, etc.
In internal audits, the Internal Control Department and respective functional departments not only check the status of internal controls using documentation such as internal control checklists but also monitor each department/group company. In addition, as a measure to complement internal controls, we have established and operate a whistle-blowing help-desk that can be used by employees of Sanyo Special Steel and its group companies, their families, and suppliers’employees.
We also conduct surveys on employee awareness regarding internal controls and compliance.

 Guidelines for Corporate Behavior
The steel industry in Japan, which is the base material industry, is required to carry out the mission of contributing to the improvement of people’s lives and development of the Japanese economy and society, through constantly supplying steel products that are useful in wide-ranging applications to society. Based on this mission and a strong awareness that it is a member of society, Sanyo Special Steel has established a trusting relationship with society, through faithful and fair business operations.

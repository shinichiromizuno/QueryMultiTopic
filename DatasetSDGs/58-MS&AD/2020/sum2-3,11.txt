Against the backdrop of rapid innovation in today’s mobility society, new driving technologies are being researched and developed. Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance focuses on providing and developing telematics insurance products and services based on big data, both domestically and internationally, that address today’s new mobility society. We launched the Telematics Mobility Service Project within the company to develop and provide new insurance products and services that leverage telematics technologies.

I think it will be necessary to accurately understand new risks and customer needs, and to ensure that autonomous vehicles, for example, are legally and socially acceptable. Moreover, it will be important to deepen our expertise through contributions to “safe, secure, comfortable mobility services” as one of the core elements of Smart Cities and Super Cities, apply this expertise, and develop and provide insurance products and services that can contribute to “lifestyles, health and community development.” I also feel there will be even greater demands than before for providing appropriate risk coverage that utilizes objective data to more fully and accurately determine uncertain risks. I will challenge to develop new insurance products with an awareness of our company policy, which is to deploy globally as a front runner in the telematics and mobility service business by continuing to research ways of applying new technologies like telematics and leveraging the technologies we have acquired thus far.
insurance services for Toyota-connected vehicles in the United States, in cooperation with Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Toyota Motor Corporation. TIMS analyzes mileage driven, driving hours, driving time, hash braking & acceleration and other telematics data from connected vehicles and provides the results to partner insurance companies. In 2019, we began collaborating with Progressive Casualty Company, one of the largest telematics insurance companies, and, together with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, launched BrightDrive, a usage-based telematics automobile insurance for Toyota-connected vehicles.
BrightDrive uses driving data collected from the connected vehicles to provide a discount based on how safely the customer drives. We feel this concept contributes to realizing a safe & secure mobility society because customers who practice safe driving help reduce traffic accidents. Moreover, this insurance provides high-quality repairs using Toyota Genuine Parts in an accident, which makes for a Win-Win-Win product for customers, Toyota (including Toyota dealers) and TIMS. Another major feature is that we have built a fully online insurance solicitation system for BrightDrive.
I am in charge of deploying and promoting telematics automobile insurance and services for Toyota vehicle owners, teaming up with local staff.

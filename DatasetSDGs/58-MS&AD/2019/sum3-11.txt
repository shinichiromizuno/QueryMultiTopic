Regional Revitalization Project
ADI seeks to further deepen its close relationships with local communities, as set forth in its action guidelines, and has launched a regional revitalization project. This project starts
with the conclusion of partnership agreements with local public authorities and works to support the efforts made to revitalize local regions through contributory activities for local communities, providing a menu of beneficial solutions for issues relating to “communities, people and jobs” in local regions. These efforts have received high praise with regard to a variety of aspects and have been certified as “signature initiative examples” by financial institutions contributing to regional revitalization. For a second consecutive year, the initiative has received a Cabinet Office Minister’s Award.
   Toward sustainable local communities
Confronted with issues such as a declining population, a falling birthrate and an aging population, an intense concentration of population and businesses in Tokyo; and the contraction of regional economies, Japan is pushing policies for regional revitalization based on the “Act on Overcoming Population Decline and Vitalizing the Local Economy in Japan.” To achieve regional revitalization, it is critical to seize on the overall strengths of regions through collaboration with the full range of participants in society,* and it is expected that insurance companies, which are financial institutions, will do their part in contributing to regional revitalization.
*Participants in society include industry, local public authorities and national-affiliated organizations, universities and higher education institutions, financial institutions, labor organizations, media, and lawyers and others in the legal profession.

 Recently, there has been an increasing number of local public authorities tackling the issue of realizing an inclusive society to revitalize local communities. Given this, we are applying our abilities to provide assistance by utilizing the expertise we already have in activities to support sports for the disabled.
From fiscal 2019, we have signed an affiliation contract with the professional runner, Yuki Kawauchi, with the same thoughts of supporting local community by utilizing sports. Currently, ADI has affiliated relationships with 14 disabled athletes (as of July 1, 2019), and in addition to spreading sports for the disabled and related educational activities, we are working with Mr. Kawauchi on a marathon caravan that is contributing to the promotion of sports, the vitality of local communities and inclusive society.
As society and social issues become more diverse, we believe that when people accept their diverse individuality and can play an active role, that will lead to regional revitalization and the creation of a resilient society. We will continue to make vigorous efforts to reach these goals.

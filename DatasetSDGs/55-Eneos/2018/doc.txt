Editorial Policy
The JXTG Group has prepared this integrated report, which combines both financial information and non-financial information to help broaden stakeholders’ understanding of the story behind its creation of economic value and social value over the medium to long term.
In editing this integrated report, we referred to the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation created by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry as a set of guidelines on common language connecting companies and investors.
For example, we have included a section called “Value Creation Story,” which describes the value creation process of the Group. In addition, as these guidelines recommend the disclosure of ESG aware- ness with regard to sustainability and business climate risks, we have included a special feature section to discuss the Group’s strategy and measures in detail with regard to climate change, one of the most import- ant issues facing the Group. Climate change is also discussed in the Message from the President. From a standpoint of securing and reinforcing management resources and intangible assets, per the guidelines, we also discuss measures to reinforce various assets for maintaining and improving sustainability, including an explanation of our development of management and other human resources.
More detailed and comprehensive information concerning the Group’s business activities, financial information, social contribution activities, and other aspects of our operations can be
           found on our website. Please refer to the website for financial statements.
We will continue our endeavors to provide clear, concise disclosures and actively pursue dialogue with investors and other stakeholders.

To Our Stakeholders
In fiscal 2018, the JXTG Group marked the second year since its business integration. Our earnings in our first fiscal year after the business integration greatly exceeded the previous year, demonstrating that we are off to an extreme- ly strong start.
The business climate surrounding the Group is expected to become increas- ingly more challenging given the structural decline in fuel oil demand in Japan, more intense competition in global markets, and volatility in commodity prices, among other factors. Moreover, the rapid wave of digitalization and innovation driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating various changes in our lives and in business. There are also movements to form a low-carbon or carbon-free society internationally as evidenced by the Paris Agreement and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations. With operations in energy, resources and materials, this means that the roles and responsibilities of the Group will continue to grow ever larger in the future.
Amidst this business climate, the Group is committed to fulfilling its social mission of delivering a stable supply of energy, resources and materials. We are also working toward sustainable growth with an eye on addressing head-on the challenges we face in the areas of environment, society and governance (ESG).
Taking the SDGs and ESG into consideration, the Group established the new JXTG Group Philosophy following the business integration. This Group Philoso- phy consists of Our Mission and Our Five Core Values, and it represents our commitment to achieve sustainable development and a vibrant future by achiev- ing a balance between social value and economic value.
The world is undergoing major changes. Now is the time for the Group to transform itself and take on new challenges, with the aim of developing into one of the most prominent and internationally competitive comprehensive energy, resource, and material company groups in Asia.

   Message from the President
Part II Part III
The JXTG Group and Sustainability JXTG Group Business Strategy
We are speeding up business reforms while deepening trust and encouraging dialogue aimed at the realization of sustainable growth.
Tsutomu Sugimori
Representative Director, President JXTG Holdings, Inc.
Q1 About one year has passed since the business integration. How was the past year? What are your ambitions as the new president?
A1 We got off to a strong start in the first fiscal year since the business integration thanks to a positive business climate. We will continue to push ahead with reforms with a sense of urgency.
Furthermore, it is vital that we promote and thoroughly spread the JXTG Group Philosophy, established at the time of the business integration. To date, we have proactively worked to promote the Group Philosophy and survey results
indicate that more than 80% of the Group’s employees comprehend and identify with it. The next big theme will be how each and every employee can implement the Group Philosophy in actual business activities.
  The business climate in fiscal 2017 was relatively good and we saw strong market conditions for Japan’s petroleum products market. In addition, the many efforts of Group companies aimed at the early realization of business integration synergies contributed greatly to our success. As a result, we marked a strong start to the first fiscal year since the business integration.
Of course, this business climate will not remain in place forever and undoubtedly there will be even greater change coming our way in the future. Under these conditions, for the JXTG Group to achieve sustainable growth, we must transform ourselves with an idea of the changes set to take place in the business climate. Dialogue is important for realiz-
ing these reforms. Through dialogue, we will be able to enhance mutual understanding and trust, which will make it possible for everyone at the JXTG Group to come together to take on new challenges.
To accelerate reforms, I made two calls to action after becoming president. The first was “listen to proposals and take the lead in new endeavors instead of simply doing things as they have always been done” and the second was “make decisions with a sense of urgency, without excessive documen- tation or laying unnecessary groundwork.” We are encouraging reforms across the entire Group by having management take the lead in implementing these calls to action.
Q2 FY2017 was the first year of your medium-term management plan. How was progress under “enhancing profitability of the core businesses,” one of the pillars of the plan?
A2 We moved ahead with the integration and optimization of operations from manufacturing to sales and achieved integration effects well in excess of the plan.

which helped us achieve major advances in production efficiency and energy conservation. The Supply Division also achieved great results thanks to its optimization of product imports/exports and transfers between refineries, along with the optimization of crude oil selection and fleet optimization.

  Message from the President
Additionally, we decided to suspend production at the Muroran Plant as part of our broader effort to rebuild our supply chain for petroleum and petrochemical products. As a result, we have taken a step forward in building more efficient and competitive production and supply systems. Furthermore, we began evaluating joint operations of the Marifu Refinery with Petrolimex, which has about a 50% share of the petroleum sales market in Vietnam. If this comes to fruition, we will be able to effectively utilize our existing facilities to promote exports to Vietnam, a growth market. In Vietnam, service stations are mainly operated for two-wheeled vehicles, but in the future the country will need to transform its sales network to service stations for
four-wheeled vehicles to cope with the spread of automo- biles. With Petrolimex as our partner, we hope to establish a business footprint in the Asia’s growth market by participat- ing in the development of this kind of service infrastructure.
Meanwhile, in the Sales Division in Japan, we decided to adopt the ENEOS brand name across our entire nationwide service station network, and unified sales measures including the wholesale price system. In this manner, we achieved robust integration effects by fully integrating operations from manufacturing to supply and sales. Looking ahead, we will continue to promptly realize and maximize integration syner- gy effects.

tions, while beginning production at Layang oil and gas field in Malaysia and Hail oil field in Abu Dhabi. In fiscal 2018, we will make steady progress with projects under development, including those in Malaysia and the UK’s area of development in the North Sea. Meanwhile, in the United States, the CO2-EOR project is currently underway. With this project, CO2 from the exhaust gas of thermal power plants is injected into old, depleted oil fields to increase crude oil production. As of February 2018, this project had recovered a cumulative total of over 1.2 million tons, contributing to environmental impact mitigation and an increase in crude oil production.
In the Metals business, we were forced to post an impair- ment loss of 128.6 billion yen in fiscal 2017 due to changes made to the long-term production plan for Caserones Copper Mine in Chile. We expect the business to return to the black in the second half of fiscal 2018 thanks to thorough cost
management and the stabilization of operations. At the same time, we established the Caserones Business Department to manage operations, costs and capital in a more flexible and centralized manner.
We are focusing on expanding our electronic materials business given growing demand for electronic components and devices owing to the spread of IoT and AI technologies. In fiscal 2017, JX Nippon Mining & Metals reached an agree- ment to acquire the tantalum and niobium division of H.C. Starck GmbH of Germany, and we plan to make quick strides in generating synergies through the steady implementation of the integration plan for fiscal 2018 and beyond. Looking ahead, we will use not only in-house development, but also M&A, Group collaboration, and corporate venture capital (CVC), among other means, to create high added-value technology-driven businesses.

In fiscal 2017, we generated free cash flows in excess of the plan thanks to robust operating income, carefully selected capital expenditures, and asset disposals carried out ahead of schedule. Specifically, we sold our interest in an oil sand
project in Canada and exchanged interests in a copper mine, we sold an office building, and made great progress toward the optimization of our business portfolio. In addition, we continued to sell cross-shareholdings.
At the same time, we made steady progress with the development and reinforcement of businesses that will serve as future pillars of our business portfolio. This includes acquiring H.C. Starck Tantalum and Niobium GmbH of Germany as I noted earlier and entering into the residential gas retailing business.
To enhance capital efficiency, we have made efforts to manage return on invested capital (ROIC) in a better and closer manner than before. We worked to boost earnings power and make improvements in asset efficiency and turnover. In particular, the Group’s businesses are truly wide ranging, which makes it important to thoroughly manage ROIC and check asset efficiency for each individual business division.

We pushed ahead with selection and concentration of businesses and prioritized the allocation of management resources in growth domains and fields where we can harness our strengths.
In the Oil and Natural Gas Exploration & Production business, we prioritized the allocation of management resources in regions and technical fields where we can capitalize on our strengths, under the basic policies of “thoroughly implement-

Q6 How do you view the risks and opportunities for the JXTG Group to achieve sustainable growth?
Climate change is one of our greatest risks, yet it also presents major growth opportunities, such as the electricity business powered by renewable energy.
Meanwhile, we are building an ERP system with rollout planned for January 2020 as part of our measures to reinforce our management foundation. Migrating to this new system will enable us to visualize management and find ways to standardize and streamline our operations. Furthermore, we will formulate the JXTG Group Basic Regulations for Internal Control and will introduce them in our business divisions. Following these rules, each division will implement risk management using the PDCA cycle.
Human resources development, too, is an important theme for the future. We will formulate a Basic Policy on Human Resources Development and step up develop- ment of human resources with high standards of ethics
and a passion for tackling new challenges. In terms of
developing the management leaders of tomorrow, the
Human Resources Development Council plans to take the
lead in selecting candidates and providing concentrated A6 training and education. The development of global human
 resources is also critical. For example, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy has made changes to its overseas training system to extend stays so that participants can master not only the language, but also fully immerse themselves in the local culture and society as well. JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy has also shortened its job rotation cycle from three to two years so that employees can gain overseas work experience while in their 20s.
I believe that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to our company. As climate change worsens, gasoline demand will contract if the growth of electric vehicles picks up steam. Fluctuations in gasoline demand will have a major impact on the production balance of various other petro- leum products, including naphtha and other fuel oils. At the same time, a stricter sulfur cap on marine fuels, set by the IMO, will take effect in 2020. This means we will need to change over to fuel oils compliant with this regulation.
Furthermore, it will also be important to achieve safe and stable operations by thoroughly managing safety-related risks. If an incident were to occur, it could not only impact earnings, but also pose a major threat to human life and the environment. Starting in the first fiscal year since the business integration, we introduced an operations management system, facility reliability management system and quality management system at all of our refineries and plants. We are now further improving these systems so as to thoroughly reduce occupational injuries and operational issues.
Seen from a different perspective, climate change can also be viewed as a major growth opportunity. If demand for fossil fuels declines, demand for clean energy such as renew-
able energy will grow. Japan’s new Fifth Basic Energy Plan, recently approved by the Cabinet, includes a policy to make renewable energy a primary source of electricity by 2030. We already operate a wide-ranging renewable energy business* portfolio that includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass power. Renewable energy is vital to the reinforcement and expansion of our electricity business, which we consider to be a business that will be a mainstay of the future. Looking ahead, we will expand this business in earnest, with a focus on areas where we can harness our strengths, while taking into account government policy and technology trends.
Additionally, the growth and spread of digital technologies such as IoT and AI will increase demand for electronic components and device products, which I see as a major growth opportunity for our electronic materials business.
*See the Special Feature on page 36 for more information about the Group’s renewable energy business
 Q5 What are your thoughts on returning profits to shareholders?
A5 We will strive to return even more profits to shareholders based on a stable dividend provided over the medium to long term.
The Group recognizes that returning profits to shareholders is an important management task and strives to continually provide a stable dividend reflecting trends and the outlook for consolidated business performance over the medium to long term. We aim to return even more profits to shareholders by increasing dividends or buying back shares, based on the progress of achieving management targets.
We offered a dividend of 19 yen per share for fiscal 2017, an increase of 3 yen compared to fiscal 2016, and we completed share buybacks of up to 30 billion yen, thanks to operating income and free cash flow greatly exceeding the first-year targets of the medium-term management plan.
We plan to offer a dividend of 20 yen per share for fiscal 2018, or 1 yen higher than this year’s 19 yen per share.

      Q8 The some have pointed out importance of “invisible capital (non-financial capital)” in achieving sustainable growth. What are your thoughts?
A8 We will foster an organizational culture that embraces diversity in order to maximize the potential of our human resources, which is one of the most important forms of non-financial capital.
Human resources is perhaps the most important form of non-financial capital. In particular, with Japan facing a declin- ing working population, it will be important to establish a system for finding and retaining talent over the long term. This will involve not only human resources development, but also actively promoting diversity management that encourages women and seniors to play an active role and that hires and appoints global human resources. To get the most out of the individual skills and characteristics of this diverse workforce, I believe it is critical to enhance mutual understanding and trust through dialogue and create an organization that is open and embraces diversity.
We will steadily implement the medium-term management plan and focus on strengthening our earnings and financial foundation while maximizing our ability
to generate cash flows.

 Performance Overview of Fiscal 2017
 23 JXTG Holdings, Inc. | JXTG REPORT Integrated Report 2018
JXTG Holdings, Inc. | JXTG REPORT Integrated Report 2018 24
We achieved significantly higher profits due to improved petroleum product margins and integration synergy effects
Looking at the Group’s operating environment in fiscal 2017, the price of crude oil climbed higher because of coordinated output cuts by oil-producing countries and concerns of geopolitical risks caused by political uncertainty in the Middle East. Key factors driving the increase in the price of copper included strong growth in the economy of China, the world’s largest consumer of copper, and expectations for rising demand driven by the spread of electric vehicles (EV) around the world.
On a consolidated basis, in fiscal 2017 the Group recorded net sales of 10.3 trillion yen, up 1.5 trillion yen over the previous year*, and a major uptick in operating income which totaled
Maximizing Our Ability to Generate Cash Flows
487.5 billion yen, up 113.5 billion yen over the previous year*. Operating income excluding inventory valuations totaled 372.6 billion yen, up 188.1 billion yen over the previous year*, and net income attributable to owners of the parent came in at 361.9 billion yen, up 149.1 billion yen over the previous year*. These positive results are attributed to strong commodity market conditions, along with improved petroleum product margins and integration synergy effects, which offset the impairment loss booked for the Caserones Copper Mine.
*The previous fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017) represents the combined total of JX Holdings and TonenGeneral Sekiyu for the period from April 2016 to March 2017.
 We boosted our ability to generate cash flows by increasing profits and asset disposals
With “focusing on cash flows and capital efficiency” as one of the three pillars of the medium-term management plan, the Group is working to generate a cumulative total of 500 billion
yen in free cash flow during the three-year period of the medium-term management plan. Aimed at reaching this goal, in fiscal 2017 we boosted profits through the strategies of

  Message from the Director Responsible for Finance & Investor Relations Department
each business, including creation of integration synergies, and we actively carried out asset disposals. For example, we worked to optimize our business portfolio by selling our cell culture material business, our oil sands business in Canada, our interest in the Collahuasi Mine to another party, and the Shin-Nisseki Building in Tokyo, among others. We also moved ahead with the sale of cross-shareholdings as well. As a result, our free cash flow for fiscal 2017 reached 481.3 billion yen excluding the effect of excise tax payment timing (612 billion yen when including the effect of excise tax payment timing), indicating that we are making solid progress under the plan.
In terms of capital expenditures during the medium-term
management plan, we will establish and implement rigorous investment criteria, while narrowing the focus of investments and reining in the total amount of investment. The amount of invest- ment during the three years of the medium-term management plan will be limited to the total of depreciation and amortization and the amount of asset disposals. This will limit investment to about 70% of the total amount of investment over the three years from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2015. Under this policy, we held the total amount of investment in fiscal 2017 to 308.8 billion yen, within the planned amount. Going forward, we will strengthen our earnings and financial foundation and carry out only rigorously selected investments aimed at achieving the plan.

Outlook for Fiscal 2018
     The consolidated earnings forecast for fiscal 2018 includes net sales of 10.7 trillion yen, an increase of 398.9 billion yen; operating income of 490 billion yen, an increase of 2.5 billion yen; operating income, excluding inventory valuation, of 490 billion yen, an increase of 117.4 billion yen; and profit attribut- able to owners of the parent of 310 billion yen, a decrease of 51.9 billion yen.
In fiscal 2018, we will look to further boost profits by
maximizing and quickly realizing integration synergies in our Energy business and improving profits of the Case- rones Copper Mine in our Metals business, aimed at reaching each target laid out in the medium-term manage- ment plan as early as possible. At the same time, we will focus on maximizing cash flows by thoroughly managing inventory levels and carrying out asset disposals, among other initiatives.

Development of
a low-carbon society
Energy conservation at Group production sites
Relevant SDGs
  The JXTG Group consumes large quantities of energy at its refiner- ies, smelters and plants. Therefore, we consider improving energy efficiency at these sites to be of the utmost importance. To this end, we are implementing energy conservation activities and working to reduce CO2 emissions caused by energy usage.
Large investments in energy conservation
at refineries
At the Chiba Refinery, we introduced energy-efficient distillation
tower technology developed overseas and not yet extensively
used in Japan in order to extract xylene from gasoline. Typically,
two distillation towers are needed when modifying a facility for the
purpose of extracting xylene, but this technology enables two-tow-
er distillation in a single tower. As a result, we were able to reduce
both energy costs and construction costs by around 20% and
produce more added value in our products. (thousands of t-CO2)
Factories
Metals
Upgrade of oxygen production equipment to
the latest energy-efficient model
At the Tamano Smelter of Hibi Kyodo Smelting, we replaced five units of aging oxygen production equipment with a single larger and latest energy-efficient model. As a result, we reduced energy use per ton of copper ingot production volume by about 15% compared to the old equipment.
Use of solar power generation
receive imports. We are also building the Kushiro LNG Terminal in Hokkaido. Our sales volume of LNG totaled 936,000 tons in fiscal 2017, a 2.4% increase over the previous year.
In October 2017, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, Osaka Gas and TEPCO Fuel & Power jointly established Ohgishima City Gas Supply Co., Ltd. in Kawasaki City. Through this company, which manufactures and supplies city gas, we seek expansion in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area of our supply business for city gas using LNG as feedstock.

Supplying materials that reduce impacts on people and the environment
The JXTG Group develops and sells a residential heat storage material made primarily from paraffin. During the winter, this heat storage material retains the heat of the sun during the day and releases it at night, reducing the use of energy needed for heating homes. In Japan, where a large percentage of homes are made from wood, which is susceptible to heat loss, use of this heat storage material is expected to be effective in conserving energy.
Contributing to energy conservation through
the supply of lubricants
The JXTG Group sells the ENEOS Fleet and ENEOS Industrial series of lubricants developed with the environment, energy conservation, safety and long service life in mind. These products offer high-performance lubrication for customers’ automobiles, marine vessels, and industrial equipment while also contributing to energy conservation.
    Tatsuta Electric Wire and Cable’s Tatsuta Technical Center and JX Metals Precision Technology’s Kakegawa Works are working to conserve energy through the use of solar power generation.

The JXTG Group has been operating mega solar power plants using its idle lands since fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2016, operations began at mega solar power plants constructed at Nihonkai Oil in Toyama Prefecture, at the former site of the Fukui Oil Depot in Fukui Prefecture, and at the former site of Gamagori Gas Terminal in Aichi Prefecture. As a result, we now operate 17 mega solar power plants with a generating capacity of about 43 megawatts. We also operate power plants using other forms of renewable energy, such as biomass, hydroelectricity, and wind power. Looking ahead, we will efficiently convert the most optimal energy to meet the needs of customers as we look to expand our renew- able energy business even further.

  Supplying environmentally friendly products
  The JXTG Group is pursuing a low-environmental-impact Energy business involving the development and sale of environmentally friendly products alongside the supply and use of LNG, hydrogen and renewable energy, in order to reduce CO2 emissions not only from its own production sites, but throughout society as well.
 Expansion of natural gas business capable of stable supply with low environmental impact
LNG is a clean source of energy that produces little in the way of CO2 emissions when burned and results in lower emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which are causes of air pollution. There are vast quantities of natural gas in the world today, with proven reserves estimated at around 50 years*. Natural gas producing countries are also located around the world, ensuring access to stable supplies.
Since the year 2000, the JXTG Group has actively expanded its presence in overseas natural gas development projects, includ- ing those in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia, among other countries. At the same time, we have developed a natural gas supply system in Japan, which included building the Mizushi- ma LNG Terminal in Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture in 2006 and the satellite Hachinohe LNG Terminal in Hachinohe City, Aomori Prefecture in 2017. Later, in 2015, the Hachinohe facility was expanded into a full-scale terminal with greater capacity to

Establishment of new joint venture to promote
a positive cycle of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen stations
The JXTG Group is promoting the spread of fuel cell vehicles, which do not produce CO2 emissions. As part of these efforts, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy established Japan H2 mobility, LLC (JHyM) jointly with 11 other companies, including infrastructure businesses and automakers. This all-Japan consortium centered on 10 companies will join forces in promoting the strategic development and efficient operations of hydrogen stations, taking into account the many challenges facing the hydrogen station business during the early stages of fuel cell vehicle growth. We will now work toward the goal of creating a positive cycle of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen stations in which user convenience is improved to promote the spread of fuel cell vehicles and the development of hydrogen stations.


Reducing environmental impacts with technology
Recycling of waste material
The JXTG Group endeavors to recycle the waste it generates using the most appropriate means for each material. The main items we recycle are as follows.
Sludge Sludge produced during wastewater treatment is mainly recycled as a raw material for cement following dehydra- tion and desiccation.
Waste acid (sulfuric acid waste) Sulfuric acid used in the manufacture of high octane gasoline is recycled by a recovery and processing company.
Collected dust Dust from exhaust gas is collected using an electric dust collector and recycled as a raw material for cement.
Controlling VOC emissions
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are thought to cause photo- chemical oxidants formed by photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ultraviolet rays.
By fiscal 2010, the JXTG Group had established emission control measures above the government reduction standard for oil industry, and since then we have made proactive efforts to recover VOCs. As a result, in fiscal 2017 we reduced our VOC emissions over 50% compared to fiscal 2000.
At times, dust may be recycled as material for roadbed after thermal recycling.
Waste catalysts Catalysts used in the desulfurization of petroleum ultimately become waste catalysts as they lose their activity. Valuable metals such as vanadium and molybdenum contained in disposable catalysts are recovered as much as possible by a metal recovery and processing company.
Waste asbestos Thermal insulation containing asbestos used in the repair of equipment is detoxified via a melting process at JX Nippon Environmental Services and recycled as roadbed material, etc.
VOC Emissions at Refineries, Oil Depots and Other Facilities
Development of
a recycling-oriented society
Relevant SDGs
        Increasing crude oil production and reducing CO2 emissions with CO2-EOR technology CO2-EOR is a technology in which CO2 is injected into aging oil fields to boost the recovery rate of crude oil, while the CO2 is immobilized underground, reducing emissions into the air.
The JXTG Group is operating a project using this technology on the outskirts of Houston in the US state of Texas. In December 2016, the plant used for recovery of CO2 from a thermal power plant was completed. As of February 2018, the project had recovered a cumulative total of 1.2 million tons of CO2, which is being injected into an oil field 130 km away.
Developing asphalt pavement that helps to increase vehicle fuel efficiency
NIPPO, through a joint research project with the Public Works Research Institute, developed a fuel-efficient asphalt pavement called Energy Save Pervious that increases the fuel efficiency of vehicles. In this pavement, the aggregate is arranged densely and smoothly, which is expected to help reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles by reducing the roll resistance of tires, thereby increasing fuel efficiency.
This pavement contains moderate gaps and texture depth, which helps to promote water drainage, prevent pooling, reduce road noise, reduce skidding, and improve visibility at night and in the rain.

Recycling and environmental services business
The JXTG Group has integrated operations ranging from resource development of non-ferrous metals to metal smelting, electronic materials, and recycling and environmental services. Our recycling and environmental services business consists of environmental services for detoxifying industrial waste and the recycling of materials containing non-ferrous metals into valuable metals. We contribute significantly to the development of a sustainable, recycling-oriented society by utilizing the key features and strengths of this business— zero net emissions, proprietary treatment processes based on smelting and refining technologies, and a global collection network.

Stable supply of energy, resources and materials and effective use of resources
Achieving stable operations and a stable supply
The JXTG Group's mission is to provide a stable supply of energy, resources, and materials for businesses and everyday living. In order to ensure stable operations and a stable supply at our refineries and plants, we implement measures for disaster preven- tion and reduction in preparation for possible incidents and disasters including earthquakes and fires.
Utilizing lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy has developed a business continuity plan (BCP) that encompasses the entire supply chain. With this BCP, the company was able to promptly respond in the wake of the April 2016 Kumamoto earthquake by focusing on the dispatch of tank trucks to the affected areas. In addition, since fiscal 2012, we have established disaster-resistant service stations, which we plan to expand to 130 locations by the end of fiscal 2018.

Adapting to digitalization
Advancements in digitalization have brought about major changes in our world. As a result, we have positioned the digitalization of business operations as an important issue to address from multiple angles under the Group's ongoing review of its Long-Term Vision. Furthermore, "transforming business processes focused on the arrival of an IoT society" is listed as one of the focus areas under strengthening the business foundation in the medium-term management plan. To this end, we are developing a cutting-edge integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Each Group company is implementing digitalization in various ways, including streamlining of business operations using robotic process automation (RPA), as well as in their plant and distribution operations, communications with customers, and workstyle innovations. For instance, JX Nippon Mining & Metals has launched the IoT & AI Promotion Project, which promotes an advanced level of quality management and preventive mainte- nance at plants utilizing sensing technology. In addition, the JXTG
Group contributes to the development of a recycling-oriented society through the provision of electronic materials supporting digitalization.

What are your thoughts about the role that the JXTG Group should play in society?
In recent years, there has been a rapidly growing interest in the social aspects of companies, owing to the worldwide spotlight on the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nowadays, companies not only have to make profits and return them to the stakeholders, but they are also expected to contribute to the solutions for a multitude of social issues through their business activities. The JXTG Group in particular must fulfill the major role of addressing environmental and climate change issues more so than other industries as we are broadly engaged in the energy business, which includes fossil fuels.
Since I was elected outside director, I have visited a number of resource development sites including offshore gas fields in Southeast Asia and copper mines in Chile, and it dawned on me just how quickly people of the modern era can extract and consume these precious natural resources that took eons to form deep underground. I feel it is import- ant to seriously consider social issues, including climate change, with respect to the future of the planet and its people while realizing the weight of our responsibility.
How would you rate the JXTG Group’s current initiatives in response to climate change?
The JXTG Group has recently gained a greater appreciation for climate change as a real issue and is in the process of enhancing specific initiatives to address it. While fossil fuels such as petroleum and natural gas play pivotal roles in energy demand and form a major pillar of our operations, the JXTG Group is implementing a variety of policies to minimize impacts on climate change through its business activities. For example, we inject CO2 emissions from a thermal power plant in the United States into an oil field to
achieve both a lower environmental impact and increase crude oil production volume. In fiscal 2017, we established the medium-term management plan, which contains a reduction target for CO2 emissions. We are also stepping up efforts in our recycling and environmental services business. Furthermore, the Renewable Energy Business Strategy Office was established to examine basic strate- gies on the future of the renewable energy business. As discussed above, I would rate the JXTG Group highly for its efforts in providing a stable supply of energy while taking tangible steps in environmental initiatives that can be implemented today.
What are priority issues to address going forward in order to realize a sustainable society?
Going forward, rather than focusing on short- and medium-term efforts, we need to transform our business structure with a longer-term vision in mind. While this is a very challenging topic, it is important to broaden discus- sions on the resources, energy and materials industries 10 and 20 years in the future and the JXTG Group’s vision for itself, while at the same time continuing to pursue a self-transformation aimed at the achievement of this vision. The role of the JXTG Group as a leading company in resources, energy, and raw materials is to develop a new business model that can contribute to a sustainable society by undertaking pioneering challenges. As an outside director, I will continue my role in supporting the execution of management strategies and contributing to enhanced corporate value over the medium to long term. I hope to play a role in the JXTG Group shining not only in Japan, but also in Asia and the world, so that it may be regarded as a truly indispensable company.

JXTG Holdings and its three core operating companies were recognized as certified health and productivity management organizations (White 500) for our excellent track record in health and productivity management following an assessment conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in February 2018.
The JXTG Group considers health to be of the same importance as safety and the environment, declaring in our Group Philosophy, “We give the highest priority to health, safety and environmental initiatives, which are vital to the well-being of all living things.” Health enhancement also forms part of the JXTG Group Code of Conduct, which declares, “Health is the core element of our business continuity and development. We take active measures to maintain and enhance the mental and physical health of individuals employed by our group companies.” This forms the basis of our health and productivity management.
 JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy’s Kawasaki Refinery and Sakai Refinery were the first and second businesses to be certified under the new certification regime for the High Pressure Gas Safety Act in December 2017 and February 2018, respectively. This certification, established by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, is awarded to refineries that satisfy certain criteria for such areas as advanced safety activities and operational support systems. As a certified business, we will continue to implement high-quality safety activities with the goal of raising the bar of our safety practices even further.

About the JXTG Group
Human Resource Development
Basic Approach
The JXTG Group believes that an important challenge in the achievement of our growth strategy in a rapidly changing business environment is the development of creative, innovative human resources who can take on challenges on a global scale. Based on this belief, we have established three areas as part of the JXTG Group Basic Policy on Human Resources Development.
Part III
JXTG Group Business Strategy
  Respect for Human Rights
Basic Approach
The JXTG Group believes that an important element in striving for sustainable development as a corporation is respect for the human rights of our employees and all stakeholders, and the mitigation of human rights-related risks in our business activities. Based on this understanding, we support international norms such as the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour
Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work*. We have also stipulated such norms in the JXTG Group Code of Conduct, and are promoting initiatives aimed at resolving various human rights issues.
*This declaration calls for freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation
Under this policy, the JXTG Group has established consistent systems for each phase of human resource development, including recruitment, assignment, assessment, promotion, and training. Additionally, we develop employees using on-the-job and off-the-job training based on each individual’s aptitude. We are enhancing the collective strengths of the Group by actively promoting development suited to individual aptitude across all domains.
   JXTG Group Code of Conduct (excerpt)

(2) We shall not engage in any type of discrimination or harassment.
(3) We shall not engage in any forms of forced labor or child labor.
(4) We shall not engage in business transactions which may lead to the prolongation of conflicts, human rights violations, or inhumane acts.
 JXTG Group Basic Policy on Human Resources Development
● We will continuously and systematically develop human resources to secure talent capable of tackling challenges globally with the spirit of creativity and innovation.
● We will develop human resources who will help us enhance corporate value over the medium to long term in order to strengthen our management foundation.
● We will establish systems for actively supporting employees looking to grow independently by promoting diverse develop- ment and growth tailored to each employee’s aptitude.
 Implementation System
The Human Rights Promotion and Human Resource Development Committee, established under the JXTG Group CSR Council, is responsible for deliberating on the policy and direction of Group-wide approaches to human rights, checking and evaluating the activities of Group companies, and sharing information. The committee also implements various measures on respect for human rights as
Major Initiatives

JXTG Holdings, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration and JX Nippon Mining & Metals support the UN Global Compact and strive to realize the 10 principles and 4 areas, including human rights.
●Human Rights Due Diligence
The JX Nippon Mining & Metals Group is committed to ensuring respect for human rights, and has established the JX Nippon Mining & Metals Group Compliance Regulations to explicitly document human rights policies, including those for the prevention
stipulated in the JXTG Group Code of Conduct, including raising awareness of human rights based on the business characteristics of each Group company and working on human rights due diligence.
Information on the initiatives of Group companies is shared at the committee’s liaison meeting convened quarterly and in turn this information is used for the improvement of relevant activities.
of discrimination, harassment, child labor and forced labor.
Once a year, the Group also conducts checks to ensure that no child labor or forced labor is being used in connection with its business operations. It also surveys its business partners to gain
written confirmation that these forms of labor are not being used.
●Preventing Harassment
As well as providing various forms of training designed to prevent harassment, we have established consultation centers at each Group company to receive reports and complaints about harassment.
Executive Talent Management
To ensure we can always respond to the rapid changes in the future management environment, it is important to develop candidates for senior management positions who will determine the company’s direction and lead us forward.
JXTG Holdings and its core operating companies have decided to use a more systematic and strategic approach to the
development of candidates for senior management positions, which is considered a common issue for each company. We will now search for truly qualified management candidates from a wide range of domains and develop them so that they can fully harness their skills as the senior management of the future.

Work-Life Management
Basic Approach
The JXTG Group aims to reduce total annual working hours and encourage the taking of annual paid leave to increase the motiva- tion and creativity of each and every employee, and enable them to maximize their abilities. Our basic approach is outlined below. ●To allow adequate time for each and every employee to achieve

 Corporate Governance
Part I
About the JXTG Group
Basic Policy on Corporate Governance
In order to achieve sustainable growth and increase the JXTG Group’s corporate value over the medium to long term, the Company established the Basic Policy on Corporate Governance of the JXTG Group, with the objective of establishing and operating a corporate governance framework for the conduct of transparent, fair, timely, and decisive decision-making in the Group’s manage- ment. This policy describes systematically and comprehensively the Group’s basic approach to corporate governance as well as its establishment and operation, taking into consideration the Corpo- rate Governance Code created by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This basic policy is published on the JXTG Holdings website as our commitment to all stakeholders, including shareholders of JXTG Holdings along with JXTG Group customers, business partners and employees, and the local communities where we operate. JXTG Group Basic Policy on Corporate Governance
(Available in Japanese only.)
WEB https://www.hd.jxtg-group.co.jp/company/system/pdf/ governance01.pdf
Basic Approach to Corporate Governance
By appropriately establishing and operating corporate governance, the JXTG Group works to realize the JXTG Group Philosophy, to achieve sustained growth, and to increase corporate value over the medium to long term. Based on this recognition, the Company establishes and operates the corporate governance of the Group as follows.
Basic Principles on the Establishment and Operation of Corporate Governance
1. Role of each company in the holding company structure
The JXTG Group is a group of companies whose core business consists of three business fields: the Energy business, the Oil and Natural Gas E&P business and the Metals business. In view of the fact that these three businesses are so distinct, the JXTG Group has established a structure under which the Company serves as a holding company and the three core operating companies, which promote each core business, are placed thereunder. Under this structure, in light of optimizing the value of the JXTG Group as a whole, the Company takes charge of formulating management policies including the JXTG Group Philosophy, JXTG Group Code of Conduct, and the medium-term manage- ment plan and budget (hereinafter, “basic management policies”), allocating management resources, and overseeing the manage- ment of each core operating company. In turn, each core operat- ing company shall agilely execute the business activities in accordance with the basic management policies.
2. Institutional design
The Company is a company with an audit and supervisory committee.
3. Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of the Company consists of the chairman, the president, more than one full-time director, part-time
Part III
JXTG Group Business Strategy
directors concurrently serving as the presidents of the core operating companies, and outside directors. The Board of Directors is operated pursuant to the policy below:
(1) The Board of Directors will focus on deliberation/determina- tion of basic management policies, and the supervision of business execution;
(2) Certain decisions on the execution of material operations will be delegated to the president of the Company in order to improve the agility of business execution; and
(3) With respect to material matters related to the investment return evaluations for important business execution projects for the Company and core operating companies along with risks and progress, the president of the Company and the presidents of the core operating companies will submit reports, which will be verified for consistency with the basic management policies and then supervised.
4. Audit and Supervisory Committee
(1) The Audit and Supervisory Committee of the Company will carry
out organized and systematic audits with high efficiency and objectivity through appropriate collaboration between full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members, who possess powerful information-gathering skill, and outside directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members, who possess strong independence along with a wealth of knowledge and experience; and
(2) The Audit and Supervisory Committee of the Company will supervise business execution by means of each director who is an Audit and Supervisory Committee member exercising their voting rights at meetings of the Board of Directors and by means of each director who is not an Audit and Supervisory Committee member exercising their right to voice their opinion concerning personnel and compensation matters.
5. Outside directors
To take advantage of the wealth of knowledge and experience of outside directors and to ensure transparency and objectivity in decision-making, the Company shall take the following measures:
(1) In determining the basic management policies at meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company, request outside directors to be involved from the stage of consideration, and to fully discuss it from multiple points of view; and in decision-making on the execution of material operations as well as supervision of execution of material operations, fully verify consistency with the basic management policies, taking opinions of outside directors into account; and
(2) In determining personnel affairs and compensation of directors at meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company, ensure transparency of the decision-making process by consulting with the Nomination Advisory Committee and the Compensation Advisory Committee, half of whose members are outside directors, and which are chaired by an outside director.
6. Executive officers and Executive Council
(1) The Company will appoint executive officers as an institution for
the agile execution of operations pursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors.

          Transition to a Company with an Audit and Supervisory Committee
The Company transitioned to a company with an audit and super- visory committee effective June 27, 2018, with the aim of further strengthening the management functions (deliberation and determination of basic management policies) and supervisory functions of the Board of Directors, as well as to further improve
the agility of the execution of operations. Through this transition, the Company will promote the separation of management and supervision from the execution of operations, and strive to further enhance corporate governance.

 Corporate Governance
(2) For the determination of business execution by the president as president and executive officer, the Company has established the Executive Council as the institution for discussing matters approved by the president. The Executive Council, comprising the chairman of the Board of Directors, president and executive officer, executive vice president and executive officer, managing executive officers appointed by the president, and the presidents of core operating companies, make decisions based on prudent deliberations.
(3) Full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members will attend meetings of the Executive Council to understand the process for making important decisions and the status of business execu- tion, and share these with other Audit and Supervisory Commit- tee members.
7. Governance framework of core operating companies
(1) Each core operating company is a company with a board of corporate auditors. Each core operating company has a board of directors as a mechanism enabling directors to fully exhibit mutual supervision functions, and each core operating company will independently carry out sufficient analysis of risks and verification of
consistency with basic management policies. In addition, full-time Audit and Supervisory Committee members of the Company will be dispatched as part-time corporate auditors of each core operating company to perform audits on the execution of duties by directors of core operating companies.
(2) With respect to decision-making related to important business execution of core operating companies (including important business execution projects under the control of the core operating companies), after the decision by the Board of Directors of the core operating company, in principle, the matter must be decided on or reported to the Board of Directors of the Company. With respect to other business execution of the core operating companies, execution will be entrusted to each core operating company within the scope of the basic management policies and management resource allocation determined by the Company, and these matters shall be approved by the president of the core operating company after deliberation by the Executive Council of the core operating company.
Support System for Outside Directors
Each of the three outside directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Board members and the three outside directors who are Audit and Supervisory Board members meet the independence standards based on the rules of the Tokyo and Nagoya stock exchanges on which the Company is listed. The Company sends materials regarding the agenda of meetings of the Board of Directors to the outside directors, in principle, three days before the meeting, and the Compa- ny provides explanations to the outside directors about important agenda items before the meeting. Furthermore, to enhance the auditing function by all Audit and Supervisory Committee members, including outside directors, the Company has established the Auditors Affairs Office, which is clearly independent from the chain of command for divisions responsible for business execution (including personnel evaluations). Full-time staff members have been assigned to the office to assist with the duties of the Audit and Supervisory Committee members. Moreover, to support the outside directors that are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members in business execution, the Board Members Support Office has been established, and full-time staff members have been assigned.

characteristics as high standards of business ethics, a certain level
of specialist knowledge in legal affairs, finance and accounting, as
well as the ability to appropriately audit the execution of duties by
directors and the ability to appropriately supervise the execution of
business. A majority of these are independent outside directors.

 Nomination Advisory Committee
To ensure the transparency of the process of determining the director candidates of the Company, the Nomination Advisory Committee has been formed to provide advice to the Board of Directors. The Nomination Advisory Committee consists of three outside directors and three representative directors, and one of the outside directors on the committee acts as chairper- son. At meetings of the Nomination Advisory Committee, deliberations are held on the personnel matters of the Company’s director candidates, and reports are made to the Board of Directors on the results of these deliberations. In addition, opinions are exchanged on the issue of succession planning for the Company’s chairman and president and for the presidents of the core operating companies, and advice is received from the outside directors.
Compensation Advisory Committee
To ensure the transparency and objectivity of the process of determining the compensation and other benefits for directors and executive officers, the Compensation Advisory Committee has been formed to provide advice to the Board of Directors. The Compensation Advisory Committee comprises three outside directors and three representative directors, and one of the outside directors on the committee acts as chairperson. The Compensation Advisory Committee is responsible for deliberating the policies for determining the compensation and other benefits for directors and executive officers as well as other related matters. The results of the committee’s deliberations are reported to the Board of Directors.
 Overview of Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
From November to December 2017, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the entire Board of Directors. To conduct the evaluation, the Company employed an external consultant and a questionnaire and interviews were implemented for all directors and corporate auditors, including outside directors and corporate auditors. The results were analyzed and it was determined that improvements have been made in the provision of information to outside officers, which was cited as an issue last
year, and that the Board was generally evaluated as effective. Also, each director and corporate auditor praised the initiatives under- way since fiscal 2017 to improve operation of the Board of Directors, including ensuring enough time for deliberations.
On the other hand, directors and corporate auditors continued to point out certain issues, such as the roles of the holding compa- ny and the core operating companies, the organization of delibera- tion matters, and improved monitoring.

 Corporate Governance
Determination of Director and Corporate Audit Compensation
The upper limit of the total amount of compensation, etc., for the Company’s directors was decided, as follows, at the eighth Gener- al Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2018.
1. The amount of compensation for directors who are not Audit
and Supervisory Committee members shall be equal to or less than 1,100 million yen (including 200 million yen for outside directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members) per business year.
2. The amount of compensation for directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members shall be equal to or less than 200 million yen per business year.
In addition, in a separate framework from the above, at the eighth General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 27, 2018, it was decided to once again introduce a share compensation plan for the Company’s directors who are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members (excluding outside directors) and executive officers who do not serve concurrently as directors (hereinafter, “the Directors, etc.”). The upper limit of the plan is 600 million yen over a period of three fiscal years.
The compensation and other benefits of directors that are not Audit and Supervisory Committee members comprises the three components of fixed compensation paid monthly based on role, a bonus whose amount fluctuates based on performance, and share compensation where the Company’s shares are provided based on role. This is a balanced compensation system that reflects the Company’s business performance for the business year as well as stock value over the medium to long term in compensation amounts. The policy for determining this compensation and other benefits is determined by resolution of the Board of Directors after
deliberation and reporting to the Nomination Advisory Committee (comprising three outside directors and three representative directors; and chaired by an outside director). Compensation is paid out within the above maximum amount pursuant to this policy.
The compensation and other benefits of directors who are Audit and Supervisory Committee members comprise a fixed compensation amount from the perspective of the independence of their duties. Compensation is paid out within the above maximum amount pursuant to deliberations involving each director who is an Audit and Supervisory Committee member.
Introduction of Share Compensation Plan
The Company introduced a share compensation plan beginning in fiscal 2017. The share compensation plan adopts a mechanism called Board Incentive Plan Trust (BIP Trust). The plan covers the period of execution of the duties of the Directors, etc., over three fiscal years, from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2019, and entitles the Directors, etc., to the delivery of the Company’s shares based on their roles. Certain portions of such Company shares may be provided by cash equivalent to the value of the Company’s shares upon conversion.
The purpose of the introduction of this plan is to clarify the linkage between compensation of the Directors, etc., and the value of the Company’s shares; to further raise the incentive of the Directors, etc., to contribute to the enhancement of corporate value; to further increase awareness for shareholder-centered management; and to improve the medium-to-long-term corporate value of the JXTG Group.

Based on the JXTG Group Philosophy and in alignment with the Code of Conduct, the Company has established and operates an internal control system to ensure appropriate operations. The Board of Directors formulated the Basic Policy on Internal Control System, which addresses the operation of this system, and is monitoring the status of operation of this system.
The JXTG Group’s Basic Policy on Internal Control System is published on our website.
WEB https://www.hd.jxtg-group.co.jp/english/company/ system/pdf/policy.pdf
The Internal Control Department takes the lead in the assistance and general management for the development and operation of the JXTG Group’s internal control system. In particular, the department works on building and reinforcing internal control systems for general operations pursuant to the COSO framework, which has become a global standard on internal controls. Starting in fiscal 2018, an approach to internal controls following a risk-based PDCA cycle was rolled out and deployed at JXTG Holdings and JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy. Under this approach, each organization identifies and evaluates risks that will stand in the way of operations that must be carried out, formulates and implements appropriate controls based on the risks identified, and then regularly monitors these risks. We plan to roll out and deploy this same approach at other Group companies in the future.
Risks and Opportunities Concerning Climate Change
The Company recognizes that climate change is one form of risk posed to management strategy within ERM. Specifically, the Company faces risks related to the transition to a low-carbon society and the risks related to the physical impacts of climate change.
The JXTG Group maintains a diverse business portfolio that spans the fields of energy, resources and materials. Along with risks related to the transition to a low-carbon society, there are various business opportunities that can be gained from this transition as well, including in natural gas, electricity, renewable energy, function- al materials, and electronic materials, among others. In particular, the Company believes that development and strengthening of businesses that will be mainstays of the future as indicated in the medium-term management plan (overseas business, power and gas business, and technology-driving business) will help it to cope with the transition to a low-carbon society.

About the JXTG Group
Risk Management
The JXTG Group has introduced an enterprise risk management (ERM) system, through which it strives to share and visualize risk information that contributes to management decision making and the day-to-day execution of business operations.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
The Company established an office in charge of risk management within the Corporate Planning Department in April 2017, which has been working on the development and operation of an ERM system.
In fiscal 2017, based on the COSO* ERM framework, the Company comprehensively identified risks facing the JXTG Group with an eye on the current condition of the entire JXTG Group and future changes in the social and economic situation. Afterward, through interviews of managers and other means, we determined specific risk events that could affect the JXTG Group. After calculating the impact and probability of these risks according to assessment criteria, we selected those risks exceeding a certain threshold as “material risk events.” Furthermore, we determined the degree of latency of these material risk events in a comprehen- sive manner and defined multiple priority response risk events. The Board of Directors receives reports on these priority response risk events and verifies the effectiveness of the overall ERM process.
In fiscal 2018, we will examine detailed contingencies for each designated priority response risk event and begin implementing these contingencies after reporting them to the Board of Directors. Also, we will continue to closely monitor changes in the social and economic situation as we identify material risk events that could affect the JXTG Group and assess these risks, as well as designate priority response risk events and prepare for them.
Furthermore, the core operating companies of JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration, and JX Nippon Mining & Metals each have established and are operating an ERM system based closely on their individual business opera- tions and characteristics.
Departments in charge of risk management of the Company
and its core operating companies work together to share informa-
tion on risks. If a risk event that could seriously impact the JXTG
Group’s management is detected at a core operating company, a
system is in place in which both the core operating company
responsible for the risk event and the Company will work together
to share information as well as examine and implement contingen-
cies for the risk event.
*COSO stands for Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. It refers to a framework for internal control released by the commission and adopted by countries around the world

The JXTG Group and Sustainability
 Risk Assessment of Business Activities
The JXTG Group has developed company rules and regulations for combating various forms of risks in its business activities. For the screening of new investments, in addition to country risk and foreign exchange rate risk, we analyze and evaluate ESG-related risks, including environmental risks such as those related to the scope of response to biodiversity and environmental regulations, risks in the procurement of raw materials including water, and human resources risks including occupational health and safety aspects. Based on this, appropriate actions are taken when necessary.
For example, when reviewing a potential investment, we perform screenings based on the stage gate system prior to reach- ing a final decision. The objective of the stage gate system is to narrow down important projects for the advancement of business strategy in an efficient manner. Under this system, processes from initial review to execution are broken down into stages of reviews. In turn, gates are set up that must be cleared in each of these stages. During screenings, we clarify various risks, including ESG-related risks, using sensitivity analysis and case analysis among other means and take steps to minimize risks. For import- ant investments, follow-up is carried out after a certain period of time has passed to clarify impacts on the initial outlook caused by environmental changes or other factors and determine whether to continue with the project thereafter.
Furthermore, ESG-related risks pertaining to existing business- es are managed and monitored appropriately within the framework of the Company’s CSR promotion structure.
Crisis Management
When crises or emergency situations arise that may significantly affect the management of the JXTG Group, the Company exercis- es overall control and has prepared the Rules for Responding to Crises and Emergency Situations, which specifies measures to be taken to minimize any damage that may occur.
The Crisis Management Department of the Company functions as the standing organizational unit in charge of crisis response and management. The general manager of this department acts as head of this crisis response unit, and, when such situations arise at the Company and Group companies, operating procedures require that the situation and measures to be taken be reported immediately to the head of the crisis response unit.
Also, depending on the magnitude of the crisis, at its discre- tion, the Company may form a crisis response headquarters or a joint crisis response headquarters with JXTG Group companies to respond quickly and appropriately to the crisis and, thereby, fulfill the social mission of the JXTG Group.
Information Security
Based on its Basic Rules for Information Security, the JXTG Group works to prevent the improper use or disclosure, including leakage, of company information, which is a corporate asset. The JXTG Group also strives to maintain the accuracy and reliability of its corporate information as well as prevent falsification or erroneous handling while making it possible for authorized users of information to have constant access to information when they need it.
Cyber Security Measures
The JXTG Group conducts training drills and issues reminders on suspicious email delivered to employees and provides Group-wide security training using curriculum translated into multiple languag- es, in order to protect its important information and systems from cyberattacks, which have become stealthier in recent years.
The IT Security Basic Procedures for JXTG Group have been established as a set of rules that must be followed by Group companies. The Company is now working to further enhance cybersecurity countermeasures for the entire JXTG Group.

Business Strategy
The JXTG Group is expanding its businesses around the world in the fields of energy, resources and materials, mainly through its three core operating companies: JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration, and JX Nippon Mining & Metals.
Aiming to make further leaps forward through transformation and business reforms at
Group companies
In our Energy business, we realized integration synergies exceeding the targets and the business climate improved in oil and natural gas explora- tion and production (E&P) and development along with metals and mining development thanks to rising commodity prices. We were also able to generate higher revenue and higher profits that exceeded the initial target for fiscal 2017, buoyed by continually growing demand in the electronic materials segment of our Metals business.
In fiscal 2018, we will continue to work toward transformation and improvement, and steadily implement our plan for fundamental business reforms.

In addition, we will implement a long-term business strategy closely in tune with
the two social needs of energy demand
and environmental protection.

Operating Income Excluding Inventory Valuation
Change in Fiscal 2017 Operating Income Excluding Inventory Valuation (versus previous year)
In Japan, the steady decline in demand for petroleum products is expected to continue due to structural factors such as the declin- ing population and the increasing number of eco-cars. We expect the domestic business environment to remain challeng- ing. On the other hand, demand for petroleum products in Asia is expected to increase steadily, particularly in emerging countries, but competition with large-scale overseas refineries that are highly cost-competitive has become a major issue for us.
In this challenging business environment, in fiscal 2017, the first fiscal year following the business integration, we got off to a solid start in achieving the targets laid out in the medium-term management plan. We worked to further boost the competitive- ness of our entire supply chain and achieved positive results in terms of production streamlining and energy conservation in the Manufacturing Division, optimization of distribution, crude oil selection and fleet deployment in the Supply Division, and ratio- nalization and streamlining measures in the Procurement Divi- sion, including procurement optimization. As a result, we achieved synergies in excess of the targets.
In addition, on the manufacturing side, we are proceeding with the restructuring of our refinery and plant network. As part of this effort, we decided to end production at the Muroran Plant at the end of March 2019 and convert it into a business site. Furthermore, we introduced various management systems,
including an operations management system, in order to further reinforce our systems for safe and stable operations.
On the sales side, we integrated various sales systems including our wholesale pricing system. We also decided to con- solidate our four service station brands in Japan into the ENEOS brand, from the standpoint of maximizing customer convenience and further boosting integration synergy effects.
As a way to develop and strengthen our next-generation busi- nesses, we decided to enter the residential gas retail business following a similar entry into the electricity business. We plan to begin sales in part of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area before the end of fiscal 2018. In the hydrogen business, we established Japan H2 Mobility, LLC (JHyM) together with 10 other companies including infrastructure businesses, automakers and financial institutions. Through this joint venture, we will move ahead with the full-scale development of hydrogen stations. In the technolo- gy-driven businesses such as lubricants and high-performance materials, we focused on R&D and expanding sales channels.
We will continue to implement measures aimed at maximizing corporate value and achieving the business transformation called for at the time of the business integration, in order to maintain our competitive edge and make a leap forward to become one of the most internationally competitive and prominent comprehensive energy companies in Asia.

 Energy Business
Business Strategy
Our top priority is to steadily implement measures under the medium-term management plan launched following the business integration and achieve positive results, in order to make a leap forward to become one of the most prominent comprehensive energy companies in Asia through a thorough business transformation.
Specifically, we have identified three challenges: (1) reinforcing competitiveness of core businesses by quickly realizing and maximizing integration effects; (2) developing and strengthening businesses that will be mainstays of the future; and (3) further strengthening our management foundation through business infrastructure development and human resource development.
Our greatest business challenge is building robust business and management foundations by steadily implementing and achieving success in the integration of sales systems and SS brands, restructuring of manufacturing sites, optimization of the supply chain, and the introduction of mechanisms and systems for more efficient management.
Electricity Business
Since entering the electric power retail business in April 2016, we have steadily expanded our customer base. We will now step up our sales capabilities by strengthening our relationships with alliance partners that have customer bases that are different from our own, such as major consumer electronics retailers, telecom- munications companies, and credit card companies. In fiscal 2019, we will unify the brand as ENEOS Denki and further expand the sales area.
To secure competitive sources of electricity, we launched opera- tions of electricity generation facilities powered by petroleum coke at the Mizushima Refinery in June 2018 and we are moving ahead steadily with construction of the Muroran Biomass Power Plant.
High-Performance Materials Business
In our high-performance materials business, we have positioned next-generation automobiles, next-generation homes and nutrition as business priorities.
In fiscal 2017, we released a carbon material used for the anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LiB) and a highly heat-resistant waveplate harnessing our proprietary nanoimprinting technology. We plan to launch a transparent film (Kaleido Screen) for screens with significantly greater transparency than
Overseas Business
In April 2016, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy concluded a strategic cooperation agreement with Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex), which has the largest share of sales in Vietnam’s petroleum products market. JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy is leverag- ing its expertise to increase the competitiveness of Petrolimex, and it began considering a joint operational structure for the Marifu Refinery involving Petrolimex.
Moreover, we are considering a range of potential initiatives to expand our business in petroleum product sales and distribution in Australia.
Moving forward, we will continue to meet wide-ranging demand for petroleum products in other regions, centered on Southeast Asia, where growth in demand is expected.
Lubricants Business
For our lubricants business in Japan, we will deploy new measures following the unification of our SS brands while continuing to reinforce the sales capabilities of dealers.
Outside of Japan, we will develop sales channels in overseas regions in order to boost sales of ENEOS brand products. In addition to high value-added products, we will develop products that are highly cost competitive and meet market needs to build the ENEOS brand. We will also work to strengthen earnings through marketing activities at our 30 locations around the world and the optimization of procurement, manufacturing, and distribution.
The installation of these systems will standardize and significantly streamline operations and help us to further strength- en our management system.
Additionally, for JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy to achieve sustained growth in the future, we must also transform the way our officers and employees think and make changes to our organizational culture, in addition to these system improvements. Our workstyle reform projects will aid us in implementing initiatives that foster a corporate culture that embraces highly productive styles of work.

Quickly Realizing and Maximizing Integration Synergy Effects
 Our medium-term management plan announced in May 2017 called for the realization of 100 billion yen in synergy effects over the plan’s three-year period. Since the business integra- tion, we have been creating synergy effects in each division by pursuing best practices utilizing the knowledge and expertise of JX Nippon Oil & Energy and TonenGeneral Sekiyu.
In the Manufacturing Division, by sharing best practices at all 16 of our refineries and plants, we have boosted the effects of cost improvements in the reduction of repair costs, etc., and streamlining of production through improved product yield, etc., and energy conservation. Given that the two predecessor companies have neighboring plants and refiner- ies in the Kawasaki area, we have achieved results by increas- ing production efficiency through integrated operations. We are utilizing feedstock for chemicals more efficiently between refineries and plants. For example, if the ethylene facilities on the former TonenGeneral side run low of feedstock naphtha, naphtha produced by the former JX Nippon Oil & Energy side is supplied, instead of using imported naphtha. As a result of these initiatives, the entire Manufacturing Division achieved synergy effects totaling 15.4 billion yen in fiscal 2017. We aim to further boost these synergies as we integrate our organiza- tions in April 2019.
In the Supply Division, we have enabled more competi- tive crude oil procurement by streamlining and speeding up
Growth of Integration Synergy Effects Over 3 Years
crude oil evaluations and purchase decisions using a production optimization tool built for the new organization. In addition, by combining the strengths and know-how of both predecessor companies, we are working to optimize crude oil tanker deployment, optimize the supply of raw materials between refineries, reduce distribution costs through the integration and closure of oil depots, and expand exports of high value-added products. As a result, the Supply Division realized 19.5 billion yen in synergy effects in fiscal 2017.
In the Procurement Division, we completely overhauled purchase operations across the entire company and by combining the best aspects of both predecessor compa- nies, we achieved synergy effects of 5.7 billion yen in the procurement of catalysts, materials and services.
Furthermore, we are working to quickly generate synergy effects wherever possible in each division, with a focus on streamlining the entire supply chain, from raw material procurement to refining, distribution and sales. As a result, across the entire Energy business we were able to create synergy effects totaling 44.1 billion yen in fiscal 2017, exceeding the initial target.
Looking ahead, we will aim to quickly realize and further boost synergy effects.

 Strengthening Our Business Foundation
For JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy to establish competitiveness at the international level, we will need to build an integrated enterprise resources planning system (ERP system) as an IT platform suitable for the current business environment. We plan to introduce this system by the end of fiscal 2019. At our refineries and plants, we introduced a new operations management system in fiscal 2018 with the goal of achieving even safer and more stable operations. We are now working on developing internal control systems compliant with post-integration standards.

The world economy is achieving steady growth driven by the United States and emerging countries in Asia, and demand for oil is growing at a steady but gradual pace. Meanwhile, on the sup- ply side, there are emerging concerns over declining supply caused by coordination production cuts by OPEC members and other countries along with geopolitical factors such as the con- frontation between Iran and the United States and Venezuela’s civil unrest. Given these factors, petroleum supply-demand has tightened, causing the price of oil to recover back to the $70 per barrel level as of late. Nevertheless, the trend towards higher pro- duction of shale oil remains intact, and there is concern over loosening supply-demand caused by supply side factors, such as a reduction in the size of coordinated production cuts and reigniting investment in development projects following the recovery of oil prices. Furthermore, there is a risk that the deterio- rating trade climate centered on the United States could cause economic activities to stagnate worldwide, which would result in weaker demand for oil. Therefore, uncertainty persists due to the possibility of a temporary but steep drop in oil prices from current levels given the current instability.
Given this climate, oil majors and other E&P companies are steadily restoring their earnings capacity through optimization of their business portfolios and cost reductions. These companies are now actively implementing measures aimed at future business expansion, including restarting major investments in LNG or deepwater develop- ment, pursuing M&A, and developing renewable energy.
In fiscal 2017, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration pushed ahead with “selection and concentration,” a basic policy under the medi-
um-term management plan, and as part of this sold all of its inter- ests in the project in Canada and some of its interests in the UK North Sea.
In addition, we continue to closely manage the budget and schedule in our development business, while still focusing on cost reduction. As a result of these efforts, we are sure that we have moved much closer to a corporate structure that can realize sustainable growth and generate steady profits even in an envi- ronment where oil prices are low.
Meanwhile, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration has started up production at its CO2-EOR project in the United States, the Layang oil and gas field in Malaysia, and the Hail oil field in the United Arab Emirates. Other major development projects (Mari- ner oil field and Culzean gas field in the UK North Sea and the Tangguh LNG expansion project in Indonesia) are progressing largely according to plan, with production slated to begin in fiscal 2018 or later.
Additionally, we worked on developing a business structure at overseas business areas in preparation for our future business expansion. First, we established the Abu Dhabi Office in the Unit- ed Arab Emirates with the goal of building relationships with the governments of oil producing countries and state-owned oil companies in the Middle East. Next, we restructured our busi- ness areas, with a focus on the Kuala Lumpur Office, in order to further boost the competitiveness of our business in Malaysia.
Based on the above, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration will work toward future business expansion while strengthening its corporate structure by continuing to restore its earnings power.

Business Strategy
Under the current medium-term management plan, we are restricting investment to advance the Group’ s basic policy of management, which focuses on cash flows and capital efficiency. At the same time, now is the time to prepare for medium- to long-term growth as a proactive strategy, while reinforcing our business foundation as a defensive strategy.
Under our defensive strategy, we will establish business and financial foundations that can withstand low oil prices through cost reductions and asset portfolio optimization, in order to maximize the value of existing businesses. Meanwhile, under our proactive strategy, we will focus our investment on businesses in which JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration can leverage its strengths and steadily replenish reserves. At the same time, we will strengthen our foundation for growth over the medium to long term by creating businesses that contribute to sustainable growth.

Principal Oil and Gas Field Projects
 With Japan’s largest energy supply chain, the JXTG Group has a social mission as an “unsung hero” that provides stable supplies of energy that power society and the economy. JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration is responsible for the E&P component of this supply chain, placing it in a position to contribute to the stable supply of energy as the starting point.
The business operations of JX Nippon Oil & Gas Explora- tion span 12 countries around the world, including Japan, and also in the range from exploration to production. The main topics of interest surrounding our business operations most recently are outlined below.
1. Malaysia (Block SK10)
Currently, JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration is moving ahead with the comprehensive development of Block SK10, one of our core projects. First, in 2017 we started up production of gas at the Layang oil and gas field, for which develop- ment began in 2014. We plan to start up production of oil from this field in 2020. Additionally, the Beryl gas field,
which we acquired in 2017, carries the potential for lower costs and shorter development because of tie-ins with existing facilities. As a result, we plan to start up production as early as before the end of fiscal 2018.
2. North Sea (UK)
JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration’s major development projects, Mariner oil field and Culzean gas field, are in the final stages of work. We plan to start up production of Mariner oil field before the end of fiscal 2018 and of Culzean gas field sometime in fiscal 2019. These projects will help to underpin JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration’s profitability over the medium term.
3. Indonesia (Tangguh LNG Project)
In Indonesia, we are moving ahead in parallel with a project for expanding existing LNG facilities and the development of new gas fields. We plan to start up operations of the expanded LNG facilities sometime during fiscal 2020.

Operating Income Excluding Inventory Valuation
Change in Fiscal 2017 Operating Income Excluding Inventory Valuation (versus previous year)
Copper, which is central to our Metals business, has many advan- tages, such as good electrical conductivity, ease of processing and good thermal conductivity. Widely used in applications such as power cables, electronic and digital products, and electric circuits for automobiles, copper is an indispensable metal resource for the growth of society. Consequently, growth in copper demand is expected to continue, driven not only by demand for power cables in infrastructure projects, but also the advancement of IoT and AI, as well as the growth of electric vehicles.
Under such environment, the price of copper in fiscal 2017 rose amid the strength of China’s economy and expectations for growing demand following the spread of electric vehicles.
The JX Nippon Mining & Meals Group’s consolidated business results featured net sales of 968.4 billion yen, up 11.1% versus the previous fiscal year. However, we also posted an operating loss of 62.2 billion yen, mainly due to impairment of plant, proper- ty and equipment related to the Caserones Copper Mine we operate in Chile.
In our upstream resources development business, we posted an operating loss as with the previous fiscal year due to high production costs at the Caserones Copper Mine in Chile owing to instability in certain operations in the final copper flotation process, along with an increase in various costs incurred for quickly establishing a full-capacity operating system. In addition to these operational factors, we booked an impairment loss after reapprais- ing assets based on a review of the mine’s long-term production plan, taking into account risks of reduced operations due to winter weather conditions, rising environmental costs, and changes in the mining plan. In May 2018, we established the Caserones Division,
which oversees the Caserones Copper Mine in a centralized and flexible manner. This department is now working to address the issues discussed above.
In our midstream smelting and refining business, we carried out upgrade work on the flash furnace at Pan Pacific Copper’s Saganoseki Smelter and Refinery. This involved replacing the settler for the first time since the No. 2 flash furnace came on line in 1973. We also performed work to improve the cooling of the furnace. All work was completed as initially planned, resulting in an updated flash furnace that can be better heat load. Looking ahead, we plan to make improvements in ancillary facilities to increase the site’s copper concentrate smelting capacity by 10% in fiscal 2019.
In our downstream electronic materials business, we plan to carry out work to boost production capacity for rolled copper foil and sputtering target materials in order to accommodate rising demand for smartphones and cyber-related products.
In our recycling and environmental services business, both the volume and margin of material we collect for recycling rose thanks to a recovery in scrap market prices owing to rising metal prices. Meanwhile, the trend toward lower-grade precious metals has been continuing owing to the reduced use of these metals.
In our titanium business, in general we saw stable growth amid firm demand for the production of commercial aircraft and demand from the electric power sector.
Additionally, through a subsidiary, we acquired all of the shares in H.C. Starck Tantalum and Niobium GmbH, a company headquartered in Germany that is engaged in the development, production and marketing of tantalum and niobium products (high purity metal powders).

 In Focus
Development of New Downstream Businesses Contributing to a Sustainable Society
 In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agreement, which lay out targets with a specific timeline for achievement. This has brought initiatives to achieve a sustainable new society to the forefront globally. Various technologies will need to be utilized to fulfill these international frameworks. Among these technologies, IoT and AI will play a key role. JX Nippon Mining & Metals handles a number of the materials essential to the advancement of these technologies. Today, we enjoy a leading market share internationally in rolled copper foil and sputtering targets for semiconduc- tors. However, overwhelming increases in hardware capacity in the future mean that by 2020 the volume of digital data is expected to rise to about 40 times the amount of 2010. Therefore, we plan to increase production capacity further to provide a stable supply of materials to accommodate this growing demand.
We have made a number of moves with the goal of developing new businesses and generating synergies with
the Group’s downstream businesses as a future growth strategy. In June 2018, we made an investment in Material Concept, Inc., a venture firm initially founded at Tohoku University, to participate in its copper paste business. We also acquired the shares of Toho Titanium and Tatsuta Electric Wire and Cable from JXTG Holdings. In July 2018, additionally, through a subsidiary, we acquired all of the shares in H.C. Starck Tantalum and Niobium GmbH, a company headquartered in Germany that develops and manufactures tantalum and niobium products. The JX Nippon Metals & Mining Group will now be able to harness these companies’ micro-wire material technology, metal powder manufacturing technology, high purification technology, and manufacturing and recycling technology for next-generation battery materials for EV. Looking ahead, based on these technologies, we plan to develop next-generation wire materials, 3D printing materials, solid electrolytes for next-generation lithium ion batteries, and new applications for scandium alloys.

   Resources Development Business
At Caserones Copper Mine, the Japan and Chile sides work togeth- er to shrink cash expenditures using thorough cost management and quickly resolve any issues that may arise. We are also working on the selection and concentration of mine investments, which has involved the acquisition of additional interest in Los Pelambres Mine and the transfer of interest in Collahuasi Copper Mine. We are also strengthening management control through the restructuring of companies in which we have investments. In this manner, we aim to boost earnings power by increasing mine production and optimizing operations through greater involvement in the mines we invest in.
Caserones Production Volume
measures that improve upon our smelting and refining technolo- gies. In addition, working closely with LS-Nikko Copper of South Korea, we will establish a business framework with world-leading cost competitiveness.
Recycling and Environmental Services Business
While increasing the amount of recycled materials we collect from outside of Japan, we will ensure stable processing of recycled materials through the development of physical sorting technology, cost reduction and other initiatives, thereby strengthening our business foundation. Additionally, we are conducting commercial feasibility trials on rare metal recycling from spent lithium-ion batteries, and expand the treatment of low-concentration PCBs and waste asbestos as part of our efforts to build a zero-emission, recycling-oriented, environmentally friendly business.
Titanium Business
We will operate our business following the management strategy of establishing and strengthening a management foundation focused on quality. We are moving ahead with preparations for the start-up of commercial production at our titanium sponge manufacturing joint venture in Saudi Arabia sometime before the end of fiscal 2018.
Strengthening the Business Foundation
To continually deliver stable supplies of copper, which is essential to the development of our society and economy, we must continuously secure the human resources that drive our businesses. As part of this effort, we launched an endowed unit at the University of Tokyo, which marked its sixth anniversary in 2017. This course is mainly intended for people in the industry, teachers, and students. However, to broaden that target audience, we have also launched a course that makes it easier for a wider range of people to understand the future of JX Nippon Mining & Metals and copper, including students from elementary school to high school.
As JX Nippon Mining & Metals’ business domains are expanding to overseas markets, in human resource development we will strive to develop personnel who think creatively and innovatively while keeping cultural differences in mind. Accordingly, we offer a study abroad program for foreign graduate schools as well as personnel rotations across divisions. Furthermore, we have taken steps to reevaluate our personnel evaluation system. In addition to incorporating budget control, we have clarified the assessment criteria for skills and capabilities for the revitalization of individual employees and organizations.

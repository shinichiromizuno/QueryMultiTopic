Can you provide a quick overview of the long-term vision you are currently preparing?
A7 We plan to present a future vision spanning 10 and 20 years into the future prior to developing our next medium-term management plan.

We plan to launch our second medium-term management plan in fiscal 2020. Before developing this plan, we need to come up with a major underlying direction for the Group over the next 10 to 20 years. This integrated report contains value creation stories about the social value and economic value
the Group will create over the medium to long term. This long-term vision will further build upon these stories and will include initiatives in renewable energy and social aspects such as ESG and the SDGs. With regard to the SDGs, we plan to reinforce initiatives mainly for SDG 7 – Affordable and clean energy, SDG 11 – Sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 12 – Responsible consumption; namely those goals with close correlation to the Group’s operations.

Development for New Treatments for
Tropical Diseases Utilizing Partnerships
Eisai is proactively taking initiatives aimed at developing new treatments for NTDs. We have collaborated with several international research organizations to obtain specific research technologies and experience in running clinical studies and networking with clinical facilities in endemic regions.
Eisai’s initiatives for elimination of NTDs are a long- term investment with the aim of eliminating regional gaps and expanding the productive population and middle-income group in developing and emerging countries, and we will continue to proactively engage in these initiatives.

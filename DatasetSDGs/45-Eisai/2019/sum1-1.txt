Initiative to Eliminate Tropical Diseases
in Impoverished Regions
A representative example of efforts to resolve the gap is to eliminate Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). NTDs, such as lymphatic filariasis* (LF) are serious medical and social issues. Moreover, due to poverty or other reasons, many people afflicted with NTDs cannot receive the necessary treatments. We are taking proactive initiatives to relieve patients of their fears and sufferings. Initiatives for NTDs are not side work; it is a major area of focus alongside oncology and neurology.
In order to eliminate LF, Eisai initiated manufacturing the LF treatment “DEC (Diethylcarbamazine)” tablets, at our Vizag Plant in India. We have provided these to the World Health Organization (WHO) at Price Zero. Supply commenced
in October 2013, and we
have delivered approximately
1.8 billion tablets to 28
countries by the end of June
2019. WHO announced that
elimination of LF was achieved
in 14 countries. Eisai will
continue providing DEC tablets
until LF is eliminated in all the
endemic countries.

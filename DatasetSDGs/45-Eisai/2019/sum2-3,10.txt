Affordable Pricing Policies
in Emerging Countries
We have been formulating various flexible pricing policies that enable patients in emerging countries to purchase our products at affordable prices. For example, we have introduced “HOPE TO HER PROGRAM” in eight Asian countries. In this program, our anticancer agent Halaven® is provided based on tiered pricing model, which is a scheme to reduce the burden for medicine expenses according to the patients’ income and health insurance systems. This program has enabled approximately 4,100 patients with breast cancer to receive Halaven® over the past five years.

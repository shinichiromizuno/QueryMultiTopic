Business with Consideration for the Global Environment
     Eisai conducts business operations seeking coexistence with the global environment. Based on the Eisai Network Companies (ENW) Environmental Protection Policy, all employees recognize the importance of environmental protection and incorporate an environmental perspective in working to solve social issues. In promoting business expansion into countries across the world, Eisai will fulfill its corporate social responsibility by focusing on reducing environmental impact at each stage of business.
Developing a Management System for Protecting the Global Environment
Eisai established the company-wide Environment and Safety Committee as a decision-making body for deliberation of important environmental protection issues. Moreover, Eisai develops its own management system in each of its offices in an effort to facilitate its environmental activities. At our major production bases in Japan and overseas, we engage in activities that are based on the acquisition of ISO14001 so that we can check the validity of the environmental management system through external reviews. In addition to observing environment- related laws, ordinances and agreements, we periodically conduct internal environmental audits by an organization specializing in internal auditing to identify and solve issues.

 Eisai is promoting initiatives for the formation of a low- carbon society to help solve the problem of climate change. Eisai is participating in the Commitment to
a Low Carbon Society initiated by the Federation
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations of Japan, and the Eisai Group in Japan is implementing relevant initiatives based on its own medium-term plan for the reduction of CO2 emissions. More specifically, we plan to reduce domestic CO2 emissions by 23% compared to fiscal 2005 by fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2017, our domestic CO2 emissions were reduced by 37.1%*1 compared to fiscal 2005.
Furthermore, revenue per CO2 emissions, one of the ecoefficiency indices, has been increasing.
In June 2018, Eisai submitted its commitment letter

AppendixEstablishment of a Recycling-Oriented Society:
Zero Emissions Have Been Achieved in Japan for Ten Consecutive Years
 Eisai is conducting waste disposal with three goals
in mind: reduce the amount of waste generated, increase the rate of recycling and decrease the amount of waste sent to landfill. We also sort waste for recycling and select the best waste disposal contractors possible in a timely manner. Furthermore, we are actively trying to process recycling that has value in the market and to reduce disposal costs.
In fiscal 2017, we have domestically attained “zero emissions”, which indicates a ratio of the amount of
waste sent to landfill to the total waste of less than 1%, for ten consecutive years.

 Handling the Risk of Water Shortage through the Efficient Use of Water Resources
In recent years, the number of regions suffering from ●Global Water Consumption and Amount of Wastewater*5
 severe water shortages due to climate change and (thousand m3) other environmental changes has been increasing 4,500
Water consumption Amount of wastewater
 worldwide and the importance of effective use of
water resources is rising year by year. To conserve
water resources, Eisai tries to secure the quality of 3,500
water discharged from its plants and laboratories. We 3,125 perform regular measurement and ensure that the 3,000
amount of pollutant emissions to domestic waters is 2,500
below the standard defined by the Water Pollution
Control Law and the agreements on pollution
prevention. We are also committed to reducing water
consumption and drainage and to facilitating the reuse
of water. As a result, our water consumption and
drainage from our facilities in Japan are decreasing in
recent years. Also, the results of our internal research 500
indicate that the sites of Eisai’s plants and laboratories 0
are not situated in high-risk areas that would force 2013 them to suspend operations due to water shortages
in the near future.

In 2017, the CDP evaluation system highly rated Eisai as “B”, which is equivalent to the “Management” level. In the Japanese health care sector, only two companies achieved “Leadership” level (A-), while three companies including Eisai achieved “Management” level (B).
*6 A non-profit organization based in London, formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project. Requests information relating
to climate change, water, and forests from companies with top ranking market capitalization in principal countries and discloses the information to the government and investors. The CDP evaluation system evaluates the status of implementation of a company’s environmental management activities on a scale of one to eight (A, A- to D and D-) on four different levels including leadership, management, recognition and information disclosure.
In June 2018, the non-government organization World Wide Fund for Nature Japan (WWF Japan)*7 announced
its Ranking of Corporations for Effective Efforts to Address Climate and Energy Issues for the pharmaceutical
industry, in which Eisai was ranked 3rd among Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers.

    Working on human rights due diligence both internally and in the supply chain by promoting responsible procurement■ Respect for Human Rights
Eisai believes that human rights constitute the most universal and fundamental requirement for our business activities, and we have clearly stipulated respect for human rights as one of our standards in the Eisai Network Companies (ENW) Charter of Business Conduct. We formulated the ENW Human Rights Policy, which complies with international regulations, and continue to promote efforts to respect all stakeholders’ human rights.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on protecting employees from infection and on providing global support for medical facilities and endemic areas, in addition to our existing activities.

■ Sustainable Procurement
When undertaking business, companies need to pay attention to social and environmental matters throughout the supply chain. After evaluating our business partners’ efforts in the area of sustainability, including human rights, labor, health and safety, environment, and ethics, we initiated sustainable procurement with the aim of improving our business through engagement with our business partners.
In fiscal 2020, we have laid the foundation for implementing sustainable procurement by revising the Code of Conduct for Business Partners in conjunction with the formulation of the ENW Sustainable Procurement Policy, and adopting the EcoVadis platform as a sustainability evaluation tool for business partners. In addition, we joined the Pharmaceutical Industry Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), a non-profit organization in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors aimed at building sustainable supply chains, with
purpose of understanding and practicing the ENW Human Rights Policy in fiscal 2020. Regarding harassment prevention, we implement compliance training to ensure that employees thoroughly understand the policy.
recognition of the importance of under taking these activities industry-wide. Our Code of Conduct for Business Partners complies with the PSCI principles.
To help our business partners to understand our initiatives for sustainable procurement, we held the first briefing sessions. We are in the process of asking our business partners to sign undertakings to abide by the Code of Conduct, and have received signed agreement forms from 43 direct material manufacturers, 48 trading companies and wholesalers. We use EcoVadis evaluation results to understand risks in the supply chain, and engage with business partners based on the results. We exchanged opinions with 10 business partners regarding initiatives for improving sustainability. Going forward, we will expand the sustainability evaluation of our business partners in Japan and overseas, and promote responsible procurement in the supply chain.

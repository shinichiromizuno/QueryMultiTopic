Taking the Global Environment Into Account in Our Business Activities
      Ensuring the sustainability of the global environment and building a solid foundation for enhancing corporate valueEisai has been developing corporate activities as a global “human health care (hhc)” company. In the new medium- term business plan ‘EWAY Future & Beyond’ starting from fiscal 2021, Eisai aims to deliver not only pharmaceutical products but also solutions to “The People” including both patients and the public, under the “hhc” philosophy. In order to contribute to “The People,” it is important for Eisai to strengthen its activities to ensure the sustainability of the global environment, which is the basis of its business activities. In particular, efforts aiming at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, realizing sustainable use of resources such as water, and safeguarding biodiversity, will reduce not only the burden on the environment but also the risk of natural disasters in
society as a whole, and alleviate water stress. We believe that this will contribute to a more stable product supply, meet the needs of future patients and the public, and lead to the continuous realization of the “hhc” philosophy.
Our efforts in this area have received external evaluations such as a “B” in the CDP*1 Climate Change Report 2020, selection for inclusion in the “Carbon Clean 200*2” ranking of the top 200 listed companies in the world in 2021 that are contributing most to the reduction of fossil fuel energy consumption, and inclusion in the S&P/JPX Carbon Efficient Index.
■ Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Eisai’s statement of commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 – Setting a new medium- to long-term target
We have established the Eisai Network Company (ENW) Environmental Policy and developed corporate activities that emphasize the conservation of the global environment. The entire company has been working together to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
We proceeded with the examination of medium- to long-term goals in the cross-organizational Carbon Neutral Project, which was launched as a countermeasure against climate-related risks, and set the medium- to long-term targets outlined below in the 2040 Carbon Neutral Declaration in May 2021. The new target was set to respond to the initiatives of governments intending to solve the issues of climate changes by realizing a carbon-free society, and in response to global demands for solving social challenges. Eisai declared that we would accelerate our
efforts to protect the environment more than ever with the new target. We will create a company-wide roadmap and promote concrete actions to achieve our goals, such as further introduction of renewable energy. As part of this, in June 2021, we applied for membership in RE100, an international initiative that aims to have companies use renewable energy for 100% of the electricity used in their businesses, and will officially join in September 2021.
In December 2020, Eisai announced our support for the Japan Climate Initiative, a network of companies, local governments, and NGOs that are actively working on climate change countermeasures, and we have been actively working with more than 600 stakeholders, including companies, local governments and NPOs, to realize a carbon-free society.• Medium-term target: Achieving 100% usage of renewable energy by 2030
Eisai will switch over to renewable energy for all electric power, which accounts for 65.3% (as of fiscal 2019) of the total energy used by the entire Group (Aiming for zero CO2 emissions from the use of electric power classified in Scope 2).
• Long-term goal: Achieving carbon neutrality by 2040
Eisai will balance out CO2 emissions and absorption across the entire Group (Aiming for zero CO2 emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels classified in Scope 1 following the achievement of the target of Scope 2).
Progress towards achievement of the SBT (Science Based Targets: Targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions based on scientific grounds)
Having set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2016), the entire Group has been working on to reduce the emissions. Eisai
received approval from the Science Based Targets (SBT) Initiative* for the reduction targets in 2019. In addition, as a result of promoting the use of renewable energy at

plants in China and India, greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2) decreased significantly in fiscal 2020, and these efforts enabled us to make great progress in our plan for achieving our SBT. We will also work with our suppliers on reducing Scope 3 CO2 emissions.1. 30% reduction of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2016)
2. 30% reduction of GHG emissions (emission based on purchased products and services in Scope 3) by fiscal 2030 (compared to fiscal 2016)
Scope 1: Direct emissions of GHG released into the air by the use of fossil fuels Scope 2: Indirect emissions of GHG through the use of electricity and steam
purchased from others
Scope 3: Indirect emissions of GHG through the supply chain, excluding Eisai
itself

The Eisai Group conducts R&D and manufacturing activities in compliance with GLP (Good Laboratory Practices) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards. We consume a considerable amount of electricity by operating air conditioners, because we have to operate at certain temperature and humidity levels following these standards. The Vizag Plant (India) has procured solar electricity and the Exton Site (U.S.) has generated solar power and uses it onsite. We will
■ Efforts To Address Climate-Related Risks
In June 2019, we announced our support for the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Information Disclosure (TCFD), and performed climate scenario analysis. Critical risks including those that are climate-related are managed at the Risk Management Committee, which is chaired by the corporate officer responsible for internal control, and
continue to introduce renewable energy and reduce CO2 emissions even more in a systematic manner.

■ Efforts Aimed at Sustainable Use of Water
In April 2021, we revised the Eisai Network Company (ENW) Environmental Policy to include a clear statement that Eisai would contribute to the building of a recycling- oriented society through the sustainable use of resources, including water, as one of the environmental action guidelines. In addition, we have conventionally
promoted efforts to ensure the quality of water discharged from our production sites and research facilities, and to use water efficiently both in Japan and overseas (including offices in areas with an inadequate water supply). In the future, we will consider setting quantitative goals for sustainable use of water.
For further information regarding environmental protection activities, please refer to the “Environmental Report”.

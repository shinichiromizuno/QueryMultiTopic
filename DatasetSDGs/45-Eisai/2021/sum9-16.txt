Corporate Governance
66.7% Ratio of outside directors on the board of directors Striving continually to achieve the best corporate governance
 ■ Features of the Company’s Corporate Governance
❶ Clear Separation of Functions Between the Oversight of Management and the Execution of Business
The Company fully leverages its system of being a company with a nomination committee, etc., with the Board of Directors entrusting a large portion of the decision-making authority over business execution to corporate officers to the extent permitted by relevant laws and regulations in order to devote its attention to the oversight of management.
This enables prompt, flexible decision making and business execution by corporate officers, even in environments undergoing dramatic changes. Additionally, in order to achieve a clear separation between the oversight of management and the execution of business, the Company has established that the chair of the Company’s Board of Directors be an outside director and that the Representative Corporate Officer and CEO shall be the only individual to
❷ Diversity of Directors
The Company selects directors who have various different backgrounds so that the Board of Directors can meet the expectations of stakeholders and exercise the function of management oversight.
For outside directors in particular, we aim to secure a significant level of diversity over the medium to long term. This includes diversity in terms of tasks, with outside directors who
concurrently serve as a corporate officer and a director. Clearly separating management oversight and business
execution in this manner enhances corporate vitality, including business execution by corporate officers, while the Board of Directors exercises the function of oversight from the perspective of stakeholders to ensure fairness and transparency in management. At the same time, directors and corporate officers communicate with each other and build trust in executing their respective duties and fulfilling their responsibilities, working together to increase corporate value and contribute to the creation of social value. Mechanisms such as these are important characteristics of the Company’s corporate governance.
are experienced in corporate management and global business, and others who are experts in law or financial accounting, as well as diversity in terms of characteristics such as nationality, gender, and age. Reflecting the efforts to ensure excellent outside director candidates on an ongoing basis, the Nomination Committee resolved to increase the number of outside director candidates for fiscal year 2021 to 8, an increase of 1.
❸ System of Operational Divisions for Optimal Decision Making and Flexible Business Execution
a. Selection and Assignment of Corporate Officers
The Board of Directors takes a global perspective in selecting the corporate officers who will implement our corporate philosophy and improve our corporate value, and assigns them in ways that allow them to effectively, efficiently harness their capabilities.
People who are well-versed in the operations in each field of administration, including those with advanced expertise in R&D, science, and the production, quality, safety, and other aspects of pharmaceuticals, as well as those with extensive knowledge

b. The Executive Board, Advisory Boards, etc.

Management oversight
Reporting & proposals

 c. Building and Operating a Global Internal Control System
The Board of Directors determined the rules for internal controls that should be put in place and operated by corporate officers, based on which corporate officers ensure independence
by establishing, preparing and operating an internal control system within the scope of their assigned allocation of duties. The Company also assigns global corporate officers, with
the corporate officers who are in charge directly building and operating internal control systems at overseas subsidiaries.
❹ Management Oversight by the Board of Directors The Board of Directors has the authority to select and dismiss corporate officers. The Board of Directors delegates a large portion of the decision-making authority over business execution to corporate officers, and corporate officers are responsible for reporting to the Board of Directors in a timely, appropriate fashion.
The Board of Directors confides in corporate officers
by verifying the appropriateness and efficiency of business execution processes based on their reports while also evaluating the performance results of the business execution, thus fulfilling the role of management oversight by ensuring the appropriateness and transparency of management.
d. Instilling Management with Accountability and Stakeholder Consciousness
Once every 3 months, all corporate officers attend a Board
of Directors meeting and report to the Board of Directors
on decisions made in the Executive Board as well as the
status of their business execution. Corporate officers having accountability and reporting to the Board of Directors improves the rationality and transparency of decision making, policies, and initiatives of operational divisions, while instilling stakeholder consciousness in management.
The Board of Directors also delegates important management oversight functions of the Board of Directors to the Nomination Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, and oversees the business execution of these committees based on their respective reports. The fairness and efficiency of the Board of Directors are also ensured through oversight of each individual director to verify whether they are making fair judgments, exercising their authority in a way that lives up to the confidence placed in them by all shareholders, and executing their business functions appropriately.
■ Formulation of the Corporate Governance Principles
Based on recent developments in awareness and discussions on sustainability, including corporate governance, ESG, and the SDGs, the hhc Governance Committee deliberated extensively and at a meeting of the Board of Directors on March 1, 2021 changed the title of the Corporate Governance Guidelines
to the Corporate Governance Principles, while also making

the Corporate Governance Principles, which are the code of conduct for corporate governance, the Board of Directors will firmly supervise efforts to create value with stakeholders and realize a sustainable society.
The outline of this revision is as follows.
1) Revised stipulations to include relationships not only
with shareholders but also with principal stakeholders
stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation.

been expanded in the revision of the Corporate Governance Principles.
❶ Dialogues with Patients
The Outside Directors participated in dialogue with a patient who is a breast cancer survivor and also has experience helping care for her mother who was suffering from dementia, and in so doing gained a deeper understanding of the importance of empathy with the patient’s emotions, as well as the “hhc” corporate philosophy and its practical application.
❷ Dialogues with Institutional Investors
The Outside Directors had a discussion with approximately 70 institutional investors that lasted roughly 2 hours, and other discussions for sharing information and exchanging opinions with about 7 companies that are major shareholders in a total
of 10 sessions via video and telephone conferencing. The opportunity to hear candid opinions from various perspectives and the matters pointed out and knowledge gained from these dialogues are now being utilized in discussions and management oversight by the Board of Directors.
Dialogue session with institutional investors and others held using an online conferencing system
  ❸ Dialogues with Employees
There was an active discussion between the outside directors and young and middle-ranking employees and researchers about efforts in designing formulations, product quality assurance, and the state of the most
recent research activities.
At the exchanges of opinions with labor union
representatives on behalf of employees, there were discussion on the following topics:
 - The state of labor negotiations and communication with the Company
- Discussions regarding the issues and expectations regarding workstyles during and after COVID-19
- Challenges faced by female employees who want to continue working after having children, and what systems are in
place for these
- Issues and impact caused in the workplace by requests for voluntary retirement

Directors, more than half of the members of which are outside directors

 ■ Information Sharing and Discussion Regarding the Succession Plan ❶ View Regarding Selection of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
The Company considers the selection of the CEO one of
the most important decisions to be made by the Board of Directors. The CEO’s duty is to exhibit strong leadership while also nurturing the next CEO. The Company believes that having outside directors participate in this process, with awareness
❷ Procedures Regarding CEO Selection
After Eisai transformed to a company with a nomination committee, etc., system in 2004, discussions continued to be held under a consistently optimal corporate governance system regarding the CEO succession process. In fiscal 2016, taking developments up to that point into account, discussions were held in the Outside Directors Meeting (now the hhc Governance Committee) on how information should be shared by the Board of Directors in relation to a succession plan formulated by the CEO, and how to prepare for unexpected situations. These procedures and other considerations were set out as rules. The outline of the procedures is as follows.
1) Sharing of Information about the Succession Plan
1 Information about the succession plan proposal by the
CEO is shared in the hhc Governance Committee twice each year.
❸ Preparations for Unexpected Situations Circumstances, such as unforeseen accidents, that necessitate the sudden selection of a new CEO by the Board of Directors are also possible. Contingency plans for such
of the above, and having them offer advice, etc., increases the objectivity of the CEO’s proposal of successor candidates.
It ensures the fairness of the CEO selection process in an appropriate way.
2 The CEO and inside directors also participate in the hhc Governance Committee, and information on the succession plan is shared among all directors.
2) Discussion on the Succession Plan
1 Criteria for evaluating candidates are expected to change in accordance with the business environment and other factors. For this reason, criteria will be set appropriately when the CEO proposes candidates.
2 The CEO evaluates candidates based on the criteria that have been set, and presents evaluation results in the succession plan.
3 Outside directors provide advice on the succession plan. The CEO considers the advice provided by outside directors, and reflects it in the succession plan as appropriate.
unexpected situations are also confirmed when considering the aforementioned succession plan.
■ Mechanism for Utilizing Outside Organizations to Improve and Ensure the Suitability of the Board of Directors Evaluation
❶ Aiming to “ensure the suitability of the Board of Directors evaluation,” a mechanism to improve and ensure the suitability of the Board of Directors evaluation through an outside organization was adopted in fiscal 2017. This process by which the outside organization examines the evaluation process, evaluates it, proposes improvements and inspects its evaluation results takes place once every 3 years.
❷ After analyzing the Company’s past evaluation methods, evaluation decision process,
evaluations of each director, and
final evaluation, etc., the outside
organization points out issues and makes recommendations regarding the systems and their operations.
❸ Based on the recommendations and what was pointed out by the outside organization, the hhc Governance Committee and Board of Directors work on improving the systems and their operations.
❹ The outside organization inspects the evaluation process, evaluation
results, and other aspects of the Board of Directors evaluation compiled by the hhc Governance Committee, and submits a report to the Board of Directors.
❺ The Board of Directors determines the corporate governance evaluation for the applicable fiscal year based on the evaluation compiled by the hhc Governance Committee and the report by the outside organization.

 The Board of Directors Evaluation Third Party Review Report (overview)
Eisai Co., Ltd. performed a review on the Board of Directors evaluation that was conducted in-house from the following perspectives.
- Verifying the comprehensiveness of the items in the Board of Directors evaluation survey
- Verifying the fairness and appropriateness of the evaluation methods
- Verifying the fairness and appropriateness of discussions in the hhc Governance Committee - Verifying the fairness and appropriateness of Board of Directors evaluation results disclosures
When conducting this review, documents and disclosure materials provided by Eisai Co., Ltd. pertaining to the previous 2 years’ worth of Board of Directors evaluations were analyzed, while information needed for the review was also obtained by sitting in on hhc Governance Committee meetings.
Results of the Review
• Tireless efforts are clearly being dedicated to making the governance system more in-depth through use of the risk map and stronger monitoring that can identify risks whenever they arise.
• Sincere efforts are clearly being made to improve governance in a way that boosts corporate value, as regular checks by (outside) third parties are included in the evaluation methodology, and ways to create greater transparency are being devised.
• It was determined that the fiscal 2020 Board of Directors evaluation overall had been performed properly from the perspectives of comprehensiveness, fairness, and appropriateness.
• It was suggested that it was effective for increasing support from stakeholders to explicitly re-confirm the items in the Board of Directors evaluation survey that people are important to institutional investors, etc. More effective corporate governance could thus be achieved.
■ Compensation Paid to Directors and Corporate Officers
❶ Compensation System for Directors
Compensation paid to directors is only a fixed base compensation. The duty of directors is to supervise management, and a fixed rate not incorporating performance-based compensation is used to
❷ Compensation System for Corporate Officers Compensation paid to corporate officers is determined
in accordance with basic policies by the Compensation Committee with the aim of enabling the Company to attract excellent personnel to the Company’s management cadre and to strongly motivate corporate officers in the performance of their duties, thereby contributing substantially to the Company, and with a recognition of the differences in the levels and mechanisms of compensation, etc., in each country or region.
The level of compensation paid to corporate officers is intended to be set at the upper middle range for the industry. The compensation paid to corporate officers is composed of base compensation, bonuses, and stock-based compensation at a ratio of 6:3:1, and performance-based compensation accounts for 40% of total compensation.
●Process of determining performance-based compensation
ensure that directors are able to properly perform their oversight functions. The level of compensation is intended to be set at the upper middle range for the industry.
Stock-based compensation provided to corporate officers increases or decreases each year according to Company-wide performance. In addition, in the medium and long term, when stock prices fluctuate, the actual value of the compensation fluctuates accordingly. The Company believes that maintaining this mechanism will strengthen the motivation of corporate officers to adopt the perspective of shareholders and strive to increase corporate value.
The Compensation Committee has recognized that the compensation system should be drastically revised due to changes in the business environment, business and profit structure of the Company. From fiscal 2020, we have begun to revise the executive officer compensation system.

Обращение генерального директора
Инциденты, связанные с нарушением корпоративных норм, также называемые ‘white-collar crimes’ (злоупотребление должностными полномочиями), могут иметь серьезные последствия для отдельных лиц и компаний. С одной стороны, в случае преступного умысла, например хищения денежных средств, компания должна будет потребовать компенсацию от злоумышленника или инициировать уголовное разбирательство. В любом случае правонарушителю придется покинуть компанию. С другой стороны, иногда нарушение нормативных требований происходит, поскольку правонарушитель считает, что действует в интересах компании. Примером могут служить картели, поскольку может показаться, что фиксация цен или корректировка производства позволяет временно повысить прибыль. Однако такие инциденты могут привести к крупным штрафам, размер которых в подавляющем большинстве случаев превышает полученную финансовую выгоду. Нарушители — как сотрудники, так и директора — могут быть приговорены к тюремному заключению. Кроме того, для решения проблем, возникающих в результате ненадлежащего поведения, требуется много времени и усилий. Ошибочно полагать, что такие действия могут помочь компании. Нарушения нормативных требований никогда не стоят этого.
Кроме того, такие проблемы на рабочем месте, как преследование и дискриминация, приносят огромный вред пострадавшим лицам и значительно подрывают функционирование компании и ее корпоративную культуру.
Фальсификация или неправильное представление данных, информации или заявлений о качестве продукции представляют серьезный риск для компании. Такие нарушения могут пошатнуть основополагающие принципы компании, что приведет к потере доверия или прекращению деятельности компании. Это может даже привести к банкротству компании или нежелательному слиянию.
Вам может показаться, что вы можете поступить тем или иным образом, поскольку никто не узнает о вашем поступке; вы можете подумать, что это допустимо, потому что в вашем окружении поступают так же; или вы можете почувствовать, что это допустимо в какой-то степени, потому что вы вправе действовать по своему усмотрению. Однако такие мысли свидетельствуют о наличии этических проблем у человека и в организации. В Eisai нет места такому поведению или заявлениям о том, что существуют обстоятельства, оправдывающие такое поведение.
Я хочу подчеркнуть, что соблюдение нормативных требований не является чем-то рекомендательным в Eisai. Это абсолютно необходимое и обязательное условие для того, чтобы мы могли заручиться доверием уважаемых нами пациентов и всех заинтересованных сторон.

■ Risk Management Promotion
Regarding risk management, Eisai defines risks as
the threat or probability that an action or event will adversely affect the achievement of corporate and/
or organizational objectives. In order to avoid risks or keep risks within acceptable levels, Eisai is carrying

making bodies regularly discuss the risks and uncertainties that the Group faces, and consider measures to turn these risks and uncertainties into opportunities, or to mitigate them. The results of such consideration are reported to the Board of Directors, which in turn discusses them. Accordingly, the risks and uncertainties indicated below do not only include the input from the Executive Board, but also reflect the discussions of the Board of Directors.

Social and Relationship Capital Initiatives for Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/ESG Indices A LIST in CDP report 2019
Proactively Work toward the Solution of Global Environment and Social Issues under Well-Established Governance
  Eisai aims to enhance corporate value by creating social value. The origin of this idea is “human health care (hhc),” which is Eisai’s corporate philosophy. Eisai’s corporate activities rely on the idea that economic value is created as a result of social value creation.
We believe that the continuous realization of “hhc” is a mission for all Eisai employees. We are working on this realization, recognizing that it is important to contribute to the unmet medical needs of the world through our business activities and continue to create value for society. As part of these efforts, the CEO, other executives in charge of ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance), and employees gather together and hold a “Sustainability Advisory Board” to discuss sustainability, and receive advice from external advisors once a year. We discussed actions for climate change and human rights in addition to Access to Medicines (ATM) in the Board in fiscal 2019. Eisai will continue to strive for further sustainability.●Access to Medicines (ATM)

 ■ Rated “A” in the CDP*1 Climate Change Report 2019
Eisai conducts business operations seeking co- existence with the global environment. Based on the Eisai Network Companies (ENW) Environmental Protection Policy, all employees recognize the importance of environmental protection and incorporate an environmental perspective in working to solve social issues. In promoting business expansion into countries across the world, Eisai will fulfill its corporate social responsibility by focusing on reducing environmental impact at each stage of business.
We were rated “A,” the highest rating in the CDP
Expanding use of renewable energy*2
We are working to switch to renewable energy in production sites and R&D sites that consume the most energy group-wide. In fiscal 2019, we switched to renewable energy with green electricity certificate at the Vizag Plant in India, and at the Suzhou and Benxi Plants in China. In fiscal 2020, we aim to achieve the renewable energy ratio target by switching the energy usage of the headquarters building group and part of the Tsukuba Research Laboratory.
Climate Change Report 2019, based on the evaluation of answers to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire. In fiscal 2019, 8,400 companies responded worldwide, of which 180 were companies with an “A” rating and 38 were Japanese companies. The A list companies are recognized as taking advanced approaches to climate change issues, and are expected to continue to demonstrate global leadership to respond to environmental risks and contribute the building of a sustainable economy.

Initiatives for a low-carbon society Reduce CO2 emissions by 30% from fiscal 2016 by fiscal 2030
We are promoting initiatives for the formation of a low carbon society to help solve the problem of climate change. As one of the initiatives, we set the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target by fiscal 2030 based on scientific grounds and received the approval from “Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)”*3 in May 2019. We are making efforts to decrease CO2 emissions by 40,000t globally to realize low carbon society.
*1 CDP (former name: Carbon Disclosure Project) is an NGO founded in London in 2001. It sends inquiries to the world’s top companies on behalf of institutional investors with assets under management of 96 trillion USD, analyzes and evaluates the answers, and then represents the results to investors, governments and companies. The information from CDP is considered to be a key factor for ESG investment.
*2 Energy that is always present in the natural world, such as sunlight, wind power, and geothermal energy, that “is not exhausted,” “is present everywhere,” and “does not emit CO2.”
*3 SBTi helps companies set reduction targets to keep average global temperature rises below 1.5 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World
Resources Institute (WRI), and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Japan jointly established SBTi in 2015.
■ Improving Resilience to Climate-Related Risks
Analysis of Impact of Climate Change Based on TCFD Frameworks
 Eisai tried scenario analysis from October 2019 to March 2020 in accordance with the Final Report “Recommendations by the Task Force on Climate Change Disclosure” released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2017. Setting two scenarios, one with large GHG emissions and a temperature rise of 4
degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution in 2100, and one with a strict climate change policy that limits the temperature rise in 2100 to within 1.5 degrees Celsius, we executed financial impact analysis of physical risks and transition risks due to climate change, and did mapping on the three axes of magnitude of financial impact, probability of occurrence, and timing of occurrence.

Transition risk
Physical risk

 As a result, we detected that the largest physical risk is the decline in access to medicines in developing countries and the need for additional cost spending required for improvement. The second is the loss due to production failures and damage to fixed assets due to natural disasters and the amount of continuous investment in the production backup system. We also evaluated that the decrease in sales by the stagnation of product supply due to the suspension of production and logistics was significant.
In terms of transition risk, we evaluated that the decline in reputation in case GHG reductions were inadequate would have an extremely large impact, and
Initiatives for physical risks
Acceleration of initiatives for further improvement of access to medicines and cooperation with external agencies
Promote development of new drugs for infectious diseases
Initiatives for unique business models
Strengthening of BCP at each business site, detailed disaster risk diagnosis, and promotion of hardware measures
Ensuring employee safety and strengthening BCP at high-risk business sites
Supply chain resilience enhancement by identifying high-risk suppliers or procured items
■ Activities Based on Human Rights Policy
Eisai believes that it is essential for all business activities to be conducted on the basis of respect for human rights, and that this is the foundation of our business activities. The importance of respect for human rights is clearly stated in The Eisai network companies (ENW)
that the continuous rise in raw material prices due to the continuous rise in carbon prices would also have a large impact. In addition, we evaluated that the replacement cost would be large if we were forced to change the packaging due to increasing environmental demands, including a certain period of time needed for the change as cost.
To manage these risks, in addition to accelerating the initiatives already underway, we establish a medium- to long-term roadmap for setting and achieving higher goals. We also accelerate the implementation and the disclosure of long-term and sustainable initiatives and measures.
Initiatives for transition risks
Verify the cost-effectiveness of reduction measures and formulate concrete action plans for the entire value chain globally
Clarification of required management resources
Disclosure of easy-to-understand information on GHG emissions, reduction targets, and results in addition to maintaining CDP evaluation
Confirm emission status of major suppliers and reduction measures for GHG reduction in the supply chain to achieve SBT
Early consideration of the priority of switching targets Selection of alternative materials and technologies
Charter of Business Conduct, which was defined to promote respect for human rights as a company-wide initiative in March 2019. We are promoting activities to fulfill our corporate responsibility for respecting human rights in line with this Charter.

Internal activities to disseminate respect for human rights
In order for the respect for human rights to become established as a corporate culture, it is necessary for top management to understand it. Eisai held a training lecture for the Board of Directors and Corporate Officers from an outside expert about responsibility for respecting human rights being required by the international community. In addition, we made every effort to make respect for human rights penetrate the Company by holding training for domestic ENW employees (held 29 times, 6,220 people participated), level-specific training for new employees and organizational managers, and e-learning about business and human rights.

Business with Consideration for the Global Environment
     Eisai conducts business operations seeking coexistence with the global environment. Based on the Eisai Network Companies (ENW) Environmental Protection Policy, all employees recognize the importance of environmental protection and incorporate an environmental perspective in working to solve social issues. In promoting business expansion into countries across the world, Eisai will fulfill its corporate social responsibility by focusing on reducing environmental impact at each stage of business.
Developing a Management System for Protecting the Global Environment
Eisai established the company-wide Environment and Safety Committee as a decision-making body for deliberation of important environmental protection issues. Moreover, Eisai develops its own management system in each of its offices
in an effort to facilitate its environmental activities. At our
major production bases in Japan and overseas, we engage in activities that are based on the acquisition of ISO14001 so that we can check the validity of the environmental management system through external reviews. In addition to observing environment-related laws, ordinances and agreements, we periodically conduct internal environmental audits by an organization specializing in internal auditing to identify and solve issues.

 Eisai is promoting initiatives for the formation of a low-carbon society to help solve the problem of climate change. Eisai is participating in the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society initiated by the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Associations of Japan (FPMAJ), and the Eisai Group in Japan is implementing relevant initiatives based on its own medium- term plan for the reduction of CO2 emissions. More specifically, we aim at reducing domestic CO2 emissions by 23% compared to fiscal 2005 by fiscal 2020.
In fiscal 2016, even though our domestic CO2 emissions increased following the increased number of production and research bases due to the establishment of EA Pharma, the Kawashima Plant drastically reduced its CO2 emissions by taking actions such as proactively introducing energy-saving equipment and improving its operations. As a result, our total CO2 emissions were slightly reduced in fiscal 2016 compared with the previous year. Our domestic CO2 emissions in fiscal 2016 were reduced by 33.1%*1 compared to fiscal 2005.
Furthermore, revenue per CO2 emissions, one of the eco- efficiency indices, has been increasing in recent years as a result of our medium- and long-term efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.

  Company Introduction Management Strategies
Value Creation Activities
Establishment of a Recycling-Oriented Society Zero Emissions Have Been Achieved in Japan for Nine Consecutive Years
Business Base (ESG)
 Eisai is conducting waste disposal with three goals in mind: reduce the amount of waste generated, increase the rate of recycling and decrease the amount of waste sent to landfill. We also sort waste for recycling and select the best waste disposal contractors possible in a timely manner. Furthermore, we are working to process recycling that has value in the market and to reduce disposal costs.
In fiscal 2016, we have domestically attained “zero emissions”, which indicates a ratio of the amount of waste sent to landfill to the total waste of less than 1%, for nine consecutive years.

 In recent years, the number of regions suffering from
severe water shortages due to climate change and other environmental changes has been increasing worldwide and the importance of effective use of water resources is rising year by year.
To handle the risk of water shortages, Eisai tries to secure the quality of water discharged from its plants and laboratories. We perform regular measurement and ensure that the amount of pollutant emissions to domestic waters is below the standard defined by the Water Pollution Control Law and the agreements on pollution prevention. We are also committed to reducing water consumption and drainage and to facilitating the reuse of water. As a result, our water consumption and drainage from our facilities in Japan are decreasing in recent years.
Also, the results of our internal research indicate that the sites of Eisai’s plants and laboratories are not situated in high- risk areas that would force them to suspend operations due to water shortages in the near future.

  Rated “A-” in the CDP* Climate Change Report 2016:
The Highest Rating among the Companies in the Health Care Sector in Japan
 In 2016, the CDP evaluation system rated Eisai as “A-”, which is equivalent to the “Leadership”
level. The CDP evaluation system evaluates the status of implementation of a company’s
environmental management activities on a scale of one to eight (A, A- to D and D-) on four
different levels including leadership, management, recognition and information disclosure.
“Leadership” is the highest level which only the A or A- rated companies can be classified into.
The highest rating for the Japanese health care sector is A-, which only five companies achieved. Also see the following links of CDP for information such as energy-saving activities that may lead to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

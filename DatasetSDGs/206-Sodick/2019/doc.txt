From1976 Genesis–Breakthrough
Founding of Sodick. World’s first NC die-sinker EDM
developed and structure for mass-production established
Sodick was founded in August 1976. When our founder Toshihiko Furukawa left a machine tool manufacturer and established Sodick, initially there were just 24 employees, but their approach of doing whatever it took to solve their customers’ challenges drummed up business and allowed them to get started off on the right foot. In December 1976, Sodick developed and delivered the world’s first NC die-sinker EDM equipped with a microcomputer, and in March of the following year, released the GPC series of power units for NC die-sinker EDMs. In 1980, Sodick constructed its own factory in Fukui, Japan, developing and releasing one EDM after another and outpacing its rivals. Just ten years after its founding, Sodick became the first EDM manufacturer to list on the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
From1988 OverseasExpansion
Promoting globalization of development, production and
sales in five regions worldwide, beginning with Thailand
To address sharp yen appreciation following the Plaza Accord and rising demand overseas, in 1988, Sodick established its first overseas factory, based in Thailand. This now operates as our main factory and forms the central core of the group. In China, Sodick established a software company in 1991 through joint investments with Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai City, and in 1994, we established a factory in Suzhou. In 2006, we established a factory in Xiamen, further expanding our production structure, and we have also established sales centers in Singapore, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In the West, we have deployed sales centers to serve as footholds for exhibiting at international trade fairs, and we have expanded our sales channels.

Formulating Sodick’s long-term management plan “Next Stage 2026 ~Toward Further Growth~”
In 2019, Sodick drew up a long-term management plan, marking 50 years since our founding: “Next Stage 2026 ~ Toward Further Growth ~.“ With this plan, we are aiming for medium-to-long-term sustainable growth in a way that addresses the changes in global society which impact our business. Its goal is to overcome the capital and labor-related business challenges facing machine tool manufacturers, where previously the future outlook has been assessed over a relatively short timeframe. Based on quantitative targets of 125 billion yen in sales and 17 billion yen in operating income by FY2026, we have established policies targeting portfolio reform and stronger governance, capital policy and working style reform, and organizational reform, and we are promoting business activities with the aim of achieving these targets.
  Ongoing development of injection molding machines and metal 3D printers to support future manufacturing
In Japan, we began to take on new product challenges. Drawing on the features of EDMs, which are comprised of a broad range of technologies including electrical, magnetic, chemical, precision measurement technology, and software, Sodick developed ceramics and linear motors in-house. We also started developing and selling consumable goods. In 1989, Sodick advanced into the field of injection molding machines, embodying our philosophy of “resolving customer issues and contributing to manufacturing.“ Since the 2000s, we have continued to develop and release a string of products including nano-machines, NC devices equipped with 3D CAD-CAM functionality, electron beam machines, nano-EDMs, and more that put original in-house technologies such as our linear motors, ceramics, and numerical control to practical use. In recent years, we have made forays into the food processing machinery industry and metal 3D printer field, and were listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2015. In 2018, we completed construction of a multi-factory in the Kaga Office.

 Sodick’s Strengths1 Superiority of core business
  A quest for high-precision processing ―――
Further boosting market share with our industry-leading EDMs as the earnings driver
■Aiming for ever greater precision
in an untiring spirit of development
Sodick’s origins lie in the pioneering spirit of our founder Toshihiko Furukawa, who invented products including nonconsumable electrode circuits. By dramatically enhancing mold machining precision, he alerted the industry to the benefits of EDMs. Sodick inherited this corporate DNA and developed the world’s first NC die-sinker EDM equipped with a microcomputer. As a pioneer of NC EDMs, Sodick has also developed core materials in-house, such as ceramics and linear motors, and has now established its position as the EDM manufacturer with the leading global market share. In recent years, there has been growing interest in Sodick’s products, which make it possible to produce molds of even greater precision. Such molds are performing an essential role in the shift to electric vehicles and support for CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared &
Service, and Electric), as well as in the semiconductors and electronic components used in the era of IoT and 5G.
■Ability to generate added value and cut costs through in-house production and customization
Ever since its founding, Sodick has put its business philosophy into practice, based on the concept: “We create it if it does not exist.” For example, we have produced the hardware for EDMs in-house, such as linear motors that enable high-speed, high-precision movement with low energy consumption, ceramic-made high-rigidity mechanical structural components, and motion controllers. We have also carried out in-house production of the software for NC units – the key to ultra-high-precision and ultra-high-quality machining with high level
responsiveness. For injection molding machines, we have developed proprietary technologies including a direct pressure mold clamping system called the V-LINE® System that enables stable injection volume, and a hybrid system that combines hydraulics with electric motors. By promoting product differentiation, enhancing cost performance and customizability, we are further raising customer satisfaction.
■Sodick’s presence and competitive edge in “manufacturing powerhouse” China
In China, Sodick has built a product development, production and sales structure tailored to local requirements, establishing a sales base in Shanghai in 1991, a manufacturing plant in Suzhou in 1994, a development base in Shanghai in 2003, and a manufacturing plant in Xiamen in 2006. By forging a presence in the Chinese market ahead of our competitors, we were able to establish Sodick’s brand value, so that Sodick became synonymous with high-precision EDMs. China’s mold and die industry has seen remarkable growth since the 2000s, and Sodick has secured a share of the market exceeding 40%. The number of technicians who are skilled in utilizing Sodick products has also increased in line with the large volume of Sodick machines in operation.
We have developed a regional network of sales, service and maintenance offices in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai. And alongside this, we are capturing demand in the Chinese market for high-precision equipment, which is being driven by increased sophistication in manufacturing and rising automation requirements. We are indeed at the threshold of a new growth phases.
Helping to save labor and enhance efficiency in manufacturing through process automation
At Sodick, we are utilizing our proprietary technologies to develop systems capable of automating the various electrical discharge processes. The use, for example, of robots that automatically change electrodes and software that automatically inputs the machining coordinates results in a wide range of benefits, such as greater production efficiency through the saving of labor and improved quality stability.

■Outstanding stability with V-LINE®
Injection molding machines are used across a wide range of fields, including automotive, IT, and medical equipment. In recent years, demand has grown particularly in the high-end market where ultra-high-precision machining is required. To meet these requirements, Sodick’s proprietary V-LINE® injection molding machines ensure that a measured, uniform resin volume is injected into the mold. This enables favorable yields and stable molding without variance, and Sodick’s products have been widely praised for their use in difficult-to-mold applications, including smartphone lenses and connectors, and components in automotive mechanisms.
■Expanded lineup of injection molding machines to support light metals and new materials
Since developing the industry’s first magnesium alloy injection molding machine in 2002, Sodick has gone on to develop a wide range of injection molding machines that support new materials such as carbon-fiber and glass-fiber reinforced plastics, aluminum, as well as silicon. The ALM450, the world’s first high-quality aluminum alloy injection molding machine, employs Sodick’s unique V-LINE® Direct Casting system. It has established a revolutionary manufacturing method that makes it possible to replace materials with aluminum alloy, resolving the issues faced by conventional die-cast manufacturing. Its unique mechanism enables injection into the
mold without the entrainment of air, facilitating even higher quality molding of automotive parts as well as smartphones and other components.
■Metal molds and component machining using metal 3D printers
Metal 3D printers have gained attention for their ability to realize shorter metal mold manufacturing lead times, cut production costs, and reduce the molding cycle. Sodick released a metal 3D printer in 2014, and since then we have expanded our lineup to include models that support large molded objects, and entry models that significantly improve the molding speed. In future, we aim to further enhance ease of maintenance while also setting our sights on the component machining field, and will be focused on expanding sales.
Building an integrated support system
Sodick provides information and after-sales services through service centers both in Japan and overseas, so that customers can use our products with confidence. As well as offering consultation at the time of purchase, we are also building an integrated support system in order to enhance efficiency at the site of operation, including holding regular seminars for customers.

 President’s Message
Review of the first year of the long-term management plan
In February 2019, Sodick launched the long-term management plan “Next Stage 2026 ~Toward Further Growth~,” which will take us to the 50th anniversary of the Company’s founding.
The first year of this ambitious plan was extremely challenging. In the December 2019 fiscal year, the prolonged trade friction between China and the United States produced markedly reduced activity in the Chinese market, which accounts for roughly 30% of our sales. Automobile sales in China—the world’s largest automobile market—fell sharply, and electronic component and smartphone sales also plummeted. China’s economic conditions had repercussions throughout global supply chains, and many companies suspended capital investment plans. Corporate revenue dwindled as companies reduced their factory operating rates amid falling orders. At the same, fixed costs escalated as the active investments to increase production capacity in recent years led to higher depreciation costs. These factors all combined to create powerful headwinds to profit performance.
In the second half of 2018, we recognized that a decline trend was materializing and at the start of fiscal 2019 we projected that our unit sales for the year would contract by about 20% from the previous year. But the conditions turned out to be even worse than we anticipated, and our unit sales ended up declining by closer to 40% for the year. As a result, our performance for the December 2019 fiscal year included declines of nearly 20% year on year in net sales and over 60% in operating income, ordinary income, and profit.
I expect the business environment to continue to be relatively unstable in the year ahead. It is also difficult to estimate the impact on the global society from COVID-19, which began spreading worldwide in February 2020.
Proactively investing in long-term growth even during the current severe conditions
At the same time, I see several areas of promise. The demand for 5G-related base stations, terminals, and other devices that started to pick up in summer 2019 offers opportunities for us to leverage our strength in precision processing products for new business growth. We also expect stricter environmental regulations and advances in developing electric automobiles to increase demand for lightweight, high-precision plastic automotive parts.
While the business conditions are fraught with uncertainty, my mission in any environment is to steadily expand our business and advance toward the Next Stage 2026 targets of 125 billion yen in sales and 17 billion yen in operating income by fiscal 2026. These targets may seem ambitious given our recent performance. Nevertheless, despite the adverse conditions, we can achieve them if all employees unite to fulfill the motto that has driven Sodick’s growth from the beginning— to “create” and “implement” new value for the world and “overcome difficulties” one at a time. I am approaching the changing environment as a growth opportunity and will seek to make quick management decisions based on careful assessment of business risk.
We are committed to generating business growth for the long term, and our dedication to this commitment is evident in the 6.5 billion yen in capital investment we conducted even while orders were falling. When the business conditions recover again, as they surely will, we will be ready with newly constructed technical centers in Singapore and the United Kingdom, a new sales company for the food processing machinery segment in Shanghai, and enhanced production capacity for the die molding and ceramics businesses. We are also continuing to invest in our core businesses of EDMs and injection molding machines as well as in next-generation equipment, such as metal 3D printers.
 We are dedicated to our founding spirit to “Create” , “Implement” and “Overcome Difficulties” using our technologies and manufacturing techniques to support a sustainable society and a prosperous future.

 President’s Message
The key to our long-term strategies is using manufacturing technology to resolve customer and social issues
Increasingly sophisticated manufacturing technologies is raising demand for
high-end machines
Manufacturing will require components that are increasingly higher precision, miniaturized, smaller, lighter, and stronger; and the machine tools that make those parts will have to provide even greater precision. The EDM market is already a mature market, but the demand for higher-precision manufacturing capabilities is creating an increasingly rapid shift in the market from low-end to high-end machine tools. The demand base for machine tools is also widening, and we anticipate growing demand similar to that occurring in countries like India and Mexico where industrial growth is gaining momentum. Sodick will use its highly sophisticated technological capabilities to offer higher-precision capabilities and further enhance our customer support to meet the manufacturing needs of a broader base of customers.
Molding is becoming increasingly complex
and demanding
Sodick began making injection molding machines to meet customer needs for difficult-to-make molds. The skills we acquired while meeting those needs led to the development of our V-LINE® System and our proprietary technologies. In addition to the molds themselves, manufacturers are increasingly demanding machine tools capable of handling lighter materials and that improve the environmental performance of manufacturing processes. Magnesium and aluminum are gaining much attention as lightweight materials for molded parts. We already offer machines capable of processing magnesium, and we are progressing from the testing stage to the mass production stage for aluminum molding machine. Aluminum parts are in high demand from the automobile and other industries, and we see potential to create a market for aluminum molding equipment as replacements for die-cast machines.
We are also designing equipment capable of handling environmental friendly materials and have developed a molding machine for biodegradable plastics. We plan to continue developing machines for various applications.
Helping everyone enjoy
“convenient and delicious” food
Japan is currently the primary market for the food processing machinery segment, which offers noodle-making machines and sterile-packed cooked rice production systems primarily for the convenience store, supermarket, and restaurant industries. However, our global sales are steadily rising, particularly in China and Asia, due to growing demand for higher food quality and increased food safety and security as well as for food manufacturing automation and labor-saving equipment. We established a sales company in Shanghai in 2019 to boost the sales growth in China and greater Asia and plan to begin noodle-making machines production at the Amoy Plant in Xiamen in 2020.
Food manufacturers combine various types of machines in their plants as they seek to produce tasty and high quality food. Most of the companies that make food processing machinery are small. We are the only maker of food processing machinery able to meet the total machinery needs of the food manufacturers. We are leveraging this advantage by proposing plant equipment systems using our proprietary technology that scientifically examines food flavors. We are further combining this with the competence we have cultivated in other businesses to engineer and propose solutions across the entire food production line.
The potential of metal 3D printer technology
The potential of metal 3D printers is drawing increasing interest, and some companies are already eagerly using them to produce prototype parts. At this point, however, sales of the printers are being inhibited by their still-high prices, the still-early stage of the technology, and export restrictions. Nevertheless, metal 3D printers promise to significantly streamline metal mold manufacturing processes and shorten the molding cycle, and they are destined to become essential to manufacturing process in the medium and long term for their ability to increase productivity and improve labor saving. While promoting their advantages for mass production processes, we will continue advancing R&D in speeding up the metal 3D printer molding process and increasing the variety of usable metal powders. We intend to be perfectly positioned with leading products when demand for metal 3D printers in mass production systems begins to accelerate.
Our strengths are in the technologies we have cultivated and the products we have created, which enable us to provide total support for all manufacturing processes upstream and downstream, from product design to metal cast and product molding. We will continue to develop optimal solutions that resolve customer production issues and fulfill their requests across the complete production process.
Strengthening ESG initiatives that will appear in future finance
While advancing the growth strategy and aligning earnings to a growth trajectory, management is incorporating environment,
society, and governance (ESG) initiatives to strengthen R&D, human resource development, environmental performance, and governance with a view to the medium and long term. At the same time, there is great interest among companies and societies about the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which will be blended into corporate growth strategies. Sodick has always emphasized environmentally sound operations and human resource development, and we fully understand the importance of further strengthening the ESG aspects of our growth strategies for the future.
Environmental performance has always been a focus for us. Our products do more than mechanizing and automating work. Our automated production systems and metal 3D printers consolidate and automate multiple processes, thereby saving energy and resources as well as improving safety in the production stages, which is part of the social responsibility of our customers. As I stated earlier, one of our current focuses is helping customers answer the call to eliminate plastic content by developing molding machines capable of handling biodegradable plastics.
We are also prioritizing creating worksites that support a diverse workforce. A healthy work environment and fully developed personnel systems are essential to attracting and retaining talented employees. In fiscal 2019, we took a series of steps to enhance our corporate systems, including revising the salary structure to better recognize a person’s capabilities, updating our employee training programs for the digital transformation (DX) era, renovating the employee cafeteria, and arranging our IT system to accommodate telework and facilitate shortened work hours so we can offer a variety of workstyle options. These systems will continue to be improved through employee surveys, and we will continue seeking ways to enhance employee engagement.
In these uncertain times, as a company manager I will continue to listen carefully to our various stakeholders while making the important decisions that will lead to the sustainable growth of our Company.
I greatly appreciate your continued support.

Investing in R&D for the medium and long term
The prolonged US-China trade friction and COVID-19 pandemic have cast a large shadow over our earnings prospects. In these times, we believe it is essential to adhere to our roadmap and continue steadily investing in R&D to ensure we fulfill the medium- and long-term vision for the Company. We plan to spend 3.4 billion yen on R&D in the December 2020 fiscal year, approximately the same level as in the previous year.
To fulfill our vision, we will continue researching solutions related to the electrification of automobiles and to realize CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Service, and Electric) vehicles, including ways to achieve the fine processing needed to improve electrical efficiency and communication quality and to create the large molds needed to produce combined single-piece bumper and body parts. We will also step up development of high value-added products for the aerospace and other industries. We will also concentrate on developing new elemental technologies for the mechanism elements that will open the door to new potential for motion controllers and the next-generation of computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines. In injection molding machines for light metals, such as aluminum and magnesium that are increasingly being used to lighten vehicles, we are stepping up the development of a specialized coating that will eliminate mold erosion, which often affects the quality of mass-produced parts.
We are also integrating the SDGs to our business management to align our business growth by addressing social issues. We have been working on creating an injection molding machine for our V-LINE® System capable of stable forming biodegradable plastic and are successfully creating molds made of bio-based materials. We expect demand for these machines to steadily grow and are working with our marketing department to promote their use.

A year of reassessing our business risks
Sodick has had a global mindset from early in its business development and actively markets its products and support services in the five regions of Japan, the Americas, Europe, China, and Asia. Overseas sales have grown to over 60% of our total sales, and sales in China, which is our biggest market for molds, are growing each year as industries pursue more sophisticated manufacturing. In fiscal 2018, China accounted for over 60% of the total sales of our core line of EDMs on a unit basis.
Overall sales slowed in the fiscal year to December 2019 and EDM orders from China slipped to less roughly half of total orders. The sluggish market conditions were due to the prolonged trade friction between the United States and China and China’s slower economic growth, which affected the global economy and led many companies to postpone capital investment plans. We anticipate the severe business conditions to continue in 2020, as corporate capital expenditure has stalled worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Achieving balanced growth
Sales to China and sales of our core products have been the main drivers of our earnings growth in recent years, but the recent developments have reminded us of the risk presented by over-relying on these two areas. We are accordingly seeking to develop marketing and sales strategies carefully tailored to each product, customer, and market. Although the outlook for global demand for machining equipment is uncertain, the pursuit of connected, autonomous, shared & service, and electric (CASE) and
mobility as a service (MaaS) technologies presents a once-in-a-century transformation in the automotive industry and the steady stream of new IoT- and 5G-enabled equipment and terminals offers new opportunities in other industries. Our strengths in miniaturized and high-precision products are essential to both of these trends, and we believe they have potential to support significant growth for the Company in the medium and long term.
We have been preparing for this scenario in the past several years by putting in place a worldwide network of regional sales offices. In the United States in 2018 and in the United Kingdom in 2019, we established technical centers with fully equipped showrooms and after-sales service functions. To promote adoption of the latest manufacturing techniques, in 2019, we also set up a technical center in Singapore offering complete consulting services, contracted processing, and sales and maintenance support to customers using metal 3D printers to make molds. In addition, we established a sales company in Shanghai to promote our food processing machinery business, which is our third-largest earnings driver.
We are cultivating close relations with customers in each of our business regions and by actively sharing and communicating information about our products, technologies, and after-sales support services, we are able to quickly respond to changes in each market and generate continuing business growth.
  Breakdown of Net Sales by Region
 A clear developmental roadmap
Sodick applies its R&D network linking operations in Japan, China, and North America to develop products and systems with the world’s highest processing accuracy and speeds that meet the full range of functions needed by our customers. Every year, our executive managers from the United States, China, and the advanced research centers in Japan gather at our headquarters for a Joint Technical Meeting and lay out a 10-year roadmap for the Company. In addition, a Technical Meeting is held each month to monitor our progress. Our on-the-ground presence in Silicon Valley in the United States enables us to stay on top of the latest technologies and develop next-generation motion controllers with state-of-the-art IoT and AI control technologies. In Shanghai, China we are focusing our R&D activities on developing software incorporating human interface technology.

Global production strategy
Financial strategy
  Reduced plant utilization rates
Sodick’s business spans the five regions of Japan, the Americas, Europe, China, and Asia, and overseas sales represent 60% of our total sales. These global production operations are supplied by our plants in Japan, Thailand, and Suzhou and Xiamen in China that enable us to flexibly meet the needs in each market.
In 2019, we were compelled to lower the utilization rates and reduce the output of all plants owing to the persisting trade friction between the United States and China from the previous year and a worldwide decline in demand for smartphones and automobiles. At the same time, higher fixed costs due to depreciation from our capital investments in recent years and high prices for parts at our core Thailand Plant also worked to erode profits. In addition, due to the spread of COVID-19, at one point we suspended operations at our two plants in China in February 2020 and were operating only our plants in Thailand and Japan.
Using our strengths to fortify our systems
In these conditions, we will continue advancing measures to improve our profitability by lowering costs and reviewing our supply sources. In the challenging business conditions, our high ratio of in-house production minimized the impact of the Chinese factory shutdown and the Kaga multi-factory, which started operation in 2018, helped us to continue producing various products. This organizational resilience is one of our strengths, and we will continue seeking to make it even stronger. In the precision die and mold business, we are constructing automated production lines and cell production lines incorporating our metal 3D printers and specialized MR30 molding machines. In the ceramics business, last year, we built kiln equipment capable of accommodating long products. In addition to these in-house technologies, we are also actively adapting our manufacturing technologies, such as the automation and labor-saving technologies at our Kaga multi-factory, for our overseas factories and incorporating the latest 5G, IoT, and AI technologies. We are seeking to formulate production systems with the ability to flexibly and efficiently respond to changes in market conditions.
We are also taking steps to improve production efficiency and reduce costs. In China, we are forming plans to manufacture injection molding machines and set up a sales company to meet growing demand and support business expansion for the food processing machinery segment in China and the Asia region. We are also considering options to increase our local production ratio in the region.
We will continue to bring together our vast range of in-house cultivated manufacturing technologies, expertise, and groundbreaking digital technologies to create a production structure that is highly resilient to changes in the market conditions.

Executive Managing Director, Corporate Division
Strengthening our financial position and investing for long-term growth
In the December 2019 fiscal year, we continued to make capital investments, including establishing technical centers in the United Kingdom and Singapore and expanding ceramic production capacity in Japan. These investments caused only a slight increase in fixed assets from the previous fiscal year, but the substantial declines in trade receivables and inventory assets led to total assets contracting by approximately 4.4 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year.
We continue to steadily pay down interest-bearing debt, and net interest-bearing debt decreased by approximately 1.2 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year. In terms of equity capital, our financial position remained solid as the debt-to-equity ratio improved to 0.69x and the equity ratio rose to 51.2%, bringing it near the industry average.
Investing in our businesses for long-term growth
The machine tool industry still has room to grow in several geographic regions and the rapid sophistication of manufacturing technology also promises to generate demand worldwide. We are approaching this outlook by continuing to make investments for growth while also fortifying our position against business risks. In the December 2020 fiscal year, we plan to invest approximately 4.5 billion yen to expand production capacity at the Amoy Plant in Xiamen, China and Kaga Office in Japan and to automate and improve the efficiency of the precision die and mold business. We have also earmarked roughly 3.4 billion yen for R&D to develop metal 3D printers, precision machining centers, light metal injection molding machines, food processing machinery, and related elemental technologies into full-fledged businesses alongside the EDM business.
We will continue actively investing for business growth while maintaining a balanced and strong financial position.
To date, our financial policy has been to utilize our financial resources while maintaining ROE at 8% or higher, and we consider that level to be the absolute minimum as we conduct our strategic and growth investments. We will continue to construct a foundation for stable growth so we can achieve our target ROE of 10 –12%.
Our plan for returning profits to shareholders is to allocate capital while maintaining a sufficient balance of growth investment and, while considering our earnings performance, to maintain dividend on equity ratio of 2% or higher as we incrementally raise the payout ratio to 30%.

  Overview of year ended December 2019
Demand remained solid in the North American aerospace and medical equipment-related industries. However, the impact of prolonged US-China trade friction on China—Sodick’s biggest market—and other countries around the world resulted in more companies postponing capital expenditure in a wide range of sectors, including automotive, smartphones and electronic components. This led to a significant reduction in EDM sales volumes. Segment profits also registered a steep year-on-year decline due to a drop in factory utilization rates associated with the lower sales volumes and an increase in fixed costs. In research and development, Sodick developed the “AG200L” die-sinker EDM, which supports machining of large-sized and more complex molds, where demand has been growing in recent years especially in auto-related industries. In marketing activities, Sodick participated in numerous exhibitions worldwide, including CIMT 2019 (China International Machine Tool Show), EMO 2019 (European machine tool trade show), and MECT 2019 (Mechatronics Technology Japan exhibition), enhancing the visibility of the Sodick brand and expanding sales. We also established the Singapore Techno Centre to support cutting-edge manufacturing in the ASEAN region, bolstering our sales structure.
Outlook and strategy for year ending December 2020
The machine tool segment is well positioned to benefit from latent demand for high-precision machinery resulting from increased sophistication in manufacturing, especially in the automotive, IT, and electronic components sectors, primarily in China. However, the ongoing US-China trade friction is expected to drag on the global economy, and we anticipate weak results for the segment. In addition, the recent spread of COVID-19 worldwide is affecting production and business activities, and there are also concerns about disruption to supply chains. This has led to increased uncertainty about the market outlook. Given these conditions, Sodick will focus on cost reductions, greater production efficiency and business streamlining. At the same time, we will work to expand sales of our products with a particular focus on demand for high-precision equipment, including the longer-term diffusion of CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Service, and Electric) in the automotive industry, next-generation 5G, and automation and productivity enhancements.

   Overview of year ended December 2019
As well as companies in Japan and around the world postponing capital expenditure due to US-China trade friction, demand related to the mainstay smartphone and electronic components business was flat, both in Japan, China and other regions of Asia, and sales volumes decreased. On the other hand, we have seen demand in domestic auto-related industries, and demand has also started to emerge in relation to optical lens molding and next-generation 5G communications infrastructure development. Segment profits fell significantly year-on-year owing to factors including increased R&D expenses and one-off costs associated with participation in exhibitions. In research and development, Sodick developed the “VT50” 490 kN (50 ton) vertical single-acting type injection molding machine, which further enhances productivity using V-LINE®’s stable precision molding technology. This model contributes to improvement in productivity in the precision molding field, including narrow-pitch and low-profile precision connectors where demand is growing in fields such as autonomous driving, sensing, and 5G communications.
Outlook and strategy for year ending December 2020
Like the machine tool segment, the industrial machinery segment is well positioned to benefit from latent demand for high-precision machinery resulting from increased sophistication in manufacturing, especially in China—Sodick’s largest market—in sectors including IT, electronic components, and automotive. However, capital expenditure demand is expected to remain weak due to factors including a slowdown in the global economy resulting from prolonged US-China trade friction, and the spread of COVID-19. Under these circumstances, Sodick is aiming for an overseas sales ratio of at least 70%, and will implement a variety of measures over the medium- to long-term. In product development, Sodick has developed light metal injection molding machines and we are working toward mass production. In marketing activities, we are strengthening our sales structure in growth markets including Europe and India, expanding sales of the automated production system “ICF- V,” and providing solutions services such as preventive maintenance and status management using IoT and AI. And in production activities, we are focused on increasing the ratio of overseas production and implementing cost-cutting measures including the use of standardized components.

Successful production of 5.5 m ceramics product, among the longest in the world
 In recent years, precision machinery and equipment, exemplified by ultraprecision (nano) machining equipment and LCD panel manufacturing equipment, has seen a switch to ceramic structures, as conventional metal structures cannot meet customers’ precision requirements. In 2019, Sodick F.T’s Kaga Plant succeeded in manufacturing a 5.5 m-long ceramics product, much longer than the 4 m length that was previously possible, making it among the longest in the world. Sodick aims to continue expanding sales by incorporating innovative technologies that fulfill the demands of the times, and internalize production so as to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. This will enable us to better respond to increased demand for products used in manufacturing equipment, and to strengthen our capacity to supply larger-sized products.

Message from External Directors
I will continue to identify ways to utilize Sodick’s extensive expertise to further develop our technologies for the future.
I am committed to executing sound governance centered on sustainability.
  Katsuhisa Furuta External Director
I have served as an external director for Sodick for four years. My professional experience is in control systems engineering, such as mechanical control and robot control, and in administrating operations at a university; I actually have no previous corporate experience before joining the Company. Since becoming an external director, I have learned so much about Sodick’s business and technology as well as its general management through the extensive preparatory materials provided for the Board meetings, numerous tours of the Company’s factories in Japan and overseas, e-learning courses on governance, and several workshops. The many opportunities I have had at the meetings of the Board of Directors to receive the reports from the directors in charge of business execution and to hear the status and audit reports about the internal controls for the corporate group and all its subsidiaries have greatly deepened my understanding of the Company. These experiences allow me to make informed recommendations to the
Board of Directors about the stakeholder view of corporate soundness and transparency and provide meaningful input to the Board’s discussions.
My current duties include serving on the Advisory Committee on Personnel and the Advisory Committee on Compensation. The Board’s current makeup includes a wonderful mix of diverse individuals, and I intend to encourage them to formulate a clear succession plan. The Advisory Committee on Compensation discusses and determines compensation levels for directors based factors including their business execution performance, management content, and contribution to the business. Last year, the Company fell short of its profit targets, and the compensation amounts were lowered for representative directors and directors in charge of business execution.
As I fulfill my duties as an external director, I intend to continue actively providing recommendations informed by my technological expertise. The remarkable development of information and communications technology has created an era in which companies that are unable to keep pace with the major social and technological changes can quickly become redundant. I believe the metal 3D printers that Sodick is developing into a core business offer much promise, and I have been encouraging the Company to be very proactive about boosting their attractiveness to a whole range of potential customers. My urging led the Company to set up the online Sodick Additive website with videos showing the printers’ capabilities. I believe the site will help widen recognition of the features of the latest metal 3D printer “LPM325” to an audience of engineers beyond the Company’s current followers. This is just one example of Sodick’s numerous excellent technologies and products. I will recommend that more opportunities be created for informal discussions with the technical engineers so I can provide deeper discussions with the Board of Directors about ways to apply the Company’s technologies, information communication methods, ideas for new applications, and suggestions for new management plans.
Kenzo Nonami External Director
I am the founder of Autonomous Control Systems Laboratory (ACSL), a maker of unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones. When we launched in 2013, we were a university-backed venture company and listed on TSE Mothers in 2018. I served as the chairman of ACSL until 2019. While at the ACSL, in April 2016 we brought in external directors from Rakuten and University of Tokyo Edge Capital due to the increase in third-party allotments. At the time, an external director was a representative of a major shareholder brought in to watch over a start-up company and with the clear purpose of helping increase capital gains when a young company listed on the stock market. Unlike a director assigned by a venture capital firm, I consider it important to provide general management advice, and I am constantly thinking about my role and how to fulfill this mission. I have switched sides from bringing in an external director to being an external director myself at Sodick.
I believe Sodick has given me the responsibility of providing guidance from my experience in venture capital and as a standard external director, which gives me the opportunity to apply my insights from the point of view of an external director.
As we all know, external directors play an important role in strengthening corporate governance. We participate in meetings of a company’s highest decision-making body, the Board of Directors, and offer advice to management that is objective, professional, and based on experience. Independence is essential for an external director so we can represent shareholders to ensure proper legal compliance, corporate social responsibility, and risk management and make certain that management aligns with their interests and is acting to increase corporate value. At the same time, the question arises as to how suitable an external director’s advice can be since they are not directly involved in the company’s business. At ACSL, having that objective perspective helped the Board of Directors hear sound advice and overcome the risk that could occur when a person or company has been in an industry so long that their vision becomes too shortsighted, or when the norm in the industry veers away from the common sense in society. I believe that is where external directors are invaluable.
Sodick’s founder Toshihiko Furukawa overcame many difficulties to build the world’s leading company in EDM, and the Company continues expanding its business with injection molding machines, machining centers, linear motors, metal 3D printers, and food processing machinery. As the business grows, my mission is to tap into the passion of the Company’s founder and to find ways to imbue that spirit into the company’s management structure and link it to employee motivation. I will continue to do my utmost to provide governance for a healthy growth process aimed at realizing a sustainable company and society.

Corporate Governance
   Composition of Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board
Sodick believes that in order for the Board of Directors to perform its role and duties effectively, it needs to comprise members with sufficient knowledge and experience of business management in their respective fields, whether they come from inside or external the company. We select candidate directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members based on the type of knowledge and experience we consider to be important from a corporate management perspective.
Based on this approach, the directors and auditors we have appointed as of end-March 2020 are as shown in the table.

Corporate Governance
Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Officer Compensation
Basic Policy on Officer Compensation
– Compensation for officers is based on a compensation system that reflects job position and results while ensuring linkage to company performance, taking into consideration the management issues of sustainable growth and medium- to long-term corporate value enhancement.
– Compensation for external directors and auditors is based on a compensation system that is not affected by company performance, thereby ensuring independence from management.
Structure of Officer Compensation
Compensation for directors comprises basic compensation and performance-related compensation.
– Basic compensation is made up of role-related compensation,
management/operations compensation and a sum based on
personal contribution to performance. –Performance-related compensation comprises the following
elements: as an incentive for contribution to short-term performance, an amount of monetary compensation calculated by multiplying basic compensation by a performance evaluation coefficient configured according to profit attributable to owners of the parent; and as an incentive for contribution to medium- to long-term corporate value enhancement, a monetary compensation receivable is provided according to the director’s role (excluding external directors), and stock compensation with restriction on transfer is supplied by way of an allocation of treasury shares according to the amount of this receivable.
Method of Determining Officer Compensation
The amount of compensation for each director is deliberated and decided at an Advisory Committee on Compensation, made up of three external directors and two internal directors appointed by the Board of Directors. The Advisory Committee on Compensation develops the compensation system for directors and considers revisions, and deliberates on the evaluation results
    Every fiscal year, all directors perform a self-evaluation regarding the extent to which they have fulfilled their professional duties. This is carried out to verify that Sodick’s Board of Directors is performing its professional duties in accordance with our guidelines, in order to

and the suitability of the amount of basic compensation / performance-related compensation of each director.
Policy for Determining Supply Ratio
Performance-related compensation of directors is supplied to each individual according to their respective results and performance, on the basis of the expected results for each job position and applicable duties. Therefore, the higher the position and the more important the contribution to performance of the applicable duties, the higher the allocation of performance-related compensation. A high level of results and performance is expected.
–Short-term performance-related compensation is calculated by applying a pre-determined performance-related coefficient to basic compensation, if the profit attributable to owners of parent within the consolidated income plans drawn up each year exceeds a certain amount.
Compensation for external directors and auditors is supplied only as role-related compensation from within basic compensation, which is not affected by company performance.
– Medium- to long-term performance-related compensation is determined by proportional distribution in line with the basic amount for each director’s position and duties (excluding external directors), after determining the total sum of the monetary compensation receivable provided as shares based on 3-year average performance.
Compensation for external directors is a fixed amount, and no performance-related compensation is provided.
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
The following KPIs are used to calculate performance-related compensation: for short-term performance-related compensation, profit attributable to owners of the parent; and for medium- to long-term performance-related compensation, 3-year average EBITDA.

   Sodick implements the following in order to ensure that its directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members are able to perform their functions and roles appropriately.
(1) Newly appointed directors and auditors take part in training provided by the Japan Audit & Supervisory Board Members Association.
(2) Independent external directors and independent external auditors are kept informed about Sodick’s business activities and visit key business sites, etc., and are also updated on our business strategies where appropriate.
(3) Other directors, auditors, and executive officers also acquire the knowledge needed to enhance corporate value, and learn
about the approaches taken to this, through methods such as
e-learning provided by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Opportunities are provided for executive officers and others to
participate in management, such as through business report meetings, in order to cultivate successor personnel. In addition, we implement initiatives aimed at developing human resources at the executive management level, including training for executive managers covering areas such as drawing up long-term business strategies. However, as there is scope for further discussion concerning successor planning and training, the training system and the content of this, the Board of Directors will continue to hold discussions on this area.

ESG Initiatives
Environmental Initiatives
The Hokuriku region, where Sodick has a production base, is a place where traditional culture exists in symbiosis with beautiful natural surroundings. In our work of developing and manufacturing a large number of products in this well-favored region, we have come to realize that treating the natural environment with care is a practice that in itself leads to richness in the lives of the people.
CO2 Reduction Initiatives to Tackle Climate Change
 Sodick’s Policies and Structures
Sodick has established systems for promoting quality, the environment and safety, from the perspective of Total Quality Management (TQM), in order to realize a sustainable society through manufacturing. As part of this process, we have formulated a “QVP+ Companywide Policy,” and have rolled out QVP+ activities* to our bases in Japan and overseas in order to reform and improve operations. At a global presentation event led by top management, our Group companies and departments review the previous fiscal year’s activities in the light of their respective priority issues, reflect on these, and set targets for the new fiscal year. This leads to continuous improvements that take medium- and long-term targets into account.
All of Sodick’s bases in Japan have obtained the international ISO 14001:2015 standard for environmental management systems. They operate while conducting ongoing reviews and improvements and confirming the effectiveness of systems.
Promoting Green Procurement
In May 2000, the Japanese government enacted the Act on Promoting Green Purchasing. This law was established to actively promote green procurement based on the perspective that demand-side initiatives were of equal importance to supply-side initiatives when it comes to forming a recycling-oriented society. It encourages procurement with a priority on goods that have a small environmental impact while still bearing in mind the unique features of a given business, the strength and durability required, the preservation of functionality, and cost considerations.
Our Green Procurement Standards took effect in November 2017, and prescribe selection criteria for suppliers and the items procured. These criteria also clarified the activities and surveys needed in order to fulfill our Green Procurement Standards. Additionally, we carried out a survey on our suppliers covering locations within Japan and overseas. We have also established a structure that is capable of handling situations such as earthquakes and data falsification by manufacturers.
In conjunction with this, Sodick is creating its own
Structure for Promoting Quality, the Environment & Safety
Amid rising global concern surrounding social issues centered on the climate and energy, the Paris Agreement, in which countries came together to mitigate global warming, and the SDGs set out by the UN, are drawing growing attention. In Japan, compliance with the energy conservation law will be required by 2030, and Sodick is setting its sights on the use of natural energy. Solar power systems have been installed on rooftops at our Head Office and at the Miyazaki Office of Sodick F.T.
In our offices, initiatives are being promoted to reduce CO2, including effective use of the “Cool Biz” energy-saving campaign (cooler business attire to cut down on air conditioning usage) and teleconference systems. The introduction of teleconference systems at our domestic offices and overseas subsidiaries reduces travel for meetings and business discussions, thereby helping to reduce energy consumption.

Sodick is actively engaged in the development of products and technologies that contribute to high efficiency, lower consumption of energy and resources, and waste reduction.
By supplying environmentally sound products and technologies, we are helping to reduce the global environmental footprint and protect the global environment.

Tsubame Wire Plus
The world’s first electrode wire, adapted to used-wire recycling systems, developed and manufactured in-house. Built using high-quality and high-precision production processes to offer superior straightness and an extremely smooth surface quality. It fully elicits machining performance that is highly reliable.
Eco-Ion R
An ion exchange resin system included with wire-cut EDMs (water specification), with an extended operating life making it well suited to long-duration machining. Its 18-L capacity is approximately twice that of conventional types. The “canister” itself is replaceable, so there is no need to perform the work of refilling the resin. This makes for an environmentally-friendly product.

Granule Powder Cooling System
Quickly and evenly cools granular raw materials including wheat flour, buckwheat flour and rice flour. Improves the dough quality and shortens cooling time in fields including noodle-making, bread and confectionery production, and also significantly cuts power consumption for cooling.

Biodegradable Plastic Molding Technology Initiatives
Research and development of plastics that biodegrade in natural conditions such as soil and water is currently drawing attention. Biodegradable plastic is a type of plastic that eventually breaks down completely into a natural by-product (such as carbon dioxide and water) through the action of microorganisms that exist in the natural world. This helps to resolve the problem of microplastics, which remain when plastic waste does not break down naturally, and by becoming progressively smaller are difficult to recover.
Sodick’s injection molding machines employ the V-LINE® System, a unique mechanism that separates the processes of plasticization and injection. This system demonstrates outstanding performance in terms of the stability of the melted state and heat stability during injection, contributing to stable manufacturing of products made from biodegradable plastics.

Since our founding, Sodick has expanded its operations under the motto of “Create,” “Implement,” and “Overcome Difficulties.” The very mettle and ability to take action possessed by each and every one of our employees provides the backbone for this endeavor. All of our employees – not just our technical staff, but also our sales and management personnel – maintain a high level of motivation at their respective stages in the process, and are actively engaged in their work as specialists.
The diversity of our workforce, with employees offering different perspectives and values, is conducive to further globalizing our business. Based on this thinking, Sodick is promoting efforts to employ a wide-ranging workforce that includes foreign nationals, the disabled, and senior citizens. Furthermore, we are also working hard to create an environment in which women can continue to flourish in the workplace after they marry and have children.

Encouraging Women in the Workforce
Sodick is striving to create an environment that allows our employees to balance work with child-rearing. We want to ensure that they can take maternity or parental leave and then return to their previous departments and positions. As a result of our initiatives, women are actively taking maternity and parental leave, with a 100% return-to-work ratio in the past five years. We are also encouraging male employees to take parental leave and they are gradually becoming more aware of this opportunity.
Sodick has drawn up an action plan to enable female employees to shine in a variety of fields, and the percentage of female new hires between 2015 and 2019 was 26.5%. We will continue working hard to promote women in the workforce, while supporting all our employees in achieving their own work-life balance.
Hiring Disabled Workers
Sodick itself is also making efforts to actively hire disabled persons and create an environment that broadly promotes such hiring goals in order to provide them with stability. In fiscal 2019, the percentage of disabled employees was 2.5%. In addition, we have invested in KIBI NC training center Corp., an enterprise that uses the latest machine tools to conduct skills-development training for the physically disabled with the goal of helping them to become socially independent.

Sodick was quick to adopt a global perspective in developing its business. Around 70% of our employees are currently working overseas, and the Company has also actively sought out non-Japanese hires.
Having foreign national employees will be absolutely indispensable for our efforts to further globalize our business in the future. Understanding their perspectives and thinking is extremely important when it comes to understanding the unique characteristics of each part of the world. This is also conducive to promoting the strategies pursued at our overseas sites and in developing and strengthening our marketing networks. We are also striving to hire locally for executive positions at our overseas sites as part of our overall goal of making optimal use of global human resources. Women are also serving as presidents at some of these overseas locations.

Starting on April 1, 2018, Sodick uniformly set the retirement age as the first March 31st after the employee’s 65th birthday, and also introduced our Senior Program which allows workers to select a diverse array of work styles at the age of sixty. From the first March 31st after they turn sixty, we limit factors in response to employees’ changing circumstances, such as their working hours, number of work days, work duties, and work locations. This establishes an environment in which they can work with peace of mind. We are striving to revitalize our organization through the realization of dual-track career paths, by giving broad consideration to extending the retirement age, career planning for each individual employee, and the Company’s HR strategy.

ESG Initiatives
Creating a Comfortable Workplace Environment
The organization of the workplace environment is closely correlated with enhancing our employees’ approach to their work. At Sodick, we are working to achieve a workplace environment where all employees can stay highly motivated and work with peace of mind. Maintaining a favorable workplace environment serves to keep new hire retention rates high and establish a foundation that facilitates the nurturing of outstanding human resources.
Maintaining and Improving the Office Environment
Since 2018, we have renovated our office environment, including refurbishing the office, dining hall and cafeteria on the third floor of Head Office, and completing a second Head Office building and the Kaga multi-factory. The provision of a new office environment has increased our employees’ motivation.
Comprehensive Benefits Packages
Sodick strives to offer comprehensive benefits packages and relevant facilities so that our employees can attend to their duties without worrying about their daily lives or health.
As part of this, the Company offers financial incentives amounting to 20% of its employee stock ownership plan, provides regular health examinations, and offers financial assistance for cancer examinations using positron emission tomography (PET), a treatment technique that has been
Initiatives for Social and Cultural Activities
Supporting the Preservation of
Katanokamoike Wetland
As part of our regional contribution activities, Sodick made a donation to the “Machi, Hito, Shigoto” (town, people, work) regional revitalization program run by Kaga city in Ishikawa Prefecture, supporting grass-cutting and bamboo fence maintenance in Katanokamoike. Although only a small lake of around 10 hectares (100,000 m2), Katanokamoike is renowned for its abundant nature and coexistence with people, and in 1993 it was registered under the Ramsar Convention as an internationally important wetland. Through such initiatives, we will continue working to ensure that our business activities are rooted in the local community.
Katanokamoike
much talked about recently, among other benefits. Also, in terms of facilities for employees to refresh themselves, Sodick has resort houses in Yatsugatake and Miyazaki, and has concluded corporate contracts that allow for preferential treatment at designated theme parks and similar facilities.
Promoting Club Activities
At the Sodick Group, club activities including tennis, marathon running, cycling, futsal, badminton, and golf are very popular. They serve to promote employees’ wellbeing, encourage interaction with employees from other departments, and promote sports in the local area. In September 2019, the Sumo club based in Kaga city in Ishikawa Prefecture won first prize in the second group section of the “61st All-Japan Corporate Sumo Tournament” held at the Sumo Hall of the Saitama Kenritsu Budokan.
 Promoting Health Management
Our employees are at the very heart of the Company, and ensuring that they stay healthy in mind and body, and can work in an energetic manner, is crucial when it comes to the Company’s growth. Creating a management structure and providing safety and sanitation training that conform to the Industrial Safety and Health Act protects our employees from dangers and health impairments in the course of their work, and also prevents occupational injuries.
With this in mind, Sodick has introduced the Employee Assistance Program. We have established contact points not only within the Company, but also outside the Company including with medical specialists and lawyers, in order for employees to receive consultations about their mental and physical health, harassment, and other topics.
Through this, we have established a structure where people can receive care before things get out of hand as we focus on setting in place a work environment where employees can work with peace of mind. We have also set up similar contact points for overseas representatives and their families, and make every effort to ensure that they can adapt comfortably to life overseas. We are focusing our efforts on initiatives not only for the physical wellbeing of our employees, but also for their mental wellbeing, and are working to create follow-through structures to prevent mental and physical disorders from arising.
Sodick has also adopted a Compliance Helpline (whistleblowing system) with the objective of preventing and rapidly responding to wrongdoing or unethical behavior perpetrated by employees or corporate officers.
Sodick’s Initiatives
Promotion of Reduced Working Hours Scheme
Sodick has adopted a reduced working hours scheme to enable employees to undertake childcare or nursing care. This allows employees to alter their working hours as needed. In recent years, a number of employees have
taken advantage of this scheme, and we continue to make it available.
Educational Activities on Safe Driving
Sodick aims to achieve zero road accidents among our sales and service personnel. All Company-owned vehicles are equipped with driving recorders so that the causes of accidents can be ascertained and used to prevent future accidents. We also provide educational activities on safe driving, including inviting local police officers to give traffic safety seminars, and each month the number of accidents is notified throughout the Company.
Encouraging Employees toTake Paid Leave / Reducing Overtime Work
Sodick has designated specific days as days on which we encourage employees to use their paid leave, and we actively encourage them to take days off. Doing so creates a virtuous cycle, as they are refreshed from taking a break and thus tackle their work with renewed motivation. Sodick is actively taking steps to reduce overtime work. Once a certain number of hours of overtime is exceeded in a given month, the individual concerned and their manager are alerted by email.
As a result of these initiatives, the average number of days of paid leave taken by employees has increased since the March 2017 fiscal year, and there has been a significant reduction in overtime hours.
Supporting “Kashu Daishoji-han Sankin Kotai Walk 2019”
Sodick aims to deepen social exchanges, fulfill our corporate obligations, and improve our corporate brand name recognition through community activities.
In fiscal 2019, we supported the “Kashu Daishoji-han Sankin Kotai Walk 2019.” This is a project that first arose through high school students’ learning about their hometown of Kaga city in Ishikawa Prefecture. It re-enacts, in relay walk format, the “sankin kotai” (alternate attendance) journey from Nihonbashi, Tokyo to Kaga city, Ishikawa Prefecture taken by the Daishoji clan during the Edo period. Sodick employees took part in this walk, and we will continue to engage wholeheartedly in activities that help to revitalize local areas.

ESG Special Feature
Nurturing human resources for Sodick’s Next Stage
 Basic Approach
Based on our company motto “Create,” “Implement,” and “Overcome Difficulties,” Sodick is striving to create a workplace environment and corporate culture in which each of our employees can grow together with the company, respect each other’s individuality, and flourish. Amidst dramatic change in the business landscape, Sodick aspires to achieve further growth and improve productivity in our traditional specialist fields in order to realize our long-term management plan “Next Stage 2026 ~Toward Further Growth~.” At the same time, our human resources will play an essential role in fearlessly pioneering future innovation while also adapting flexibly to changes in the business environment. Sodick is strengthening its systems and building the conditions to develop such human resources.
Related SDGs
  Personnel appraisal system to promote organizational and personal growth
We have relaxed our previous policy, which focused on the accumulation of experience, and have now introduced a personnel appraisal system based on how we expect the individual employee to grow together with the organization/company, and their role. This aims for our employees to flourish while playing their part in realizing
sustainable growth for the Company, regardless of age, gender or nationality. All employees with ambition and ability can play a more significant role and put into practice “Create,” “Implement,” and “Overcome Difficulties,” thereby extending their skills.    Creating a comfortable workplace environment
Set organizational targets, clarify the roles expected of employees and follow through so as to achieve targets.

 Promoting utilization of paid leave, parental and nursing care leave
Sodick supports the creation of a pleasant workplace environment that makes it easier for all employees to take paid leave. We are strengthening collaboration within the organization and promoting work style reform so that anyone can freely take time off work, while at the same time raising the quality of work and services.
In addition, based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children, since 2016 we have encouraged male employees to take parental leave. Parental leave utilization among men has increased steadily, and employee awareness is gradually changing, not just among male personnel but also throughout the workplace.
Utilizing IT
(introduction of telecommuting and RPA)
Sodick is establishing systems that enable each employee to select the optimal work style based on their work duties, irrespective of the work location, in order to realize a proper work-life balance. After a period of consideration, in 2019 we introduced telecommuting on a trial basis to boost employees’ motivation by improving their self-management skills, and its use has steadily grown.
In addition, we are actively using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) as part of streamlining administrative operations in various areas of our business. RPA is a tool for automating simple PC-based tasks across applications, and requires no programming knowledge. In future, we will develop personnel who can create RPA scenarios, and promote RPA for various business tasks to improve operational efficiency.
In order to develop human resources with the qualities and abilities needed to realize further growth for Sodick, we have established a skill development system for the personal growth and career development of each employee.

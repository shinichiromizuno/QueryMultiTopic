 Occupational health and safety
We believe that our ability to provide safety and peace of mind to our customers depends on first ensuring the health and vitality of our employees. Accordingly, we promote various initiatives aimed at protecting and enhancing employee health and creating safe, employee-friendly workplaces.
The Human Resource Division has established a system to com- prehensively manage occupational health in collaboration with the Health Promotion Office, which is staffed with occupational health physicians (OHPs), and the SECOM Health Insurance Union. To pro- mote continuous improvements in occupational health and safety, health committees nationwide meet monthly to discuss key issues, including employee working hours and efforts to improve health, enhance work environments ensure safety and prevent risks. We also actively care for employees’ mental health, conducting stress checks, arranging meetings with psychiatrists and specialized counselors, to make certain that employees feel both physically and mentally supported.
To ensure occupational safety, the Operation Division verifies day-to-day security operations and works to reduce identified occupational safety risks. Our operational and control structure facilitates the efficient exchange of reports and instructions between the front lines and senior management, ensuring that the latter is fully apprised of day-to-day operations across Japan and able to provide guidance for the improvements where

 SECOM’s Philosophy and the SECOM Group Code of Employee Conduct
 Encouraging awareness of SECOM’s Philosophy and adherence
to the SECOM Group Code of Employee Conduct are essential
to maximizing the trust of stakeholders and our corporate value. Handed down since our establishment, SECOM’s Philosophy pro- vides a spiritual anchor for Group employees and the entire SECOM Group. The driving force behind our growth and evolution, this philosophy emphasizes a refusal to be content with the status quo and a commitment to doing what is appropriate. The first element expresses our determination to offer innovative services and systems
by challenging accepted norms, while the second calls for judging the legitimacy of our actions by examining whether they are just, fair and beneficial not only to SECOM but also to society as a whole. The SECOM Group Code of Employee Conduct sets forth ideals for the conduct of employees in both public and private life and spe- cific standards for the day-to-day performance of duties. We have published SECOM’s Philosophy and the SECOM Group Code of Em- ployee Conduct in the form of handbooks and pocket-sized guides, which are distributed to employees in Japan and overseas.

An employee who becomes aware of a violation is obliged to submit a report to

Securing and fostering talented human resources
Our vibrant, diverse team of employees, who are critical to our ability to provide services that deliver safety and peace of mind, are our greatest asset and another driving force behind our growth and evolution. Accordingly, we strive to secure and foster talented human resources who have the ability to adapt to change and create value and who seek to contribute to society.
As a company that extends services across Japan and around the world, we promote active recruiting efforts. We also work to enhance employee welfare with the goal of improving our ability to retain human resources, and have established a variety of programs designed to boost motivation and productivity, as well as to create
other steps to promote more strict observance. Since 2018,
we have promoted the Tri-ion initiative, which seeks to ensure that SECOM’s Philosophy fully penetrates every aspect of our operations and to bolster motivation and productivity Groupwide. Through this initiative, we aim to nurture employees who embody SECOM’s Philosophy to foster a stronger corporate culture, ensure a well-established brand and further earn the trust of society.
employee-friendly workplaces. One such program enables employ- ees to choose the geographic location to which they are assigned to suit career phase or personal preference.
We provide extensive training to foster human resources with high ethical standards and superior skills. In addition to training for all new employees, we have developed department- and job-specific curricula that reinforce practical capabilities in a manner that ben- efits employees on the front lines. We have also launched a variety of specialized training options, including an overseas study program and a subsidy system for employees to take correspondence courses. In the area of training for security guards, we have introduced VR

technology, among others, to improve effectiveness and ensure employees acquire excellent discernment and know-how.
Employee performance reviews look to impartially evaluate employees’ efforts and support self-realization. Evaluations are based on reports prepared by employees assessing their execution of duties, achievements and areas in need of improvement, and rational assessment categories optimized for each particular job. We use an open, fair format whereby review results are disclosed to employees. In addition, we promote self-actualization through systems designed to assist with career development, including
the Self-Reporting System and Challenge Support System, which encourage employees to declare and assists their efforts to realize their own future goals and aspirations.
Advancing diversity
Recognizing the importance of welcoming a broad spectrum of individuals with wide-ranging ideas, to the creation of new value, we actively promote diversity in our labor force, including by advancing career opportunities for female employees. In 2017, we established the Declaration of Promoting Diversity and Inclusions, and assigned diversity and inclusion staff to the Human Resource Department. We currently promote the creation of positive work environments that maximize the capabilities of all employees regardless of gender, nationality, age, physical ability, sexual orientation or gender identity.
With the aim of actively fostering female leaders, we are a member of the nonprofit organization Japan Women’s Innovative Network (J-Win). We also dispatch two female employees to par- ticipate in J-Win programs, which are aimed at cultivating skills and helping female employees build networks.
Promoting work–life balance
We view work–life balance, including sufficient physical and mental rest and a fulfilling private life as essential to the ability to approach one’s work with energy and focus. In addition to actively encouraging employees to take annual paid vacation days, we have established vacation and leave systems in line with which we promote ongoing efforts to help employees achieve
a balance between their careers and private lives and enhance employee retention.

Dialogue with employees
We seek to achieve sustainable growth as a strong, flexible organi- zation that is impervious to the impact of social change and the competitive environment. We are thus working to create a virtuous circle, recognizing the importance of enabling employees who share SECOM’s Philosophy to demonstrate their full potential, which helps raise the quality of the services and products we provide, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and earning the trust of society, which in turn increases employees’ job satisfaction. Since 2016, we have conducted an annual anonymous employee job satisfaction survey. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the response rate for this survey was 85.5%.
Reflecting our fundamental belief that the growth of our employees is inextricably linked to our prosperity, we signed a union membership qualification agreement with SECOM Lively Union (the SECOM Employee Union Federation), which was estab- lished in 1964, and became a union shop, meaning that in

*Scope of reporting: SECOM CO., LTD.
principle employees automatically become union members when they are hired. As a consequence, our union membership rate for eligible employees is 100%.
We place a priority on dialogue between labor and manage- ment. With the aim of boosting employee morale, building a vibrant and healthy organizational culture and maximizing organi- zational energy, the management representatives, including the President and Representative Director, meet monthly with SECOM Lively Union to exchange views. Discussions are also held at SECOM Group companies and branches across Japan to address issues such as improving workplace environments and operating procedures and ensuring occupational health and safety. SECOM Lively Union also exchanges views with management through meetings with employees on organizational culture and the SECOM Employee Central Council.

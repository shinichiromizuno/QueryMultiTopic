Social changes and issues that
Seven Bank is considering
As both social globalization and economic globalization progress, the number of visitors to Japan from overseas and the number of non-Japanese persons working in Japan increase every year. Seven Bank believes that we need to live with a mutual acceptance of other cultures and build relationships of equality regardless of nationality or ethnicity.
Seven Bank’s approach to changes
and issues

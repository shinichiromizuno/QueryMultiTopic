   Social changes and issues that
Seven Bank is considering
Social changes and technological advances are leading to a diversification in customers’ lifestyles and values, one of which is a desire for financial services to be “more close-by, convenient.” Seven Bank believes that this requires innovation and equality of opportunity in financial services that are not bound by conventional concepts.
Seven Bank’s approach to changes
and issues
Seven Bank will incorporate elements like lifestyle diversification and the sharing economy to build new financial services that are not bound by conventional concepts to provide new value that corresponds to changes in people’s lives.
“Uniquely convenience store” financial services
Developing products including credit, investment and insurance with a view toward cooperation with the Seven & i Group and outside companies
     New styles of ATM usage
Promoting cooperation with new settlement business operators that are opening up new areas of settlement
Offering “Smartphone ATM transaction service” for cash deposits and withdrawals without using a card
Expanding top-up transactions for transportation-related electronic money
Convenient, easy-to-use services that keep pace with social changes and technological advances
The “real-time money transfer function” supports diversified work styles
in terms of finances
“ATM Receipt (cash receipt service)” allows customers to receive cash without having an account
           Real-time money transfer function
Various remittances by partner companies are made by Seven Bank immediately upon receiving instructions, in cooperation with an outside service operator (e.g., an API [Application Programming Interface] connection).
With the diversification of work styles, companies that pay salaries or settle expenses immediately use this service to pay employees for the portion of work they do that day or to settle expenses the day they are incurred.

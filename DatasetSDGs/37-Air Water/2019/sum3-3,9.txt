Review of FY2018
In the advanced medical solutions segment, a trend toward using less medical gas and the exhaustion of potential for new orders for hospital equipment has left us in a tough position. Conversely, medical services progressed robustly, buoyed by the acquisition of new clients for in-hospital SPD (Supply, Processing and Distribution Service) and inventory management systems, as well as streamlining in material procurement and rectification of prices received for sterilization services. Meanwhile, the government’s revision of medical remuneration led to growth in sales of high-pressure oxygen devices, providing new wind in the sails of our medical equipment business. Meanwhile, our hospital equipment business in Singapore performed well.
The lifestyle medical solutions segment was buffeted by the severity of the market for home medical care and sanitary materials, as well as rising logistics costs in the dental segment. 150,000 perioperative equipment and injection needles 100,000

Revenue & Operating Profit (IFRS) (unit: million yen)
While potential for new hospital equipment orders has been exhausted, the demand for higher hospital functionality and efficiency is expanding needs. In order to keep abreast of these new needs, we are striving to position ourselves as an all-round provider of perioperative solutions by offering a comprehensive range of solutions by adding peripheral equipment, sterilization, surgical kits and other disposables to our existing line-up of operating theater and ICU equipment. To that end, we established Air Water International Advanced Medical Center, a broad-ranging hub for R&D and information dissemination at the Kobe Biomedical Innovation Cluster. At the same time, we are working hard to develop products with a difference, such as endoscope cameras and surgery video systems using 8K imaging technology.

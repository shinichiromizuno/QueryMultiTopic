We conduct research and development to contribute to society in terms of health and nutrition through our materials and technologies.

Vitamin K2
We have commercialized oils, fats, and powders containing vitamin K2 extracted from Bacillus natto as an important ingredient that is indispensable for maintaining bone health. We have succeeded in using a special deodorization method to make vitamin K2 oils, fats, and powders that do not affect taste or smell. Against the backdrop of health-consciousness and an aging population, the needs of active seniors in particular are expected to increase.
Resistant starch
Resistant starch (indigestible starch), which activates good bacteria in the gut, is a material drawing attention. Resistant starch is not absorbed by the small intestine and reaches the depths of the large intestine,
causing good bacteria to proliferate in the gut, producing short-chain fatty acids that enhance immune strength. It could also suppress sudden spikes in blood lipids and blood sugar levels, and it is expected to have a preventive effect against lifestyle-related diseases.
Skin health
We provide tocopherol, a natural antioxidant, for cosmetic ingredients. In addition, high-oleic sunflower oil, which boasts the highest level of oleic acid content among vegetable oils, is well received as a base oil for cosmetics because of its high oxidation stability, light color and faint scent. We are not only researching vitamin K2 regarding the maintenance of bone health, but also its health function in the skin.

Texture is an important element of tastiness. With its “translation ability,” J-Oil Mills cracks the code for the textures that customers want, such as chewy, crispy, and juicy, to create various kinds of tastiness. Our unique ingredient NEOTRUST has the ability to retain both moisture and oil. By combining moisture and oil in different ways, it enables the creation of various textures without compromising the taste of the original ingredients. Since it can reproduce the fleshy texture of ingredients in sauces and soups, and maintain the crispy texture of fried foods, it is expected to be useful not only for tastiness but also for reducing food loss and preserving food resources.

Since our starch product NEOTRUST is highly water absorbent and can retain moisture and oil, it can be used to create a variety of textures such as soft, plump, and chewy without becoming pasty and without damaging the ingredients.

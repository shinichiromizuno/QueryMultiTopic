The cooking flavor series for professional-use, J-OILPRO®, can reproduce the richness of animal oils and fats even though the oils are plant-derived. We broke down the elements of flavors related to grilling, scorching, and smoking in order to reproduce the aromas and flavors (the five tastes of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness, and umami) of meat using plant protein, as well as the complex flavors produced at the time of cooking. A building block method reconstructs these tastes three-dimensionally, allowing us to create the flavor of freshly cooked meat out of vegetable oil.
The frying oil Bimi Toku Toku is used as an alternative to animal oils and fats. Starting with the question, “Why are butcher shop croquettes so good?” we observed that cooking with heat enhances the richness of the arachidonic acid contained in animal oils and fats. This observation was used to create the product using a processing technology that replaced the heat cooking with industrial production. If heated too much, arachidonic acid breaks down and its rich taste lessens. It is important to age it to the point where it is just right, and this manufacturing method has become one of our core technologies.
With margarine, we developed “Rama – The Margarine for Butter Lovers,” which has a buttery flavor and richness that had not been realized with conventional margarine. We were particular about creating a butter-like flavor, using our new Tasty MTE Production Method, which creates a balanced composition of milk ingredients and flavors.

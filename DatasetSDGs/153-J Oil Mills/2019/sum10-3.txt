Promoting Health Management
Our employees are the driving force enabling us to achieve stable growth over the medium to long term. Adopting a solid emphasis on ensuring that our employees are able to continue working in good health, both mental and physical, we are promoting health management. To date, we have advanced a variety of initiatives, including employee health checks and stress checks and the continuous monitoring of results, in addition to the mounting of health campaigns in cooperation with health insurance societies. We have also conducted employee awareness surveys and implemented training of our executives based on the results. We share the scores for each of our departments and conduct activities that seek to resolve problems in our organization. 

Health and Safety
J-Oil Mills has worked to improve occupational health and overall safety, at the level of individual worksites, throughout the Group, and at affiliates that perform work at our factories, through convening a variety of meetings and committees including a Quality and Environmental Safety Conference and Health and Safety Committees, and conducting a range of activities. In addition to lecture-based safety education, we also offer training for employees in the factory workplace that involve simulated experience of accidents that might lead to injuries, such as getting caught in machinery or tripping and falling. In fiscal 2018, we experienced three accidents that led to employees spending four or more days away from work. We intend to advance initiatives aiming to realize zero workplace accidents by increasing sensitivity to danger among our employees and ensuring that they thoroughly perform basic operations.

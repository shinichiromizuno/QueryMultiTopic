We intend to introduce a “Customer’s Voice System” to our Customer Liaison Office in order to further strengthen communication with our customers. In this system, we will (for example) enhance the store search function, enabling us to quickly provide information on retail stores to customers who are searching for our products. In addition, we will be able to quickly share information with production departments, reducing the amount of time required to respond to questions and inquiries. Preparation for the system was completed in fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019 will see us making the final adjustments, looking towards fully- fledged operation.
Together with the “Customer Liaison Office Inquiry Form” on our renewed website, this will make it easier in future for customers to offer us their opinions, and we will also be able to quickly provide customers with even more information. This will enable us to create mechanisms that allow us to develop products and provide services that are even easier to use and offer even greater value.

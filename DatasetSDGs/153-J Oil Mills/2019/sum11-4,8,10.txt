Seeking to realize our corporate vision, “Joy for Life,” we have revised our personnel systems for employees and management.
For employees, the philosophy of our system is “Individual-oriented career formation.” Under this banner we seek to respect each individual and allow them to sketch out a vision for their career and realize it, and we have also enhanced our education system to support the realization of these goals.
In our management personnel system, we have introduced the concept of “Change Leaders” who continue
to evolve. Our aim is to allow the individual to continue to flexibly evolve their own strengths in line with changes in the environment and the development of technology, rather than simply growing along the trajectories that were normal in the past.
In addition, we have introduced a Career Development Program (CDP) for both employees and managerial positions. From August 2018 we have enabled employees to form autonomous careers by filling in a career design sheet and clarifying the image of the person they wish to become via an interview with a superior.

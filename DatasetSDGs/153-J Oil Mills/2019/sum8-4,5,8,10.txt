Promoting Diverse Work Styles (Work-life Balance)
In addition to focusing our energies on the development of human resources, J-Oil Mills is promoting diverse work styles for our employees, and promoting work style reforms by introducing new initiatives that will increase work satisfaction.
Up to the present, as part of our efforts to reform work styles, we have introduced a variety of systems in order to enable diverse working styles.
In fiscal 2018, we encouraged employees to take paid leave in exchange for long working hours, established “no overtime” days, expanded the range of workplaces using flextime, introduced a super flextime system, and introduced flexible office systems (working from satellite offices, working from home, etc.). The number of users of these various systems is increasing. Going forward, we will implement more activities to ensure that our employees are aware of flextime and our flexible office systems, promoting systems that enable employees in a variety of circumstances to flexibly continue working.
As an initiative towards the appropriate management of working hours, since April 2018 we have conducted appropriate management of total working hours by linking PC log-in and logout times to our system. In fiscal 2018, average total working hours were 1,961.0 hours, and overtime hours per person were 17.5 hours per month. The rate of acquisition of paid leave increased to 69.7%. In fiscal 2019, we will advance countermeasures by conducting analyses regarding working hours for each of our business divisions while also proceeding with reforms towards flexible work styles.
Our rate of employment of workers with disabilities, however, was below the rate stipulated by law in fiscal 2018. Seeking to exceed the stipulated rate, we will take an active approach, for example by reexamining the scope of disabilities in our recruitment activities.

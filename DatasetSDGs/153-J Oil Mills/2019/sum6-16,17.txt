Two-way Communication with the Market, Improvement of the Quality and Frequency of Information Disclosure
We are working to enhance our IR and SR activities in order to increase the reliability of our management and boost our corporate value over the medium to long term. As part of these efforts, we established a CSR and IR department in July 2019, creating a more robust system of information disclosure that integrates IR, PR, and CSR. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, we will actively hold dialogues with our stakeholders in order to further increase trust.
Similarly, we are actively engaging in PR activities. From
fiscal 2018, we increased the frequency of our release of
information, and commenced publication of a new newsletter.
Going forward, we will seek to increase our corporate value
through the active dissemination of information.
(We disseminate new information as news releases, and other information that we wish to communicate in newsletters).

Dialogue with NPOs
As a company, we engage with our diverse stakeholders through dialogue. In August 2018, we conducted a dialogue with organizations that seek to promote the sustainable procurement of palm oil, exchanging opinions regarding the best direction for its procurement. We also regularly exchange opinions with NPOs. Going forward, we will continue to take the opinions of diverse stakeholders seriously, and will strive to fulfill our responsibilities as a member of society.

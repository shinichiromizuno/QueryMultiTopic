Reform of Our Corporate Culture
In order to adapt to a rapidly changing external environment and continue to evolve, a company must possess an open environment in which every individual is able to freely express his or her opinions. Seeking to realize our vision of “Joy for Life,” J-Oil Mills is encouraging employees to translate our principles of action into personal goals to enable their realization. These are: Spirit of exploration, Spirit of challenge, Creativity, Sincerity, Coexistence, and Love for oil. We have also commenced efforts to introduce a system in which employees are able to make free use of any desk as part of our work style reforms, creating an environment that promotes mutual communication among our employees.
In attempting to become an open organization, we are also using a “Linkage Board” (an in-house bulletin board) to provide opportunities for communication between employees, and “Yammer” (our internal SNS) as a forum for the sharing of internal information.
Further, by means of the introduction of a year-round business casual dress code and a movement for more casual modes of address (removing the name of the addressee’s job position), we are promoting a corporate culture with no sense of distance between employees and between them and management.

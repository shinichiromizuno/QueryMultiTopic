Emphasis on Human Resource Development for the Future of Kanamoto
The Kanamoto Group knows excellent human resources with a high level of expertise and skills are the driving force of sustainable growth. That is why we have built systems to extract and nurture the full potential of each and every employee through stratified human resource training and devel- opment programs for sales persons and engineers.
In particular, our engineers focus on learning maintenance and repairs of construction equipment, which requires a wide range of qualifications. In addition to in-house maintenance and repair training, Kanamoto helps employees learn maintenance techniques whether through participation in maintenance and repair training held by each manufacturer or the expan- sion of in-house education programs that encourage employees to acquire various certifications.

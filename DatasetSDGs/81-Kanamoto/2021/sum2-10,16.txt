Appropriate Disclosure and Comprehensive IR Activities
Kanamoto knows the importance of an appropriate market evaluation of corporate value through fair, precise, and prompt informational disclosure. We strive to not only provide information about management and busi- ness conditions as well as corporate activities but also timely and active disclosure of valid information for everyone to understand and assess the Kanamoto Group.
Our IR efforts had actively focused on presentations at IR events for indi- vidual investors, small meetings with institutional investors in Japan, and IR events overseas. However, as a measure to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus infection, the Kanamoto Group has put in place systems to consistently communicate with shareholders from financial results brief- ings to online rather than in person question-and-answer sessions.

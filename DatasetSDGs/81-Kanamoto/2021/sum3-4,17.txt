Patronage to Support Development of Local Arts and Culture
Kanamoto believes its patronage to support arts and culture helps to en- hance its corporate value. As part of this support, we provide Providence, a former beer hall owned by Kanamoto, free of charge to Muroran City in Hokkaido as a venue for its Port Literature Museum. Kanamoto has also ac- quired the naming rights for the Sapporo Civic Hall where 400,000 people a year attend concerts and take part in life-long learning opportunities. This venue has come to be adored as the Kanamoto hall. The Kanamoto Group works to not only improve its brand recognition but also to help vitalize local education and culture.

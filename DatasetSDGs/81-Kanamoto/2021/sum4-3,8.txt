Initiatives to Strengthen Health and Safety Systems
One Initiative the Kanamoto Group is strengthening is safety training. We have put in place systems that work to prevent accidents around the Safety and Health Office led by the president. This office regularly conducts in- house seminars and audits and works to raise health and safety awareness at all branches while utilizing safety patrols executed by safety and health working groups. Our efforts to strengthen health and safety systems and eradicate occupational accidents have proven successful. As many as 23 branches in Kanamoto are accident-free over the last 20 years.

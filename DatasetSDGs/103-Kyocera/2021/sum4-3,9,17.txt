Reinforcing New Product Development
●Expanding Our Medical Business Outside of Japan In January 2019 we established KYOCERA Medical Technolo- gies, Inc. in the U.S. as part of an effort to expand our medical business outside Japan. Our goals include broadening our product development and sales networks using our propri- etary 3D processing technologies. We will also leverage syn- ergies with our proprietary material technologies to create new opportunities to serve U.S. orthopedic patients.
    via Open Innovation
Orthopedic joint replacement systems are the cornerstone of Kyocera's medical products business, and demand is expect- ed to surge as Japan evolves into to a “super aging” society. We aim to leverage our strength as the manufacturer with the most extensive clinical track record in Japan's joint re- placement market1 to grow this business globally.
We are also utilizing the latest expertise in treating joint dis- eases to expand into regenerative medical therapies. This promising field offers great potential to address societal needs ranging from burgeoning medical and nursing care costs to labor shortages, which are likely to grow as popula- tions age.
In addition, we are working with other leading organizations to develop digital healthcare technologies and systems sup- ported by our extensive lines of electronic components and sensors.We will enhance these solutions and early diagnosis technologies to help create a society in which everyone can live a healthy, active life. Our information and communica- tions technologies (ICT) can play an essential role in networks connecting people with their caregiver institutions to help extend healthy life expectancy.

Growing Market
Japan's healthcare and nursing care costs increase yearly, and are forecast to reach approx. 93 trillion yen by 2040. We will ad- dress diverse medical care issues by aggressively developing new technologies that can help reduce the cost of care.

This field is hampered by late diagnoses which limit intervention, making successful rehabilitation more diffi- cult.3 We hope to improve quality of life through SaMD-based early diagnosis, allowing behavioral changes and treatments to occur sooner. We also hope to reduce the burden on med- ical staff by utilizing digital technologies to provide more effi- cient diagnostic solutions.

 Greetings
Corporate Motto
“Respect the Divine and Love People” Preserve the spirit to work fairly and honorably,
respecting people, our work, our company and our global community.
Management Rationale
To provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advancement of society and humankind.
Management Philosophy
To coexist harmoniously with our society, our global community and nature. Harmonious coexistence is the underlying foundation of all our business activities as we work to create a world of prosperity and peace.

Management Based on the Bonds of Human Minds
Kyocera started as a small, suburban factory, with no money, credentials or reputation. We had nothing to rely on but a little technology and 28 trustworthy colleagues. None- theless, the company experienced rapid growth because everyone exerted their maxi- mum efforts and managers devoted their lives to earning the trust of employees. We wanted to be an excellent company where all employees could believe in each other, abandon selfish motives, and be truly proud to work. This desire became the founda- tion of Kyocera’s management.
Human minds are said to be easily changeable. Yet, there is nothing stronger than the human mind. Kyocera developed into what it is today because it is based on the bonds of human minds.
Chairman of the Board and Representative Director, President and Representative Director,
  Thank you very much for your patronage and support of the Kyocera Group.
We wish to express our sincere sympathies to all those touched by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since its founding in 1959, our Group has expanded its businesses under the Management
Rationale of “To provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advancement of society and humankind.”
Over the last decade, the environment in which we do business has changed dramatically. Not only have product and device needs changed, but there is also increasing awareness of the environment and society. Above all, digitization is accelerating rapidly, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes are visible in our main business areas, which include the Information & Communication, Automotive, Environment & Energy, and Medical & Healthcare markets. The needs of our customers are shifting to systemization and solutions.
We publish this annual Integrated Report to inform stakeholders of our efforts to address societal needs through our business activities. Our goal is to raise the value of our contributions to society by conducting business in a more sustainable manner.
By outlining our basic initiatives for growth, as well as the potential such initiatives create for society, we hope to share our values with you, and further our role as a socially responsible enterprise. We hope this report will be helpful to you in understanding our company.

KYOCERA INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 3
 We will work on reforming our
businesses, organization, and personnel
system, and accelerate these reforms
to create new businesses that help
solve societal needs.
Since our founding, the Kyocera Group has remained devoted to growing our business and promoting social development based on our Management Rationale: “To provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advancement of society and humankind.” The core of our Management Rationale is the Kyocera Philosophy, which has been carefully cultivated over the course of more than 60 years.
Currently, we face a period of great change. With the expanding digital transformation and widespread adoption of 5G communications, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as changing work-styles, a giant wave of change is upon us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also prompted changes in the business environment and how we work. We must accelerate our transformation without changing the business philosophy we inherited from our founders.
We will promote reforms based on new ideas without being bound by conventional wisdom or customs, so that new members can flourish more than ever in the spirit of our Management Rationale.
President and Representative Director,
  
 Top Management Message
Introduction
Entering a Period of Dynamic Change
Worldwide
Since assuming the post of president in April 2017, I have observed the business environment surrounding the Kyoc- era Group changing significantly, and it is no exaggeration to say that we are entering a period of dynamic change around the world. Social trends, digitalization and globalization have advanced significantly. As a result, individual needs have di- versified, and what people value is shifting from products and devices to experience. With the business environment changing drastically, the outlook has become more uncer- tain and opaque due to the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the business environment changing drasti- cally, the outlook has become more uncertain and opaque due to the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the work-style reforms we have enacted, such as the introduction of remote work and flextime systems, have represented a dramatic leap forward. In the midst of such changes in the world we live in, companies are also required to take swift action. Businesses are being encouraged to shift from a precedent-based approach, which emphasizes certainty, to a proactive, risk-taking approach in which speed is the number-one priority.
We need to accelerate our business transformation fur- ther, and in new ways, such as by breaking away from our self-sufficient approach and actively utilizing external re- sources. Most importantly, our ability to turn social solutions into business strategies and increase our corporate value will be key to our success. As a company supporting the energy sector, developing renewables to promote carbon offsets1 with diverse technologies and business assets, we must give greater emphasize the social aspects surrounding our business.
Restructured Organization Adapts to Changes in External Environment
In FY2022, we restructured to integrate our business divi- sions into three segments in order to adapt to changes in the external environment and optimize key technologies.
The aim of this restructuring is to change the organiza- tion from pyramid-style into a flatter structure, which can
1 Carbon offsets: reductions in carbon dioxide emissions intended to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.
respond faster to diversifying needs as manufacturing shifts from mass production toward an age of mass customization. Manufacturers like us cannot survive if we cannot keep
up with changes in the market.
Thus, I thought it was necessary to review our organiza-
tional structure and personnel system to keep pace with the changing times.
In undertaking this restructure, our 16 product lines have been newly consolidated into three segments: “Core Components,” “Electronic Components,” and “Solutions.”
One of our strengths is that we deploy our businesses over a wide spectrum rather than specializing in a specific sector. However, a strong vertical awareness can divide or- ganizations, and we faced challenges in maximizing synergy opportunities between individual businesses.
By consolidating the product lines into 3 segments, we will promote intra-organization exchange, break down hier- archical boundaries, and accelerate collaboration.
During the same time as this consolidation initiative, our back office divisions were integrated into “Headquarters” operations.
Following the organizational restructure, officers in charge of each segment were appointed.
By giving each officer in charge the authority of a top manager, our aim is to make swift and dynamic manage- ment decisions that go beyond existing frameworks and put the Kyocera Group on a new course for growth. We can now better execute strategies across business divisions, stimulat- ing our staff and organizations, and optimizing manage- ment resources.
In the Core Component segment, we will focus on growth markets such as 5G and semiconductors, while strengthen- ing our technological development to increase revenue growth and profitability. In the Electronic Components seg- ment, first and foremost, we will strengthen our sales force by integrating our global sales organization with our US subsidiary, AVX Corporation (now KYOCERA AVX Compo- nents Corporation). In October 2021, we rolled out a new business brand called “KYOCERA AVX.” In addition, we will work to increase revenue and profits through the integra- tion of manufacturing and development resources. In the Solution segment, we will strive to build new business mod- els that utilize our communication technology and software.
In addition, we are proceeding with projects under the
direct control of the president. For example, group-wide R&D will be conducted as a project under the direct control of the president, focusing on priority themes that best con- tribute to future growth. For example, in local 5G, technolo- gies for base stations, sensors, software, AI, and others that were previously rolled out separately, and technology han- dled by each organization, will be integrated to bring hard- ware and solutions together. I think that one of the reasons why IoT is not as widely adopted as had been expected is that there are few companies that can handle all the prod- ucts and technologies necessary for solving problems using IoT.
We possess technologies in both components and wire- less communications systems, and will improve this area as one of our strengths. Going forward, the integration of hard- ware and solutions will become even more essential, and so we plan to make significant investments in the solutions field in the future.
Growth Strategy Maximizing the Collective Strengths of the Group
With regard to capital expenditure, we are planning a total of 450 billion yen in investment over the three years from FY2022. Especially in 5G-related business, where the next three years are pivotal to success, we will concentrate our efforts to become the market leader. We will aggressively expand into this growing market by optimizing our diverse business assets, such as our expertise in fine ceramics and wireless communications, as well as our global expansion capabilities. In the components business, we will apply the fine ceramic technology we have developed since our compa- ny's founding to supply key products such as fine ceramic parts for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, image sensor packages, optical communication packages, and com- munication module circuit boards. In terms of electronic equipment, we are utilizing our wireless communication tech- nology to develop 5G handsets, base stations, routers, IoT communication equipment and other products. We plan to deploy local 5G systems in facilities, such as factories and stadiums, and drone-related 5G solutions for agricultural and inspection applications. Our plan is to aim for growth by max- imizing the Group's collective strengths in these 5G growth areas and responding to all needs, whether it involves selling
products and devices or experiences.
Regarding digital transformation, in April 2020 we assem-
bled members from each department to promote compa- ny-wide digitalization and established our “Digital Business Promotion Group.” For manufacturing divisions, we have built an automated production system that utilizes IoT and AI based on our proprietary data platform to double productivity, and are now implementing it on the clay-type Li-ion storage battery production line at our Yasu Plant in Shiga. Using this case as a model, we plan to roll out smart factories group- wide. To support sales divisions, we are introducing Sales Force Automation to share sales information between divi- sions. We have begun full-scale operation of SFA in some business divisions.
In addition, to help support these efforts, we are pro- moting initiatives in the fields of data science, information security, and core infrastructure. In addition to promoting Group-wide digitization, we intend these efforts to bring drastic change in awareness among all employees.
Optimizing Management Resources to Achieve Growth Strategy
To implement such a growth strategy, we need to acquire and appropriately allocate management resources such as funds and staff. In raising funds, the ideal scenario is to in- crease our earning power to cover our costs, but in some cases, we will consider borrowing and issuing corporate bonds. We will also devote more consideration than before to the selection and concentration of our businesses. The aim of this restructure includes both business expansion and consolidation. In the future, we plan to concentrate our management resources on businesses that are expected to grow and businesses that offer greater social value.
In terms of human resources, we are working to achieve our Management Rationale of providing “opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees.” We are reviewing our personnel system to support new ideas and challenges in order to put the Kyocera Group back on course for sustained economic growth. In particular, we will create new specialist courses as a system that enables us to pick out talented employees. First and foremost, we will review our work styles with a focus on our technical research staff.
    KYOCERA INTEGRATED REPORT 2021 4

 Top Management Message
Reforming our personnel systems will promote exchang- es between people of different levels. We hope to stimulate the entire Group by building a system in which veteran em- ployees support the activities of more junior members. In addition, regarding the mobility of human resources, we will respond to changes in the business environment by acquir- ing staff from outside the Group, including mid-career re- cruits, to ensure diversity. People are the most important resource of all, and we will strive to acquire and develop tal- ented human resources.
We will also consider acquiring external management resources through M&A and business alliances. SLD Laser, of the United States, which we acquired in January 2021, is a world leader in laser light sources based on gallium nitride (GaN) technology. We will continue to consider M&A and in- vestment to acquire excellent businesses and technologies that will lead to greater growth and development.
ESG Management that Achieves Corporate Value and Social Solutions
Solving environmental challenges and fulfilling societal needs are extremely important themes for us in terms of creating innovative products and enhancing our corporate value. Since our founding, we have continued to improve our environmen- tally-friendly ceramics technology. After Japan was hit by its first oil crisis, in 1975, when the whole country was calling for energy-saving measures, we were early to focus R&D on solar cells — and in 1993, we launched the industry's first2 residen- tial solar power generating system. Since then, we have con- tinued to expand our energy business by focusing on devel- oping storage batteries and fuel cells. By further advancing these efforts, we will continue to emphasize Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) measures as a corporation.
In terms of the environment (E), as a measure against climate change, we set long-term environmental targets in FY2020 to reduce our CO2 emissions by 30%3 by FY2031 and to increase our adoption of renewable energy tenfold3. However, we are currently considering setting even more ambitious goals. After starting an in-house proof-of-concept verification trial for renewable energy using storage batter- ies at our Yasu Plant last year, our Kokubu Plant this year started a verification experiment using a combination of solar batteries, fuel cells, and storage batteries. Regarding

3 Compared to FY2014
the circulation of resources, in addition to recycling, we must also extend the lives of our products, an area where our ceramic technology can be utilized. As an extension of this, we believe we can contribute to the development of new automotive products in the future.
On the social (S) side of things, we will work to further promote diversity and inclusion. Kyocera originally de- ployed Amoeba Management to ensure the involvement of all employees, and this initiative was very strong especially at the time I joined the company. However, as we got bigger and bigger, we gradually changed to a pyramid-type orga- nization, making it difficult to demonstrate what makes Amoeba Management good to begin with. Currently, we are moving once again to reignite implementation of the Amoeba Management approach. Against this backdrop, we can smoothly transition to a flat organization that promotes horizontal collaboration. This will lead to diversity, and I would like to ensure this approach is ingrained in the cul- ture of Kyocera. In particular, expanding our solutions busi- ness can be achieved only under such a system. We are also promoting greater gender inclusion in the workplace. For example, in the “Venture Startup Program,” we seek ideas from a wide range of employees regardless of age, gender, and experience. Currently, we are turning the development of applications for people with food allergies into a busi- ness. This is based on an idea from a female employee, and I think that in the future such bottom-up businesses will inevitably increase. Respect for human rights, particularly within supply chains, is another issue that must be ad- dressed as a responsibility of a company that engages in business globally. In November 2020, we formulated the “Kyocera Group Human Rights Policy,” which we are shar- ing with business partners and suppliers to help ensure that human rights are upheld in all aspects of business.
In terms of governance (G), at the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders in June 2021, the number of inter- nal directors was halved from 12 to six along with the ap- pointment of officers per the organizational restructuring. After the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors consisted of nine members, including outside di- rectors, and the ratio of outside directors was increased to one-third. Through this change in the structure of the Board of Directors, we are clarifying the roles of manage- ment supervision and execution, as well as speeding up
decision-making and enhancing our supervision system. To date, our business division leaders also served as either di- rectors or executive officers. Through these changes, by making all business division leaders directors, and by trans- ferring authority for HR and capital investment from top management to the officers in charge, we are trying to fur- ther accelerate decision-making. By enlisting new experts as outside directors, we expect to receive a broader per- spective of advice on management activities from a more diverse pool of knowledge and experience. Furthermore, we expect an increase in the number of female directors in the future, and we intend to ensure diversity in our addition of outside directors as well. For many years, we have been working on our mission to contribute to the advancement of humankind and society through our business. Going forward, we will continue to steadily promote ESG manage- ment based on our belief that a business is not a proper business unless it aims to fulfill societal needs.
Final Thoughts
To Our Stakeholders
The business environment we are surrounded by is under- going major changes due to the acceleration of digitaliza- tion and changes in people's values.
I see these changes in the times and society as the per- fect opportunity to create new value.
Reflecting the Kyocera Group's vision to create a brighter future by encouraging every employee to continue taking on new challenges, the Group slogan for FY2022 was set as fol- lows: “Let's recognize the drastic changes in our environ- ment as opportunities for innovation, and exert our spirit of challenge aggressively to create a brand new future.” On the business side of things, areas where we can fully demon- strate our core competencies, such as the semiconductor and renewable energy fields, are expanding before our very eyes. I believe that stakeholder capitalism, which emphasizes relationships with all stakeholders, and the Kyocera Philoso- phy have a great deal in common, and I see it as our mission to both increase our corporate value and fulfill societal needs. Going forward, we will continue to accelerate these efforts to remain a company that is trusted and held in high regard by our stakeholders. Expect big things from the Kyocera Group in the future!

Outline of Our Reorganization
Feature
Outline of Our Reorganization
The Kyocera Group is engaged in a wide range of businesses, from materials, components, devices, and equip- ment to services and networks. In order to optimize our organizational structure amid a changing external environment, we recently integrated our 16 core businesses and Group companies into three segments — Core Components, Electronic Components, and Solutions — and consolidated our administrative divisions into Headquarters to support these segments.
At the same time, we also vested the leaders in charge of each segment with executive decision-making au- thority. We believe this will dramatically enhance the swiftness of decisions relating to business strategy, in- vestment, and human resource development.
    Nimble Management Decisions for the Next Stage of Growth
Bridging vertical divisions within our organization has been a longstanding concern. Our reorganization will help overcome collaborative challenges between divisions, while avoiding redundant management resources, reducing the challenge of making large-scale investments, and increasing human resource mobility and diversity. We believe the new structure will revitalize the Company to facilitate innovation in creating new products and opening new businesses while rapidly responding to changes in our external environment. We will also strive to streamline and optimize our management resources. This will involve reorganizing product lines and strengthening our management base to improve strategic planning, increase job mobility, and revitalize the organization as a whole.
We have consolidated our general affairs, human resources, business administration, legal, and other core administrative divisions into a unified Headquarters function to provide comprehensive support to each business segment. Looking ahead, we will increase the capabilities and collaborative power of all administrative divisions to optimize the Kyocera Group's business as a whole.
Because Kyocera's intellectual property in R&D and digital transformation serve as a foundation for business collabora- tion, the Corporate R&D Group and other related divisions are now under the direct control of the President. This system will help us promote new initiatives across the board.
With this reorganization, we look to (1) speed up deci- sion-making processes, (2) ensure the effective use of man- agement resources, and (3) encourage increased job mobility. By allowing speedier, more dynamic management decisions that transcend past methods, we look to reignite growth and revitalize the Amoeba Management system that has remained with Kyocera Corporation since our founding.

 Value Creation at Kyocera Management by All
 Each Employee Participates in Management, Leveraging Diverse Expertise Toward “Doing What Is Right”
 Since its founding, Kyocera Corporation has pursued Management by All, empowering diverse staff to take initiative and play an active role in our success. Man- agement by All is an idea that aligns with the core concepts of Diversity and Inclusion.
respect others while being free to say what we think. This is what makes Management by All possible.
Of course, we also need to respond to changes in the times. The Kyocera Group promotes other specific mea- sures to bring out the best in its employees. In FY2019, we initiated the “Venture Startup Program,” an internal system for creating innovation. In the program's first year alone we received more than 800 ideas, two of which are set to be commercialized. In FY2022, our 16 main business units were consolidated into three major segments. By making mobility within the organization flexible, we will increase the number of projects where diverse staff from multiple divisions can collaborate in developing innovative products and technologies. We are also working to further promote Diversity and Inclu- sion. A more diverse workforce brings more viewpoints to incorporate, enhancing our ability to create products that meet rapidly diversifying needs.
All our employees should be able to shine in their own unique way. Each employee's experience, abilities, and way of thinking must be recognized and accepted. And we must make the most of the diverse possibilities that we each bring to the table. This rich working envi- ronment provides the basis for Kyocera's Management by All.
In Amoeba organizations, small groups with indepen- dent P&L and accounting are treated as management units within the company. All employees contribute to the goals and profitability of their Amoeba, often discussing matters beyond their own responsibilities and influencing management. Each action to improve the Amoeba gives employees a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. Over time this helps maximize their capabilities as a team, contributing not only to the devel- opment of the overall company, but even toward a brighter future for society as a whole.
To achieve this, the “vector” of each member's actions must be aligned. The standard for this “vector” is our “Philosophy of Coexistence,” which consists of our Management Rationale and the Kyocera Philosophy that we value as our foundation. We align our vectors based on these ideals and follow the principle of return- ing to the essence of a matter, rather than relying on conventional wisdom that changes as circumstances shift. The resulting shared mindset produces an open work environment and a sense of family, where we

 Value Creation at Kyocera
Kyocera Group Management Roots
The Kyocera Group’s management approach springs from the Management Rationale propounded by our founder, Kazuo Inamori.
It was the ultimate ideal for the Kyocera Group when the company was founded.
We keep the essence of this statement in mind as a foundational principle in discerning the needs of our customers and society.
Further, we continue to test ourselves, staying eager to overcome difficulties, and bold in taking on challenges that can lead to new products and services.
These tireless efforts have enabled the growth and development of the Kyocera Group, and motivated our employees to contribute to the advancement of society.
The Kyocera Group Management Rationale
“To provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advancement of society and humankind.”
 The “Kyocera Philosophy” Shared by All Employees The “Kyocera Philosophy” is shared among all employees as a guideline
for achieving our Management Rationale.
The “Kyocera Philosophy” consists of four elements.
· The rules and promises that codify the company's value system;
· The mindset necessary to achieve business goals;
· The fundamental character of the enterprise; and the key element
Two Systems to Achieve Our Rationale
The Kyocera Group values fair and transparent, above-board manage- ment.
Unbound by preconceived notions, Dr. Inamori's Seven Account- ing Principles, based on “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” let us accurately assess the true performance of our Amoebas and decide the best direction in which to proceed.
These two practical business management methods support the Kyocera Group's solid financial foundation and allow us to uphold our Management Rationale.
Philosophy of Coexistence Combines with Our Management Rationale
Since its founding, the Kyocera Group has continued to grow and devel- op by constantly taking on new challenges with innovative technologies in emerging fields. This process, as stated in our Management Ratio- nale, is not just about pursuing the Group's own development. With contributing to humankind and society as our starting point, this pro-
cess is based on “Living Together” ー that is, the spirit of coexistence. Since the 1970s, Kyocera Corporation has made clear its philosophy that business should be based on a “Coexistence with Nature,” “Coex-
that serves as the foundation for these three:
· Doing what is right as a human being
These management concepts and life philosophies are based on
The Kyocera Group has adopted a unique system called “Amoeba Management” to achieve its Management Rationale. The Amoeba system divides the company into small groups called “Amoebas” that operate with their own P&L accounting systems directly linked to their respective markets. Amoebas, which are run independently, naturally foster the development of leaders with managerial awareness. Fur- ther, all Amoeba members take initiative in their daily work to improve the profitability of the Amoeba to which they belong. This facilitates Management by All, free exchange of ideas, and a broader sphere of influence for each employee.
The profitability of an Amoeba is calculated as the added value it creates per hour.
Results are disclosed to Amoeba members transparently, so you can actually see in real-time how your work is reflected in manage- ment. Amoebas that deliver good performance, however, do not get disproportionately higher financial rewards. This is because the add- ed value created contributes to the entire Kyocera Group. At the core of Amoeba Management is the idea to “Work Hard for the Sake of Our Colleagues,” a basic tenet of the Kyocera Philosophy.
Even a poorly performing Amoeba can become a great help to other Amoebas in the next phase of business. We must share grati- tude and sincerity while working hard to bring out the best in each other. This ties into the “material and intellectual growth of all our employees” referenced in our Management Rationale.
istence with Society,” and “Coexistence with the World.”
“Coexistence with Nature” means a company must uphold ethical standards that balance its business with coexistence and the cycle of life, rather than pursuing purely economic interests that disturb the cycle of the natural environment. “Coexistence with Society” is the idea that long-term prosperity depends on providing satisfaction not only to employees, customers, shareholders, and business associates, but also to society as a whole. “Coexistence with the World” means that as a company globalizes into new markets and communities, it must devel- op a deeper understanding of the local culture and history, and contrib-
actual experiences and “rules of thumb” from our founder, Kazuo Inamori. Our goal to aim for growth and development while always be- ing fair and impartial reflects universal ethical, moral, and social norms embodied in the principle to “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” Our palm-sized “Kyocera Philosophy Pock- etbook,” which originated in Japan, has now been translated into at least 10 different languages and distributed to employees worldwide, helping to share our philosophy and foster a sense of unity among the Group.
ute to the development of the region.
These three ideas of coexistence are linked to many of Kyocera's
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and can be found in various forms in the business activities of the Kyocera Group.
  ● The Principle of Cash-Basis Management
Solid
 We do not strive merely to understand its content like a theory; rather, we try to practice the philosophy routinely in our daily work. These tireless efforts will nurture the spirit of making better decisions, which in turn will lead to improving the Kyocera Group's character as a company. The fact that our global organization shares this philosophy gives us confidence that we can move forward with a persistent will toward a brighter future full of hopes and dreams.
The source of our strength lies in Management by All and the keen motivation employees feel under Amoeba Management.

           Value Creation at Kyocera
Examples of Providing Value to Society
With the aim of fulfilling societal needs, the Kyocera Group will incorporate elemental technologies developed since its founding into our practice of Amoeba Management, combining them with innovative technologies to provide new value to society.

everyone can travel safely
P.13
As we anticipate a future of autonomous driving systems, we will focus on the need for infrastructure development that allows people to travel in safety and security.
Utilizing our experience in developing communications infrastructure for Japan's PHS network and the international iBurst System, as well as our core wireless handset technologies, we will conduct autonomous driving
demonstrations involving rap- id-transit buses (BRT), signal-co- operative roadside units, and smart-pole intelligent transport systems (ITS). These initiatives will extend to safe- driving sup- port, disaster support, and ac- cident prevention at railroad crossings.
 GaN application business using environmentally friendly materials
Gallium nitride (GaN) is attracting increased attention as a key material to enable a low-carbon society.
Having long investigated GaN and other advanced materials, the Kyocera Group in January 2021 completed its acquisition of U.S.-based Soraa Laser Diode, Inc. (now KYOCERA SLD Laser, Inc.),
which develops high-effi- ciency, high-power lasers. Combined with our technol- ogies in crystal growth and semiconductor packaging, we will develop high-perfor- mance laser devices and expand their range of ap- plication to fields such as high-speed optical commu- nications and optical-fiber- based power supplies.

Value Creation at Kyocera
 Special Issue
Amoeba Management: Fusing Technical Assets and Enabling New Technologies. What Lies at the Heart of Our Latest R&D in Transportation Infrastructure?
   The Kyocera Group has produced a broad range of technologies primarily based on fine ceramics. Our goal is to bring these underlying technologies together to create new advances that contribute to society.
One example of this is our new initiative in transportation infrastructure development
begun this year.

   Amoeba groups that pursue a common ideal
support of global needs, developing bonds within our Group, and a spirit of cooperation and collaboration that has served us well over the years.
It must be said that, with rapid techno- logical advancement, one technology is continually being supplanted by another. However, we never let accumulated exper- tise fall by the wayside. This is because we believe knowledge developed through tire- less efforts over the years can serve society in new ways in the future.
Our pursuit of transportation infrastruc- ture development, which goes beyond the amoeba framework, is one such example.
Bringing our technological assets to bear
Today society faces various issues concern- ing mobility, including inadequate public transportation for those who need it the most, continuing traffic fatalities, and the need to comply with environmental regula- tions. Can the Kyocera Group pool its exist- ing expertise to develop new technologies that benefit people’s lives? This question lies at the heart of our latest challenge.
The Kyocera Group has almost 30 years of experience in developing wireless com- munication technologies. We developed our first mobile phone in 1991. Following this, we developed our first wireless network equip- ment in 1994, and a new business was born for Japan’s PHS system.
Our communications business served as a foundation for PHS infrastructure, de- veloping a total of 400,000 base stations.
Following the reduction in scale of the PHS business over time, we shifted our at- tention to transportation infrastructure as an area where we could potentially utilize this communications infrastructure tech- nology to serve society.
This highly developed technology can also be easily adapted to work with 5G net- works, which began operating in many markets in the spring of 2020 . While 5G allows for high-speed communications, multi-spot connections, and high-definition video, problems persist with coverage area. To solve this problem, Kyocera Corporation developed 5G Smart Routers, which can optimize data loads within our own local 5G systems.
The Group has also played a role in a broad range of business initiatives involving in-vehicle equipment. The Group provides our vehicle-centered society with a wide range of technologies, including optical components such as automotive cameras, displays, and lenses. We are currently devel- oping an AI in-vehicle camera which uses deep learning to provide high-accuracy object recognition, and a millimeter-wave radar that integrates blind-spot detection sensors, parking assistance, and space-de- tection sensors.
We hope to help achieve a sustainable society in which all people enjoy enhanced
mobility freely and safely, with less environ- mental impact, using solutions developed by fusing diverse technologies. As a compa- ny that has relentlessly pursued technology development on a broad scale, we believe this is the next mission we should achieve.
Towards the development of a free and safe transportation network
We are currently pursuing two transporta- tion infrastructure development projects.
One is a self-driving system for buses.
Autonomous driving relies on highly ad- vanced sensing and communications tech- nologies. Kyocera Corporation is involved in the Mobility Innovation Consortium backed by the East Japan Railway Company. Kyoc- era was responsible for road-to-vehicle communication as part of the self-driving bus trials held on Japan’s Kesennuma Line BRT in FY2020. We installed Intelligent Transport System (ITS) roadside units and controlled road-to-vehicle communications. This project also involved verifying wireless communications on BRT roads, and testing autonomous braking systems when an ob- stacle is detected in bus’s path.
We also participated in trials involving trucks in a convoy on the Shin-Tomei Ex- pressway, where sensing solutions with millimeter-wave radar and stereo cameras proved to be of great benefit. Whether in rural or urban areas, public transportation will remain essential. We hope to help sup- port this need in some capacity.
A second development project serves to promote the use of signal-cooperative roadside units and smart-pole ITS systems on public roads.
Wireless roadside unit
Signal controller
Wireless roadside units and sensors in traffic signals can transmit information to cars, assist self-driving vehicles, and prevent missed signals when a person is driving. Smart-pole ITS is a system that can be installed in street lamps and utility poles where traffic signals are not pres- ent. This system can alert drivers to dan- ger in real-time, using peripheral sensing technologies to help prevent accidents at intersections that lack traffic signals. In the future, this system could also make self-driving safer by sending hazard infor- mation to autonomous vehicles, which would help support the adoption of au- tonomous driving.
We believe this system will ultimately become an indispensable part of our lives, with expanded functions to help emergen- cy vehicles pass through congested traffic, prevent vehicles from entering railway crossings, supervise children in the neigh- borhood, and in help provide aid in the event of a disaster.
Companies exist for people
Ever since our founding we have hoped to see our ideas spawn unprecedented new technologies that contribute to society, and bring happiness to people worldwide by improving the safety and convenience of their daily lives.
Transportation infrastructure develop- ment represents just one of the initiatives we have adopted, with multiple divisions collaborating with countless amoebas, in- cluding planning and marketing, sales, operations, maintenance, production and quality assurance.
However, we do have a conviction. We firmly believe that each technology we de- velop serves not just as a company asset, but also as a seed from which other new technologies will one day spring, helping to change people’s lives, and society, for the better.
The history of the Kyocera Group is a history of technological development. We hope to advance the extensive range of technological assets left to us by our fore- bears to develop a safe and secure transpor- tation infrastructure that brings freedom of mobility to a new level. We will continue to rise to the challenge in pursuit of this social mission.
Danger alert
    Since its founding in 1959, Kyocera Corpora- tion has based its corporate management on the bonds shared by its employees. The com- mon criterion for decision-making among our employees involves the question: “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” As a result, Kyocera Group employees have been imbued with a spirit of support for each other, sharing one anoth- er’s challenges and celebrations, which con- tinues to this day.
   Kyocera Corporation’s unique ‘Amoeba Management’ approach was also born out of this philosophy. Under this system, each business segment, product line, and manu- facturing process consists of many small, quasi-independent organizations, known as amoebas, which continually create what customers currently want and anticipate society will need in the future, based on a common sense of what is right. Amoebas evolve and can divide or co-exist alongside one another. Similarly, the amoebas that make up the Kyocera Group pursue their own goals, and collaborate with other amoebas when common goals are created.
  This also applies to technology develop- ment. Throughout the history of the Kyocera Group, beginning with the development of the U-Shaped Kelcima used in early televi- sions, we have consistently expanded the applications for fine ceramic technologies in

● Introducing Local 5G at Manufacturing Plants/Features of Kyocera's Local 5G System
 Expanding Local 5G and
Related Businesses as a Catalyst for Growth
We aim to improve productivity by performing demonstration tests and verifying the effectiveness of local 5G. One example is the demonstration tests of local 5G at our Shiga Yasu Plant, which we hope to use as a step- ping stone to new business development. We are now experimenting with wearable cameras and high definition video distribution on production lines for our clay-type Li-ion storage battery products produced at the Shiga Yasu Plant.
We will use knowledge developed through these demonstration tests to accumulate high value-added assets that can be rolled out at other Kyocera plants, and will use the system as a showcase for customers look- ing for remote work support systems.
Kyocera Corporation's local 5G system offers stable communication through dedicated bandwidth; easy installation due to its compact, light- weight design; flexibility to meet custom needs regarding configuration and functionality; and secure communications on an independent net- work. Looking ahead, we hope to leverage the high-capacity, high-speed communications provided by local 5G to boost productivity and pursue automation initiatives using high resolution images and AI, further devel- oping the smart factory concept.

The Paris Agreement, enacted in 2016, aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to less than 2°C — and ideally, less than 1.5°C — over pre-industrial levels. The Kyocera Group recognizes the importance of climate change countermeasures. In FY2019, we set a long-term environmental target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than 30% by FY2031 compared to FY2014 levels, with SBT certification. Our plan involves new technology development, deeper energy conservation, and verifying new methods of renewable energy adoption. With carbon reduction initiatives gaining pace worldwide, we are considering additional long-term targets. Future efforts will include scenario analysis and planning to increase climate change countermeasures based on recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Information Disclosure (TCFD).

Efforts to Create a Low-Carbon Society
Climate Strategy-Responding to TCFD Recommendations-
The Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) asks all companies to assess climate-related risks and opportunities using climate change scenarios, and to reflect and dis- close them in their business strategies and risk management. In 2020, the Kyocera Group agreed with TCFD recommendations, conducted anal- ysis for 2°C and 4°C climate-warming scenarios, and examined business strategies based on the scenario outcomes. This year, we conducted a scenario analysis of “well-below” (“WB”) 2°C and 1.5°C warming cases and disclosed our business strategy, financial impact, and problem-solv- ing methods on our public sustainability website.
Climate Change Scenarios
Governance System
The Kyocera Group ranks climate change among our priority management issues.
Our Corporate Social Responsibility Committee meets semiannually with top management to discuss long-term environmental goals, strategies and execution plans.
We also share our climate action policy at the semiannual Kyocera Group International Management Conference.
Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Our Businesses
The Kyocera Group incorporates climate change risks into our company-wide risk management and planning.
Our method of assessing risks and opportunities involves categorizing emerging needs and global trends alongside stakeholder expectations. After assessing stakeholder priorities and Kyocera's own priorities, we classify prospective impact into three levels: major, medium, and minor.
Scenario Analysis
We conducted a scenario analysis to ascertain Kyocera's future climate-change-related risks and opportunities, in order to build them into our business strategy.
In doing this, we referenced international simulation results and created our own temperature-increase scenarios of WB2°C and 1.5°C, as well as 2°C and 4°C, before conducting our analysis for 2030.
1.5°C Case
In this scenario, governments across the globe introduce stronger renewable energy incentives and mandates, and electric power companies set targets toward becoming “Net Carbon Zero.”
In renewable-energy-related industries, including solar power generation, storage batteries, and fuel cells, we will collaborate with power utilities to help them expand their renewable energy portfolios, and will support the creation of regional microgrids. As AI, IoT, smart cities, and other digital technologies expand into communities, we will increase production capacity and technology development in our Semiconductor and Information & Communication businesses. DX visualization will enable us to forecast demand for electric power, and the renewable energy imbalance will be reduced. All of this will bring further strides toward a low-carbon society. We imple- ment Business Continuity Plan (BCP) measures based on the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, with physical risks assessed as minor. As a result, efforts to create a low-carbon society will create new opportunities for energy-related businesses, and the impact of physical risks is regarded as small, so profit impact is expected to be favorable.

Developing Human Resources with Diverse Skillsets
Our business environment is changing rapidly. To continue growing, it is essential
that Kyocera Corporation not only attracts diverse human resources, but also empowers each
employee to reach their full human potential.
That's why in June 2021 we updated our personnel system with new methods to cultivate human resources and promote diversity, starting with our global headquarters and domestic operations in Japan.
・ Flextime (for sales staff)
Our style of work is becoming increasingly diverse according to job functions and responsibilities. Kyocera Corporation is en- couraging the adoption of workstyles that suit the characteris- tics of the job, including a flextime system for sales divisions in Japan. This effort is intended to boost the company's total pro- ductivity.

● Increasing Women in Leadership
Our target is for Kyocera Corporation's management to be at
least 6% women by March 31, 2023. We are expanding train- ing opportunities for management candidates and promot- ing capable female employees into managerial positions. As of April 2021, Kyocera Corporation had 121 female managers (3.7%); and within its executive team, one female director and two female executive officers (7.9%). We will continue to seek new ways of promoting the participation of women through- out the Group.
● Expanding Childcare Leave to Male Employees
Changing family patterns are bringing an increase in households in which both parents work full-time outside the home. Kyocera Corpora- tion is developing a culture that encourages employees, regardless of gender, to be involved in childcare in a way that allows work/life balance. We understand our employees' need to balance work and family com- mitments, and we encourage our male employees to be involved in the care of their children.

 A Foundation for Creating Value Respect for Human Rights
Respect for Human Rights
The Kyocera Group Human Rights Policy expressly prohibits any form of forced labor; child labor; employment discrimination based on gender, age, religion, ideology, nationality, physical characteristics or disabilities; sexual harassment; and abuses of authority in the workplace. Kyocera Corporation is striving to develop a more comfortable work environment that enhances employee motivation
through open communication with labor organizations and regular workplace communications.
Human Rights Policy
Human Rights Management System
The Kyocera Group has created a working group in which managers from multiple departments, including human resources, CSR, risk management, procurement, auditing, and public relations, participate. After completing training for education on human rights initiatives, we are also considering broader training on human rights issues.
●Employee
Some plants in the Kyocera Group undergo labor-related human rights audits implemented by a third-party organization based on the RBA Code of Conduct.
●Supply Chain
We are conducting a CSR assessment of our supply chain, which includes an assessment of human rights items.
 Kyocera Group Human Rights Policy
All Kyocera businesses are designed to foster a more sustainable society, in reflection of our Kyocera Group Management Rationale --which is, “To provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our employees, and through our joint efforts, contribute to the advance- ment of society and humankind.”
This requires us to ensure complete respect for the rights of every member of our value chain, including all Kyocera Group stakeholders.
As a result, the Kyocera Group supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.
Scope

Important Human Rights Issues
The Kyocera Group shall place particular importance on the following issues in our efforts to protect human rights.
Prohibiting forced labor:
All labor at the Kyocera Group is voluntary. We shall never use forced, captive, or detained labor; involuntary or exploitative prison labor; or any labor force involving slavery or human trafficking.
Prohibiting child labor with minimum age requirements:
We shall not allow children under the age of 15 to engage in any form of Kyocera Group employment. We shall provide thorough health and safety training, and shall allow no employee younger than 18 to engage in any work that could involve potential health or safety risk.
Ensuring appropriate work conditions:
Work hours shall never exceed the limits set by applicable local laws. Wages shall always comply with applicable minimum wage regulations, and benefits required by law shall always be provided.
Prohibiting harassment:
We shall never engage in harsh or inhumane treatment toward workers, including any type of harassment, sexual harassment, sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental or physical suppression, or verbal abuse.
Prohibiting discrimination:
We shall never engage in unjust discriminatory treatment based on race, skin color, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or ex- pression, ethnic background or nationality, presence or absence of disabilities, pregnancy, religion, political party affiliation, union member- ship, presence or absence of military service experience, genetic information, marital history, or any other aspects set forth by law. In addi- tion, we shall never conduct any type of medical or physical examination for unjust and discriminatory purposes.
Respecting freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining:
We shall respect the right to associate freely, and the rights of workers engaged in collective activities, in full accordance with the laws and labor customs of our host nations.
Conducting Human Rights Due Diligence
• In order to achieve the goals of this Policy, we shall conform to practices that respect human rights under the oversight responsibility of Kyocera Group management.
• Additionally, we shall construct and implement human rights due diligence frameworks based on the UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Risk Mitigation Measures
●Prohibition of Forced Labor
The Kyocera Group Human Rights Policy and Kyocera Supply Chain CSR Procurement Guideline prohibit slavery, human trafficking and all other forced labor, along with child labor, throughout the Kyocera Group. Our supply chains are also required to comply with the Kyocera Supply Chain CSR Procurement Guideline.
●Prevention of Harassment
Kyocera began providing training for all employees in 2020 as a measure to pre- vent harassment.
Supervisors are equipped with necessary knowledge and training, including case studies, to ensure a workplace free of harassment. In the event that any harass- ment or human rights violation does occur, a framework has been established to ensure that workers can contact a help desk, anonymously if they wish, and neces- sary privacy measures will be taken.

 A Foundation for Creating Value Promoting Digitization
Digitization: Fostering a New Corporate Culture
The Kyocera Group continues to invest aggressively in company-wide digitization and digital transformation (DX). Our goals include enhancing competitiveness and
serving new needs arising from a declining population, diversifying workstyles and related social trends.
Increased digitization will drive the horizontal expansion of our group-wide business and IT strategies, bringing deeper employee awareness and enhancing our corporate culture.
● Leveraging DX to Achieve CX and BX
The Company's DX strategy does not represent an end goal, but rather a means to achieving sustainable growth through deeper employee awareness and an enhanced corporate culture.
Our DX objectives include stimulating a broader corporate transformation (CX) and business transformation (BX).
● Fostering Junior Employees with Broader Per- spective
DX to BX transition requires junior leaders with Company-wide perspective.
Over the next 10 years, we plan to develop the foundations for long-term growth through a Company-wide strategy of human resource development and training that reduces any sense of internal boundaries.
● Current DX Status
Formed in April 2020, Kyocera Corporation's Digital Business Promo-
tion Group is developing a cross-functional platform for information sharing by employees from diverse groups. By removing barriers be- tween departments, this initiative will become a hub for IT and human resource development.
Sharing systems that individual departments formerly had to develop independently can bring quicker solutions and a better return on in- vestment, while developing IT personnel with a Company-wide per- spective.
Looking ahead, the Digital Business Promotion Group will continue to
break down barriers between departments to become a hub of infor- ... mation and human resources serving the entire company.

Kyocera has established the “Kyocera Group Philosophy Committee” to educate and permeate the “Kyocera Philosophy,” which is our corporate philosophy setting forth the importance of conducting business of management in a fair and honest way, basing its fundamental judgments on a precept that “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?”
The committee has set the education policy regarding “Kyocera Philosophy” of each entity in Kyocera Group, and discusses and decides the measures to promote an understanding of “Kyocera Philosophy” and practice it.

Initiatives for Strengthening Corporate Governance
Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Functions and roles of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Kyocera has strengthened the supervisory function of the Board of Directors and audit function of Directors by appointing three Outside Directors with extensive knowledge and experience as a professor of graduate School, as an attorney-at-law, or as a person with management experience, and two Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members with extensive knowledge and experience as an attorney-at-law, or as a certified public accountant and having the Directors provide sufficient explanations to the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members at meetings of the Board of Directors and other meetings. In addition, Directors make decisions with an external perspective by exchanging opinions with Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Su- pervisory Board Members on overall management. Furthermore, Kyocera has established a sound corporate culture pursuant to the “Kyocera Philosophy,” which is the corporate philosophy based on the general criteria in making judgment, namely “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” Kyocera establishes its corporate governance system through practicing the Kyocera Philosophy. Such system is supplemented by the function to check the management by the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members.
Thoughts of Kyocera with Respect to the Independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Kyocera thinks that it is important to retain persons who have outstanding “personality,” “capability” and “insight” as Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members of Kyocera and to have such persons supervise and audit Kyocera’s management from an objective point of view.
The Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members of Kyocera are selected as independent Directors and independent Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members compliance with the following “Independence Standards for Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members,” which Kyocera established, in addition to the requirements concerning the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members prescribed by the Companies Act and the independence standards prescribed by the financial instruments exchanges.

Cross-Shareholdings
Policy regarding cross-holding of shares
 We engage in cross-holding of shares with the objective of improving our business value in the medium to long-term, focusing on corporate growth through enhancement, maintenance and development of business relationships, realization of profits through shareholdings, and the issuing companies’ social significance.
In our annual review of cross-holdings of shares, if we determine that there is no significance in holding the relevant shares, in principle we will dispose of such shares.
Pursuant to the above-mentioned policy, we currently hold shares in KDDI CORPORATION (“KDDI”). We continue to hold these shares for economic reasons and because we anticipate that KDDI will be an important business partner of ours in future business opportunities.
Involvement in succession planning
The Board of Directors is actively involved in the establishment and implementation of a succession plan for Executives based on Kyocera’s objectives (such as the management rationale) and specific management strategies. Appropriate monitoring is also con- ducted to ensure that sufficient time and resources are dedicated to the systematic development of candidates for succession.
In addition, we have established an Executive Officer system to ensure the effective and efficient operation of the business execution system. One of the objectives of this Executive Officer system is to plan the development of the next generation of executives by actively identifying managers who display outstanding humanity and ability to take charge of the future management of Kyocera.
In line with this purpose, the Board of Directors checks the development of future Executives every year and determines the appoint- ment of Executive officers based on these findings.
Training for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members are given, at the time of their assumption of their office, explanations concerning the details of the business of Kyocera and their respective roles and responsibilities as considered necessary in order for them to perform their roles and fulfill their responsibilities.
Further, even after assuming office, if a Director or Audit & Supervisory Board Member requests, training tailored to meet the individual requests are given and opportunities for advancement of necessary knowledge are offered or introduced, or financial support for the necessary expenses for such purposes are provided, according to their individual situations.
 Review of cross-holdings of shares
Kyocera Group Management Committee and our Board of Directors conduct an annual review of all cross-holdings of shares to assess whether continued holding of the relevant shares is appropriate, taking into account business needs, such as maintenance and/or enhancement of business relationships and efficiency in use of assets, including capital costs, with respect to individual shares.
We decrease our holdings of shares for which a justifiable reason for holding them cannot be identified through discussions with the issuing companies.
We sold some of our cross-holdings of shares in the year ended March 31, 2021 as a result of such reviews.
Exercise of voting rights
In exercising the voting rights of shares that we hold through cross-holdings, we undertake a comprehensive assessment based on criteria that include whether the proposed measure conforms to our basic policy regarding cross-holdings of shares, and whether our exercise of such voting rights will produce improvement in medium to long-term business value and in shareholder returns, or may cause damage to the management efficiency or financial soundness of the issuers, while continuing to respect their overall management policy and strategy.

 Corporate Governance
Messages from Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
  Messages from Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Regarding the future direction of the Kyocera Group, we received messages from three Outside Directors and two Outside
Audit & Supervisory Board Members told from various perspectives including subject areas such as “decision-making” and “governance” ideals, the importance of the “Kyocera Philosophy,” “work styles,” and “mergers & acquisitions.”
I want to do my best to help make Kyocera “The Company” that is respected all over the world
Outside Director Atsushi Aoyama
Looking back over the past year, there was an incident in which it came to light that safety certification had been obtained fraudulently. In response to this, Kyocera Corpo- ration and the Board of Directors did the right thing by utilizing the Kyocera Philosophy, which is based on “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” in corporate governance to deal with the incident in good faith and to formulate mea- sures to prevent the incident from happening again. In a time where innovation is ac- celerating due to advances in science and technology, and not taking risks is, in fact, a risk, I feel that the Board of Directors is also establishing a system that enables innova- tion and new business creation that transcends the boundaries of business fields by Kyocera Corporation taking calculated risks for continued sustainable growth in the future. In addition, as represented by the SDGs, there is a growing trend of social re- sponsibilities being demanded from companies. With “Respect the Divine and Love People” as our corporate motto, Kyocera Corporation is a pioneering company in man- agement grounded in its sense of values, and thus I believe we should further strength- en our management philosophy. From a professional standpoint, I hope I can make a contribution and do my best to help make Kyocera Corporation “The Company” that is respected all over the world, with it continuing to create a bright future through all our employees demonstrating creativity and committing to innovation.
It is important that we enhance the governance of domestic and overseas subsidiaries and affiliated companies
Sharing the Management Rationale and� Kyocera Philosophy� throughout the Group
Outside Director  Akiko Koyano
For the two years since I became an Outside Director, I have been asking questions and making suggestions focusing on the Kyocera Philosophy, diversity, and work styles. The COVID-19 pandemic made us think long and hard about what it means to work and what it means to live. Increasing the options in how we work contributes to the diversity of our members and, by extension, innovation. I look forward to continuing to see the fruits of all kinds of originality and creativity.
Due to technological innovation, the world will change even more rapidly as we head to- ward the year 2030. As a global company, we are required to stay ahead of the curve while working closely with fellow members outside of Japan. Our starting point will always be our Management Rationale and the Kyocera Philosophy. Taking the UL certification prob- lem discovered last year very seriously, I think it is important that the entire Group active- ly discusses “What do we consider to be the right choice as a human being?” and “how to contribute to the advancement of society and humankind,” and including social contribu- tion activities, for each leader to talk about the relationship between business activities and societal needs in an easy-to-understand manner and share it with all members. I want to value discussions linked to the Management Rationale and our future vision whether it be with the Board of Directors or with the Nominating and Remuneration Committee.
In a time of rapid change, a
challenge going forward will be
how to shorten the time required
for training after a merger or
acquisition
Outside Audit & Supervisory
Board Member Masaaki Akiyama
      I would like to express my opinions based on my management experience at another company to help contribute to the realization of our management objectives
Outside Director Eiji Kakiuchi
I became Outside Director by being elected at the 67th Ordinary General Meeting of
Shareholders. This is the first time for me to serve as Outside Director of a listed com- pany, and I feel that this big responsibility will get the best out of me. Needless to say, the Kyocera Group is one of the biggest companies not only in Kyoto but in Japan, and its employees all over the world are proud to work here. One of the roles of the Board of Directors is to embody the thoughts of employees and achieve growth and prosper- ity that meet the expectations of our stakeholders. While the role of Outside Director is basically to maintain independence from the management team, I believe it is also about understanding the enthusiasm of the management team and the business en- vironment, and then from this achieving discussions and decision-making with calm and objective opinions.
In my case, I would like to contribute by expressing opinions from my management experience at another company. I have experienced the importance of this role first- hand from my experience as top management at another company in which I was as- sisted by the diverse range of opinions of Outside Directors many times who gave me a lot of insights. I will play my part in achieving our management objectives in order to meet the expectations for which I have been elected.
Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member
Hitoshi Sakata
Reflecting on this past year, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Audit & Supervisory Board has implemented its audit activities as planned. At the Board of Di- rectors, while inside directors and outside directors have exchanged opinions freely, I hope that such dialog will enliven yet further.
This fiscal year, Kyocera Corporation is consolidating its market segments to tackle man- agement issues flexibly and across departments. Amid such organizational reforms, we also need to respond swiftly to the state of corporate governance. Furthermore, the Kyocera Group has a large number of subsidiaries and affiliated companies both do- mestically and outside of Japan, and so it is important that we enhance the governance of these companies. To that end, the Audit & Supervisory Board must further enhance its cooperation with the Corporate Global Audit Division and ensure communication with local employees. Kyocera Corporation will continue to actively expand its business in diverse fields such as 5G, AI, printing, and clean energy. I expect big things.In times like these, we must enhance the work environment, which is open and transparent and where all our employees can have aspirations and passion towards their work.
I hope to contribute to the further development of Kyocera Corporation by utilizing my knowledge and experience as an attorney at law.
On the Board of Directors, predominantly taking a financial perspective, I have made re- marks about investment projects, in particular, focusing on plans to recover investment and the financial details of companies we are/were considering investing in. On the Audit & Supervisory Board, I constantly keep an eye on the audits of the entire Kyocera Group by deliberating on the outcomes of business audits, receiving reports from accounting auditors quarterly, and receiving reports of audit outcomes from subsidiary auditors at the Kyocera Group Audit & Supervisory Board Members Meeting every six months.
The pillar of our corporate governance is the “Kyocera Philosophy,” and I believe that the widespread adoption of the “Kyocera Philosophy” is important for achieving our Manage- ment Rationale. Going forward, I believe that cooperation between the Corporate Global Audit Division, which conducts business audits focusing on the business risks of overseas subsidiaries, and the Audit & Supervisory Board will be even more important.
For mergers & acquisitions, we focus on projects that have a high synergistic effect with our business segments, and currently, we adopt a policy of giving the company time to develop after the acquisition, but in a time of rapid change, I believe that how we shorten this time will be a challenge going forward.

 Corporate Governance
Compliance and Risk Management
Improving Compliance, Risk Management and our Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
The business environment that the Kyocera Group finds itself in is facing volatility, uncertainty, complexity,
and ambiguity, driving the need to review our supply chain to shore up economic security amidst a shift towards the decoupling of the world’s economies. The Kyocera Group will look to bolster the resiliency of our management foundations and achieve sustainable growth for the Group by actively pursuing risk management, compliance, and BCP activities essential for survival amidst these uncertain times.
● Global Compliance Promotion Activities
Risk Management and Compliance Conference
Held four times a year, the newly established Risk Management and Compliance Conference serves as a forum to share infor- mation and exchange opinions with business divisions, admin- istrative divisions, and domestic affiliates. The Kyocera Group conducts risk management, compliance, and BCP activities, with the President as the Group Chief Officer and the General Manager of the Corporate Legal and Intellectual Property Group as the Chair of the Risk Management and Compliance Conference.
Cooperation with Risk & Compliance Managers
The Global Compliance Division was reorganized in April 2020. Following the establishment of a new risk and compliance sys- tem that integrates the three core pillars of compliance, risk management, and the Business Continuity Plan (BCP), we ap- pointed Risk & Compliance Managers to corresponding busi- ness divisions and administrative divisions. In addition to being provided an e-learning training course upon their appoint- ment, Risk & Compliance Managers representing each division maintain consistent cooperation with the Global Compliance Division by participating in regular meetings and consultations.
Risk & Compliance Month Initiatives
■Organization of Chart of Risk Management, Compliance, and BCP Activities Promotion System
Compliance
The Kyocera Group has set out a Compliance Statement to demonstrate its proactive stance towards pursuing compliance activities on a global level both within the Company, and to external stakeholders. This Compliance Statement has been issued across the Group, and is used to ingrain a sense of awareness for compliance issues. In addition, as the Company’s business activities expand overseas, there is a need to comply with the personal information protection restrictions imposed by each country. Around the time the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect in Europe, there has been an increased push to introduce strict laws concerning the handling of personal data in countries around the world, including new restrictions on the transfer of personal data and other information outside the country or region. We will continue to cooperate with related divisions and overseas Group compa- nies in endeavoring to conduct continual studies and implement measures concerning the handling of personal information in order to properly address concerns related to global digital marketing activities. Further, in a step toward addressing the recent tightening of anti-corruption laws and regulations, of which many international companies have run afoul, we have published the Kyocera Group Basic Policy on anti-corruption, which serves as our basic stance on anti-corruption in conducting global business activities. In addition to Japanese, this Basic Policy has also been translated into English and Chinese, and is distributed to all Global companies. This An- ti-Corruption Compliance System is defined in the Anti-Corruption Regulations of the Kyocera Corporation. Additionally, Group com- panies are implementing internal regulations and training employees on anti-corruption rules and procedures.
Revisions to the Privacy Policy
The privacy policy outlined on the Kyocera Corporation website was revised to provide a clearer description of privacy provisions to customers to bring it closer in line with the intent of the Act on the Protection of Personal Information. We are also revising the contents of privacy policies set by overseas Group companies to comply with the legal requirements of each country, and we are pursuing measures concerning the handling of personal information, and the collection, use, management, and protection of such.
Corporate Ethics
We are currently exploring options for the implementation of in-house confirmation systems for products and services in order to account for a broad range of social conventions and ethics in addition to legal compliance.
Addressing Issues of Impropriety Concerning Chemical Products
An issue with inappropriate conduct concerning the certification by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), a U.S.-based third party safety science organization, of chemical products manufactured and sold by the Company was found. To address this issue, the Company has established a special investigation committee, and the Division is providing this investigation its full backing, serving as com- mittee secretariat. As part of future corrective actions and recurrence prevention measures, the Company is implementing ethics and compliance training based on the committee’s investigation report, using this issue as a case study to help promote awareness reform among employees.
  President of Kyocera Corporation (Group Chief Officer)
  For Kyocera Corporation, each December marks Risk & Compliance Month, which is used to raise awareness and provide risk and compliance training for all employees. In 2020, the President gave an address to reaffirm employee awareness of the importance of risk and compliance activities. Other activities addressing risk and compliance include the provision of reference information at morning meetings (small notes), the holding of e-learning courses for all our employees, and feature columns published in the Company magazine “Respect the Divine and Love People.” By sharing these initiatives with Group companies, we will look to devel- oping a Group system whereby risk management, BCP, and compliance activities permeate throughout.
Global Five-regional Legal and IP System
Kyocera Group’s proactive M & A strategy has seen the number of companies grow to almost 300, a figure that is projected to in- crease further in future. As a result, the Corporate Legal and Intellectual Property Group, to which Global Compliance Division be- longs, divides the global network into five regions. The presiding company in each region works with Group companies in their region to build a system for reducing legal risk, while our division also draws on this system to make an active contribution to promoting compliance. Building networks to facilitate cooperation and information sharing between Group companies is also vital for ensuring the efficient roll out of compliance activities at Group companies, and on a global level. To this end, we have newly established the Kyocera Group Legal, Compliance, and Intellectual Property Conference (GLCIP), to be attended by presiding com- panies in each region and Group companies, to consult on Group policies. Conferences are actively held in each of the five regions, including Japan and South Korea, the U.S., Europe, China, and the Asia Pacific, prompting lively discussion based on circumstances pertaining to each region.

Compliance and Risk Management
Risk Management
The Kyocera Group is making group-wide efforts to reinforce our risk management system to cope with global risks that are be- coming more complex. The Kyocera Group faces various risks that may affect the credibility or business sustainability of the Kyoc- era Group, including changes in the market environment, the occurrence of natural disasters, incidents and accidents, the impact of climate change, information security, stoppages and deficiencies in labor conditions in the supply chain, and violations of human rights. To cope with these issues, the Kyocera Group endeavors to reduce and mitigate risks while implementing countermeasures through the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and acting on "Kyocera Group Risk Management Policy" put in place for this purpose.
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
The Kyocera Group has established a policy of aiming for prompt recovery and resumption of operations even if the supply of products and services is interrupted due to a natural disaster, and is implementing BCP based on this policy. In Japan, Kyocera Corporation is taking measures to shore up critical management resources, such as the securing of key equipment and facilities, and making arrangement for repair materials and ensuring alternate means of production in anticipation for major earthquakes in the future. To this end, we are also incorporating BCM (business continuity management) into our business activities, including in terms of providing education and training, and correcting and revising measures.

 Kyocera Group Basic Policy on Risk Management
1. In accordance with assurance of compliance and the spirit of the Kyocera Philosophy, the group will consider what is the right conduct as a human being and act based on the value standards.
2. In accordance with the spirit of the Kyocera Philosophy, the group will accept "the highest priority is to ensure safety of bodies and lives of people," deal with crisis, and for convergence of crisis, cooperate among employees as a unit to minimize loss, recover the damage, and make efforts to prevent reoccurrences, thereby attempting to remove or mitigate impediments to the interests of each stakeholder (the interested party), including customers, business partners, shareholders/investors, and the community.
3. The Kyocera Group will attempt to continuously develop its business through implementing risk management.
4. The group will act with its social mission to stably supply products and services helpful to the progress and development of society.

 Under the Kyocera Group Basic Policy on Risk Management, the Group is working to systematically organize rules and reg- ulations concerning disaster response measures, crisis man- agement measures, and information security. The Disaster Response Manual outlines the basic guidelines for disaster response, and defines regulations relating to measures in re- sponse to earthquakes, tsunamis, storm and flood damage, etc. The Crisis Management Manual outlines the basic guide- lines for crisis management, and defines regulations relating to measures in response to a serious incident such as a ter- rorist attack. The Information Security Manual defines com- mon regulations under the Information Security Manage- ment Policy, and regulations relating to electronic information security and the protection of personal information.
Review of Information Security Rules
With regard to information security rules for preventing the
the Company, we revised rules concerning the use of information devices at manufacturing sites to more effectively utilize IoT technologies in manufacturing sites while maintaining a high degree of security, and to better respond to new requirements for remote auditing and other monitoring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Promotion of Information Security Training and Initiatives
The Kyocera Group conducts information security training based on the Information Security Training Regulations. Further, public servers undergo vulnerability assessments at least once a year. In January 2021, Kyocera officially joined the Nippon CSIRT Associa- tion. Through its involvement with this Association, we look to enhance the security level of Kyocera Corporation and the entire Kyocera Group by sharing information on security incidents and vulnerabilities with other member companies.

Improving BCP Activities to Reduce Risks to Storms,
Floods or Cyber Attacks
In 2020, we experienced some significant storm and flood damages, including torrential rains in July. However, the imple- mentation of improvements to our BCP at each of our loca- tions based on lessons learned from the storm and flood two years ago ensured that there was no major damage or impact on business continuity.
In addition, the recent spread of IoT technology and cloud computing environments to production sites, together with an increase in employees working remotely at home by COVID-19, has resulted in growing concerns about business interrup- tions due to computer virus infections and cyber attacks. Preparation for unforeseen circumstances includes both the backup of important information and recovery training to en- sure that crucial data can be restored as quickly as possible.

With regard to infection control measures, we have taken steps to ensure the continued provision of products and services while taking measures to prevent the spread of infection by making adjustments to office attendance rates and introducing a remote work policy in accordance with infection rates of COVID-19 based on the action plan formulated in response to 2009 H1N1 Pandemic.
BCP Response to Supply Chain Risks
Procurement concerns persist due to a range of risk factors, including fire accidents at semiconductor manufacturing companies, natural disasters such as the cold wave that hit the U.S., international conflicts, and energy and environmental concerns, such as CO2 reduction efforts. Under normal circumstances we strive to continually maintain a complete understanding of the state of BCP activities at suppliers, and regularly review the procurement of materials based on such. Additionally, we are currently developing a management system that uses IT to rapidly determine the impact of disasters on suppliers.

Accordingly, financial results for FY3/2018 have been reclassified in accordance with IFRS. Account titles are also presented in accordance with IFRS.
Note: (A) Earnings per share (EPS) attributable to owners of the parent - Diluted is calculated by dividing profit attributable to owners of the parent by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjusting for treasury stock during the corresponding fiscal year period.
For the year ended March 31, 2020 and the year ended March 31, 2021, instead of EPS attributable to owners of the parent - Diluted, EPS attributable to owners of the parent-Basic is described in the above table, as there is no potential share.
(B) "Cash dividends per share" in FY3/2019 includes the 60th anniversary commemoration dividend in the amount of 20 yen per share. (C) Free cash flow = Cash flows from operating activities + cash flows from investing activities
(D) EBITDA = Profit before income taxes + depreciation and amortization + finance expenses
・ No figures have been restated due to changes in accounting standards for the figures from FY3/2011 to FY3/2017 in the above table.
Kyocera Corporation undertook a stock split at the ratio of 2 for 1 of all common shares on October 1, 2013, EPS and cash dividends per share in each fiscal year are retrospectively re-calculated based on the ratio of the stock split.

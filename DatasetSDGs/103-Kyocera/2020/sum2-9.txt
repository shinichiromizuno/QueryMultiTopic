Provide inexpensive renewable energy
Establishment of Kyocera EPA LLC, and Kyocera Kanden Energy LLP
Kyocera EPA LLC has launched services aimed at companies that wish to adopt renewable energy and operators that supply electric power services. With a focus on new, detached residential buildings, Kyocera Kanden Energy LLP has launched services that make it possible to install solar power generating systems with no initial outlay.

Resolving Labor Shortages in Major Industrialized
Countries by Developing Our Cobot Business
According to United Nations estimates, the working-age populations of the major industrialized countries will show a downward trend between 2020 and 2030, so there is an increasing need for an alternative to human labor on production sites.
The Kyocera Group will help to resolve labor shortages by providing solutions that combine collaborative robots (cobots) and AI technologies.

Clay-type Li-ion storage battery cells used in tandem with solar power generating systems
Kyocera plans to stabilize electric power from renewable energy by developing long life, very safe, low-cost storage batteries that are easy to link up and use in tandem with existing solar power generating systems. Private power consumption will also expand when surplus power produced by solar power generating systems and fuel cells is saved to storage batteries.
2019 Revision of World Population Prospects
Residential solar power generating system
The table on the right shows transitions in the working- age populations of the major industrialized countries. It predicts a decrease in the working-age population in Japan, China and Germany between 2020 and 2030, and a decelerating increase in the U.S.A. In these circumstances, there is a growing demand for cobots as a substitute for human labor on high-mix low-volume production sites. However, what causes a bottleneck in robot operations is the need for complex programing (known as teaching) for each type of product targeted, in order to deal with complicated manufacturing situations. Cobots that leverage AI are expected to make it possible to do this teaching accurately and in a short period of time, and to resolve labor shortages.
● Kyocera’s Solution
Kyocera is developing an AI cobot system that utilizes our proprietary AI-leveraging technologies to dramatically reduce the teaching work. Using AI to minimize the programing, and using big data and AI to give robots mastery of their tasks, makes it possible for high-mix low-volume production sites to simply and swiftly utilize cobots.

Leverage self-consignment for the transmission of renewable energy from external sources
When a site cannot be secured for a solar power generating system, renewable energy can be used by the “self-consignment” of electric power from solar power generating systems located elsewhere.
 ■ T  he 2030 energy mix proposal in Japan is based on the assumption that the Net Zero Energy House (ZEH) will be standardized energy-saving houses.

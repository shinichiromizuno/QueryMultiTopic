Creating a World Where People with Food Allergies Can Enjoy Stress-free Meals Without Accidentally
Ingesting Allergens
Project Leader: Minako Tani
I applied for the program because I wanted to create a mechanism for people with food allergies to display and share information about their allergies with those around them so that they can relax and enjoy socializing over meals. It is difficult for people who have foods that they cannot eat to convey that information accurately to those around them without being misunderstood. So I wanted to create a mechanism to make things easier for them, both physically and mentally, so that they can manage their condition in a positive way, and enjoy stress-free meals.
There is no fundamental cure for food allergies at this point in time, and if a personâ€™s allergies do not disappear in adulthood, they must live with them for their entire life. Allergen combinations and symptoms vary from person to person, and they sometimes change as people get older. It seems, therefore, essential that the patient be able to convey accurate information about their condition to the people around them so that they can avoid accidentally ingesting allergens.

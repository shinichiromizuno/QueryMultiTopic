Sharing social issues and reflecting them in our actions (Yahoo! News Sponsored Content)
In order to raise awareness of social issues that are not well known and promote the activities of NPOs and other organizations that work to resolve such issues, we created Yahoo! News Sponsored Content, a branding advertorial that leverages the reliability of the Yahoo! News service.
The sponsored articles include links that lead users to the Yahoo! Internet Fund Raising and Yahoo! Volunteer services. This in turn helps provide opportunities to encourage people interested in social issues to take action in such ways as making donations and participating in volunteer activities.
Addressing issues that impact society as a whole
Yahoo! News Sponsored Content
 In Yahoo! News Feature, in an effort to highlight the issues that have a long-term impact on society as a whole, we use unique perspectives to delve into issues that tend to get buried within the large volume of information available on the Internet. Through Yahoo! News Feature, we will help solve social issues by providing not only information for consumption but also article content that can be used as reference materials and that can be accessible to readers in the long term.

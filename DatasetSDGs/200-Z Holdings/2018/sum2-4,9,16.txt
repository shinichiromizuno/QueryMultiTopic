Secure development of e-commerce
For our YAHUOKU! and Yahoo! Shopping services, we have in place a program that takes action to remove exhibits when notified to do so by the intellectual property rights holder of that particular exhibit. Through this program, not only do we protect users and intellectual property rights holders, we also work to ensure the secure development of e-commerce by addressing the important issue of preventing intellectual property right infringement.
In addition, we are strengthening our management structure and IT systems to prevent improper actions and are pushing forward with multifaceted initiatives to protect intellectual property rights, including raising user awareness and pursuing collaboration with rights holder associations. Going forward, we will continue to actively engage in these activities with the aim of completely eliminating improper access.
Recognizing stores nationwide through Yahoo! Shopping
Announcement of the program
 In our Yahoo! Shopping service, we administer the Area Award, which recognizes outstanding stores that represent regions across Japan from the over 550,000 stores available through this service. We also hold an award ceremony at venues in each region.
By drawing attention to local products and small local stores striving to survive, this award is expected to create a positive ripple effect whereby the number of people who take pride in their local area increases and the outflow of talented individuals from local areas decreases. The Area Award has also created synergistic effects with other initiatives. For example, the award was presented in the past to a store operated by a graduate of the IT Human Resources Development Project, which we promote in collaboration with Cyber
University (SoftBank Groupâ€™s online university), who gained e-commerce know-how through the project.

Tsubaki’s Sustainability The EnvironmentEnvironmental Management
To contribute to the development of a sustainable society, the Tsubaki Group has established an Environmental Philosophy and a Basic Environmental Policy, under which it works to reduce its environmental burden from a medium- to long-term perspective while proactively developing and offering new products that are SDG-oriented.
  Environmental Philosophy
TheTsubaki Group recognizes that environmental conservation is one of the most important issues shared by humankind, and seriously considers the environment in all aspects of its global business activities and contributes to the “development of a sustainable society” by generating environmental value and economic value through manufacturing.

that resource recycling, such as the reduction of waste and the appropriate management of hazardous chemical substances, in addition to coexistence with nature in ways such as greening and water saving, is essential for such a corporation. Accordingly, the Group is tackling these issues.
Against this backdrop, we established an Eco Factory Certification System that sets management indicators and milestones for each of the three themes of climate

We launched activities at domestic business sites in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Based on the results of those initiatives, the Kyotanabe Plant received the Platinum Award, an internal award for plants that have cleared certain environmental criteria, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.

Environmental Accounting
In order to engage efficiently in environmental conservation, we quantify investment and development costs and benefits at domestic business sites using classifications based on the Ministry of the Environment’s guidelines.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we proactively increased our investment in energy-saving facilities and equipment amid an expansion in production. We carried out major investments including in a solar power generation system and rainwater storage tanks at the new
tensioner factory in our Saitama Plant, in addition to upgrading other energy-saving equipment and plant wastewater treatment facilities.
Through this environmental accounting, we will analyze the cost of environmental conservation and the economic and environmental conservation effects gained through those activities. We will utilize the analysis in our activities going forward while endeavoring to disclose information on them.

             Initiatives for Reducing Environmental Impact
Prevention of Global Warming
As climate change progresses, the Tsubaki Group is working to reduce its CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. In Japan, under our environmental long-term targets, we are promoting specific initiatives based on our environmental action plan.
Much of the energy used in the Group’s manufacturing is concentrated in the production process. We are therefore improving energy efficiency by proactively installing energy-saving production equipment while
promoting the application of insulating paint coating for major plants and the conversion from heavy oil in air-conditioning equipment to liquefied natural gas and other fuels that have lower CO2 emissions. Further, when building or renovating plants, we carry out a host of CO2 reduction measures, such as expanding our use of renewable energy by proactively installing solar power generation equipment and adopting LED lighting.

          Contribution to a Recycling-Oriented Society
The Group is advancing initiatives designed to realize a recycling-oriented society with a low environmental impact by creating higher economic value through the reduced use of water and other resources while promoting the reduce, reuse, recycle (“3R”) approach.
Specifically, these initiatives entail 1) reducing our total weight of waste, 2) improving our resource recycling rate, and 3) reducing our water consumption. In particular, we are working to fundamentally reduce the amount of materials we extract from the natural earth’s crust by
using the total weight of waste discharged as a management indicator, including recyclables traded for sale, in addition to reducing waste and improving our resource recycling rate.
Moreover, we are striving to reduce environmental impact and coexist with the natural environment through products and manufacturing in harmony with the environment, such as by reducing hazardous materials and greening our plants.

Recycling Rate (right)Provision of Eco Products (SDG-oriented Products)
  The Tsubaki Group has created many unique products that are environment-friendly, such as those with extended life spans and energy-saving features. In 2011, we established “eco” evaluation criteria with the aim of bolstering product development that helps customers reduce their environmental impact (ecology) and improve their economic performance (economy). We classify products that clear this criteria as eco products. Moreover, from the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, we will add the SDGs as a new angle and expand the development and sale of new eco products from the following two perspectives.
1. Contribution to environmental conservation through reductions of CO2 emissions from a life cycle perspective by improving existing products and developing new products
Highly corrosion-resistant coating chain (RoHS compatible)
2. Indirect contribution to environmental conservation by promoting existing products or new products in global markets for environmental (SDGs) products, such as those offering low-carbon or decarbonization features.

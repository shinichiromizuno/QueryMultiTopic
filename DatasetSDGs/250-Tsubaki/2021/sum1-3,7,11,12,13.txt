 Sustainability Management
E Environmental Management
 In order to contribute to the development of a sustainable society, the Tsubaki Group completely revised its Basic Environmental Policy in March 2021 and is working to reduce its environmental impact from a medium- to long-term perspective while proactively developing and offering new products targeting the eco (SDG) market. In particular, we will address the issue of climate change, which we view as a priority issue of the utmost urgency, by closely monitoring international standards and market and customer trends.
Please refer to our website for details on our environmental management. https://tsubakimoto.com/sustainability/environment/
Environmental Management Structure
Under the supervision of the Board of Directors, the Tsubaki Group Environmental Committee takes the lead in promoting the Group’s environmental management. This committee, which is chaired by the executive officer in charge of the environment for Tsubakimoto Chain and comprises plant managers, general managers of business segments, and representatives of each Group company, addresses the Group’s environmental issues from a medium- to long-term perspective. In addition, overseas business sites appoint environment promoting staff who communicate with the employee in charge of environmental promotion for Tsubakimoto Chain (Group Environmental Secretariat).
Environmental Activity Initiatives
As the climate changes, the Group recognizes that reducing total CO2 emissions is a key social issue. Setting out environmental activity initiatives as priority matters, Mid-Term Management Plan 2025 promotes specific initiatives based on our environmental action plan, which is guided by our medium- to long-term environmental target of reducing total CO2 emissions by 46% by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2031 (with FY2013 as the base year for comparison) in Japan.

  Responding to Climate Change
Climate change-driven events, such as intensifying natural disasters, including temperature rises, concentrated heavy rains, and floods, constitute a major physical risk. In business terms, while the transition to decarbonization poses risks that will have a significant impact on the Group’s business operations, business domains, and product concepts, Tsubaki recognizes that implementing appropriate measures will help strengthen its corporate structure and enhance its competitiveness while presenting opportunities to identify new markets and businesses.
Going forward, we will promote initiatives that position climate change as a priority issue in terms of both risks and opportunities. We will also advance preparations for disclosing information to announce our support for the recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
The TCFD was established by the Financial Stability Board in response to a request from the G20 Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors
 Our Measures in Response to Climate Change Risks and Opportunities
We have broadly divided climate change risks and opportunities into two categories: risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, and risks related to physical changes due to climate change. Our approach to measures in response to these risks and opportunities is as follows.
Transition Risks and Opportunities
In our Companywide management systems and existing business domains, we must operate defensively and offensively in response to both risks and opportunities.
We recognize that carving out new businesses and developing new products that adapt to paradigm shifts, such as decarbonization and the creation of a recycling- oriented society, are key tasks, as is the speed of our response.
Physical Risks
We recognize that it is important for measures in response to climate change to enhance the resilience of our businesses and further strengthen our business foundation, rather than simply to serve as a hedge against risks.

 Sustainability Management
 Environmental ManagementShifting Our Focus from Eco Products to SDG-Oriented Products (Creating Shared Value)
In 2011, we established eco evaluation criteria with the aim of bolstering product development that helps customers reduce their environmental impact (ecology) and improve their economic performance (economy). We have classified products that meet these criteria as Eco Products and pursued product development and sales promotion activities with an eye on co-creating economic value, such as cost benefits for our customers.
In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, we launched Long-Term Vision 2030. In terms of the sustainability issues (environmental, social, and economic) that Tsubaki must tackle as set forth in this long-term vision, the Company will not only strengthen its existing Eco Products but also the development of SDG-oriented products, and marketing activities. Specifically, we will expand our activities with a focus on efforts that will include the provision of:
1. Eco products that contribute to areas related to the
global environment and resources/energy
Initiatives for Expanding SDG-Oriented Products
Creating a people-friendly society
Building a safe and secure infrastructure for living
       Based on the following definition of SDG-oriented products, we will expand the development of and sales activities for new products.
1. Products that directly contribute to environmental
conservation through reductions of CO2 emissions from a lifecycle perspective by improving on existing products and developing new products (Product Development)
2. Products that indirectly contribute to achieving the SDGs by promoting the appeal of existing products or new products in global markets for environmental or otherwise sustainable products, such as those offering low-carbon or decarbonization features (Application Development)
Overview of Activities for Expanding SDG-Oriented Products
2. Equipment that contributes to medicine, healthcare, and aging
3. Products that contribute to building infrastructure, disaster prevention, and urban development.
At the same time, we have also initiated a new system for activities aimed at expanding the sales of SDG-oriented products

To help resolve water environmental issues around the world, we deliver equipment and plants meeting the needs of each country. With the domestic water supply and sewage system market focused on renovation projects, we believe expanding overseas is essential to the growth of our Water Environmental Business. Alongside economic growth, demand for water infrastructures is growing in the major cities of China and Southeast Asia. As a specialist in sludge treatment, we have seen growing demand for our services due to the need to treat sewage sludge—previously disposed of by landfill— generated as a result of increasing access to and use of sewage treatment.
We have delivered more than 20 sludge dryers to the China market, and we are the only Japanese firm with a track record in dryers and incinerators in this market. Our operations in China are conducted through a joint venture (JV) with local Chinese firms, and we are also the only Japanese firm in China with experience as a lead JV partner in this field. In April 2019, with business in China growing, we established a joint venture with a local firm to establish a maintenance structure, and we now operate both sales and maintenance structures in China. We also have experience of construction in Vietnam,
where demand is growing for sewage treatment with expanding adoption of water supply systems, and we have constructed several wastewater treatment plants in this market. We
have also delivered machinery and equipment used at water purification plants in Bangladesh, another area associated with growing adoption of water supply systems.
To improve water environments worldwide, Tsukishima Kikai will continue to provide equipment and plants suited to the needs of each country.

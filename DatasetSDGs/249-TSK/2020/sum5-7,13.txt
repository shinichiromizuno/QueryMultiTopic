Lithium ion secondary batteries are used to power EVs and other eco-friendly vehicles and to store renewable energy.
We deliver equipment used to manufacture cathode active materials, which impact on the performance of lithium ion secondary batteries, as well as anode materials and electrolytes in Japan and overseas. Our cathode material manufacturing equipment employs our core crystallization, filtration, drying, weighing, and mixing technologies developed since our founding. We have a track record in a wide range of production areas from precursors through active materials. We are also capable of handling integrated engineering including wastewater treatment equipment.

Asia has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, with certain areas undergoing rapid industrialization. Cases involving transplanting (i.e., installing overseas production functions already present in Japan) by Japanese firms, in which we help domestic customers advance overseas, are increasing.
Our overseas affiliates are primarily responsible for sales activities in their local markets, and the Thai affiliate TSK Engineering (Thailand) Co., Ltd. has both sales and engineering functions, with total staffing of around 80 people. This subsidiary handles the entire series of engineering operations, from sales to design and construction.
Through these initiatives, we intend to contribute to social progress and an improved standard of living in Asia.

Active in the waste treatment business, SUN ECO THERMAL Co., Ltd. contributes to renewable energy generation through the installation of a solar power generation facility (750 kW) as part of environmental improvements for unused land at its site.

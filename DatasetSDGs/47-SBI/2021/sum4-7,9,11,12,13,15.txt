Propagation of Renewable
Energy and Regional Development
As power generation from renewable energy sources increases world- wide, the effective implementation of regional resources such as solar, wind, geothermal, small-scale hydropower, and biomass is attracting interest in Japan as a crucial presence for future regional economies. In addition to solar power, SBI Energy is developing solar sharing op- erations (farming-type solar power generation) that generates solar power on farmland while agricultural activities continue, as well as small-scale hydropower and biomass power generation. Through power generation business operations like these, we are engaging in regional economic revitalization by promoting the use of local resourc- es and natural energy. This helps increase energy self-sufficiency rates, contributing to regional sustainability through local production for local consumption.

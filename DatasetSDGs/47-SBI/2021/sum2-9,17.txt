Contributing to the Fostering of New
Industries and Technological Innovation
One of the SBI Group’s corporate missions is to become a “New In- dustry Creator,” therefore we are engaged in the investment business to achieve this mission. Since the Group was founded, we have made focused investments in growth sectors that will become next genera- tion core industries, such as IT, biotechnology, environment, energy, fintech, AI, and blockchain. In particular, we have set up funds in the IT sector, where technological advancements are rapid, that target key investment sectors in response to changes in the times and technolo- gy. In 2000, we established a venture capital fund that was the largest in Japan at the time (¥150.5 billion in total), contributing to the devel- opment of many domestic Internet-related companies. Since then, we have continued to invest in and support companies involved in busi- nesses such as communications infrastructure, mobile communica- tions, smartphones, fintech, AI, and blockchain. This culminated in April 2021 with the launch of the SBI 4+5 Fund, one of Japan’s largest venture capital funds with a total commitment of ¥100 billion.
In this way, we are actively assisting companies that will shape the society of the future and contribute to the fostering of new industries
and technological innovations. ( page 17)

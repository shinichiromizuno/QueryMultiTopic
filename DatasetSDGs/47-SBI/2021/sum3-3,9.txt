Needs of People through Biotechnology,
Healthcare & Medical Informatic Business
The SBI Group established its presence in the biotechnology sector in 2003 by investing in and supporting companies in this sector and has since established multiple funds to invest in and nurture promising startup companies and has supported other companies in the fields of life science, healthcare, and biotechnology. We will continue to active- ly invest in these fields, as interest is further heightened, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 In addition, the SBI Group has been engaged in the Biotechnology, Healthcare & Medical Informatics Business, through which we are helping to improve peopleâ€™s health and beauty primarily through the development and marketing of pharmaceuticals, health foods, and cosmetics using 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA).

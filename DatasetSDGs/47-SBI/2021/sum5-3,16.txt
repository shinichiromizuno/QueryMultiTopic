Supporting Abused or Neglected Children
The SBI Group has been actively engaged in direct social contribu- tions to return to society some of the profits earned through its busi- nesses. In 2010, the SBI Children’s Hope Foundation was autho- rized by the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan as a Public Interest Incorporated Foundation. The Foundation undertakes activities to support abused or neglected children to become self-reliant, and to improve their welfare. Its wide range of activities include the donation of funds to improve conditions at facilities that care for abused or neglected children, and the provision of practical training programs for care providers at the facilities. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the cumulative donations amounted to approximately ¥1,080 million. The Foundation also supports the Orange Ribbon Campaign for prevention of child abuse, and officers and employees of the SBI Group are engaged in public awareness campaigns.

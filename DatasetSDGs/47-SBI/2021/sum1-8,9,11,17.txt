Contributing to Regional
Economies through Solving
the Challenges Facing
Regional Financial Institutions
The business climate confronting regional financial institutions is ex- pected to remain challenging, so the SBI Group has built close work- ing relationships with Japan’s regional financial institutions over the past four years. We will support these regional financial institutions through regional revitalization projects that give back to local commu- nities by promoting initiatives seeking to further strengthen the profit- ability of regional financial institutions going forward. If the asset man- agement capabilities and product development capabilities of regional financial institutions improve because of the utilization of the SBI Group’s wide-ranging operational resources, these institutions will be able to contribute to the steady accumulation of assets by local resi- dents. If this in turn stimulates consumption and investment by local residents, it will lead to a revitalization of the regional economies. In this way, through its support for regional financial institutions, the SBI Group will contribute to the creation of a virtuous cycle that will con- tribute to regional revitalization.

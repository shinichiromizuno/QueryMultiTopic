Initiatives to Alleviate Poverty and Solving Environmental Problems in Emerging Countries
The SBISL Telematics Loan Fund, operated by SBI Social Lend- ing, uses a social lending mechanism to lend money for use of business funds to companies in the Philippines that sell three- wheeled taxis equipped with the Mobility Cloud Connecting System (MCCS) on an installment basis. Installation of the MCCS, a device developed by Global Mobility Service, makes it possible to remotely control vehicle engines and acquire vehicle position information.
As a general rule, a lack of credit information agencies and other factors in emerging countries limit access to installment loans and other financial services. Meanwhile, the MCCS is expected to lead to increases in customers eligible for installment loans and the number of people working as drivers. Also, in the Philippines, where environmental pollution is a serious social prob- lem, this business will promote purchasing of low-exhaust vehicles to replace older vehicles. In this way, this is a socially beneficial ini- tiative that improves the standard of living of Filipinos and contrib- utes to environmental conservation.

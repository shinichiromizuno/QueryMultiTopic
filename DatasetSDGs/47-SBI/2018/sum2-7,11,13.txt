The Spread of Renewable Energy and Regional Development
As electric power generation using renewable energy sources increases worldwide, in Japan, in addition to solar and wind power, the introduction of energy generated by effectively utilizing local resources such as geothermal heat, small-scale hydropower, and biomass is attracting attention as an important means of sup- porting the local economies of tomorrow. Currently, SBI ENERGY engages in solar power generation and is developing solar sharing (agricultural solar power generation, a system for operating a solar power generation business while continuing to farm the land), small-scale hydropower and small-scale wind power generation. Through such power generation projects, SBI ENERGY promotes the utilization of local resources and natural energy, contributes to the creation of sustainable communities by increasing energy self-sufficiency and encouraging local production for local con- sumption, and helps invigorate local economies.

Supporting Abused or Neglected Children
The SBI Group has been actively engaged in direct social contri- butions, in order to return the profits it earns through its busi- nesses to society. In 2010, the SBI Children’s Hope Foundation was authorized by the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan as a public interest incorporated foundation. The Foundation under- takes activities to support abused or neglected children to become self-reliant, and to improve their welfare. Its wide range of activities include the donation of funds to improve conditions at facilities that care for abused or
neglected children, and the provi-
sion of practical training programs
for care providers at the facilities.
As of the fiscal year ended March
31, 2018, the cumulative donations
amounted to approximately ¥1,010
million. The Foundation also sup-
ports the Orange Ribbon Campaign
for prevention of child abuse, and
officers and employees of the SBI
Group are engaged in public aware-
ness campaigns.

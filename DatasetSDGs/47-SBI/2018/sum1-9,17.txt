Contributing to Society through Businesses Activities
Contributing to the Fostering of New Industries and Technological Innovation
One of the SBI Group’s corporate missions is to become a “New Industry Creator,” and we engage in investment business to achieve this mission. Ever since the Group was founded, we have made focused investments in growth sectors that will become next-generation core industries: IT, biotechnology, envi- ronment and energy, and FinTech. In particular, in the IT sector, where technological progress is rapid, we have set up funds that have targeted key investment sectors in response to changes in the times and technology. We started in the 1990s with investments in the U.S. Internet-related companies, and in 2000 we set up a venture capital fund that was the largest in Japan at the time (¥150.5 billion in total commitment amount), contributing to the development of many domestic Internet-re- lated companies. Since then, we have continued to invest in and support companies involved in businesses such as commu- nications infrastructure, mobile communications, smartphones and FinTech.
On the other hand, we entered the biotechnology sector in 2003, investing in a drug discovery startup company and engag- ing in support activities. We have since set up multiple funds and provided assistance to biotechnology companies as well as life science and healthcare-related companies. In this way, we actively assist companies that will shape the society of the future and contribute to the fostering of new industries and technologi- cal innovation.

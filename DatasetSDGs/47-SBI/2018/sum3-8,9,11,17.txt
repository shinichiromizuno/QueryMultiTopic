Contributing to Regional Economies through Solving the Challenges Facing Regional Financial Institutions
Uncertainty in the business environment surrounding regional financial institutions is expected to continue. This includes the negative interest rate policy, the emergence of new financial ser- vices as a result of technological innovation, and the arrival of an aging society. Accordingly, the SBI Group is utilizing the FinTech technologies and expertise we possess as a comprehensive financial group to support regional financial institutions and implement regional revitalization projects. If the asset manage- ment capabilities and product development capabilities of regional financial institutions improve as a result of utilization of the SBI Groupâ€™s wide-ranging operational resources, these insti- tutions will be able to contribute to steady asset formation by local residents. If this in turn stimulates consumption and invest- ment by local residents, it will lead to revitalization of regional economies. In this way, through support for regional financial institutions, the SBI Group will contribute to the creation of a vir- tuous cycle that contributes to regional revitalization.

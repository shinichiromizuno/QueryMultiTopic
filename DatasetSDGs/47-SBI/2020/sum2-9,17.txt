Contributing to the Fostering of New Industries and Technological Innovation
One of the SBI Group’s corporate missions is to become a “New Industry Creator,” therefore we are engaged in the investment busi- ness to achieve this mission. Ever since the Group was founded, we have made focused investments in growth sectors that will become the next-generation core industries, such as IT, biotechnology, envi- ronment and energy, fintech, AI and blockchain. In particular, in the IT sector, where technological advancements are rapid, we have set up funds that target key investment sectors in response to changes in the times and technology. We started in the 1990s with invest- ments in U.S. Internet-related companies, and in 2000 we set up a venture capital fund that was the largest in Japan at the time (¥150.5 billion in total commitment amount), contributing to the development of many domestic Internet-related companies. Since then, we have continued to invest in and support companies involved in businesses such as communications infrastructure, mobile communications, smartphones, fintech, AI and blockchain. On the other hand, we entered the biotechnology sector in 2003, investing in a drug discov- ery startup company, as well as engaging in support activities, and have since set up multiple funds that support companies involved in the life science, healthcare and biotechnology fields.
In this way, we are actively assisting companies that will shape the society of the future, and contribute to the fostering of new indus- tries and technological innovations.

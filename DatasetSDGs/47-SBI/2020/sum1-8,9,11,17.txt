Facing Regional Financial Institutions
Regional financial institutions are expected to continue facing chal- lenging circumstances in the business environment, owing to the prolongation of a negative interest rate policy, the emergence of new financial services as a result of technological innovation, and the acceleration of a declining population owing to demographic aging. The SBI Group has established close relationships with regional financial institutions over the past three years, and will further advance the co-creation of value with these institutions moving for- ward. In addition to shared use of various systems and ATMs, pro- jects that support regional financial institutions in order to contribute to regional revitalization, including backing for nationwide implemen- tation of business operations through the use of fintech, and the pursuit of other efforts that strengthen the earning capacity of regional financial institutions will be implemented. If the asset man- agement capabilities and product development capabilities of regional financial institutions improve as a result of the utilization of the SBI Groupâ€™s wide-ranging operational resources, these institu- tions will be able to contribute to a steady asset formation by local residents. If this in turn stimulates consumption and investment by local residents, it will lead to a revitalization of the regional econo- mies. In this way, through its support for regional financial institu- tions, the SBI Group will contribute to the creation of a virtuous cycle that will contribute to regional revitalization.

Solving Poverty
in Emerging Countries
SBI Social Lending uses crowdfunding to help solve poverty in emerging nations. For instance, through the SBISL Cambodia Micro- finance Loan Fund operated by SBI Social Lending, financing is made available to businesses that provide small loans and other microfinance services to the poor and low-income segments of the population in Cambodia. Many of Cambodia's poor earn income through occupations such as farming, raising livestock or selling pro- duce. Even when they want to obtain financing to expand their busi- nesses, they are unable to access the financial services of banks or insurance companies, so we are assisting people like this to boost their income by providing them with small-sum financial services.
In addition, the SBISL Cambodia Mobility Loan Fund imple- ments financing for IoT-enabled automotive sales business opera- tions of the borrower, and its Cambodian subsidiary. By installing an IoT terminal in the vehicle, it becomes possible to manage engine operations through remote control, which is an effective deterrent that leads to reduced loan recovery risk. Demand for used vehicles is rapidly expanding in Cambodia, in line with its economic growth, but the distribution of improperly maintained vehicles has been a cause of traffic accidents. In order to solve this issue, the borrower and its Cambodian subsidiary are contributing to the development of a healthy mobility market for Cambodia, by promoting the expansion of high-quality vehicle inspections and maintenance.

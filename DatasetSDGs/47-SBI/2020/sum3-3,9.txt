Helping to Meet Medical and Healthcare Needs through the Biotechnology-related Business
Since worldwide interest in medicine and healthcare has grown, the SBI Group established its presence in the biotechnology sector in 2003 by investing in and supporting companies in this sector, and have since established multiple funds to invest in and nurture prom- ising startup companies that will meet the needs of the life science, healthcare and biotechnology fields. We will continue to actively invest in this field, as interest is further heightened, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SBI Group is also involved in bio-related business operations. In addition to having supported the creation of pioneering medical and pharmaceutical products at the forefront of biotechnology, we con- tribute to people's health and beauty through the development and sale of medical, health and cosmetic products containing 5-Aminole- vulinic Acid (5-ALA).

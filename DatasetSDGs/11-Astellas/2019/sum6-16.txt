Ethics & Compliance
Astellas believes that acting in accordance with the highest ethical standards, which includes following the letter and spirit of the law, is the cornerstone of all our activities. Based on this belief, the Astellas Charter of Corporate Conduct, which is shared globally, expresses the Company’s ethical business philosophy in terms of corporate behavior. In addition, the Astellas Group Code of Conduct is a global code for everyone who works for Astellas in any location around the world and in any capacity whatsoever as a director, officer, employee, temporary worker, or otherwise, whether full- time or part-time, establishing that they are expected to perform their duties ethically and in compliance with laws and regulations. Also, we seek to ensure that third parties acting on behalf of Astellas comply with all relevant standards described in the Code. To demonstrate this commitment, Astellas employees are evaluated annually, in part, on ethical and compliant behavior.
Astellas promotes compliance and maintains the highest ethical standards through the development, implementation and continuous enhancement of its policies, processes, and global compliance structures and thereby maintains the trust of patients and other stakeholders and enhances enterprise value.

Structured to Promote Ethics and Compliance
Astellas has been continuously enhancing the organizational structure for the Ethics & Compliance function. In fiscal 2018, Astellas created a new compliance investigations team, which will be dedicated to conducting internal compliance investigations across the globe in fiscal 2019. The new global operating model accompanying this change will allow Astellas to more fully centralize internal compliance investigations, enhance the focus on consistent root cause analysis globally, and apply a more consistent global standard while still being respectful of local cultural and legal differences.
The group operations team in the Ethics & Compliance function continues to drive consistency on a global basis for activities that are core to the Ethics & Compliance program, such as training, communications, risk assessments, monitoring, compliance policies/processes and investigation processes.
Our Ethics & Compliance professionals continue to partner with the business to reinforce the importance of integrating integrity, ethics and compliance into business processes as doing so is critical to the sustainable success of Astellas.

Compliance Training and Communications
Compliance training and communications targeted at the business are important to conducting business activities grounded on high ethical standards and integrity. Astellas regularly educates employees on both existing and emerging compliance risks as well as policies and processes that help us manage those risks. In fiscal 2018, the Ethics & Compliance function deployed multiple online and live training programs to foster compliance awareness and understanding among employees. These training programs included updated anti-bribery/anti-corruption compliance training for employees in high-risk functions, new ethical decision-making training for senior leaders and updated Code of Conduct training. In addition, all of the global Ethics & Compliance training programs deployed in fiscal 2018 included a survey to determine training effectiveness. The results of these surveys will assist Astellas in ensuring training programs are meeting the needs of employees and in turn, update the training to make it even more effective.
Astellas’ Integrity in Action program reinforces the importance of taking responsibility, acting ethically and leading by example. As part of Astellas’ ongoing commitment to this program, our training and communication materials continue to embed the Astellas Way values and a patient-focused mindset, so employees can see how policies and procedures help them live the Astellas mission.
All employees, including new employees, are required to complete compliance training on topics such as the Astellas Group Code of Conduct, data privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance, and conflicts of interest.

Continually Enhancing and Sustaining an Ethical and Compliant Culture at Astellas
Astellas leaders and managers are critical to the effective promotion and protection of the Astellas core values of integrity, ethics and compliance within their teams. In fiscal 2018, Ethics & Compliance function deployed workshops to leaders and managers dedicated to providing insight into key ethical concepts that impact decision-making and the practical tools leaders and managers can use, as well as help their teams use, to support ethical decision-making. Employees who participated received four months of follow-up ethics-related materials to reinforce the concepts learned in the workshop.

 The ability to effectively assess compliance risk at local, regional and global levels is a foundational element of Astellas’ compliance program. These assessments enable Astellas to more quickly identify and better respond to existing and emerging compliance risks.
The internal activities assessed in compliance risk assessments (“CRAs”) continue to include transfers of value in any form to healthcare professionals, market access activities, interactions between the Company and government officials or healthcare professionals, and meals, gifts, or hospitality.
In fiscal 2018, Astellas continued to conduct CRAs based on a globally consistent process, in a number of countries around the globe. The CRAs involved both the assessment of external environmental risk in each of the countries as well as assessment of internal risks within the affiliate arising from business operations. The results are discussed with the local management team to develop a Risk Mitigation Plan, which is then tracked until closure. The findings of the CRAs continue to help Astellas enhance compliance programs in each country, and monitor trends in risks at the regional and global levels. The Ethics & Compliance function works closely with the business throughout the assessment process and helps develop and support any risk mitigation plans developed to address the identified risks.

Compliance Monitoring
Compliance monitoring is a key component of any compliance program. Astellas monitors existing and emerging compliance risks and trends across a variety of activities. Doing so allows us to better anticipate potential issues before they become actual problems for the Company. In fiscal 2018, Astellas continued to enhance its monitoring program and activities in each region. Compliance monitoring yielded results that not only informed our compliance program, but also provided management with insights to inform their decision-making on various process improvements. One of the many positive outcomes of our ongoing enhancements to the monitoring program this year was the creation of monitoring tools that enable Ethics & Compliance to provide visualizations of monitoring results on demand.
Close
Conflicts of Interest
Another core element of an effective ethics and compliance program is how a company approaches its own conflicts of interest. That is because the foundation of an effective and robust ethics and compliance program is based on how a company manages its own internal behavior.
Conflicts of interest refer to situations where outside activities or other personal interests impair an employee’s objectivity or judgment when performing their duties. Conflicts of interest also encompass situations where there is a potential conflict between the interests of an employee and Astellas. The Astellas Global Conflict of Interest Policy and accompanying training reinforces for our employees that they are expected to conduct their business activities with ethics and integrity even when no one is observing or there are no potential legal violations. Astellas believes that maintaining this baseline expectation regarding internal conflicts of interest contributes to our employees conducting their business with ethics and integrity when engaging with stakeholders outside the Company and where legal risks are involved. Engagement in the disclosure process and global training efforts continue to enhance the ability of internal stakeholders to identify potential conflicts, resulting in increased business ownership of compliance.

Helpline for Employees and Encouraging a Speak-Up Culture
In fiscal 2018, Astellas continued to have helplines available globally so employees can report and receive advice on how to react in the event they discover actual or suspected misconduct. Reports may be made by employees or third parties and may be made anonymously where permitted by local law.
In some countries including Japan, Astellas continues to have internal helplines in addition to the global external helpline.
Astellas continues to foster an environment that encourages employees to use the helplines and speak up to report potential or actual violations of the Astellas Group Code of Conduct, as well as any other illegal or unethical behavior or business practices. In addition, Astellas strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises a concern or reports a suspected compliance violation in good faith even if the concern or report is not substantiated after investigation. Astellas regularly reinforces the importance of speaking up and the responsibility that employees have in reporting concerns through Astellas’ global SpeakUp campaign which includes posters, communications, presentations,
etc. supported by a visual theme.
Having the ability to centrally manage the reports of suspected non-compliance and the corresponding investigations also enhances Astellas’ ability to analyze compliance trends globally. In fiscal 2018, Astellas’ helplines continued to receive reports in each region. Matters raised included potential harassment and promotional code violations. In response, thorough investigations were conducted and appropriate action was taken. Compliance helpline statistics are analyzed and reported to the Regional and Global Compliance Committees on a regular basis.

Anti-Bribery Anti-Corruption Compliance
Astellas strictly prohibits bribery and corruption in any aspect of its business, consistent with the organization’s commitment to conducting its business with ethics and integrity. One critically important compliance priority is to manage bribery and corruption risk arising from the engagement of third parties that provide services on our behalf.
Astellas must contract with third parties across the globe to conduct its business but recognizes that these relationships can raise bribery and corruption risk, particularly if the third party engages with healthcare professionals or government officials on our behalf.
A core principle of our anti-bribery/anti-corruption compliance program is to ensure that the Company does not allow third parties to engage in activities that we prohibit for our own employees. To adhere to this principle and mitigate and manage this risk arising from third parties providing services on our behalf, Astellas has a process in place to conduct bribery and corruption compliance due diligence assessments on third parties interacting with healthcare professionals or government officials on our behalf.
From this assessment, Astellas can determine the level of bribery and corruption risk it will be taking on by contracting with the third party and take appropriate measures to manage this risk. Such measures include requiring the third party to implement its own bribery and corruption compliance policy and program, train its employees on bribery and corruption compliance, and allow Astellas to oversee the third party’s bribery and corruption compliance program.

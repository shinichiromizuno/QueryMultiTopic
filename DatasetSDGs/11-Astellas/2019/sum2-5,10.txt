Diversity Management
Astellas is working to promote diversity so that diverse individuals can play a role, irrespective of race, nationality, gender, or age. Respecting the diverse values of our employees and reflecting their various perspectives in our business activities not only heightens creativity in our organization but also helps to attract and retain talented people as employees and enhances our competitiveness.
Based on this recognition, Astellas implements measures led by its personnel functions in each region to promote diversity in line with the current situation in the region. For Astellas, promoting the career advancement of women in Japan is a high priority, particularly because the country has a low ratio of women in management positions compared to other regions, and the Company aims to develop a work environment and foster awareness among employees so that life events do not hinder career advancement.
In the year ended March 2019, Astellas acquired the Kurumin Mark as a company supporting employee child-raising from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next- Generation Children.

Ethics & Compliance
Astellas believes that acting in accordance with the highest ethical standards, which includes following the letter and spirit of the law, is the cornerstone of all our activities.
Based on this belief, the Astellas Charter of Corporate Conduct, which is shared globally, expresses the Company’s ethical business philosophy in terms of corporate behavior. In addition, the Astellas Group Code of Conduct is a global code for everyone who works for Astellas in any location around the world and in any capacity whatsoever as a director, officer, employee, temporary worker, or otherwise, whether full-time or part-time, establishing that they are expected to perform their duties ethically and in compliance with laws and regulations. Also, we seek to ensure that third parties acting on behalf of Astellas comply with all relevant standards described in the Code.
To demonstrate this commitment, Astellas employees are evaluated annually, in part, on ethical and compliant behavior.
Astellas promotes compliance and maintains the highest ethical standards through the development, implementation and continuous enhancement of its policies, processes, and global compliance structures and thereby maintains the trust of patients and other stakeholders and enhances enterprise value.

Structured to Promote Ethics and Compliance
Astellas has been continuously enhancing the organizational structure for the Ethics & Compliance function. The global Ethics & Compliance operating model allows Astellas to continue to advance and apply a more consistent global standard while still being respectful of local cultural and legal differences.
The Compliance Excellence and Transformation team in the Ethics & Compliance function continues to drive consistency on a global basis for activities that are core to the Ethics & Compliance program, such as training, communications, risk assessments, monitoring, compliance policies/processes, transparency with respect to pharmaceutical company relationships with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, and investigation processes.
Our Ethics & Compliance professionals continue to partner with the business to reinforce the importance of integrating integrity, ethics and compliance into business processes as doing so is critical to the sustainable success of Astellas.

Compliance Training and Communications
Compliance training and communications targeted at the business are important to conducting business activities grounded on high ethical standards and integrity. Astellas regularly educates employees on both existing and emerging compliance risks as well as policies and processes that help us manage those risks.
The Ethics & Compliance function deploys multiple online and live training programs to continue to foster compliance awareness and understanding among employees. All employees, including new employees, are required to complete compliance training on topics such as the Astellas Group Code of Conduct, data privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance, and conflicts of interest. In addition, global Ethics & Compliance training programs include a survey to determine training effectiveness. The results of these surveys assist Astellas in ensuring training programs are meeting the needs of employees and in turn, update the training to make it even more effective.
Astellas’ Integrity in Action program reinforces the importance of taking responsibility, acting ethically and leading by example. As part of Astellas’ ongoing commitment to this program, our training and communication materials continue to embed the Astellas Way values and a patient-focused mindset, so employees can see how policies and procedures help them live the Astellas mission.



 The ability to effectively assess compliance risk at local, regional and global levels is a foundational element of Astellas’ compliance program. These assessments enable Astellas to more quickly identify and better respond to existing and emerging compliance risks.
The internal activities assessed in compliance risk assessments (“CRAs”) continue to include transfers of value in any form to healthcare professionals, market access activities, interactions between the Company and government officials or healthcare professionals, and meals, gifts, or hospitality.
Astellas continues to conduct CRAs based on a globally consistent process, in a number of countries around the globe. The CRAs involve both the assessment of external environmental risk in each of the countries as well as assessment of internal risks within the affiliate arising from business operations. The results are discussed with the local management team to develop a Risk Mitigation Plan, which is then tracked until closure. The findings of the CRAs continue to help Astellas enhance compliance programs in each country and monitor trends in risks at the regional and global levels. The Ethics & Compliance function works closely with the business throughout the assessment process and helps develop and support any risk mitigation plans developed to address the identified risks.

Compliance Monitoring
Compliance monitoring is a key component of any compliance program. Astellas monitors existing and emerging compliance risks and trends across a variety of activities. Doing so allows us to better anticipate potential issues before they become actual problems for the Company.
Astellas continues to enhance its monitoring program and activities in each region. Compliance monitoring yields results that not only informs our compliance program, but also provides management with insights to inform their decision- making on various process improvements. We continuously evaluate and improve our monitoring program to ensure that we provide the best tools for monitoring and the most useful information to our stakeholders.
Close
Conflicts of Interest
Another core element of an effective ethics and compliance program is how a company approaches its own conflicts of interest. That is because the foundation of an effective and robust ethics and compliance program is based on how a company manages its own internal behavior.
Conflicts of interest refer to situations where outside activities or other personal interests impair an employee’s objectivity or judgment when performing their duties. Conflicts of interest also encompass situations where there is a potential conflict between the interests of an employee and Astellas. The Astellas Global Conflict of Interest Policy and accompanying training reinforces for our employees that they are expected to conduct their business activities with ethics and integrity even when no one is observing or there are no potential legal violations. Astellas believes that maintaining this baseline expectation regarding internal conflicts of interest contributes to our employees conducting their business with ethics and integrity when engaging with stakeholders outside the Company and where legal risks are involved. Engagement in the disclosure process and global training efforts continue to enhance the ability of internal stakeholders to identify potential conflicts, resulting in increased business ownership of compliance.

  Astellas believes that the medical and scientific exchange between manufacturers and health care providers is essential to our provision of highly effective pharmaceuticals and contributes to improving the health of patients around the world. Advancing the field of science is rooted in supporting high-quality, independent medical education and global initiatives designed to improve the quality of medical care. To achieve this Astellas requires input and expertise from those such as healthcare professionals, patient organizations, academics, and healthcare organizations to drive medical innovation, focus on unmet needs, and educate providers and patients on therapeutic treatments.
An increasing number of countries and government organizations require transparency with respect to pharmaceutical company relationships with healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations. Astellas engages in appropriate relationships with healthcare professionals and organizations throughout the world. The disclosure of relevant financial relationships with healthcare professionals and organizations reflects our commitment to corporate accountability to both internal and external stakeholders. Astellas is committed to fulfilling its transparency requirements through the work of its global transparency team in coordination and collaboration with multiple business functions throughout the organization and across the globe.

  Helpline for Employees and Encouraging a Speak-Up Culture
Astellas continues to have helplines available globally so employees can report and receive advice on how to react in the event they discover actual or suspected misconduct. Reports may be made by employees or third parties and may be made anonymously where permitted by local law.
Astellas continues to foster an environment that encourages employees to use the helplines and speak up to report potential or actual violations of the Astellas Group Code of Conduct, as well as any other illegal or unethical behavior or business practices. In addition, Astellas strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises a concern or reports a suspected compliance violation in good faith even if the concern or report is not substantiated after investigation. Astellas regularly reinforces the importance of speaking up and the responsibility that employees have in reporting concerns through Astellas’ global Speak Up campaign which includes posters, communications, and
presentations supported by a visual theme.
Having the ability to centrally manage the reports of suspected non-compliance and the corresponding investigations also enhances Astellas’ ability to analyze compliance trends globally. Compliance helpline statistics are analyzed and reported to the Regional and Global Compliance Committees on a regular basis.

Annual Report 2020
Astellas Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Program
Astellas takes a strong stance against corruption. Astellas strictly prohibits bribery and corruption in any aspect of its business and is committed to complying with all applicable laws, including anti-corruption laws, consistent with its commitment to conducting its business with ethics and integrity.
This is a core commitment of Astellas embodied in the Astellas Group Code of Conduct and the Astellas Group Policy on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Compliance. In addition, Astellas is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, including its 10th Principle Against Corruption, and the Tokyo Principles for Strengthening Anti-Corruption Practices.
Astellas’ Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer has overall responsibility for overseeing and implementing Astellas’ global compliance program, including its anti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABAC) program, with the assistance of the Global Compliance Committee. The Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, in turn, has designated Ethics and Compliance professionals with global and regional responsibilities for Astellas’ ABAC program.
Astellas’ ABAC program is designed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with Astellas’ commitment against corruption. The program consists of ABAC policies and procedures, trainings and communications, risk assessments, monitoring and auditing, reporting and investigation activities.
Astellas has ABAC policies and procedures that embody its commitment against corruption. These policies and procedures are consistent with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other applicable local anti- bribery and corruption laws and regulation. Astellas prohibits all forms of bribery and corruption, including facilitation payments.
Astellas requires all employees to complete annual ABAC training. This training is available in 22 languages. Astellas additionally provides specialized ABAC training to target audiences based on their functions or roles in the company, as well as where we have identified risks and needs.
As described above, Astellas conducts compliance risk assessments and compliance monitoring, including on aspects of its ABAC compliance program. Astellas Ethics & Compliance also works closely with the Astellas Legal Department to investigate potential incidents of ABAC non-compliance and with the Astellas Internal Audit Department on the audit of Astellas affiliates and third parties covering activities that may involve ABAC risks. Astellas continuously seeks to improve its ABAC program based on these activities to assure the program remains effective and up-to-date in addressing changing risk.
Astellas has established an internal control environment designed to comply with J-SOX regulatory requirements to ensure financial reporting integrity as well as fraud prevention and detection. Its financial controls provide complementary assurance of compliance with its anti-corruption commitment.
A core principle of our ABAC compliance program is to prohibit third parties from engaging in activities that we prohibit for our own employees. This principle is embodied in the Astellas Group Policy on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Compliance and the Astellas Business Partner Code of Conduct. To adhere to this principle and mitigate and manage the risk arising from third parties providing services on our behalf, Astellas has established a process to conduct bribery and corruption compliance due diligence assessments on third parties interacting with healthcare professionals or
   110

government officials on our behalf. In addition, Astellas periodically exercises audit rights over third parties, and has risk- based ABAC clauses for contractual arrangements with third parties.© Astellas Pharma Inc.

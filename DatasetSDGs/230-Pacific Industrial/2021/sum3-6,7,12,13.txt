          CO2 Emission Reduction Topics
TOPICS
  Conversion of boiler fuel from heavy oil to city gas
At our Higashi Ogaki Plant, we replaced the steam boiler with a small, once-through high-efficiency boiler, making it possible to switch the fuel from heavy oil to city gas, which emits less CO2. The annual reduction in CO2 emissions will be approximately 680 tons.
Small once-through boiler installed at the Higashi Ogaki Plant
  Converting to extra high-voltage power
The Higashi Ogaki Plant originally received high-voltage power from an electric power company as well as produced its own electricity from an internal diesel-powered generator system. The introduction of special high-voltage power feeding system allowed us to shut down our conventional power generation system on a planned basis and cut fuel (heavy oil) consumption, enabling us to reduce CO2 emissions. The annual reduction in CO2 emissions will be approximately 1,000 tons.
 Energy saving by downsizing cationic electrodeposition coating (E-Coat) equipment
At our Nishi Ogaki Plant, by implementing improvements such as making coating hangers more universally adaptable, we were able to consolidate the production volume of two E-Coat lines for our stamping products into one and stop using one coating line entirely. We also deployed a fully integrated E-Coat line for small parts that incorporates processes from assembly up to and including final coating, reducing energy consumption and improving productivity. The annual reduction in CO2 emissions will be approximately 320 tons.

    Introduction of renewable energy
SASB
TR-AP-130a.1
To increase the proportion of renewable energy in our electricity consumption, we have introduced solar power generation at six plants in Japan and at one plant overseas. In FY2021, we are installing solar power generation systems at our Kurihara Plant in the Tohoku region in Japan and at PVT in Taiwan, and we expect to increase the ratio of renewable-to-total energy consumption from 1.2% in FY2020 to 1.6%. In addition, going forward we will actively promote the introduction of renewable energy and increase the ratio of renewable energy.

Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change
We recognize that climate change is one of the most important issues facing society, and we have declared that we will be carbon neutral by 2050, reduce CO2 emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to FY2019, Scope 1 or 2), and are implementing group-wide initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions. We also endorsed the TCFD in May 2021, and are working strategically to understand the
risks and opportunities of climate change. In this report, we have organized our efforts to address
climate change in line with the TCFD final recommendations.
     Main “risks and opportunities”
 Strategy
 Indicators and Targets
  Transition risks
  · Carbon pricing
· Requests from customers to reduce CO2
emissions
· Decrease in sales of parts for internal
combustion engine vehicles
 Set annual milestones and accelerate efforts to become carbon neutral.
· Promote energy conservation and fuel switching on a daily basis · Planning for model plants for decarbonized production
· Proactive renewable energy introduction
· Introduction of ICP into capital investment decisions
  · Reduce CO2 emissions by 50% by FY2030 · Reduce CO2 emissions to net zero by
FY2050.
(PACIFIC Environmental Challenge 2050) * Scope 1+2, compared to FY2019
   Physical risks
 · Floods
· Heatstroke
· Supply chain supply risks due to flooding,
drought, etc.
· At our Thailand plant, which has experienced flooding, strengthen drainage capacity by increasing the diameter of drain pipes, etc., and collect and analyze information on global flooding risks.
· Establish a multi-company purchasing system and promote the incorporation of flood risk and other such concerns into our BCP, as major domestic suppliers are concentrated in Gifu and Aichi prefectures.
· Proactively introduce air conditioners and air-conditioned clothing, share temperature information, and take other meticulous precautions to combat heatstroke.
 Promote the following initiatives related to material topic “Climate change adaptation measures”
· Support for business partner BCP
formulation
· Promote cooperation with local
communities in times of disaster · Heat stroke prevention
  Opportunities
  · Increase in sales of lightweight products such as UHTSS products made by cold stamping (LCA contributes to CO2 reduction)
· Increase in sales of products for EVs
· Improving resilience (against disasters) by
enhancing BCP, including those of suppliers
 · Demand for UHTSS products is increasing in line with the global need for safer and more fuel-efficient vehicles. In particular, we are strategically introducing and proposing the use of UHTSS products made by cold stamping, which is one of our strengths, because it can reduce CO2 emissions during production to about 1/8 of that of the hot stamping method (according to our calculations).
· Strengthen development of products for EVs in the areas of stamping, molding, valves, TPMS, and forged products in anticipation of the rapidly expanding trend toward electrification of automobiles.
  Set the following KPIs for materiality
· Ratio of UHTSS products to total stamping
products (25% in FY2024)
· Percentage of sales for electrified vehicles
(FY2030 70%)

Governance
We have identified 15 material topics that are important for sustainability management, including “Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change,” and categorized them into four themes. The “Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change” is led by the General Manager of the Safety and Environment Department, who works with the Corporate Planning Department to set KPIs and integrate them into business activities. Among the material topics, “Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change” is recognized as the most important one. In addition to reporting and deliberating on the status and making decisions at the Sustainability Promotion Committee, held four times a year (attended by internal directors including the president), we discuss important issues individually at weekly Corporate Strategy Committee meetings. In addition, at least once a year, the Board of Directors deliberates on the status of sustainability activity reports and initiatives regarding risks and opportunities for climate change-related issues.
Risk Management
The materiality assessment of climate change is determined in consultation with the Corporate Strategy Committee and Board of Directors. Risks and opportunities are identified and evaluated by the Sustainability Promotion Committee and discussed at Corporate Strategy Committee meetings. Issues that are already recognized as having a significant impact, such as carbon neutrality and electrification, are discussed at Corporate Strategy Committee meetings and Board of Directors meetings as needed, they are incorporated into strategies, and then measures are formulated and implemented.
Strategies, Indicators and Targets
Received a high rating in the CDP survey
We responded as a supply chain to a survey by the CDP, an international NGO that evaluates the quality of climate change initiatives and disclosure, and in December 2020 we received an “A-” leadership level rating on climate change and, in February 2021, we were named to the “Leaderboard” for supplier engagement.

 Reduction of CO2 Emissions
With an eye on the 1.5°C scenario of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, the Pacific Industrial Group endeavors to reduce energy usage by pushing forward such activities as production technology development, facility upgrading, production process improvement, and daily activity improvement and introduction of renewable energies. In FY2020, we worked to reduce CO2 emissions with the full-scale operation of our Higashi Ogaki Plant’s special high-voltage power feeding system and the efficient operation of compressors.

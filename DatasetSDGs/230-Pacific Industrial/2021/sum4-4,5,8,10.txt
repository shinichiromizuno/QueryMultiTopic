      for EMPLOYEES
Respecting human resources and their active partcipation
From the perspective of respect for human rights and dignity, the Pacific Industrial Group will provide a workplace where all employees can work at ease in an environment that allows them to find work they can be proud of, and encourages them to demonstrate their creativity and spirit of challenge.
Highly relevant SDGs
Implementation of Human Rights Surveys
Through human rights due diligence mechanisms, our Group strives to identify and either prevent or mitigate negative impacts on human rights. These mechanisms include the regular monitoring of the implementation status of our “Code of Conduct” and “Supplier CSR Guidelines”. Through questionnaires conducted in FY2020, we confirmed that there were no serious cases of human rights violations at our three domestic group companies or at our suppliers. Since then, we have conducted questionnaires for all employees at overseas business entities the same way as we do in Japan, and are working to improve human rights awareness.

Respect for human rights
Human Rights Policy Formulation
In recent years, the importance of corporate efforts to address human rights issues as a social requirement is growing. We consider human rights to be a core issue for sustainability management and created the “Pacific Industrial Group Human Rights Policy” in February 2021. Under this policy, all employees will act with high ethical standards and integrity as sensible members of the global community, and the entire Group will work together to promote initiatives that respect human rights.
Education
Upon the development of our “Human Rights Policy”, in order to raise awareness of human rights within the Group and to put into practice the creation of a corporate culture of respect for human rights, we conduct awareness-raising and educational activities to promote proper understanding of those rights and ensure that information is shared throughout the company. Specifically, in addition to incorporating human rights education into training programs for employees at each level of our company and conducting regular e-learning, we are creating versions of our policies in other languages and using them to ensure that our overseas bases are fully aware of them, as well as expanding them to related business partners. We also created a special feature article on human rights in the company newsletter distributed to all employees to promote understanding of the importance of human rights.

Improving Employee Engagement
We believe that the key to continued value creation is the ease and satisfaction employees feel when fulfilling their roles. We therefore analyze the results of various surveys conducted within our company so that we can better understand the progress and challenges of efforts to improve employee awareness and satisfaction, and share issues with management and other employees in order to create a company and workplace that is cheerful and rewarding to work at while simultaneously exploring and implementing other measures to improve engagement.
Work-Life Balance
We are implementing a variety of measures to ensure that employees are able to feel satisfaction and personal growth at work, while living a fulfilling personal life. In addition to being awarded “Kurumin” certification as a company that supports childcare, we have set a target of having employees take 12 days of annual paid vacation and have been working to ensure that target is achieved. In April 2019, we introduced a work-interval system to guarantee the minimum hours away from work before coming in for the next day. We will remain committed to supporting our employees to maintain a balance between work and their personal commitments including childcare and nursing care, while fostering a work environment and corporate culture that encourages employees to use vacation time, maintain their health, and work vigorously.
Pacific Industrial was awarded with “Kurumin” certification logo, by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
 The safety and health of employees
Building a Safe and Secure Workplace
Based on the principle of safety first, we promote safety management initiatives centered on human resource development, equipment safety measures, and workplace development to provide a healthy, safe, and secure workplace for employees.
■ Human Resource Development
In order to become a company that is strict about safety, we use the Study Hall as a base for technical education. We also conduct safety experience education, risk assessment education, and hazard prediction training for employees at each level to improve their ability to recognize danger as part of our efforts to increase risk sensitivity. We are also promoting the establishment and expansion of safety dojos to provide extensive safety education even at remote plants.
■ Equipment Safety Measures
Focus items for the eradication of STOP6, which are the six key factors that can lead to major accidents, are incorporated into our daily activities, and we are working to establish and continue implementing those activities, clarify priorities, and promote countermeasures. We aim to create a safe workplace through risk eradication at the process and equipment design stage, and work risk assessments at the installation stage, for the safety of new equipment and lines.
■ Providing Proper Work Environments
We are working toward providing comfortable work environments by introducing air-conditioned clothing and systematically making progress on converting plant lighting to LEDs. Through changing to LED lighting, average brightness has improved by 140%, which has a positive impact on the work environment. As of the end of June 2021, 55% of the floor space of all plants in Japan have LED lighting installed, and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 1,336 tons per year (cumulative total).
Health Management Initiatives
From 2005, we began efforts to promote work-life balance. In 2006, we became the first company to be registered as a “Hatsu Ratsu Workplace Creation Declaration” by the Gifu Labor Bureau, and since then we have been promoting the mental and physical health of our employees in a concrete and continuous manner. In recent years, with the declining birthrate, aging population, and health consciousness, the importance of health management is increasing. We are also placing importance on the health of our employees as the foundation for the success of our human resources. In September 2021, we stipulated our stance on this matter in the “Pacific Industrial Group Health Declaration.” By running the cycle of health management, we will enhance the social value of employee health and connect this to improving our ability to create value.

We consider the health and safety of our employees to be the starting point of “monozukuri”, and we will work to maintain and improve the physical and mental health of our employees and their families, and create a comfortable work environment for the sustainable growth of the company and our employees. In order to achieve our brand slogan, “Passion in Creating Tomorrow,” we declare that we value new ideas and challenges, and that we will strive to create a company where people can feel a sense of harmony between work and life, and work in a healthy and vigorous manner.

  Respecting human resources and their active partcipation
Development of human resources and Cultivation of culture that we can tackle new endeavors
  Basic Approach and Policy for Human Resources Education
With the intent to achieve our management strategy, and with an eye on the medium to long-term human resource development issues of raising up the baseline of the new generation of workers and the early development of leaders, we believe that the key to human resource development is “where ability meets compassion”. Therefore, in addition to providing education to improve skill, we also provide well-balanced, well-timed education opportunities to acquire both ability and compassion.
Strengthen Education at Each Level
In April 2021, we conducted a complete review of our new education program and restructured it into an effective education system that nurtures people. For our staff, we have expanded training for supervisory positions, introduced problem solving and Toyota Production System (TPS) training for new employees, systematized training on safety, quality, and productivity for technical staff, and incorporated training to improve compassion into the new program.
Diversity and Inclusion
Policies and Initiatives
We believe that by creating a work environment and corporate culture that is inclusive and allows employees to demonstrate their abilities in accordance with their internal attributes, including their individuality, strengths and weaknesses, health conditions, personality, beliefs, and sexual orientation, we can revitalize workplaces, contribute to innovation, and reduce employee turnover rate. To this end, we respect diversity and inclusion as one of our management strategies, and we are promoting various cross- functional initiatives within the company.
Dialogue with Labor Unions
Improving Work Methods
Based on the idea that each and every employee can enhance their work productivity by being continuously involved in improvements and, as a result, enrich their personal lives as well, we are continuously promoting
 the improvement of work methods without being constrained by conventional methods.
 Promotion of Women’s Activities
We believe that the further advancement of women is essential for the sustainable growth of a company and the strengthening of corporate competitiveness. We promote the hiring of capable human resources, regardless of gender, the creation of a work environment that allows employees to choose various work styles, and career education necessary for individual growth. We are working to increase the percentage of female university graduates hired each year to 10% or more. Our goal is to increase the ratio of female managers in the entire Group to 14% or more by FY2030.

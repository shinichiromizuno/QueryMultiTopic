       Status of ISO 14001 Certification
Pacific Industrial considers ISO 14001 to be a requirement as a manufacturer, and actively seeks to build and maintain a global environment management system (EMS) for the entire group and each of its companies.
As for certified sites, 18 out of 20 bases, or 90 percent of the total, have been certified (eight in Japan and 10 in other countries).
External and Internal Environmental Audits
Along with third-party audits, we conduct internal audits and management reviews (top management inspections) to ensure proper operation and continuous improvement of environment management systems. In September 2017, we conducted a third-party renewal audit and a transition assessment for the FY2015 edition, and we received certification that we have met the requirements. In addition, internal audits are used as an important opportunity to openly engage in discussions and to offer opinions and proposals through mutual audits, so as to raise the overall level of environmental management.

 “Risks” and “Opportunities” Related to Climate Change
The Pacific Industrial Group seeks to continuously monitor potential impacts on materiality (minimization of environmental load) that are considered highly important to our stakeholders and the Group, such as climate change and water, from a global viewpoint in terms of risk and opportunity.
 Factors
 Risks
 Opportunities
  Climate change
 Increase in manufacturing costs due to higher energy prices arising from the introduction of a carbon tax and the tightening of environmental laws and regulations
 Exclusion of the impact of a carbon tax through such efforts as productivity improvement, promotion of energy conservation and conversion to renewable energies
 Exclusion of environmentally unfriendly products from the market as customers grow more aware of the environment
   Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, supported by the development of lighter energy-saving parts, next-generation auto parts and environmentally friendly products, etc.
 Preservation of water resources (Physical risk)
Suspension of operation/transportation due to lack of water, floods or other causes (impacts on production activities)
 Continuous improvement of BCP and reinforcement of production and supplementation systems
 Cost reduction resulting from reduced usage of water
   Compliance with laws and regulations
  Loss of trust from local communities and customers, and even decrease in orders due to non-compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations and inadequate efforts for environmental preservation
  Improvement in corporate value and brand power brought about by enhanced efforts to address environmental and climate change issues
    Environmental Reports
Activities to Reduce Environmental Load
The Pacific Industrial Group has been stepping up efforts to achieve co-existence with nature and local communities, in addition to activities to reduce environmental load during production.
| Highly relevant SDGs |
 Reduction of CO2 Emissions Total emissions Target : kt
With an eye on the 1.5°C scenario of the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, we endeavor to reduce energy usage by pushing forward such activities as production technology development, facility upgrading, production process improvement, and daily activity improvement and introduction of renewable energies. In FY2019, we started a special high-voltage power feeding system at East Ogaki Plant, and worked on other initiatives to cut CO2 emissions as well, such as reducing defects in the production process, improving production efficiency, and replacing fluorescent lights with LEDs at plants. We have also been working to develop and produce environmentally conscious products, such as TPMS products (tire pressure monitoring systems) with greater fuel efficiency and UHTSS products, which are used as a lightweight solution.

for calculating greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions by organizations throughout the supply chain (Ver. 3.0) published by the Ministry of the Environment.
Conservation of water resources
We are pushing forward resource recycling by reducing industrial waste generation through defect reduction activities in the manufacturing process and by recycling materials, primarily waste rubber and resin. In FY2019, we implemented activities to reduce defects in the production process through quality and performance standardization activities (SSA) for forming and stamping products and all urethane covers. As part of our effort to promote plant environment beautification, we refurbished the resource station at Nishi Ogaki Plant, which helped enhance employees’ environmental manners. We also carried out activities to turn branches, leaves and woodchips cut off in cleanups at Kita Ogaki Plant into compost, and use it to increase greenery within the plant.

Chemical Substance Management
We endeavor to manage and reduce environmentally hazardous substances contained in raw materials and properly manage the chemical substances we use in the production process in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations in Japan and overseas. We have also been working to develop production technologies and improve production processes. In place of coating and gilding, we are working on in-mold electronic technology to develop and produce design products, such as ornaments, as well as products made with colored materials, such as all urethane covers. We conduct a substance survey each year for our business partners using the JAMA/JAPIA Standard Material Datasheet.
Preservation of Water Resources
We encourage the management and reduction of water usage and the recycling of water according to local circumstances to promote effective use and preservation of water resources. We are also committed to controlling the quality of waste water and preserving the quality of water, and moving forward with biodiversity conservation activities, including the maintenance of ecosystems in river source and watershed areas. In place of coating and gilding methods that use a lot of water in the production process, we have been working to develop new decoration technologies that don’t require water.

         Initiatives for Biodiversity
In 2009, the Pacific Industry Group initiated various projects to learn about environmental conservation and a recycling-oriented society at the “Pacific Satoyama Woodland” in Kamiishizu-Cho, Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture with our employees, their families and community residents. Since then, we have continuously engaged in these projects. During the decade, a total of 3,800 people participated in the projects with 1,665 trees planted. Moreover, we support “Stonefly Watching,” a water quality survey project conducted by an elementary school next to our head office and Nishi Ogaki Plant.
The Stonefly Watching conducted in June 2019 in a riverside area of the Kuise River
Environmental Communication
We regularly invite residents living near our plants and government officials to our company office to host social gatherings. We introduce visitors to our initiatives dedicated to environmental friendliness, safety, and CSR, and take them on a tour around our plants and environmental facilities. We hosted such tours at Higashi Ogaki Plant in November 2018 and Yoro Plant in February 2019.
We also carry out next-generation environmental education programs, teaching the importance of environmental activities such as the Pacific Satoyama Woodland projects to local elementary students and giving lectures on environmental efforts at universities. We maintain active communication with local NGOs so that we can work together and provide education through joint activities as well as support for environmental conservation projects.

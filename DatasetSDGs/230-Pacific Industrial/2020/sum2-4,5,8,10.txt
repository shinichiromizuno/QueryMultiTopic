Respecting human resources and
their active partcipation
From the perspective of respect for human rights and dignity, the Pacific Industrial Group will provide a workplace where all employees can work at ease in an environment that allows them to find work they can be proud of, and encourages them to demonstrate their creativity and spirit of challenge.
Promoting Human Resources Development
In keeping with the principle of “manufacturing is about developing people,” we endeavor to secure core personnel and develop the next generation of human resources. We not only focus on passing on our technologies and skills through on-the- job training, but also offer job- and rank-based education through the training programs. In 2019, we opened the Study Hall on the premises of the Nishi Ogaki Plant to learn more about safety, quality, and skills in a more practical manner. We are also devoting our efforts on education programs for nurturing talents
Promoting Work-life Balance
We aim to realize a work environment and corporate culture where employees can experience satisfaction and personal growth at work, while living a fulfilling personal life.
We offer childcare and nursing care benefits that go beyond what is required by law and ensure that our employees are familiar with them, while also providing other useful information. In recognition of our efforts to support employees with their childcare needs, we have been awarded the “Kurumin” certification three times in a row by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare.
With respect to paid leave, we have set a target of 12 days of annual paid vacation days per employee and are working to

In addition, we introduced a work-interval system in April 2019

For 14 years since joining the company, I have been mainly involved in product shipment operations. When I joined the company, I had a very hard time remembering the wide variety of products that I handled. To accurately deliver high-quality products to our customers, reliable work is required. I listened to the advice from my superiors and experienced workers at our workplace, and now I handle my job smoothly. As QC Circle leader, I’m also conducting workplace improvement activities, and I’m making positive efforts on a daily basis while feeling that I’m doing extremely rewarding jobs.

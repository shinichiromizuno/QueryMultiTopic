Initiatives Respecting Human Rights, Including Our Supply Chains
In developing a wide range of businesses across the globe, the Sojitz Group supports the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We are promoting our initiatives in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
MTP 2020 Progress
We are focusing our attention on risk assessment, in addition to ensuring that our policies, including the Sojitz Group Human Rights Policy and the Sojitz Group CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains, are well known.
Making our policies known
We distribute handbooks to each Group company and supplier.
Risk assessment
The Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, a British NGO, maintains a database with examples of environmental and human rights risks. Using this, we identify sectors in which general environmental and human rights risks could easily occur and then check any applicable circumstances in our supply chains. From now on, we will check the circumstances of initiatives related to risks with regard to these areas, and focus our efforts on amelioration and relief as necessary.

We have established a Sustainability Committee, chaired by our CEO, to enable us to promote management that considers the perspective of sustainability. In addition, the policies and issues that are discussed by the Sustainability Committee are referred or reported to the Management Committee and the Board of Directors; the Board of Directors supervises this process, and offers instruction as to how to deal with any issues as necessary.
The Sojitz Group makes numerous investments and loans, and through this is constructing a sustainable growth foundation and portfolio. Such new finance and investment proposals are deliberated by the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council, which confirms whether there is a possibility that alternatives will expand and threaten the feasibility of a business in the long term, and whether a business is experiencing increased international pressure to scale back, especially in the area of carbon emissions.
During the period of MTP 2020, we will go beyond the themes set out in our Sustainability Challenge and discuss a variety of individual themes relating to the Key
Sustainability Issues (Materiality). We will also strive to understand external trends through dialogues with stakeholders and other activities, with the aim of increased clarity regarding the areas that we should check and keep in mind as a Group.

Hospital Project in Turkey
Contributing to improved quality of life by providing high-quality medical infrastructure
We have participated in a hospital construction and facility management project in Turkey since 2017. This is one of the world’s largest PPP* hospital facility management projects involving a Japanese company; construction was completed four months ahead of schedule, with the formal opening in May 2020, enabling us to ameliorate the lack of beds caused by the increase in COVID-19 patients. Sojitz is managing this project as well as cooperating with Japanese companies to accelerate the development of derivative healthcare services, and will establish a business model that incorporates hospital management and surrounding businesses.
In addition, we will enter the area of smart healthcare and the medical
treatment platform business, creating diverse services that will contribute
to improved health maintenance for the people of Turkey.
* Public-Private Partnership: A business that involves collaboration between the public and private sectors.

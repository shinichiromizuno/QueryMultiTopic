Making use of the networks unique to a trading company to pursue sustainability for society and for business
   As emerging and developing countries experience economic growth, there is an increased demand for energy, together with a heightened awareness of its environmental impact. In this context, we anticipate rising demand for renewable energy. Sojitz has cultivated development opportunities and networks in the solar power generation business through participation in the business in Japan and overseas; in recent years, we have focused our efforts on expanding markets and sources of electric power, including participation in the off-shore wind power generation business in Taiwan and the biomass power generation business in Japan. Strengthening these initiatives will enable us to contribute to the construction of a stable energy system that makes sustainable development possible.

1 We acquired management know-how by developing and entering the market in Germany in 2010, and Japan in 2013
2 We used our partners and our Japanese/international network to develop 12 projects in Japan, and joined in the solar power generation business overseas in countries such as Mexico, Chile, and Peru
3 We will use the developmental and management know-how that we have cultivated in the solar power generation business to press forward and expand in overseas markets. We are also focusing on diversifying power sources, and engaging in on-shore wind power generation in Ireland and the U.S., and off-shore wind power generation in Taiwan. In the future, we will focus our efforts on managing our renewable energy business in an efficient and sophisticated manner by incorporating AI and the IoT

Comment from our partner (Shikoku Electric Power Company)
When it comes to the solar power generation business in Huatacondo in the Republic of Chile, we have made use of Sojitz Corporation’s business development and management functions, as well as the knowledge that we have cultivated up until now, to realize both our first solar IPP business overseas and the first Japanese electric power IPP business in South America. Following on this project, we are coming together with Sojitz Corporation to form a partnership in the off-shore wind power business in Taiwan. As we aim for further growth, we want to strengthen our relationship to contribute to the spread and development of renewable energy overseas.

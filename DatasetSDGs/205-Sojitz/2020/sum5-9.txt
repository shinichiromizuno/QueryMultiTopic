Contributing to the development of local communities by providing an environment
in which it is easy to connect to a wireless network
Sojitz entered the telecommunication infrastructure business in Myanmar in November 2019. As smartphones become more popular in Myanmar, there has been a steady increase in data traffic. On top of this, the frequency bands for 5G need more base stations than for 4G, and so we expect the demand for telecom towers in Myanmar to grow rapidly. Sojitz will contribute to improving the living environments of local communities by, for example, providing an environment with a reliable Internet connection in localities in Myanmar that either have no electricity or have little electricity. We will also focus our efforts on developing surrounding businesses centered on telecom towers as well as securing long-term, stable earnings.

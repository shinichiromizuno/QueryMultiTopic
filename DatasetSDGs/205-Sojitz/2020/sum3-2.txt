Contributing to the development of a diverse food culture by providing food in a reliable and safe manner
Food culture in ASEAN countries is changing as economies grow. Sojitz is collaborating with leading local businesses in the Philippines to achieve our wheat flour milling business and ingredient wholesaling business, as well as to create value chains for the distribution of wheat, i.e. for our packaged bread business, which has yielded a Japanese-style “soft texture.” By introducing Japanese technology and expertise, we are responding to people’s need for the reliable and safe provision of food, and contributing to the development of food culture in the Philippines.

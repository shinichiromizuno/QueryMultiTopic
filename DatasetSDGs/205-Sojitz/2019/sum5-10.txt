Initiatives Respecting Human Rights, Including Our Supply Chains
 Human Rights
 In developing a wide range of companies across the globe, the Sojitz Group supports the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and is promoting initiatives that respect human rights in regard to business, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Risk Assessment and Approach to Prioritization
In the year ended March 2019, we organized prioritization within our risk assessments to promote the reduction of environmental and social (human rights) risks in a more systematic manner.
- We have analyzed business fields that typically present high risks based on case studies of environmental and human rights risks that have occurred around the world since 2000; information on these cases come from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, a British NGO. Based on this analysis, we adjusted our approach to prioritization for both Group companies and suppliers.
- In terms of our Group companies, all of our businesses will be subject to risk assessment and improvements regardless of country, but we will especially prioritize businesses we predict will have a major impact on the environment and society (human rights).
- We will prioritize and focus on suppliers starting with high-risk fields of business, regardless of transaction amounts or revenue. As environmental and social risks exist

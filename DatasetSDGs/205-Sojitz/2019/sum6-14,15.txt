Promoting Sustainable, Responsible ProcurementSojitz Group established the Sojitz Group Wood Procurement Policy, and, together with various suppliers, we are striving to achieve sustainable wood procurement that is both environmentally-conscious and respects human rights. In the year ended March 2019, the results of a survey showed that 0% of our wood was lacking traceability (Level D), meaning that we reached our target for FY 2020 ahead of time. *1
In addition to wood, we are working to gain certification for a variety of products that require further consideration when it comes to sustainable procurement. *2

*2 Certifications newly obtained in FY2018 (1) RSPO certification (Sojitz Corporation)
 This certification comes from the Roundtable
on Sustainable Palm Oil, an international
organization. Sojitz has succeeded in
obtaining segregation—providing certified
palm oil shipped from multiple certified
plantations to manufacturers without mixing
it with uncertified oil— and obtaining a mass
balance between controlling the quantity of oil used in the distribution process and the certified oil production locations (certified plantations).
(2) MSC Chain of Custody (Dalian Global Food Corp. in China)
This supply chain certification from the Marine Stewardship Council, an international NPO, is granted to companies that can process and distribute marine products (with MSC certification) obtained through sustainable marine industry without mixing them with uncertified marine products.
(3) SCSA certification (Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima Co., Ltd.)
The Seedlings Council for Sustainable Aquaculture, a Japanese NPO, grants this certification to producers and cultivators of sustainable seedlings who use artificial seeds as seedlings for aquaculture.

   INTRODUCTION WHO WE ARE WHERE WE’RE GOING
Editorial Policy
Sojitz attaches importance to the role of its integrated report as a communication tool to help a wide range of readers understand its business activities and business model. The Integrated Report 2019 has been compiled based on the International Integrated Reporting Framework proposed by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), with the theme of maximizing “two types of value”: “value for Sojitz” and “value for society,” and an awareness of the connectivity between the use of our management resources and the creation of business functions. In addition, we have endeavored to edit this report to enable stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the Company through the visualization of the strengths Sojitz has cultivated to the present day.
The Cover of This Report
The front/back covers represent Sojitz’s commitment to realizing steady growth through Medium-term Management Plan 2020, as well as its continued efforts to promote further growth by creating value through new ideas. Sojitz promises to pursue sustainable growth through a process that begins with confronting questions (represented visually by a question mark) that are then brought to life as new business (shown as an exclamation mark).
Note on Forward-Looking Statements
The information about future performance (forward-looking statements) in this integrated report is based on information available to management at the time of its disclosure. Accordingly, readers are advised that actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to a wide variety of factors including, but not limited to, conditions in the Company’s principal overseas and domestic markets, economic conditions, and changes in foreign currency exchange markets.
Priority Initiatives
United Nations Global Compact
Sojitz signed the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to clarify our ideals in its global operations, including respect for the environment and human rights through businesses that comply with international standards as well as the laws of countries and regions. The UNGC calls for companies to exercise leadership as members of the international community and pursue sustainability through their businesses. Sojitz joined the UNGC in 2009. We support the 10 principles of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption, and practice these principles through our business activities.

 The Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation
Sojitz agrees with the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation issued by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. We consult the Guidance for Collaborative Value Creation in all our IR activities, including this Integrated Report, with the objective to receive evaluation of our corporate values through constructive dialogue with investors and shareholders.
Sustainable Development Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for the resolution of 17 worldwide priority social issues by 2030. Under the leadership of the United Nations, the goals were adopted in 2015 by 193 member nations. Given the medium- to long-term expectations stakeholders have for the resolution of these issues, Sojitz took the SDGs into account when clarifying the Group’s CSR Focus Areas (current key Sustainability Issues (materiality)).
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
Climate change is a major issue in international society, one which Sojitz is emphasizing as a management issue. We endorse the proposals of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and are making efforts to disclose the impact of climate change on our business activities and to implement specific measures to overcome it.

INTRODUCTION
Corporate Statement/To Our Stakeholders
  Sojitz Group Statement
The Sojitz Group creates value and prosperity by connecting the world with a spirit of integrity.
Sojitz Group Slogan
Sojitz Guiding Principles
The Sojitz Group aims to create value for our stakeholders by aligning our strong, capable individuals under the following 5 principles:
1. Trust: Build enduring trust.
2. Innovation: Innovate with foresight.
3. Speed: Strive for speed.
4. Challenge: Take calculated risks.
5. Perseverance: Persevere until successful.
   2 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

Utilizing innovative ideas, Sojitz will continue to take on new challenges, connecting steady growth to the next leap forward.
Since its founding, Sojitz has continued to learn from the past, take on new challenges, and achieve one goal after another. This has forged a “Sojitz Identity” defined by genba-ryoku*—that is, the abilities exhibited by our people on the business frontlines. It is the very culmination of the business ingenuity honed by our predecessors, the capacity for disciplined growth developed from the lessons learned during our hardest times, and the creativity which will lead the way to the future.
Medium-term Management Plan 2020 – Commitment to Growth – began in April 2018, and during our first year of the plan, we successfully linked our past efforts to new profit and maintained fiscal discipline in continuing to
replace assets and conduct new investments and
loans. We made full use of our greatest
advantages and abilities to actively challenge
new business areas, hand-in-hand with our
trusted partners, while responding to the
dizzying changes of the business environment.
This year as well, we will continue to refine our
strengths to build new “clusters of
revenue-generating business,” reaffirm our
“Commitment to Growth,” and realize steady
profit growth of around 10% per year.
Sojitz is now in a stage of growth. Seeking to maximize the “two types of value”—"value for Sojitz” and “value for society”—all of us at Sojitz will unite to achieve sustainable growth for our company and create a more prosperous society.

 INTRODUCTION
Sojitz’s Value Creation Model
Maximizing Business Value Where Sojitz’s “Two Types of Value” Overlap
Sojitz has taken on the challenge of maximizing our business value where our two types of value, “Value for Sojitz”, and “Value for Society”, overlap. We do this while understanding the needs of different places across the world, exercising various capabilities and putting management decisions into practice with speed. Creating continuous prosperity for all our stakeholders—that is our company’s raison d’être.

    Two Types of Value
Creating “two types of value”
Sojitz aims to create “two types of value.” The first is “value for Sojitz,” which means enhancing our business foundation and sustained growth, and the second is “value for society,” which includes the development of local economies and environmental preservation.
Strengthening human resources
Human resources are the greatest business assets for a trading company. We are working to understand needs around the world and to enhance our human resource capabilities to create value based on the keywords of genba-ryoku, speed and innovation, making this a source of value creation for Sojitz.
Exercising our capabilities through new ideas
We are always exercising our capabilities through trading, investments in interest, and business investments, with new ideas, looking ahead to the future and quickly expanding our business in advance of the fast-moving changes in the external environment and the diversification of needs.
Practicing strategies and governance that will create sustained growth
Sojitz anticipates business opportunities and risks based on the uncertainty of the external environment, and engages in disciplined investments, loans and risk management. In so doing, we create clusters of revenue-generating businesses and construct a foundation for sustained growth.
Building a robust business foundation
Business locations and partnerships that reach countries across the world, trust-based relationships with customers in different regions that have grown over many years, and brand power: the solid business foundation that Sojitz has built up supports sustained growth.

   Sojitz is currently implementing the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 “Commitment to Growth” (MTP 2020) over three years starting from April 2018. Through this plan, we are further strengthening our business foundation and accumulating clusters of revenue-generating businesses, establishing a strong corporate body that will make sustained growth possible. This will also lead to further strides forward during and after our next medium-term plan.

 WHERE WE’RE GOING
Message from the President
We have achieved 7 years of rising profits. Without letting up on this speed of growth,
focus on maximizing our “two types of value,” and further increase Sojitz’s industry presence.
Masayoshi Fujimoto

Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

A look back at FY2018:
7 years of rising profits
Moving towards steady growth
We have now finished the first fiscal year of Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 (“MTP 2020”), which started in April 2018. Our net profit for the year was ¥70.4 billion, far above the ¥63.0 billion target we set at the start of the year. This is the highest revenue Sojitz has earned since its founding and our 7th consecutive year of profit growth since FY2012. Our 3.0% ROA and 11.7% ROE also saw us meet our MTP 2020 financial targets of “ROA of 3.0% or above and ROE of 10% or above.”
Although these results were due in part to high market prices for resources, particularly coal, our having achieved our best results ever is clear evidence that we have acquired the capacity for steady earnings, and I feel that we have arrived at the point where we can seriously aim for sustained growth.
We are aiming for ¥75.0 billion or more in profit for the final year of MTP 2020, achieved through 10% year-on-year growth independent of rises in resource prices. I pledge to ensure continued growth for the company as we strive to meet our targets for the final year of MTP 2020 and head towards even further growth beyond.
We increased our dividend forecast for FY2018 from the initial estimate of ¥15.0 to ¥17.0 per share, resulting from the upward adjustment made to our net profit forecast at the start of the year (from ¥63.0 billion to ¥70.0 billion). This brought our payout ratio to 30.2%.
Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2019
In accordance with our dividend policy for MTP 2020, we will aim for stable and continuous payouts and maintain a payout ratio of around 30% going forward.
Results for FY2018:
Improving the quality of our assets led to a rise in ROA and ROE
I am personally moved that we were able to fulfill our ROA and ROE targets during the first fiscal year of MTP 2020. As the person in charge of corporate planning during the former Medium-term Management Plan (“MTP 2017”),
I was involved in formulating MTP 2020. When I compare our portfolio now to our portfolio at the time, I must say that the quality of our assets has improved more rapidly than we had expected.
This is thanks to our making ¥300.0 billion worth of new investments and loans in mainly non-resource businesses to steadily grow the company, based on a management policy focused on cash flow and profit efficiency. P. 28
Since MTP 2017, around 80% of our new investments and loans have been in non-resource fields. In addition to areas in which Sojitz already holds a competitive edge—such as steel, fertilizer, and methanol—we have also made new investments and loans in aircraft-related businesses, renewable energy businesses, and retail businesses in the ASEAN region, all of which are beginning to show stable growth. At the same time, our development projects and management/operation businesses, such as the IPP businesses and hospital business, are also

interests; we also obtained agreement from our partner on our thermal coal interests in Indonesia to sell off part of our holdings, in an effort to support sustainability. Meanwhile, we acquired new coking coal interests in Australia. As the only trading company to operate its own coal mine, we are using that function to make this coking coal business into a huge source of profits in the
  helping to raise our profitability.
When replacing assets, we reviewed our
portfolio, focusing mainly on assets with low efficiency and so we are able to minimize any one-time loss in the immediate future. We started with our non-resource businesses, quickly disposing of any assets that were both oversized and unprofitable. In terms of resource-based businesses, we not only continued to gradually sell off assets related to our petroleum gas

future.
Overall, we made firm progress in improving
the quality of our assets by narrowing our focus to resource businesses in fields where Sojitz can make full use of its functions while actively strengthening and expanding our non-resource businesses. As a result, we managed to improve both our ROA and ROE.
Heading into FY2019:
Each division will endeavor
to expand its earning capabilities.
The business environment surrounding the Sojitz Group grows increasingly opaque. In light of this, we set our expected profit for FY2019 at ¥72.0 billion, an increase of ¥1.6 billion over the previous year. Although factoring in market conditions for coal and other materials in the second half of the year led us to set a rather conservative figure, in striving for the “steady growth” named in MTP 2020, we also incorporated earnings contributions from investments and loans that are marking steady progress and the growth of our existing businesses into our plans. If you take the market conditions we expected when we first formulated MTP 2020 and replace those with this growth, it should come to around 10% growth in profits over the previous year.
Our growth is driven by investments and loans, and in order to carry those out according to plan, every division will need to analyze the business environment in minute detail and maintain speedy decision-making while distinguishing between risks and opportunities. For divisions that have yet to show their full potential, the rest of the upper management and I will work to steadily raise their earning power over the remaining two years of MTP 2020, in close discussion with the COOs of the business

Preparing for the post-MTP 2020 period:
Displaying our full strength
and driving further growth
by taking on new business areas
MTP 2020 also serves as a time to prepare for the next Medium-term Management Plan, where we will aim to earn a net profit of ¥100.0 billion a year. We believe that expanding the company’s functions, further strengthening the company’s businesses, and transcending divisional and organizational boundaries to rally the combined strengths of our 9 divisions will lead to the creation of new functions that will help expand our earnings. There have been several projects brought to closing thanks to the complementary functions of the multiple business divisions involved, and we intend to continue to promote and enhance that aspect of our business.
We also regard the changes to business models brought about by the digital revolution and new technologies as new business opportunities, and we work to respond accordingly. As part of that effort, we set up the Business Innovation Office last year to collect and share information about innovation with the management in a timely fashion, in order to lay the groundwork for increased productivity and support our forays into new areas through
cutting-edge technology.
Furthermore, during FY2018, we set up new
frameworks for innovation-related loans and investments, established a corporate venture capital in the U.S. to invest in start-up businesses all over the world, and invested in a venture fund in India, which has become a hub for some of the most prominent startups worldwide. We subsequently opened a liaison office in Bengaluru—a hotbed of IT professionals and young entrepreneurs—which we regard as the world’s most important hub for innovation after San Jose in the U.S. We plan to leverage this office in Bengaluru to take the business creation know-how we have cultivated over the years and demonstrate this expertise in Asia, a region with plenty of room for development.
At the same time, it is important that we innovate the ways in which we work in order to increase productivity. We plan to expand the scope of the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems currently utilized by some of our divisions to improve the quality and efficiency of routine tasks. This way, employees will have more time to devote to creative activities, providing them with an environment that allows them to focus on realizing new concepts.
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 21

WHERE WE’RE GOING
Message from the President
Sojitz’s mission:
Existing in harmony
with the natural environment while maximizing our
“two types of value”
At Sojitz, we always strive to create two types of value. Our mission is to maximize “value for Sojitz” and “value for society” and create a prosperous future.
I believe that trading companies were originally born from the desire to bring happiness to everyone in the supply chain by delivering the things people need. Making money from our trading activities must not come at the expense of the global environment or the interests of society. I am convinced that as the head of a general trading company, my mission is to make the best choices for all stakeholders.
I felt that more strongly than ever when I attended the opening ceremony for Shimojishima Airport in Miyakojima, Okinawa, an airport we have been managing since July 2018. Increasing our earnings from management and operation of the airport requires that we bring in as many tourists as possible. Although this will bolster the local economy, it will also bring increased environmental risks, such as the risk that tourists will pollute the island’s beautiful ocean waters and require further urban development to accommodate them. How do you balance earnings with the risk of environmental damage? In my opinion, it is in precisely at times like this that we can demonstrate our value to society as a general trading company, in our ability to turn a variety of risks into long-term growth opportunities for stakeholders using our various functions, know-how, and personal networks.
And what about the growing global population? I believe we should pursue not only technology that harvests farm produce and aquaculture products for sale, but also aids in their production. This means the industrialization of fishing and agriculture, two fields where yields are heavily influenced by climate, region, and experience. We are taking on some new challenges where, if we are able to turn our daily operations and our past knowledge into big data and use AI and the IoT to carry out systematic manufacturing and shipping just as we do for industrial goods, I believe we can streamline the
whole supply chain and maximize stakeholder returns.
In recent years, a lot of people have wondered how corporations can help achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I strongly believe that the core strength of general trading companies—i.e. their ability to turn risks into opportunities, which they then transform into long-term businesses—is directly related to the 17 SDGs. Sojitz’s place in society is none other than to increase revenue through each of our businesses while maximizing value for all stakeholders and creating “two types of value.”
Sustainability for Sojitz and society:
Announcing our endorsement of the TCFD and
pursuing our long-term vision leading up to 2050
As an evolution of the sustainability initiatives the company has pursued so far, last year Sojitz announced the “promotion of Sustainability Challenge,” its long-term vision aimed at 2050. To fulfill that vision, we have defined ”promotion of sustainability management” as one of the pillars of MTP 2020. I personally took up the post of Chairman of the Sustainability Committee and endeavored to spread understanding of this concept throughout the company, devise strategies to meet this vision, and share related information.
For example, when the business divisions are drawing up a business plan, I hold a meeting with all the COOs of business division to carefully examine the risks and opportunities in each field and then discuss strategy based on our findings. Meanwhile, when deliberating investments and loans for the whole company, I instruct the deliberating departments to thoroughly discuss and report profitability in terms of the sustainability of the business.
In other news, as part of our response to climate change, we adopted the proposals of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in August 2018. We have since started to disclose the effects climate change has on our earnings and develop concrete plans to overcome these impacts. When it came to our developing a policy regarding
 22 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

acquisition of thermal coal interests, the disclosure of which was requested by many investors, we discussed the issue repeatedly and determined that not only would we not obtain new interests in thermal coal, we would also reduce those assets by half or more by 2030. P. 40
We at Sojitz intend to expand our “two types of value” to stakeholders all over the world by extending the scope of such ongoing activities. These sustainability measures are steadily receiving greater recognition from the market.
The Sojitz of the future:
Tackling new concepts
and honing the “Sojitz Identity”
We live in an age of rapid transformation. For a trading company like us, this makes developing people with leadership ability a matter of utmost importance. Sojitz is working on formulating succession plans that will develop personnel into the next generation of management.
At the same time, we are also training young employees to make accurate decisions on the business frontlines. In recent years, we have hired hundreds of new graduates and are gradually erasing our stuffy and staid image. An important part of the process of turning these new hires into capable staff is allowing them to gain experience at our work locations in Japan and abroad.
The work of a trading company is dynamic, spanning the globe. But in a sense, it is also tough work that involves balancing the interests of a wide range of stakeholders. I am confident that our new members will gain the ability to manage people on the ground by approaching their work with the guts to change the world and accumulating a variety of experiences.
Fortunately, Sojitz has long had the kind of corporate culture that proactively provides new employees with opportunities to test themselves. Since young people rarely cause significant damage to the company’s results when they fail, I want them to take self-responsibility—that is, to have the autonomy and resolve to take responsibility for their decisions, wherever they may lead. Instead of being bound by past business models and viewpoints, I want them to use new ideas to create new value. That desire is
one of the reasons behind the current “Hassojitz” project, where we have young employees gather to discuss what they want Sojitz to look like in 2050.
The “Sojitz Identity” is defined by the company’s flat hierarchy, youth, speed, and genba-ryoku*. As we move on, we will strive to create our “two types of value” and try new ideas without settling for the status quo.
* Genba-ryoku:
Refers to the combined capabilities of Sojitz Group members working on the ground—in offices, at project sites, in meetings with customers and clients, and other places of work around the world.

Message from CFO
Achieving a sustainable growth cycle through disciplined balance sheet and cash flow management
  Seiichi Tanaka
Representative Director, Executive Vice President, CFO
Greatly expanding our positive core cash flow and strengthening our financial standing
For this year, the first fiscal year of MTP 2020 (the year ended March 31, 2019), we endeavored to achieve the disciplined balance sheet and cash flow management we set as the basic policy of MTP 2020. The scope of our positive core cash flow expanded more than planned, partly due to cash recovery from planned asset replacement occurring ahead of schedule. We put great emphasis on increasing profitability while recovering cash, so in that respect, I believe we made a favorable start during this first fiscal year. Over MTP 2020, we expect to make investments and loans totaling ¥300.0 billion. By continuing to making growth investments while replacing assets, we will maintain a positive cumulative core cash flow1 over the 3-year period of the plan.
In terms of balance sheet management in the first fiscal year, that basic approach of simultaneous growth investment and asset replacement enabled us to increase ROA; we continued to accumulate quality assets through investment and loans while recovering cash through asset replacement on largely the same scale. Additionally, our initiatives to reduce interest-bearing debt and strengthen our resistance to interest and exchange rate fluctuations bore fruit, and we achieved net DER of 0.95 time. This was much lower than our target value of 1.5 times or lower, which we established after taking market changes and other uncertainties into account.
We see ourselves as currently strengthening our financial standing while continuing some
degree of new investment. However, recent factors such as the trade friction between the U.S. and China have made the future financial environment unclear, so we will be paying even more attention to inventory and managing credit exposure.

Although we expected to make investments and loans worth ¥110.0 billion in this first year of the MTP, we actually lent and invested ¥91.0 billion. This was due to cases where we withdrew from financing at the deliberation stage due to perceived low profitability, or where recording of investments was pushed into the next fiscal year. In that sense, we are still largely on track to achieve our goal of ¥300.0 billion in cumulative investments and loans over the 3 years.
In order to continue growing, we need to both build up a certain level of assets, as well as thoroughly explore and carefully examine the risks and profitability of individual projects, including existing businesses. The members of the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council discuss issues from a variety of standpoints, and as the chairman of the council, I endeavor to stay objective at all times and make decisions carefully.
In order to increase the profits from managing operating companies we have acquired and raise their value even higher, we also attach great importance to our work on

 post-merger integration (PMI). In April 2018, we established the M&A Management Office to help the business divisions manage their operating companies more smoothly.
Naturally, the business division takes the lead in executing business strategies for their operating companies, but after acquiring a business, the M&A Management Office steps in, working together with that business division’s controller office to formulate a concrete plan to achieve the division’s growth strategy. In order for us to move towards more reliable earnings and efficient investment, we believe it is extremely important to have a dedicated organization from the corporate side be deeply committed to the project. Going forward, I want them to share the know-how gained from PMI cases throughout the company so that we can raise the proficiency of our business operations even further.
be improving capital efficiency by reducing capital costs, among other measures. We estimate our company’s capital costs to be 7–8%, as we announced for the first time in May 2019. By communicating closely with our investors and disclosing proper information, we will work to minimize the knowledge gap between us and investors so that our share value will be accurately evaluated. I believe this will lead to a reduction in our risk premiums.
It goes without saying that to raise the share value, we will need to achieve an ROE that exceeds our capital costs and further expand our equity spread. As the macro environment grows increasingly uncertain, we will have to judge our future investments and loans more carefully than ever before. We will aim to increase ROA through portfolio management characterized by new investments with a focus on profit efficiency and disciplined cash flow management; asset replacement which aims to replace underperforming assets with truly high-quality ones; and an in-depth examination of our business cycle. I am confident that maintaining this kind of financial discipline while building a cycle that continuously creates high-quality profits will lead to ongoing growth for our company.

By Further Improving Investment Quality and Ensuring Steady Earnings
In MTP 2020, we will ensure the thoroughness and strength of our business model verification and risk identification at the project conceptualization stage by clarifying our investment guidelines, in addition to developing a structure for continuously improving business value by ensuring steady earnings from investments.
1 Further Improving Investment Quality—Investment Process
 Corporate departments support business divisions in the entire process, from generating proposals, making investments to managing businesses. The entire company participates in the process, including deliberations by the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council and supervision by the Board of Directors.
Furthermore, as part of our efforts to maximize the effects of our investments and loans, since April 2018, we
have established an M&A Management Office and also set up an organization needed to strengthen the project portfolio and closing power of each division. We screen project creation opportunities in the initial stage of the investment process and steadily implement projects that we believe will lead to prospects, revenue, and growth to improve the success rate of our investments.

Business divisions carry out PMI after executing M&A to bring about synergy after executing investments and maximizing project growth. Apart from the M&A Management Office, each corporate department supports
PMI by the business divisions by developing post-investment management and personnel structures even before purchase agreements are concluded. These structures are making steady progress in the first year of the MTP 2020.
Examples of business initiatives that prioritize PMI(1):
Dealership business in Russia
After purchasing two dealerships from major brand Subaru in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Sojitz transferred one corporate employee and three mid-career and young employees from the supervising department at Tokyo HQ in addition to two employees with management experience working in operating companies in Russia to make a total of six employees deployed there. To operate the business at the site, they hold weekly teleconferences with the supervising department in Tokyo HQ, and work together with the M&A Management Office and other corporate departments to quickly resolve issues and manage the progress of measures. They also pay attention to human resource development and are working to improve the foreign language skills of mainly the Russian managers in order to improve communication. At the same time, the company is actively sending young employees from Tokyo HQ to Russia and providing opportunities for them to learn Russian.
Examples of business initiatives that prioritize PMI(2):
Commercial facility management business
Our commercial facility management business involves the use of the unique know-how, leasing networks, promotional activities and other management experiences we have cultivated as business owners and reflecting them in our property management in order to increase the value of a commercial facility. In recent years, we have been owning and managing our own commercial facilities. We strive to stimulate facilities such as Pieri Moriyama and Nasu Garden Outlet, by inviting attractive tenants and holding promotions that draw customers in. In that way, we also help create jobs and increase consumer spending in the local area.

To increase the value of the business and strengthen the competitiveness and earning power of the business after investment, the business division reports regularly on the state of the management of the business and the
Finance & Investment Deliberation Council monitors the situation. Then, depending on the management situation, the Council deliberates whether to continue the business or to sell it or withdraw from it.

Accumulating Quality Assets
3 Continuous Asset Replacement to Achieve Positive Core Cash Flow
  We will accumulate period earnings and continuously replace assets to create funds for accumulating quality assets with a view to sustainably boost growth and earnings. To replace assets, we will withdraw assets from projects with no potential for future growth and reinvest in high profitability projects while striking a balance between
the timeline and profitability. One of the quantitative targets of MTP 2020 is “Maintaining a positive three-year core cash flow.” We were solidly in the black in the first fiscal year of the plan, and are making favorable progress
 according to plan (Core cash flow trends

BUSINESS Utilize MODEL
Having proven our expertise as the only general trading company dealing in coal mine operation and rehabilitation*, in March 2019, we acquired the Gregory Crinum coal mine, a coking coal mine adjacent to the Minerva coal mine. In addition to laterally expanding our coal mine management business, we will also establish a contract mining and rehabilitation business, working towards a business model with long-term stability and resilience to market fluctuations.

 The background to our business foundation
As the first Japanese general trading company to invest in Indonesian coal in the 1980s, Sojitz is a pioneer when it comes to investing in upstream interests. As a trader, we have also formed strong relationships with our clients, who place trust in our track record as the leading importer to Japan of Russian coal, in addition to Australian and Indonesian coal.
In 2010, we acquired additional interest in Australia’s Minerva coal mine, in which we have previously invested, increasing our ownership to 96%. Since then, we have not limited ourselves to coal mine management, but have also taken on mine operations, accumulating mining-related knowledge and cost management expertise along the way. We also actively promoted cooperation between our businesses, dispatching Australian technical experts to provide guidance in Indonesia. Our status as the sole general trading company that also functions as owner-operator has become the major strength of our coal business.
Having been recognized for our skillful operation and
rehabilitation of Minerva coal mine, we went on to acquire the neighbouring Gregory Crinum coal mine in March 2019, marking our first venture into coal mine management of coking coal, a raw material for iron and steel production.

 Initiatives for sustainable growth
Demonstrate market presence by utilizing our operation expertise to develop the Gregory Crinum and surrounding mines
In line with heightened global environmental awareness and sustainable business development, our Metals & Mineral Resources Division aims to rebalance our coal assets portfolio and strengthen our coking coal business, as well as divesting at least half of our thermal coal assets by 2030. Furthermore, in order to create a portfolio that would yield steady earnings even amidst a market turndown, we are continuing thorough cost reduction in our existing projects, along with focusing our efforts in expanding our mid-and downstream businesses. Specifically, once we have determined our ideal role within the value chain from mine to clients, we will utilize our expertise in coal mine management as well as existing infrastructure to develop mining-related businesses outside of trading, such as rehabilitation and contract mining.
Our recently acquired Gregory Crinum coal mine is projected to have reserves of high-quality coking coal sufficient for over 30 years of operation. Thanks to its well-maintained infrastructure, our preparations for an early operation restart have also so far remained on track. As the mine is positioned right next to the currently in-operation Minerva coal mine and Meteor Downs South coal mine, we plan to utilize its proximity to optimize manpower allocation, switching from the existing two-mine system to integrated three-mine management.

undeveloped mine lots, Gregory Crinum’s location also brings a strategic advantage. By obtaining Gregory Crinum’s coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP), loading facilities and dragline excavator, we can further strengthen our capability as owner-operator.
Realizing these opportunities, we will promptly extend our reach into contract mining, aiming for stable returns from mining, coal handling and preparation, loading and trading in surrounding mines which will be resilient to market fluctuations. Simultaneously, we will seek new opportunities for growth in the form of new upstream investments, continuously developing new businesses for the future.
Rehabilitation: Maximizing our "two types of value" through sustainable initiatives
Legal rehabilitation obligations have been transferred to Sojitz alongside our acquisition of Gregory Crinum. In addition to fulfilling our legal responsibility, we are also considering contract rehabilitation of surrounding coal mines and new ventures that positively contribute to the environment.
In this manner, by utilizing our strength in coal mine management to offer new services and values, unconstrained by the traditional business models, we will generate stable earnings that will be resilient to market fluctuations. Simultaneously, we will work towards a sustainable society by promoting local economic development and preserving the global environment.

The background to our business foundation
In 2010 Sojitz launched its solar power generation business; to date, we have cultivated development functions through constructing and managing power plants, and strengthened our earnings foundation by furthering project development. At the same time, we regularly ascertain asset prices and the external environment, and make efforts to replace assets and improve asset quality when necessary.
We began initiatives for our renewable energy business by first entering the power generation business in Germany. After this, we entered the Japanese solar power generation business in 2013, and are developing and constructing 12 solar power plants in Japan, nine of which had begun operations by the end of March 2019.
In addition, we have cultivated comprehensive development functions through our Japanese business, and are applying these overseas to steadily expand our business fields: we are entering solar power in Mexico, Chile, and Peru, and on-shore wind power in Ireland and the U.S. Since April 2019, we have also started initiatives for off-shore wind
power generation in Taiwan and biomass power generation in Hokkaido.
In this way, we are making use of local characteristics such as solar power, on-shore and off-shore wind power, and biomass, engaging in lateral development, and steadily advancing initiatives to diversify electrical power sources. In so doing, we will form balanced renewable energy assets all over the world, from which we anticipate stable earnings.

We will continue our efforts to further strengthen our earnings foundation by making use of our integrated development functions, from identifying a project to commercializing it, promoting entry into regions in which we anticipate growth in the renewable energy market, including off-shore wind power generation, and developing new projects.
Due to the evolution of new technology, business models in the field of energy are constantly changing. In response to these changes, we established the Social Infrastructure Development Office in the Energy & Social Infrastructure Division; through this, we are promoting an approach based on the field of ICT to enable us to improve the efficiency of our energy use and to respond to social issues, including measures to address the aging of

More specifically, we are taking on the challenge of new electrical power projects that are more rooted in the regions and can respond to the needs of a variety of users—for example, constructing a microgrid* that makes use of distributed network technology— which we hope will further enhance our business earnings capacity.
In this way, we will make use of the networks and

Initiatives for sustainable growth
Vietnam is continuing to experience strong economic growth. Its middle class is growing as the standard of living improves, and the modernization of lifestyles, together with the modernization of forms of distribution and retail, is rapidly progressing. In this context, Sojitz launched a retail business through its convenience store management business in 2015; in 2017 we made use of this to start producing and selling daily/prepared food. We have taken advantage of the high-performance logistics infrastructure of our wholesale food business, which we took on in 2008, and of our four temperature logistics business, which we started in 2016, and are creating food logistics functions from production to retail. In addition, in 2018, we formed a strategic business alliance with The Pan Group Joint Stock Company (PAN), a major food and agribusiness company in Vietnam. Aiming to improve food quality and achieve affluent lifestyles, we are focusing our efforts on creating new businesses relating to farming and food processing.

SGP is a market-leading manufacturer of household
paper products, which include tissues and toilet paper, and is widely recognized and trusted throughout Vietnam for its high quality. The company also boasts a top-class track record in the industrial paper sector; approximately 60% of the old paper supply used as a raw material for its containerboard is obtained through the company’s own paper recycling centers, making it a recycling-based business striving to reduce its impact on the environment. Sojitz is taking on the responsibility of supporting fundraising and investment capital and strengthening organizational systems, and is forming policies to drive the expansion of business areas with a view to cooperating with trading partners in the future.
In this way, we have contributed to the development of Vietnam over many years through our wide-ranging businesses. We will utilize our experiences of managing these businesses and our management expertise in developing businesses all around the world, and continue to be helpful to the daily lives of the people of Vietnam.

 Systems to Promote and Implement Sustainability
To promote management that incorporates a sustainability perspective, we established the Sustainability Committee, headed by the CEO. This committee decides sustainability-related policies and targets for the whole Company, constructs and maintains systems to implement them, and monitors the progress and status of each policy. The policies and issues discussed by the Sustainability Committee are also submitted or reported to the Management Committee and the Board of Directors, based on specified criteria. The Board of Directors supervises this process, and gives directives as necessary.
In the year ended March 2019, the committee met five times, and held discussions on matters such as environmental issues, including climate change; policies and risk management systems to address social issues, including human rights; and policies for social contribution activities. They also monitored our progress towards our targets. In addition, COOs of each business division and members of the Sustainability Committee had the opportunity to discuss the medium and long-term risks and opportunities presented by external trends and environmental and social
issues for the sustained growth of Sojitz’s business divisions. These discussions helped to ensure that the business strategies of each division are in alignment with company-wide sustainability practices.

Stakeholder Dialogue
As environmental and social issues continue to become more acute on a global scale, we make a point of holding regular dialogues between management and our external stakeholders to enable us to reflect our stakeholders‘ opinions and their expectations for us in our Group’s initiatives. In the year ended March 2019, we invited experts in the environmental, social, and governance-related fields to exchange opinions on climate change and human rights, which are the themes of Sojitz Group’s Sustainability Challenge.
Through these dialogues, we have received a variety of opinions and points to note that will help improve our sustainable company management and company value, including the necessity of understanding continuous social trends and ensuring the objectivity of our sustainability, and, based on this, the importance of commitment and disclosure from top management.

Initiatives for Low Carbon and Decarbonization
   Environment
 Our Group is ”working to achieve a decarbonized society through our business activities” as set out in the “Sustainability Challenge“, and we are promoting initiatives that link business to measures against climate change, such as our renewable energy business. These initiatives are based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement adopted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2015. In August 2018, we declared our endorsement of the final recommendations of the TCFD*1 and are striving to
Status of Initiatives According to the TCFD Framework
Governance
We scrutinize climate-related risks and opportunities and discuss their influence on our business strategies based on promotion and implementation systems centered on the Sustainability Committee (Committee Head: CEO).
The details of these proceedings are regularly reported to the Management Committee and the Board of Directors, and the latter supervise and give direction when necessary.
Strategy
cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders, proactively disclose information, and improve our transparency.
*1 The TCFD recommends disclosure in relation to risks and opportunities linked to climate change in terms of four themes: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
Risk Management
We assess and identify the CO2 emissions risk of each of our Group-operated businesses by using external investigations by third parties which cover the greenhouse gas emissions statistics by industry, alternative technology trends, and policy and regulatory trends.
In addition to the deliberation process for investments and loans that involves managing individual business risks, we also hold regular meetings between our business divisions and management to discuss and assess the effect of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses.
      Based on external investigations and internal analysis, we are working on sequential scenario analysis of the business fields believed to present the greatest risks and opportunities to our Group’s business activities, management strategy, and financial planning. The scenario analysis is then analysed to determine financial impact. *2

Coal interests business
Demand and price forecasting is conducted based on a number of assumed scenarios by 2040, including the 2°C scenario, followed by analyzing the value of Sojitz’s assets
- Our thermal and coking coal businesses have a certain cost competitiveness
- Even in the scenario that might influence asset value, the effect on Sojitz businesses is limited
Power generation business
Analyzing the cost influence of Sojitz’s assets accompanying an anticipated increase in environmental taxes conducted based on a number of assumed scenarios by 2040, including the 2°C scenario
- We have confirmed the cost resilience of our assets
- We have made predictions to enable us to respond to conditions,

 Initiatives Respecting Human Rights, Including Our Supply Chains
 Human Rights
 In developing a wide range of companies across the globe, the Sojitz Group supports the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and is promoting initiatives that respect human rights in regard to business, in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Risk Assessment and Approach to Prioritization
In the year ended March 2019, we organized prioritization within our risk assessments to promote the reduction of environmental and social (human rights) risks in a more systematic manner.
- We have analyzed business fields that typically present high risks based on case studies of environmental and human rights risks that have occurred around the world since 2000; information on these cases come from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, a British NGO. Based on this analysis, we adjusted our approach to prioritization for both Group companies and suppliers.
- In terms of our Group companies, all of our businesses will be subject to risk assessment and improvements regardless of country, but we will especially prioritize businesses we predict will have a major impact on the environment and society (human rights).
- We will prioritize and focus on suppliers starting with high-risk fields of business, regardless of transaction amounts or revenue. As environmental and social risks exist

Promoting Sustainable, Responsible Procurement
 Sojitz Group established the Sojitz Group Wood Procurement Policy, and, together with various suppliers, we are striving to achieve sustainable wood procurement that is both environmentally-conscious and respects human rights. In the year ended March 2019, the results of a survey showed that 0% of our wood was lacking traceability (Level D), meaning that we reached our target for FY 2020 ahead of time. *1
In addition to wood, we are working to gain certification for a variety of products that require further consideration when it comes to sustainable procurement. *2
*1 For more details about our wood procurement initiatives, please see the Sojitz website: https://www.sojitz.com/en/csr/supply/lumber/

Human Resources
Working to Maximize Employee Capabilities
 Basic Approach on Human Resource Strategy
At the Sojitz group, the value we create as a company is directly tied to our greatest asset—our people. The Sojitz Group will create new value and businesses amidst diverse people, cultures, and values, and advance our activities by developing Sojitz people who can create “two types of value,”—value for Sojitz and value for society. Under Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 (hereinafter “MTP 2020”), Sojitz is pursuing sustainable growth through maintaining current earnings foundations, strengthening business functions and continuing to invest with an eye to further growth.
Maximizing the potential of our human resources through a consistent and sound human resource strategy is essential to achieving sustained growth, while strengthening governance and managing risks. Particularly, we aim to develop people who can respond to the rapidly changing business environment with a sense of speed, create something from scratch using their creativity and innovation, boldly take on challenges in new domains and industries, and persevere until successful with resolute determination.
Challenges in Sojitz’s Human Resource management initiatives and HR strategy in the MTP 2020
One major challenge we are facing for our human resource management is that we have not reached our targeted number of employees in their late 30s to early 40s, i.e., candidates eligible to take a leading role and become the next generation of managers. Therefore we must accelerate efforts to develop employee who will be responsible for sustained growth and expanding our earnings for our next medium-term plan. Specifically, we are reviewing the ways in which we have worked in the past, in hopes of raising efficiency and productivity to create additional time that can be reallocated to new business creation, and to improve individual and organizational capabilities by stimulating inter-organizational communication so we can accumulate, share, and use our expertise throughout our organizations.
The human resource strategy under our MTP 2020 focuses on three main areas: diversity management, work style reforms and the development of future leaders. We will improve the quality and productivity of work by promoting diversity to ensure that all employees respect and leverage their individuality and work with enthusiasm. Reforming how we work will also support the physical and mental health of each and every one of our employees. Furthermore, for the development of future leaders, we will cultivate talented individuals who can support business management by providing platforms for taking on new challenges. We will strive to achieve sustainable growth by connecting these efforts to maximizing employee potential and creating innovation.

HOW WE GET THERE
Human Resources
With all our employees exceling with their individual strengths, we will achieve “New way,
New value” through engaging with new ideas and challenges.
Approach to diversity management
Sojitz Group employees are the source of our value creation, and our diversity management efforts seek to capitalize on our diverse individuality. With respect for diversity as our foundation, we are fostering a culture and creating structures for diversity promotion based on the twin pillars of work-life management, allowing employees to independently enrich their personal and work lives; and diversity management, which allows us to harness the diverse strengths of individuals.
Aiming to strengthen our earnings capacity and create an environment where diverse human resources can perform to the best of their capabilities while maintaining a healthy mind and body.
Improving productivity
In order to reduce long working hours and increase productivity, we are formulating meeting rules (clarifying meeting aims and agendas, implementing a 40-minute internal meeting rule), implementing an improvement project in all our departments utilizing an employee survey, and making use of IT tools. With these initiatives, we aim to streamline our business through daily improvements. We are also promoting the introduction of systems that provide people with flexible choices of working times and places, without being constrained by our previous way of working. We strive to create an environment in which people can independently chose their workstyles, enabling them to work according the specific characteristics of where they work—such the conditions in the field or to accommodate a wide range of clients—through our super flex system with no fixed core hours and the company-wide teleworking trial, for instance.
Maintaining and promoting employee health
The physical and mental health of our employees and their families is important to maintaining high levels of motivation for work. Aiming to maintain and promote health across the Group, we are continuing to implement policies in accordance with “Sojitz Healthy Value,” the Sojitz Group charter to protect and improve employee health throughout the Company. In the year ended March 2019, we achieved 100% of our employees having heath checks to encourage the prevention and early detection of disease, and were recognized as a Certified Health & Productivity Management Organization (White 500), a commendation for companies that practice excellent health management. From now on, we will continue to enhance systems that offer support from both a physical and mental health perspective.

We strive to disseminate messages from the Management, give career training, and offer diversity training for managers, in addition to hosting seminars and private consultations for working parents and employees who have returned to work after childcare leave, implementing policies that create a flexible environment to support women in balancing both work and childcare, and increase in the number of male employees who take childcare leave.
These initiatives have been recognized, and we have been selected as a Nadeshiko Brand company for the third year running, and as a constituent of the MSCI Japan Empowering Women Index “WIN” for the third year running. In October 2018 we also became the first General Trading Company to join the IkuBoss Corporate Alliance, run by the non-profit organization Fathering Japan, so we can support the diverse working styles of young employees by raising awareness among Managers. We are implementing the IkuBoss Declaration and striving to disseminate it throughout the Company.

We are taking on the challenge of business growth by having young and energetic employees gain experience in our operating companies.
Actions to improve business management capabilities
To expand our business, which is made up of over 400 Group companies around the world, we face the challenge of developing future leaders who can manage the operating companies in which we have invested and steadily accumulate earnings. To this end, we provide opportunities for highly motivated and competent employees, regardless of age, to gain early experience in business management and decision-making in difficult situations, giving experience managing Group companies from when they are in their 30s. We offer selective training in our head office for employees who have demonstrated repeated growth in various business areas. This will accelerate the development of future leaders of our Group.
Business leaders and Corporate leaders to manage Group companies
To enable continuous and stable business management, we are training our successors through cooperation with corporate departments and those on the business front lines. We identify candidates according to the needs of each business environment, and are stationing staff across all divisions as required. In so doing, we strive to increase the skills of operating company management staff and advance diversification across the whole company.
Regarding core corporate employees, in addition to giving them more opportunities to handle Group company business by relocating them to operating companies. We are also increasing opportunities for them to build experience as part-time directors or Audit & Supervisory Board members at operating companies in Japan and overseas. Once they return to the head office from the operating companies, we make use of their experiences in Tokyo HQ. In this way, we have constructed a continuous cycle that leads to the development of corporate staff.

Message from the Chairman
We will pursue the kind of corporate governance expected of Sojitz Group in its current growth phase.
Takashi Hara Chairman of the Board
I assumed the post of Chairman of the Board in June this year. Using my seven years of experience as Representative Director, Vice Chairman, I will work to reinforce governance as Chairman—a role which no longer has the power of a Representative Director to enable us to clearly separate business execution from governance.
Right now, Sojitz is at the stage where we are taking on new challenges aimed at sustained growth and actively working to expand our businesses. We see these changing times as an opportunity for growth, and in order to steadily expand, it is crucial that we have a system in which fast management decisions can be made while simultaneously identifying and addressing mid- to long-term risks. Under such a system, we strike a balance between business execution and oversight.
In recognition of this need, the company established the Internal Audit Committee under the Board of Directors last year, to lead the Internal Audit Department. This organizational structure ensures that Internal Audit Department can voice opinions in a manner that is independent from business execution. As the Chairman of the Internal Audit Committee, my duties go beyond evaluating audit results. If there are findings that a certain business must address, instead of providing instruction only to the specific organization in question, I issue instructions to all organizations as necessary, to prevent any reoccurrences of the issue. I also make a point of visiting our overseas affiliates, operating companies, and other Group companies to educate staff. Incidentally, based on my experiences in the
course of many years as a public relations officer at a financial institution, I focus on ensuring that I myself am attuned to changes in the values of society in order to prevent the organization’s internal ethics from going against social conventions. Additionally, when I visit Group companies, I make an effort to meet employees face-to-face so I can check their morale. These are just some of the ways we are continuing to strengthen our supervisory functions, including those for overseas Group companies.
We will also continue to strengthen the functions of the Board Meeting Operation Office established in April 2019 as part of our continued efforts to increase the productivity and transparency of the Board of Directors. The Board Meeting Operation Office discusses matters with our outside directors before Board of Directors meetings, and we are working on ways to provide our outside directors with more specific information through greater opportunities to observe company functions, in addition to these discussions. In this way, we hope to encourage our outside directors to actively contribute opinions at the Board of Directors meetings.
To strengthen governance, we need every single employee that carries out our various policies to have high morale. I believe my mission is to get all employees to fully understand that strengthening governance to gain disciplined, highly-transparent organizational management and a refreshing human resources policy is the cornerstone to achieving the “two types of value” that Sojitz strives to realize. To make that possible, I will do my best to leverage my years of experience and tackle this new challenge.

HOW WE GET THERE
Special Feature An interview with our Outside Directors
  Increasing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Yamazaki: It’s been four years since Japan’s corporate governance code was enacted. These days, it is not enough to simply meet the formal requirements for governance. We are in an age where outside directors in particular are evaluated on their effectiveness in increasing corporate value; in other words, how they monitor and provide management oversight on behalf of shareholder interests. Ms. Naito and Mr. Otsuka, you were both appointed as outside directors last year. Looking back over the past year, what are your impressions of Sojitz‘s governance?
Naito: The first thing I noticed is that many people at Sojitz recognize the importance of governance. The Board of Directors actively discusses issues from the perspective of both profitability and risk, possibly because of the management crisis that they had to overcome in the past.
Otsuka: Yes, I agree. I was also impressed by the disciplined management of board meetings.
Yamazaki: Did you ever raise a dissenting opinion in any of the various decision-making sessions?
Naito: A general trading company does business in a wide variety of areas. Therefore, when I take part in the Board of Directors meetings, I always ask myself: “Have we overlooked anything?” I also make a point of asking questions to clarify anything that was unclear. We received explanations in advance, and these helped my understanding. Fortunately, I never saw any major problems with the decisions being made.
Otsuka: Audit & Supervisory Board members at Sojitz have a very firm grasp of their role. They are aware of what new directors like us do not know, and they explain circumstances to us in advance. So as far as internal controls go, I think this is an excellent organization. Yamazaki: It is extremely important for outside directors to receive sufficient information about the company. When and how does this take place specifically?
Naito: Sojitz has an Internal Audit Committee that operates independently from the organizations in charge
of business execution. This committee reports its activities to us at the Board of Directors’ meetings, where we then have the opportunity to share our opinions. We are also encouraged to observe councils that specialize in different issues such as the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council and the Sustainability Committee.
Otsuka: Although I could understand the business of a general trading company on a conceptual level given my manufacturing background, in practical terms, I did not know the process of who made decisions or how they were made at a general trading company. It is therefore extremely helpful for me to be informed of the actual situation on the ground when deliberating issues at committee meetings.
Naito: I’ve been in many situations where deliberations continued without the problem at hand being resolved, or where the issues had to be sent back to the proposing department.
Otsuka: The briefings before the Board of Directors meetings are very helpful. Since we understand the background of the issues, we are able to take part actively in meetings instead of listening passively. Yamazaki: I believe that these measures put in place to increase the effectiveness of the Board of Directors should be applauded.
Visiting business sites to detect potential issues
Yamazaki: On the other hand, do you have any concerns in fulfilling your duties, or are there any issues you feel could be improved upon?
Otsuka: Sojitz has full-time Audit & Supervisory Board members who visit sites in Japan and abroad, but I think it would be helpful if outside directors had more opportunities to visit business sites as well. A lot of informal conversation takes place at business sites. Even a casual conversation can reveal things about the workplace’s level of motivation or tension, and I think we could use that information when making management decisions.
Naito: Yes, I agree. I’m especially interested in learning how women’s performance is contributing to growth. Yamazaki: Sojitz is making great strides with diversity management, so if we can take part in the daily communication between employees, including conversations with women and foreign workers, we might be able to catch a glimpse of the potential of future business or possible conflicts. Furthermore, any opinions from outside directors that are based on actual observations help shareholders and investors to learn more about employee motivation, the actual state of
 48 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 affairs, and the level of trust Sojitz has earned from society, which is valuable input for them as well.
Evaluating the new executive remuneration system
Yamazaki: What do you think of the new executive officer remuneration system that was introduced this year? Remuneration is a big governance issue for Japanese companies, not just Sojitz, and there a lot of questions about whether remuneration should be determined by set rules without the consensus of executives, and whether it will be a suitable incentive to improve financial results.
Naito: We did create the remuneration system with certain rules in mind. Since FY2018 was the first fiscal year after the system was introduced, we focused mainly on ensuring that it was running as planned. However, since we received a number of questions and opinions, such as “How are contributions to sustainability evaluated?”, we are already working together with the Secretariat to discuss ways to improve the system. Otsuka: We want to take the initiative to change anything that needs to be changed. But since we need to work in tandem with management policies, any major changes will most likely happen in the course of the next medium-term management plan. Moreover, performance-based remuneration affects not only executive officers, but must also be balanced against the Group’s global remuneration structure and its human resources system, so we need to move cautiously in such matters.
Yamazaki: I hope you will be able to adopt the necessary changes to improve effectiveness even further.
Striking a balance between risks and growth opportunities in decision-making
Yamazaki: Lastly, I would like to ask you about Sojitz’s policies going forward. Sojitz has made a series of moves aimed at sustainable growth, such as investing ¥315.0 billion over 3 years under the previous
medium-term management plan. Shareholders and investors are very interested in learning how outside directors will participate in such growth strategies. Otsuka: There is a trend towards hands-on management in the manufacturing industry, so I hope to use my management experience in quality control and other scenarios to contribute as much as possible. Additionally, there are businesses from which we will not see return within the next few years. I will try to determine whether these are businesses that are properly monitored and run with a responsible management structure despite being businesses that carry risk. Furthermore, as the head of the Nomination Committee, I hope to work with the committee members to think about our vision for the Board of Directors and give them encouraging advice.
Naito: I want to support the company in realizing its “two types of value” while focusing on both the opportunities and risks that accompany its growth strategy, taking a broad look at both laws and “soft laws”—that is, international standards and generally accepted ideas such as the SDGs—and helping the company remain what regular members of the international community would consider a healthy company. Furthermore, since decisions will differ depending on whether we are taking a short, medium, or long-term perspective, I want the company to make well-balanced decisions without focusing solely on immediate profits and make irresponsible choices and delegate responsibility to others down the line. Yamazaki: When we think about the society of the future and supply chains, it is extremely difficult to conclude what kind of governance a general trading company will need to both take risks in a wide range of business areas and search for growth opportunities. Despite this, it is clear that Sojitz is putting measures in place to create the kind of culture and structure that allows outside directors, as a third-party, to share their opinions. In a time when people want to know more about how companies are strengthening governance and whether those efforts are effective, I look forward to your future involvement as outside directors who are aware of these issues.

HOW WE GET THERE
Corporate Governance
Improving Effectiveness and Transparency
 Basic Concept
Sojitz strives to improve its corporate value over the medium to long term based on the “Sojitz Group Statement.” (“The Sojitz Group creates value and prosperity by connecting the world with a spirit of integrity.”)
In order to materialize this, based on its belief that the enhancement of its corporate governance is an important issue of management, Sojitz has built the following corporate governance structure in its effort to establish a highly sound, transparent and effective management structure, while
also working toward the fulfillment of its management responsibilities and accountability to its shareholders and other stakeholders.
Board of Directors
1) Management and Business Execution System
Sojitz employs an executive officer system for the purpose
of clarifying authority and responsibilities, and ensuring
the smooth and swift execution of business through the separation of managerial decision-making from business execution. The Board of Directors is the highest decision- making body reviewing and resolving fundamental policies and most important cases concerning the management of the Group. The Board of Directors also supervises business execution through proposals of important matters and regular reports from the executing body. As the executing body, we have established the Management Committee, chaired by
the President, who is also the Chief Executive Officer. The committee is responsible for the review and approval of the Group’s important managerial and executive agendas, from a Group-wide and medium- to long-term viewpoint. In addition, we have established the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council for the review and approval of investments and loans, the Human Resource Deliberation Council for the review
and approval of major human resource matters, and internal committees to handle issues to be addressed from cross- organizational perspectives, as executing bodies all directly reporting to the President & CEO.
The term of Directors and Executive Officers is set to one year, in order to respond swiftly and appropriately to rapid changes in the business environment and clarify their responsibilities to management.
2) Monitoring and Supervisory Functions for Management
Sojitz appoints multiple Outside Directors for the purpose of receiving appropriate advice and proposals on management of the Group from an outside, objective standpoint and to reinforce the supervisory function of the Board of Directors. In addition, we ensure appropriateness and transparency with regard to the appointment of Directors and remuneration by having Outside Directors serve as the chair of the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee, both advisory bodies to the Board of Directors. We have also appointed
a Director who does not hold representative power as the

To further improve the effectiveness of the Board
of Directors' independent and objective supervision over management, we appointed a company director with no right of representation as the chairman of the Board of Directors, creating a structure dedicated to overseeing business execution.
- Establishment of the Board Meeting Operation Office
On April 1, 2019, we established the Board Meeting Operation Office to strengthen the duties of executive offices and assist the Board of Directors to operate effectively with the ultimate aim of increasing the effectiveness of our corporate governance.
  54 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

Chairman of the Board of Directors Meeting, created a management structure which focuses on overseeing business execution, and are working to improve the effectiveness
of the Board of Directors in terms of their ability to provide independent and objective business oversight.
Sojitz is a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, which independently oversees and audits the operations of the Group.
Audit Structure
Audit & Supervisory Board members, accounting auditors and the Audit Department boost the effectiveness of their respective audits by exchanging information to ensure
their efforts are complementary and efficient. The Audit Department is well-versed in the company’s business and performs internal audits based on the structure mentioned below, resulting in the creation of a highly effective audit structure in combination with audits conducted by the Audit & Supervisory Board members and accounting auditors.
Audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Pursuant to the Corporate Audit Standards established by the Audit & Supervisory Board, Audit & Supervisory Board members attend meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings such as those of the Management Committee and the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council. Audit & Supervisory Board members oversee and
audit the operations of the Group based on audit plans and task assignments and perform audits using means such as interviewing directors and other members of senior management regarding business execution, reviewing important documents relevant to major business decisions and checking business reports and other information from subsidiaries.
In addition, Sojitz has established the Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ Office as an auxiliary body to its audit structure. Its staff of full-time employees assists Audit & Supervisory Board members and is independent from the directors to ensure effective performance of duties.
Accounting Audits
Sojitz has appointed the independent auditing firm KPMG AZSA LLC to conduct accounting audits in accordance with the Companies Act, as well as audits of financial statements, quarterly reviews and internal control audits in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
Internal Audits
Internal audits are based on audit plans resolved by the Board of Directors, and mainly cover the business group, corporate departments, and consolidated subsidiaries including major overseas affiliates, commanded by Internal Audit Committee.

Corporate Governance
Structure and Nomination Policy of the Board of Directors

The Nomination Procedure for Company Directors
In line with the above nomination policy, the Board of Directors deliberates on the experience and quality as an officer with respect to each director candidate based on the results of discussion at the Nomination Committee and resolves the candidate proposal for submission to the General Shareholder’s meeting for approval.

Although we have not filed a report to the Tokyo Stock Exchange submitting Mikinao Kitada as an independent director, he meets Sojitz's standards for independence and we have determined that he is sufficiently independent. Sojitz's standards for independence can be found on our website and in the Corporate Governance Report.

 Corporate Governance Report3
     Reason for Selection as an Executive
    Takashi Hara is a highly experienced and accomplished manager, having served as the deputy president of The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. (now MUFG Bank, Ltd.) among other prestigious positions. Since his appointment as a representative director for Sojitz in 2012, he has worked tirelessly to strengthen our governance systems in order to improve the soundness, effectiveness and transparency of our management structure. Since 2018 he has served as the chairman of the Internal Audit Committee. He was elected as a director based on his suitability due to these experiences and achievements.
  Masayoshi Fujimoto was appointed as the representative director, president & CEO of Sojitz in 2017, after serving in other important offices such as the president of one of our companies overseas, the regional general manager of the machinery division in the U.S. and the executive officer in charge of corporate planning. At present he is working hard to improve corporate value and promote initiatives that lead to continuous growth as part of MTP 2020, which has set achieving steady growth and making rapid leaps into the future as its goals. As a result of his achievement, he was elected because it was determined that it would be best to have his leadership as we strive to fulfill the goals of MTP 2020.
      After serving Sojitz in financial affairs for many years, in 2016 Seiichi Tanaka was appointed as CFO, the position of highest responsibility for finances. At the same time, he also assumed the position of chairman of the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council. He has devoted himself wholly to building the solid financial structure that Sojitz will use as a foothold to achieve even greater growth. The decision was therefore taken to retain him as a director in light of his professional achievements, rich experience and expert knowledge.
     Shigeru Nishihara has held a succession of important offices as the executive in charge of a wide variety of business groups and corporate organizations. He is currently the Senior Managing Executive Officer COO, Corporate Planning Department, Corporate Sustainability Office, working hard to ensure the growth of the company. He was appointed because these experiences coupled with his extensive knowledge make him fully capable of carrying out his duties to raise the corporate value of Sojitz.
  Although Kayoko Naito has no experience of direct involvement in company management apart from her appointment as one of Sojitz's outside directors in 2018, as a lawyer she brings with her a significant amount of advanced and specialized knowledge in the fields of corporate law and international law. Her rich experience, track record and insight allow her to offer precise and valuable advice to the Board of Directors from an independent and objective viewpoint separate from the management ranks that carry out the business. Her advice has contributed significantly to the enhancement of Sojitz's corporate governance, and thus the decision was made to appoint her as an outside director.
     As part of a long and storied career, Norio Otsuka served as the director, president and Chief Executive Officer of NSK Ltd., as well as the chairperson of the Board of Directors. His record of pursuing global growth strategies and reinforcing corporate governance have given him a wealth of experience and a high level of knowledge about management. As an outside director, he has fulfilled his duties appropriately by supervising the execution of business and making pertinent recommendations from a pragmatic viewpoint. Thus, the decision was made to retain him as an outside director.
   Junichi Hamatsuka has been heavily involved in finance, accounting and risk management at Sojitz and has also held key posts such as CFO for the Americas. He is a member of board due to his considerable knowledge of finance and accounting that make him suitable for the position.
  Takayuki Ishige supervises the Company’s management and gives appropriate advice within and outside the Board of Directors, from an independent standpoint and objective viewpoint as an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, based on his wealth of knowledge in the areas of finance and accounting, experience in being responsible for duties including management audits, as well as serving as an Audit & Supervisory Board Member at Kao Corporation, and thus has been considered competent and appointed.
      Mikinao Kitada has been considered competent and appointed as he supervises the Company’s management and gives appropriate advice within and outside the Board of Directors, from an independent and objective viewpoint as an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, based on his experience in the judicial field holding important posts as a public prosecutor and as an attorney, as well as serving as an Outside Director and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member at various companies.
  Kazunori Yagi has been considered competent and appointed as he supervises the Company’s management and gives appropriate advice within and outside the Board of Directors, from an independent standpoint and objective viewpoint as an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, based on his experience holding important positions at a Yokogawa Electric Corporation, including roles in accounting, finance, and corporate planning and as a Director. He has also served as an Outside Director at several other companies, and has abundant experience in corporate management, as well as expertise in auditing as a member of the Certified Public Accountants and Auditing Oversight Board.
      Hyo Kambayashi supervises the Company’s management and give appropriate advice within and outside the Board of Directors, from an independent and objective viewpoint as Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, based on his experience holding important positions in audit firms as a certified public accountant, experience and insight as the management of a risk consulting company, along with highly specialized expertise in the area of internal control, and thus has been appointed.

Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Analysis and Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Each year, we analyze and assess the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole in order to improve the functions of the Board of Directors. The results of the analysis and assessment for the year ended March 31, 2019, and the tasks ahead are as follows.
   Analysis & Assessment Method
 A written survey and an individual interview were conducted for all Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The results of this survey were then assessed by a third party (an outside consultant).
The analysis and assessment outcome based on the results of the third-party assessment and individual interviews was reported to the Board of Directors for a discussion on tasks to be addressed.
  Survey Items
 Roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, Composition of the Board of Directors, Management of the Board of Directors, Decision-making process of the Board of Directors, Supervision by the Board of Directors, Support system for the Board of Directors, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee, which are advisory bodies to the Board of Directors, Items concerning outside Directors, and Suggestions for improving effectiveness, etc.
  Outline of Assessment Results
   The aggregated survey results showed that the overall average score exceeded the standard, and the third-party assessment was favorable as detailed below. It is therefore confirmed that the Board of Directors is functioning appropriately and effectively as described below.
  Excerpts from Third-Party Assessment Observations
- From such findings as active discussions led by Outside Officers, appropriate restraints, an excellent description of bills on the agenda, appropriate composition of the Board of Directors and high competence of the secretariat, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of Sojitz‘s Board of Directors is fairly high.

Discussions on governance took place at the meetings of the Board of Directors, showing such a topic is shred among all Board members. This indicates the Board members‘ high dedication to enhancing the governance of the Board.
- It was found that support systems were needed to promote the understanding of items on the agenda and opportunities for communication among Outside Officers.
     Tasks ahead to further increase the effectiveness of the Board
   Based on the results of the above analysis and assessment, Sojitz will continue working to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, such as by conducting regular monitoring of the progress of the Medium-term Management Plan and the operational status of the Nomination Committee; strengthening the alliance between in-house and Outside Directors/Audit & Supervisory Board Members; providing explanations on the strategies of the business divisions and the points of discussion by the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council regarding investment and loan projects; and promoting Outside Directors‘ visits to the sites of Sojitz Group business operations.

Corporate Governance
Holdings of Listed Shares
Policies for Shareholdings
Each year, we conduct a quantitative assessment of listed shares held in each company as part of our shareholding policy to ensure that dividends or related profit earned
from those shares exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). We also conduct a qualitative assessment, looking at whether the shares help improve our corporate value. Based on these assessments, we examine the value of retaining these shares. We retain those that are deemed to be worthwhile, seeking ways to achieve greater impact and benefit from those shares. Meanwhile, for those shares which are deemed to now lack significant value, we set a deadline
Internal Controls
Sojitz endeavors to implement internal control systems
in accordance with the Basic Policy Regarding the Establishment of Systems for Ensuring Appropriate Execution of Sojitz Group Business Operations, which

Specific measures in each area are handled by the relevant committees (Compliance Committee, Sustainability Committee, etc.) and subcommittees (Disclosure Subcommittee, Information Security Subcommittee, etc.) in addition to the risk management framework.
In addition, pursuant to the internal controls reporting system set out in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, Sojitz has instituted a Basic Policy to Ensure Appropriate Financial Reporting, and the Internal Control Committee monitors the progress of assessments of internal controls over financial reporting to improve the reliability of financial reporting. The Internal Control Committee met five times in the year ended March 31, 2019, and reported the details of its meetings to the Board of Directors.
to improve their value; or if there is no indication these shares will improve, we examine the possibility of divestiture.
The Board of Directors and the Management Committee conducts this assessment for each lot of shares held in each company.
Exercising of Voting Rights
Based on the significance of holding shares of listed companies, we exercise our voting rights based on whether or not they contribute to sustainable growth and improved corporate value over the medium to long term for both the Company and the investment target. We also have a system of monitoring the status of exercise of voting rights.

Compliance
Basic Compliance Policy
The Sojitz Group has established the Sojitz Group Compliance Program, which sets out procedures for achieving thorough compliance, and has also formulated the Sojitz Group Code of Conduct and Ethics, which provides common criteria for conduct that applies to Group officers and employees globally.
The Compliance Committee, chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), is at the core of the Group-wide compliance system to ensure adherence to laws, regulations and corporate ethics, which includes measures such as appointing compliance supervisors and forming compliance committees at Group companies and overseas operating sites. Moreover, to help prevent or quickly detect violations of compliance regulations, Sojitz has a hotline (internal reporting system) that provides access to the CCO and outside legal counsel; a consultation desk where committee secretariat members can be contacted; and the multi-lingual Sojitz Ethics Hotline, which is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. All Sojitz Group employees are informed about these systems. In addition, to prevent corruption, Sojitz has established the Sojitz Group Anti-Corruption Policy and
the Sojitz Group Anti-Corruption Guidelines, and is also introducing corresponding regulations at overseas Group companies and bases. Furthermore, subject to the Child Care and Family Care Leave Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, business owners are obligated to prevent sexual harassment and harassment pertaining to pregnancy, childbirth, childcare and nursing care leave, and other such
Security Trade Control
To maintain international peace and security, the Sojitz Group is adamantly opposed to acts of terrorism and the development of conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and we have taken all the necessary measures
to oppose any threats to world security. Furthermore, to respond to the rising destabilization of world affairs in recent times, increasing geopolitical risks and the influence of
these uncertainties on the Group‘s environment, we spun
off the Security Trade Control Subcommittee, which was under the jurisdiction of the Compliance Committee, and renamed it the Security Trade Control Committee in order
to strengthen our initiatives. Along with this move, we also formulated the new Sojitz Group Basic Policy on Sanctions and Export Controls to serve as the Group‘s basic policy
on the preservation of international peace and security and to comply with and prevent violations of export transaction regulations and legal sanctions in all countries. Through this policy, the Sojitz Group will strive to protect world peace while complying with all laws and regulations.
matters. Sojitz has continued with its activities in establishing systems as well as holding trainings, etc., in order to maintain positive workplaces that are free from all such harassments. We also endeavor to protect personal information. In addition to abiding by Japan‘s Act on the Protection of Personal Information, we were also quick to comply with
the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that was issued in May 2018.
Moreover, based on the action plan formulated by
the Compliance Committee, Sojitz provides counsel on measures for preventing recurrence of compliance issues
as well as assistance and guidance to Group companies on implementing the code. Specific activities in the year ended March 31, 2019 included the following:
• Discussions and exchange of ideas between CCO and presidents of Group companies
• Regular liaison meetings among the compliance officers of Group companies
• E-learning programs on the Sojitz Group Code of Conduct and Ethics for executives and staff
• E-learning program on EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for officers and employees
• Seminars and briefings on preventing harassment and corruption • Training programs for new employees, newly-hired mid-career professionals, employees on overseas assignments, and others

Risk Management
Basic Policies of Risk Management
As a general trading company, the Sojitz Group is engaged in a diverse and globally dispersed range of businesses. Due to the nature of its businesses, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks. In compliance with its Basic Code of Corporate Risk Management, the Sojitz Group defines and categorizes risks, and manages them according to the nature of each risk. For quantifiable risks such as market risks, credit risks, business investment risks and country risks, risk assets are calculated and reported to management. Non-quantifiable risks, such as legal risks, compliance risks, environmental and social (human rights) risks, funding risks, disaster and other risks and system
Risk Measurement and Control
The goals of risk measurement are (1) to manage risk assets within the strength of the Company (total equity), and (2)
to maximize earnings in line with the level of risk exposure. Based on that recognition, the Sojitz Group manages risks with a focus on both stability and profitability. The Sojitz Group’s objective for risk control is to keep the ratio of risk assets to total equity within 1.0 time. This ratio has been 0.6 time for the past five years, well within the target value. As we pursue disciplined investment under MTP 2020, since March 2019 we have been revising our method of measurement, mainly of goodwill, to make it more suitable for growth investment. Risk assets are measured quarterly and reported to the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, and each business department receives the results of analysis of the change for application in risk management activities. The Sojitz Group plans to continue its risk control efforts
to maintain the ratio within 1.0 time, even as the operating environment grows increasingly uncertain.
The external environment affecting the Sojitz Group’s businesses is constantly changing, with uncertainty in global
risks, are managed in the same manner as quantifiable risks, with the status of the risks and other issues being reported to management based on the Risk Management Policy and Plan formulated by the COOs of the divisions responsible for managing those risks.
In MTP 2020, we have added and are monitoring risks related to the use of websites or SNS and other media (such as those requiring crisis management or efforts to protect personal information) and risks related to product quality control (new quality control measures arising from diversification of the areas in which we do business).
politics, geopolitical risk, macroeconomic conditions and volatility in markets all on the increase. The Sojitz Group promptly conducts appropriate risk management for this external environment. As a specific response, risk assets are calculated factoring in stress to stock price and exchange rate volatility and country credit ratings, and the ratio of risk assets to total equity is monitored to remain within 1.0 time even under stress conditions. In addition, as a countermeasure to tail risk, Sojitz analyzes the impact on its business portfolio under stress scenarios.
  Implementation status of risk management training
Sojitz organizes yearly training for all its employees with the objective to foster a thorough risk management mindset.
• Participants (total number): 2,370 (as of the end of March
2019)
• Training contents: Spreading awareness about rules, case
studies, measures for preventing/reducing credit/country risks or market risks, such as inventory transactions, and others

- For risk associated with deferred payments, loans, and credit guarantees, periodically assesses whether profitability is commensurate with risk, and
takes steps to improve profitability or limit credit risk.
       Business investment risks
- The Group closely examines business plans and carefully assesses feasibility when deliberating on investment projects. The Group also sets hurdle rates using internal rate of return (IRR) and selects those projects where profitability is commensurate with risk.
- After investment, in order to ascertain issues at an early stage and minimize loss from withdrawal or restructuring, the Group sets conditions for withdrawal and determines whether projects meet these conditions.
       Country risks
- The Group assigns country risk ratings and sets net exposure limits to avoid concentrated exposure to any single country or region.
- In countries that pose substantial country risk, the Group hedges against country risk on a transaction-by-transaction basis, through such means as
purchasing trade insurance.
  Difficult-to-quantify risks
  Funding risks
- The Group ensures stable funding by maintaining good business relationships with financial institutions and by keeping the long-term debt ratio at a specified level.
- To provide additional financial flexibility and liquidity, the Group maintains long-term commitment lines and a long-term multi-currency borrowing facility agreement with effective period provisions.
       Risks related to environment/ society (human rights)
- The Group sets a long-term vision and objectives regarding Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality), covering the duration of the Medium-term Management Plan 2020. The Sustainability Committee oversees progress on these objectives, and the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council confirms environmental risks, social risks, and other risks related to sustainability when deliberating on potential finance and investment projects.
- Additionally, the Group has established an Environmental Policy, Human Rights Policy, and CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains. It works
to mitigate risk by ensuring these policies are observed throughout the Group, sharing them with suppliers, conducting risk assessments, and working to fix discovered issues. For climate-related risks, the Group pays close attention to government policies and regulatory trends worldwide, analyzing their impact on the Group‘s business.
        Legal and compliance risks/ Litigation risks
- The Group has formulated a compliance program and has established the Sojitz Group Code of Conduct and Ethics. The Compliance Committee promotes rigorous regulatory compliance on a Group-wide basis.
        Information system and information security risks
- The Group has prescribed regulations and established oversight entities, mainly the Information Security Subcommittee, pertaining to the appropriate protection and management of information assets.
- The Group has implemented safeguards, such as installation of backup hardware, to protect against failure of key information systems and network infrastructure. Additionally, the Group is strengthening its safeguards against information leaks through such means as installing firewalls and taking other steps to prevent unauthorized access by outsiders, implementing antivirus measures, and utilizing encryption technologies.
        Disaster risks
- The Group has prepared disaster response manuals, conducts disaster response drills, and has established an employee safety confirmation system and a business continuity plan.
- The Group monitors and has set administrative guidelines for the terms of use and protection of personal information on Sojitz Corporation and Sojitz Group companies‘ official websites and SNS accounts.
- As Sojitz Group‘s business investments bring more manufacturing business and other new sectors under the Group umbrella, the Group monitors the status of systems for controlling quality of manufactured products, etc.

   Business Models Supporting Value Creation
        External Environment
Opportunities
• Long-term increase in demand
for automobiles due to economic development in emerging countries
• Increase in demand for new businesses, such as quality assurance businesses, due to development,
as well as production and sales becoming more borderless
• Rising need for multi-modal transport as supply chains grow more complex
Risks
• Country risk due to political, economic, or social changes in emerging countries where demand is rising
• Changes in international strategies of automobile makers
• Changes in demand trends due to diversification of needs and rapid changes in social environment, including strengthening of environmental regulations and developments in autonomous driving technology
Businesses
Businesses that strengthen and refine existing core businesses
We are developing automobile assembly and wholesale businesses in Thailand, Puerto Rico, Russia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. We are also providing high-value-added services integrated with complex logistics services in Japan and overseas, as well as trading automobile and two- wheeled vehicle parts with the Asian market, which we expect to grow in the future.
• Distributor business • Autrans business
Businesses that establish new revenue sources
We are developing our dealership business in the U.S., Brazil, Russia, and Japan, bringing in continuous revenue from the services provided by each dealership to build an earnings foundation that is not influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Sojitz is also further enhancing the business models which generate profit from the Automotive Division’s strong functions—the automobile parts trading, logistics, and assembly businesses, among others. We are planning to expand the scope of our Autrans business, and in 2017 we also joined a quality assurance business in North America.
• Dealership business • Parts quality assurance business
Businesses in preparation for future growth
Utilizing the expertise we have cultivated through our vehicle sales business, we are developing an auto-financing business to help facilitate automobile purchases in emerging countries, as well as FinTech services that incorporate advanced technology such as AI and the IoT.

Growth Strategy
We anticipate rising demand for automobiles in emerging nations within Asia and South America in particular, given the increasingly active movement of people and goods which has accompanied their economic development. Meanwhile, waves of great change are sweeping over developed countries, mainly in Europe and North America, with the introduction of ride-sharing services and technological innovations such as electric vehicles and autonomous cars.
These factors have led the Automotive Division to expect ¥30.0 billion in investment during MTP 2020. We have accumulated a wealth of dealership knowledge and experience, with us positioning the business as a stable earnings foundation for the company. We aim to further increase the value of the business by conducting new M&A of top dealerships located in the promising markets where we already do business, like the U.S. and Brazil, and expanding our maintenance services, sales of parts and pre-owned vehicles, in addition to sales of new vehicles.
We are also actively focusing on strengthening new functions. We are working not only on our auto financing business, but also our automotive parts quality assurance business, for which demand continues to increase as supply chains grow more diverse.
In addition, the division is making efforts to develop personnel capable of corporate management by having employees amass frontlines experience through management of operating companies that contribute to local communities. We are aiming to develop personnel who can create new businesses and functions in response to changes in the automobile industry, in pursuit of sustained growth.
Hyundai distributor business
Sojitz has many years of experience assembling and selling Hyundai automobiles, and our distributor management function has enjoyed high praise from Hyundai Motor Company. After our success
in Puerto Rico and Thailand, we joined another distributor business in 2018. This distributor in
the 200-million-strong Pakistan market includes CKD* production, setting it apart from our other distributor businesses.
* Complete Knock Down: A production method that involves importing and assembling all the parts that make up an automobile and sale in the local area.
Automotive parts quality assurance business
Together with Green Tec Corporation, the largest automotive quality assurance provider in Japan, Sojitz acquired full management rights to Stratosphere Quality LLC (Indiana), the largest quality assurance company in the U.S. We will maintain the company‘s stable earnings structure, harnessing its customer base of roughly 3,000 companies in North America, while striving to expand the business in the U.S. and develop into Europe and Asia.
Autrans business
The Autrans business joins our automobile/two-wheeled vehicle supply chain management functions with a high value-added, multimodal logistics service that combines financing, just-in- time manufacturing, inspection services, VMI*, and easy assembly. We have established locations in Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, and even India, and we are expanding our services further into Asia.
* Vendor Managed Inventory: A method wherein the parts supplier owns the parts inventory on behalf of the client,
replenishing the inventory based on forecasted client demand.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Although we were impacted by depreciation of the Russian ruble, we exceeded initial targets thanks to increased demand for automobiles, particularly in emerging countries, and steady earnings contributions from our automobile dealership businesses in domestic and overseas and other sources.

Growth Strategy
The market is expected to expand due to both anticipated growth in worldwide demand for aircraft and transportation/airport infrastructure, as well as the approaching Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
The mission of our division is to create solutions incorporating our railway and marine vessel businesses that provide new value in response to the needs of the international community, while building on our trust cultivated over many years in the aviation sector, working with aircraft manufacturers, airline companies, and airport operators.
Our approach is to first expand the value chain for our aircraft business based on our excellent track record acting as distributor for passenger aircraft in Japan, to build new foundations for earning. Our part-out business, which sells second-hand parts from decommissioned and aged aircraft to airlines and aircraft maintenance companies, exemplifies this approach. As part of efforts to come
up with new products and stronger services, our division is actively working to improve our business jet services, for which demand is growing worldwide. In addition, we are developing transportation infrastructure centered on airport management and working on businesses that help revitalize local communities in Japan and overseas, particularly in emerging countries. By developing secondary modes of transportation centered around airports, such as railways and vessels, as well as shopping centers, accommodations, and industrial parks in the surrounding areas, we will add value and bring new life to regional infrastructure in a way that only the Sojitz Group can.
Part-out business of retired and aged aircraft
We will expand business activities by leveraging our networks and expertise to further strengthen our earnings foundation, with the aim of scaling-up our part-out business of retired and aged aircraft. We are also deepening our relationships with our partners in Europe and the Americas, and we aim to construct and acquire more robust business platforms through M&A and investments in industry players.
Transportation infrastructure business
Our EPC initiatives, exemplified by our Indian railway project, are performing steadily, and the Canadian MRO company in which we invested in 2015 is also continuing to ensure steady earnings for our North American railway business. Our goal from now on is to strategically diversify our regional partner scheme and to stabilize our earnings.
Business jet services
We are accumulating projects targeting new and existing customers and steadily increasing the scale of our business. Through such initiatives as the Phenix Jet Group, in which we began investing in 2017, and a new venture with ANA Holdings, with which we began collaborating in 2018, we are creating high value-added services with the goal of further increasing our earnings.
Airport management business
We are actively involved in airport management business, both overseas (Palau and Khabarovsk) and in Japan (Shimojishima, Kumamoto, and elsewhere), and we are using the experience gained from these businesses to strengthen our airport management and operation functions. We are also engaged in M&A of airport-related businesses and are working to expand distribution services as we seek to expand our earnings foundation through synergy with other Sojitz Group businesses.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Our aircraft-related businesses remained strong, and there was steady progress on the construction of the freight railway in India. Generally, everything progressed as planned.

Growth Strategy
The energy situation around the world is facing a major turning point due to interplay between key regional shifts in supply and demand and the movement towards decarbonization. In terms of supply, the U.S. has become a major player following the shale gas revolution; on the demand side, we believe that the tide of decarbonization will trigger a rapid spread in use of natural gas, LNG, and renewable energy, as China, India, and emerging countries in Asia take the lead in driving future growth.
Experts anticipate that Gas-To-Power will become the pillar that supports expanding energy demand in emerging countries in Asia. This has led us to position it as a core business for the division, which we hope to expand by integrating our experience in LNG businesses and gas-fired power plant PPP/PFI*5 businesses. We are also managing a cutting-edge, high-efficiency gas fired power in the U.S. which utilizes the country’s abundant and inexpensive shale gas as a fuel, thereby further contributing to the realization of a low-carbon society. Meanwhile, for our renewable energy business, we will use our experience with solar power generation businesses in Japan and Germany to accelerate the development of new businesses, in order to respond to the rapid movement towards decarbonization worldwide. Going forward, we will continue to utilize our company’s functions to create high-quality assets and focus on reforming business models using AI and the IoT.
Our mission is to develop sophisticated social infrastructure that promises reliability, safety, and comfort. To fulfill this mission, we will cooperate with excellent partners in Japan and overseas who share our values, contributing to industrialization in different countries around the world.
*5 Private Finance Initiative: A way of developing of public facilities using private funding
Gas-fired power generation businesses
We are focused on harnessing the knowledge we have gained from developing the Gas-To-Power project in Indonesia to develop new projects in countries that want to convert to alternative fuels, especially emerging countries in Asia. We are also engaged in developing and operating highly efficient gas-fired power plants in response to U.S. demand shifting from coal-fired electricity generation to gas-fired.
Gas-related businesses (LNG receiving terminal, downstream gas businesses)
We will install LNG receiving terminals in countries where expect robust gas demand to underpin strong electricity consumption, so called “Gas-To-Power project.“ Furthermore we plan to expand our business supplying natural gas to industrial end-users in Vietnam, together with our Japanese partners, and accelerate the development of new projects in other emerging countries in Asia.
Renewable energy businesses (solar power plants, wind power plants, biomass)
We will make use of the knowledge and experience that we have acquired through our participation in solar power generation business in Japan and overseas; wind power generation business in Europe, the U.S., and Taiwan; and biomass power generation business in Japan, to accelerate our expansion into new power sources and initiatives in regions where we expect further growth.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year

 Growth Strategy
The main themes of MTP 2020 are establishing a stable source of earnings resistant to market volatility, and contributing to a low-carbon society, as called for by the international community. Propelling us towards these goals are our three growth strategies.
First, we will strengthen our trading business by offering new services. In order to maintain and increase our market share in Japan, as well as extending our reach into emerging markets, we aim to strengthen our relationships with clients, and cater to their diverse demands by expanding our lineup of environmentally friendly products.
Second, we will optimize our upstream interests. By reducing costs in our existing projects and replacing them with more profitable investments, we aim to build an asset portfolio that will generate profit even amidst a market downturn.
Third, we will develop new midstream and downstream businesses, venturing into new business areas in response to social demand and environmental changes.
Acquiring high-quality coking coal and developing a contract mining
business
In order to achieve sustainable growth and address the growing global environmental awareness, we took steps to rebalance our coal portfolio by replacing thermal coal interests with high-quality coking coal, as with our acquisition of the Gregory Crinum coal mine in Australia. Making use of the mine‘s existing infrastructure, and our accumulated expertise as the sole general trading company tooperateitsownmine,wewillventureintocontractmininginsurroundingmines,anewbusiness model that will be resilient to market fluctuations.
Developing new applications for niobium
There is increasing demand for high-value-added steel products that are light and strong, driven
by the advent of the electric vehicle coupled with carbon emission regulations. As the exclusive distributor to Japan of niobium, an auxiliary material indispensable to steel production, for decades Sojitz has ensured stable supply of the rare metal to Japan. In order to contribute to a greener society not just within the steelmaking industry, we are also developing new applications for niobium. In June 2018, we signed an agreement with CBMM (Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração) and Toshiba Infrastructure Systems & Solutions to jointly develop anode material using niobium titanium oxide, for use in lithium-ion batteries of electric vehicles.
Increasing stable earnings through Metal One and other mid-downstream
ventures
Our division owns a 40% stake in one of the world‘s largest general steel trading companies, Metal One, which we founded together with Mitsubishi Corporation. Through close collaboration and providing support, we strive to create synergy between Metal One and Sojitz in the metal products business. We have also founded JAMPT Corporation as part of our strategy to augment our stable earnings with new downstream businesses, which is more resistant to market fluctuations compared to upstream investments. Commencing operations in October 2018, JAMPT is Japan‘s first 3D metal printing business which covers the entire process from manufacturing metal powders to assimilating metal products. The potential of the 3D metal printing technology is driven by increasing demand for high-precision products, such as aerospace engine components and medical implants.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
We significantly exceeded our initial target chiefly due to higher prices of mineral resources, namely coal, and increased transaction volume.

     Growth Strategy
The supply structure of the global chemicals industry stands at a major turning point. Market needs are also continuing to change, with consumer demand expanding due to the growing number of middle-income earners in emerging countries, especially those in Asia, and the development of new products and technologies in response to environmental issues.
The Chemicals Division aims to expand global trade by quickly responding to changes in our business environment and making use of our strong business foundation and marketing capabilities. We will continue to refine the strengths of our existing businesses, make additional investments in new functions, and further expand the value chains of the businesses which form the five major pillars of our organization. Furthermore, we will raise a sixth pillar, focused on global industrial trends such as the environment, mobility, and composite materials.
European chemical marketing and distribution company
(solvadis deutschland gmbh)
In 2017, we acquired solvadis deutschland gmbh, a Europe-based chemical marketing and distribution company with a long history in in sulfur, sulfuric acid, and methanol. Solvadis handles
as much as 1 million tons of methanol and one of its subsidiaries that provides a stable supply of necessary materials to chemical manufacturers in the Höchst Industrial Park in Germany. In 2019, as part of our efforts to enhance our distribution functions, we established facilities to solidify molten sulfur—which is used as a raw material for resins, textiles, fertilizer, and tires—at our logistics center in Belgium. Through this, we expect to be able to provide a stable supply to the region and increase our trade volume.
Plastics Business in Asia
In 2018, we constructed a packaging materials manufacturing plant in Southern Vietnam’s Long An Province in partnership with a major local packaging company. The food packaging materials market in Asia is growing by 10%-15% each year thanks to advancements in cold chain technology, made to meet the requirements of a growing middle class. We seek to expand this packaging business
by meeting such market needs throughout Asia. We have invested in an Indian automotive parts die manufacturing company, which is expected utilize its sophisticated technological capabilities to support the growing number of cars and motorcycles being manufactured there. It will also contribute to the Indian vehicle industry, which requires the procurement of dies.
Green Polyethylene
Because sugarcane absorbs CO2 during growth, green polyethylene is considered to emit zero net CO2 when burned as a waste material. In 2012, Sojitz Pla-Net acquired the sales rights for this product in Asia and Oceania from Braskem S.A. in Brazil. We are striving to facilitate the spread of environmentally friendly packaging materials through collaboration with retail businesses such as major convenience stores and making proposals to major brand holders.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Although our methanol business is performing favorably thanks to increased market prices, the plastic resins business and other concerns have been impacted by the economic slowdown caused by trade friction between the U.S. and China, and have demonstrated weak performance.

 Growth Strategy
Southeast Asia’s rising populations and economic development has brought more diverse lifestyles and an increase in demand for foodstuffs. Our Division aims to strengthen and increase our earnings capacity through diverse businesses related to food and agriculture, allowing Sojitz to convert the rapid changes in this region into further growth.
We operate market-leading fertilizer businesses in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam as part of our agribusiness operations, and are utilizing this expertise to develop businesses in Myanmar and other surrounding countries. We will also venture into other agriculture-related businesses fields.
For our foodstuffs business, we are involved in processing businesses, in areas such as milling, sugar refining, confectionery, and bread making, both in Japan and overseas. We will continue to expand our model of supplying raw materials and conducting sales of food products, moving into Southeast Asia. More specifically, in 2017, we established a flour milling company, a food ingredients wholesaling company, and a packaged bread company in the Philippines. We have also been involved in a flour milling company in Vietnam since 2007.
For our marine products business, we will strengthen our tuna value chain, which includes everything from farming to processing and sales, by further developing our processing and wholesale business in Japan and overseas. In terms of our feed business, we plan to enter the grain port business in Vietnam, where we also operate a feed manufacturing business. We intend to leverage these businesses to meet rising fertilizer demands in the future.
In addition, we are cooperating with other divisions that have Vietnam-based businesses in areas such as prepared food, wholesale food, and convenience stores. We will also partner with leading local businesses to promote global business development primarily in Vietnam and the ASEAN region.
Strengthening our fertilizer business and developing into surrounding areas
We aim to expand sales by implementing detailed promotion strategies for each region and each type of produce in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam, and by increasing exports to neighboring regions. We will also venture into agriculture-related businesses by capitalizing on the long-standing initiatives of our fertilizer business, which has firmly established roots in local areas.
Expanding marine products processing and wholesale
In December 2018, we increased our investment in a tuna processing and wholesale company in China. Along with our tuna aquaculture business at Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima, we will work to expand sales while we collaborate with leading processing wholesalers in each country where there is demand, such as Japan, China, Europe, and the U.S.
Strategic initiatives in Vietnam
In September 2018, Sojitz formed a strategic business alliance with the Pan Group, a major food and agribusiness firm in Vietnam. We are striving to accelerate our business expansion in Vietnam and overseas by combining the Pan Group‘s business foundation with technology from Sojitz‘s network of Japanese companies and customer base.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Progress has been weak due to the rising cost of raw materials and declining sales volumes for the overseas fertilizer business.

Retail businesses in ASEAN
We are developing food retail businesses that meet the needs of each ASEAN country’s stage
of development. Our focus is on developing four businesses in Vietnam: processing and production of prepared food and processed meats, four-temperature controlled logistics (ambient temperature, fixed temperature, chilled, and frozen), wholesale food and consumer goods,
and retail (convenience stores). We are working to improve quality of life by responding to the expectations and interests of local communities.
• Wholesale foods, processing & sales, retail, logistics business

We are contracted to manage and invest in shopping centers to increase their value. We have established a business model in which we use our management expertise to add value to our shopping centers, and are expanding our shopping center management business in Japan and overseas.
• Investment in and management of shopping centers Processed meat businesses
We are involved in all aspects of meat production, from livestock and fodder to meat packing. Sojitz boasts the top market share in imported livestock and frozen North American beef. We are also working to expand sales in markets in Japan and overseas, and to enhance our ability to procure raw materials through Meat-One Corporation, a marketing company whose shareholders include Japanese meat processing and logistics companies.

 Growth Strategy
In the midst of unprecedented diversification in consumer preferences, the Retail & Lifestyle Business Division is developing a wide range of businesses that enrich everyday life and offer greater convenience, with customers at the heart of the business. The key elements of our future growth strategy include both expanding businesses, and strengthening the functions we can provide to our customers in the ASEAN region, which is experiencing continued economic growth.
For instance, we created a cold chain in response to customer demand for delicious, high-quality foods as an extension of the wholesale food business that we started in Vietnam. This cold chain business has contributed to sales growth in the local food service industry and supermarkets. In addition, alongside development of our convenience store business, we are establishing plants for daily prepared foods and processed meat products to further increase the appeal of our convenience store products. We took advantage of the expertise gained in Vietnam to enter the wholesale food business in Thailand, where we are building a one-stop system for handling all phases from wholesale distribution to food processing. In Myanmar, we are developing a similar wholesale food business as well.
In terms of shopping center management, we have established a business model based on the shift in consumer trends from the tangible (product-oriented) to the intangible (experience-oriented), which utilizes our expertise in managing facilities in Japan, and adds more value to our company and other stores. We also make use of this know-how overseas to manage Japanese restaurants and food courts.
When it comes to the traditional trading business, we have established an integrated system which covers everything from material procurement to construction costs and moves into the field of interior building materials, which is becoming increasingly high-grade in our building materials business overseas. As for our textiles business, we provide products to major SPAs (speciality store retailers for private label apparel) and have constructed a top-down integrated production system, from the spinning to the sewing process. Through these efforts, we will provide business functions that respond to the needs of our customers, and live up to the expectations and interests of society.
Household paper and Industrial paper business
In June 2018, we invested in Saigon Paper Corporation, a major paper manufacturer in Vietnam, to enter the country‘s household paper and Industrial paper business. We plan to address rising demand by investing in greater production capacity and efficiency. Additionally, we are expanding our sales channels by utilizing the diverse network of lifestyle businesses that we have cultivated in Vietnam.
Meat-One Project
In February 2018, we established the marketing company Meat-One, together with multiple companies involved in raw meat procurement and sales, meat processing, and distribution. Meat- One combines the expertise and functions of the participating companies, allowing the companies to make use of each other‘s procurement, production, and sales networks to provide safe, reliable, and delicious processed meat products at competitive prices to consumers in Japan and overseas.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Our key businesses, such as our consumer goods distribution business, have remained strong, and we generally performed according to plan thanks to increased meat trading and other factors.

   Growth Strategy
The business foundation of the Industrial Infrastructure & Urban Development Division is our business asset administration and management. We have built this business up over many years developing industrial parks, housing, and other urban infrastructure. Our fundamental strategy is to build up these sources of revenue as base earnings, constructing a stable earnings foundation that can adequately supplement our earnings when development revenue dips, thereby steadily improving asset efficiency.
In Japan, we will achieve the kind of diverse asset control that our customers seek by further expanding and enhancing our development, asset management, and property management functions. Overseas—and in Asia with its growing middle class in particular—we are concentrating on smart cities and other development projects that will help us secure base earnings in the future, utilizing our urban infrastructure development and management functions honed in Japan.
We will also concentrate more on our strongly performing J-REIT management business and aim to restructure our business portfolio by strengthening our comprehensive life solutions services, including our childcare service business.
Domestic real estate businesses
We are aiming for increased growth in terms of the scale and areas in which we do business by creating reciprocal relationships and cycles between the functions of development in housing and other areas, asset management, and building services related to facility administration and management and residents’ lifestyles.
Overseas industrial park businesses
We make use of our knowledge of industrial park development, sales, and management businesses in Asia and other regions to develop industrial parks in emerging countries, which are attractive locations for production and consumer sales. Our industrial parks allow foreign companies trying
to capture demand created by the expanding middle class in these countries to focus on their businesses. In doing so, we participate in a foundation establishment for the advancement of these countries’ manufacturing industries.
J-REIT management business
We are increasing the total amount of assets under the management of Nippon REIT Investment Corporation (NRT), our integrated, listed REIT, and improving the quality of its portfolio to expand our stable earnings foundation. Through Sojitz REIT Advisors K.K., which is responsible for management of the assets, we are carefully identifying properties and increasing their value via our proprietary engineering technology. In the year ended March 2019, five years after NRT was listed, the company‘s assets under management totaled around ¥250.0 billion, and we are aiming for ¥300.0 billion in the medium term.
Overseas urban infrastructure business
Our development projects contribute to the growth of burgeoning economies by helping to solve their city-building issues, partnering with appropriate companies. In Deltamas City in Indonesia, we are driving the creation of a city for 250,000 people, making use of the strengths of Japanese companies to equip the city with schools for Japanese people overseas, large shopping malls, and smart housing.
MTP 2020: Looking Back at the First Year
Although sales of industrial parks overseas have moved forward favorably, progress in Japan has been weak due to declining domestic real estate sales.

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
1. Overview
In the year ended March 31, 2019, the deceleration of the Chinese economy and the trade friction between the United States and China created signs of slowdown in the global economy, which had previously been supported by strong consumption.
In the United States, the stock market suffered a temporary decline as a result of the uncertainty arising from the trade friction between the United States and China and debt issues stemming from the House of Representatives and the Senate being controlled by different political parties. Nonetheless, the U.S. economy proved firm as the country shifted toward quantitative easing and other flexible financial policies. Tax reforms and other measures contributed to solid trends in personal and capital investment, and corporate performance remained stable overall. Conversely, the United States had adverse impacts on the global economy and commodity prices through its trade friction with China, its institution of stronger sanctions on Iran, and other aspects of its foreign policy.
Overall economic growth in Europe was sluggish, with the most notable stagnation being seen in Germany. Factors behind this situation included poor growth in exports attributable to trade friction between the United States and China and the European Union and economic slowdown in China. There is also a rising sense of uncertainty in this region amid concern about the potential impacts of trade negotiations between the United States and Germany as well as for the United
Kingdom’s consensus-lacking withdrawal from the European Union.
China saw the implementation of economic policies pertaining to infrastructure investment and tax reductions. Meanwhile, there was concern about further economic slowdown. The potential intensification and medium- to long-term impacts of trade friction with the United States are also matters warranting attention going forward.
Asia enjoyed a stable economy due to relatively solid internal demand. Conditions were stable regardless of the impacts of economic slowdown in China as well as the fact that there was a trend toward people buying back the currencies of Asian countries as projections that the United States would be instituting an interest rate hike were retracted.
In Japan, relatively stable economic growth was achieved as the benefits of the solid trends in consumer spending and capital investment outweighed the impacts of the deceleration of the Chinese economy and trade friction between the United States and China.

 Automotive Division.
Gross profit increased ¥8,576 million year on year to
¥240,956 million as a result of the rise in revenue. Profit before tax increased ¥14,539 million year on
year to ¥94,882 million as a result of higher gross profit and an increase in share of profit (loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method due to higher profit at an LNG operating company.
After deducting income tax expenses of ¥19,662 million from profit before tax of ¥94,882 million, profit for the period amounted to ¥75,219 million, up ¥13,525 million year on year. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) increased ¥13,577 million year on year, to ¥70,419 million.
Regardless of the fact that foreign currency translation differences for foreign operations placed downward pressure on income and that financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income were down, comprehensive income for the year increased ¥3,622 million year on year to ¥54,948 million because of higher profit for the year. Comprehensive income for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) was up ¥3,508 million year on year to ¥50,938 million.
3. Segment Information
Results by segment are as follows.
(1) Automotive
Revenue was up 28.9% year on year, to ¥242,499 million, due to the acquisition of new domestic and overseas
automotive dealerships and other businesses. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) decreased ¥106 million to ¥6,409 million as a decline in share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method counteracted the benefits of a rise in other income associated with a gain on the sale of an automobile-related company.
Although business was affected by currency weakness in the Russian wholesaling business, the increase in demand for vehicles, particularly in developing countries, steady contributions to revenue from initiatives such as vehicle dealerships in Japan and abroad, and the North American parts quality inspection business led to results that were higher than planned. We also took steps to strengthen our functions with a view to future growth by, among other things, implementing our new vehicle assembly and wholesaling business and Fintech service business.
(2) Aerospace & Transportation Project
Revenue was down 19.0% year on year to ¥27,811 million due to the absence of gains on new ship turnovers recorded in the previous equivalent period. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) rose
¥684 million to ¥3,962 million due to an increase in other income associated with gains on sales of aircraft.
Revenues for aircraft-related businesses, one of the company's strengths, increased which, coupled with the steady progress of the Indian freight railway track-laying project, led to business performance going largely according to plan. This year, we expanded our business

 areas in the field of aircraft manufacturing by enlarging our business jet business and entering the airport management business with Shimojishima Airport in Miyakojima, Okinawa Prefecture. This and the pursuit of airport-related businesses in Japan and elsewhere were measures we put in place to help build new revenue bases.
(3) Machinery & Medical Infrastructure
Revenue was down 8.0% year on year to ¥107,010 million as a result of a decline in industrial machinery transactions. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) decreased ¥2,908 million to ¥2,763 million due to the rebound from earnings contributions from infrastructure-related projects recorded in the previous equivalent period.
The core industries of industrial machinery and medical infrastructure performed strongly, and the segment as a whole performed according to plan. The construction of a PPP-type (Public-Private Partnership) hospital management business in Istanbul, Turkey, progressed smoothly and our initiatives to expand our medical-related businesses progressed steadily. At the same time, we also took steps to establish new business models by, for example, investing in an engineering company in Thailand.
(4) Energy & Social Infrastructure
Revenue was down 35.6% to ¥74,791 million as a result of
lower petroleum product transactions. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥5,786 million was recorded, in comparison with loss for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥5,822 million in the year ended March 31, 2018. Main factors that occurred in the year ended March 31, 2019 are a rise in other income associated with a gain on the sales of an overseas solar power business operating company and an increase in share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method associated with higher profit of LNG operating company.
This year, revenue was higher than planned due to new or stable operations of our domestic and overseas solar power generation businesses and favorable trends in the prices of resources. We also expanded our services such as energy supply and power generation by starting our second gas power generation business in the United States and starting work on a Gas-to-Power project in Indonesia. We are working to establish a revenue base that is resistant to the effects of market conditions by developing a clean energy value chain domestically and abroad.
(5) Metals & Mineral Resources
Revenue was up 18.2% to ¥383,170 million as a result of higher prices and transaction volumes for coal and other resources. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) rose ¥8,581 million to ¥30,463 million due to higher gross profit and an increase in share of profit of

 investments accounted for using the equity method. Results were much higher than planned at the
beginning of the year due to a rise in the prices of coal and other resources and an increase in the volumes of resources we handled. This year, we optimized our asset portfolio by reshuffling our upstream rights assets by acquiring rights to coking coal mine in Australia and signing an agreement to sell part of our stake in a thermal coal mine in Indonesia. We also took measures to create a stable revenue base by developing new businesses that cater to social demands and change. One of these measures involved signing contracts for the joint development of next-generation EV battery materials.
(6) Chemicals
Revenue was down 2.0% year on year to ¥505,101 million following the Company’s withdrawal from low-profit transactions. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) increased ¥282 million to ¥8,984 million as a result of an increase in gross profit stemming from a rise in the price of methanol.
Our chief industry, the methanol industry, performed well due to a rise in market prices, but the plastic resins and other businesses underperformed due to the effects of the economic slowdown caused by trade friction between the U.S.A. and China, among other factors. This year, we took measures to strengthen our business foundations, which included withdrawing from low-profit businesses and expanding our global trade.
(7) Foods & Agriculture Business
Revenue was down 10.5% to ¥128,293 million following lower feed material transactions. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) decreased ¥1,749 million to ¥2,280 million as a result of a decline in the profit of overseas fertilizer businesses.
The overseas fertilizer businesses performed worse than planned due to higher costs of raw materials and lower sales volumes. This year we also worked towards the expansion of prime business assets by buying more tuna processing businesses in China, starting work on large-scale repairs in our fertilizer business in the Philippines and investing in or concluding strategic partnerships with major food and agribusiness corporations in Vietnam.
(8) Retail & Lifestyle Business
Revenue was up 8.5% year on year to ¥317,373 million as a result of the acquisition of an overseas paper manufacturer and higher beef transactions. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) increased ¥85 million to ¥5,724 million.
Performance in key businesses such as the consumer goods distribution logistics business remained strong while meat transactions increased, leading to results that were largely as planned. This year we also took steps, which included the purchase of a major paper manufacturer in Vietnam, to expand and diversify our retain businesses even further in the ASEAN region, which

 is expected to show increased demand in the future.
(9) Industrial infrastructure & Urban Development
Revenue was down 27.5% year on year to ¥33,267 million because of lower real estate transactions. Profit for the period (attributable to owners of the Company) decreased ¥1,052 million to ¥1,087 million.
Although sales at the overseas industrial park business were favorable, results were lower than planned due to lower sales in the domestic real estate business. This year, we enhanced our profitability in our REIT businesses, building management businesses and daycare management businesses in Japan. Overseas, we began the distribution of the new industrial park in Vietnam while also promoting urban complex infrastructure development that includes the creation of smart cities. In addition to all this, we also worked together with local governments and other organizations in Japan to actively support local companies as they expanded abroad.
4. Financial Position
(1) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
Total assets on March 31, 2019, stood at ¥2,297,059 million, down ¥53,292 million from March 31, 2018. This decrease was largely a result of other current assets that decreased in aircraft-related business.
Total liabilities at March 31, 2019, amounted to ¥1,635,451 million, down ¥89,776 million from March 31, 2018. This decrease was largely due to a decrease in trade and other payables associated with tobacco- related transactions under current liabilities.
Total equity attributable to owners of the Company was ¥618,295 million on March 31, 2019, up ¥31,831
● Cash Flow (Years ended March 31)
million from March 31, 2018. This increase was largely due to the accumulation of profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) in spite of a decrease in other components of equity due to fluctuations in forex and stock prices.
Sojitz consequently, on March 31, 2019, had a current
ratio of 157.1%, a long-term debt ratio of 82.9% and an
equity ratio* of 26.9%. Net interest-bearing debt (total
interest-bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents and
time deposits) totaled ¥584,711 million on March 31,
2019, a ¥18,739 million decrease from March 31, 2018.
This resulted in a debt equity ratio* of 0.95 as of March
31, 2019.
* The equity ratio and net debt equity ratio are calculated based on total equity attributable to owners of the Company.
An analysis of each segment is as follows: Automotive

(2) Cash Flow
In the year ended March 31, 2019, operating activities provided net cash flow of ¥96,476 million, investing activities used net cash of ¥42,200 million and financing activities used net cash of ¥74,907 million. Sojitz ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of ¥285,687 million, adjusted to reflect foreign currency translation adjustments related to cash and cash equivalents.
1) Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥96,476 million, consisting mainly of business earnings
and dividends received. It was down ¥2,336 million year on year.
2) Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥42,200 million, down ¥44,207 million year on year. Investment outflows for investment in a U.S. gas-fired thermal power generation business and for the acquisition of Australian coking coal mine exceeded inflows from the sale of investments.
3) Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥74,907 million, largely as a result of the repayment of borrowings. It was up ¥61,855 million year on year.
(3) Liquidity and Funding
Under Medium-Term Management Plan 2020, which began in the first year ending March 31, 2019, the Sojitz Group continued to advance financial strategies in accordance with the basic policy of maintaining and enhancing the stability of its capital structure. In addition, Sojitz endeavored to maintain a stable financial foundation by holding sufficient liquidity as a buffer against changes in the economic or financial environment and by keeping the long-term debt ratio at its current level.
As one source of long-term funding, Sojitz did not issue straight bonds in the year ended March 31, 2019. However, Sojitz will continue to closely monitor interest rates and market conditions and will consider floating additional issues whenever the timing and associated costs prove advantageous.
As supplemental sources of procurement flexibility and precautionary liquidity, Sojitz maintains a ¥100.0 billion long-term yen commitment line (which remains unused) and long-term commitment line totaling US$1.9 billion (of which US$0.31 billion has been used).
5. Business and Other Risks
The Sojitz Group is a general trading company that operates a diverse portfolio of businesses globally, and is exposed to various risks due to the nature of these businesses. Therefore, the Group defines and classifies risks in compliance with its basic Code of Corporate Risk Management and assigns managers formulate a risk management operation policy and management plan at the beginning of each fiscal year, monitor progress and risk mitigation quarterly, and summarize performance at the end of each fiscal year. The Group manages
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 93

 quantifiable risks (market risks, credit risks, business investment risks, and country risks) based on risk asset scores derived from risk measurements. Non-quantifiable risks (legal risks, compliance risks, environmental and social [human rights] risks, funding risks, disaster risks, and system risks) are managed based on quarterly monitoring. The Group has the risk management systems required to address the risks it faces, but cannot completely avoid all risks. Risks involved in the Sojitz Group’s businesses include, but are not limited to, the following.
(1) Business Risks
1) Risk of changes in the macroeconomic
environment
The Group operates a wide range of businesses in Japan and overseas that are engaged in a broad array of activities. Political and economic conditions in Japan and other countries and the overall global economy influence the Group’s results. Therefore, global and/or regional economic trends could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
2) Market risks
The Group is exposed to market risks, including exchange rate risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments; interest rate fluctuation risk associated with debt financing and portfolio investment; commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements and commodity inventories incidental to operating activities; and market price fluctuation risk associated with holding listed securities and other such assets. The Group has a basic policy of minimizing these market risks through such means as matching assets and liabilities and edging with forward exchange contracts, commodity futures/forward contracts, and interest rate swaps.
(a) Currency risk
The Group engages in import and export transactions, and offshore transactions, denominated in foreign currencies as a principal business activity. The revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly paid in foreign currencies, whereas the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is the Japanese yen. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies, and hedges its foreign currency exposure with forward exchange contracts and other measures to prevent or limit losses
stemming from this currency risk. Even with such hedging, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid currency fluctuation risk. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. Additionally, the Group’s dividend income from overseas Group companies and the profits and losses of overseas consolidated subsidiaries and equity method associates are largely denominated in foreign currencies. Their conversion into yen entails currency risk. The Group also owns many foreign subsidiaries and operating companies. When these companies’ financial statements are converted into yen, exchange rate movements could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions or issuing bonds to extend credit (e.g., for trade receivables), invest in securities, acquire fixed assets, and for other purposes. Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks. However, the Group cannot completely avoid interest rate fluctuation risks. An increase in funding costs due to a sharp rise in interest rates could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
(c) Commodity price risk
As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities in its various businesses. It is consequently exposed to the risk of commodity price fluctuations. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels for each of its organizational units. The Group also imposes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., organizational units must promptly liquidate losing positions and are prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if unit losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with these controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be
94 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 adversely affected by unanticipated market or other movements. The Group also monitors commodity inventories by business unit on a monthly basis to control inventory levels.
(d) Listed securities price risk
The Group has large holdings of marketable securities. For listed shares in particular, the Group periodically confirms the holding purpose for a security. Nonetheless, a major decline in the stock market could impair the Group’s investment portfolio and, in turn, adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
3) Credit risks
The Group assumes credit risks by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risks by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on an 11-grade rating scale. The Group also controls credit risks by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer by- customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group also employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables in which it screens the customers to which it has extended trade credit to identify those that meet certain criteria. It then reassesses the selected customers’ creditworthiness and the status of the Group’s claims against these customers. Through this approach, the Group is endeavoring to more rigorously ascertain credit risks and estimate provisions to allow for doubtful accounts for individual receivables. For credit risks associated with deferred payments, loans, and credit guarantees, the Group periodically assesses whether profitability is commensurate with credit risks on a case by- case basis. For transactions that do not generate risk commensurate returns, the Group takes steps to improve profitability or limit credit risks. However, even with such credit management procedures, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid credit risks. If, for example, receivables are rendered uncollectible by a customer’s bankruptcy, the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.
4) Business investment risks
The Group invests in a wide range of businesses as one of its principal business activities. In doing so, it assumes the
risk of fluctuations in the value of business investments and investments in interests. Additionally, because many business investments are illiquid, the Group also faces the risk of being unable to recoup its investment as profitably as initially anticipated. With the aim of preventing and limiting losses from business investments, the Group has established standards for rigorously screening prospective business investments and monitoring and withdrawing from investments. In screening prospective investments, the Group analyzes business plans, including cash flow projections, and rigorously assesses the businesses’ prospects. It has also established procedures, including an IRR (internal rate of return) hurdle rate screen, to enable it to identify investments with the potential to generate returns commensurate with risk. Once the Group has invested in a business venture, it conducts thorough business process management, which includes periodic reassessment of the business’s prospects, to minimize losses by identifying problems early and taking appropriate action. To identify problems with business investments at an early stage or before they materialize and thus minimize losses on divestiture or liquidation, the Group sets exit conditions and acts decisively to opportunely exit investments that have failed to generate risk commensurate returns. Even with such procedures for screening prospective investments and monitoring existing investments, the Group cannot completely avoid the risk that investment returns will fall short of expectations or the risk that businesses will fail to perform according to plan. Moreover, the Group could incur losses when exiting business ventures or may be precluded from exiting business ventures as intended due to circumstances such as relationships with partners in the ventures. Such events could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
5) Country risks
To minimize losses that may result from country risks, the Group recognizes that it must avoid concentrated exposure to any single country or region. In conducting business in countries that pose substantial country risks, the Group hedges against country risks on a transaction by- transaction basis in principle through such means as purchasing trade insurance. In managing country risks, the Group assigns nine level country-risk ratings to individual countries and regions based on objective measures according to the size of the country risks. It then sets net exposure (gross exposure less trade insurance coverage and/or other country-risk hedges) limits based
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 95

 on the country’s size and assigned rating. The Group limits its net exposure to individual countries to no more than the net exposure limit. However, even with these risk controls and hedges, the Group cannot completely eliminate the risk that businesses will fail to perform according to plan or the risk of losses due to changes in political, economic, regulatory and societal conditions in the countries in which the Group conducts business or countries in which the Group’s customers are located. Such events could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
6) Impairment risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of impairment of the value of its leased and non-current assets, including real estate holdings, machinery, equipment and vehicles, and goodwill and mining rights. The Group recognizes necessary impairment losses at the end of the fiscal year in which they are identified. If assets subject to asset impairment accounting decline materially in value due to a decline in their prices, recognition of necessary impairment losses could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
7) Funding risks
The Group largely funds its operations by issuing bonds and borrowing funds from financial institutions, and therefore maintains good business relationships with financial institutions and keeps the long-term debt ratio at a specified level, which ensures stable funding. However, in the event of a disruption of the financial system or financial and capital markets, or major downgrades of the Group’s credit rating by rating agencies, funding constraints and/or increased financing costs could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
8) Environmental and social (human rights) risks
The Group has established six Key Sustainability Issues (Human Rights, Environment, Resources, Local Communities, Human Resources, and Governance) and works to mitigate environmental and social (human rights) risks within business activities by establishing policies such as the Sojitz Group Environmental Policy, Sojitz Group CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains, and Sojitz Group Human Rights Policy; ensuring these are observed throughout the Group; and making efforts to ensure that the policies are understood by suppliers, who undergo risk assessment in an effort to improve their operations. With regards to risks related to the global
environment, ecosystems, or changes in the climate which could have a large impact on social systems or corporate activities, the Group pays close attention to trends in government policies and regulations with regards to the low-carbon/de-carbonization called for by the Paris Agreement, and it analyzes the impact of these policies on relevant businesses within Sojitz Group.
Environmental, occupational health and safety, or human rights issues may still arise in the Group’s business activities or within supply chains, however. Moreover, environmental or human rights groups or other members of society could accuse the Group of involvement in such issues. Such events could force the Group to temporarily or permanently cease operations or require cleanup work. The Group could also face litigation, incur expenses related to compensation for affected parties, or suffer damage to its reputation. Such developments could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/ or financial condition.
9) Compliance risks
The Group’s diverse business activities are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations, including the Companies Act of Japan, tax laws, anti-corruption laws, antitrust laws, foreign exchange laws and other trade- related laws, and various industry-specific laws, including chemical regulations. To ensure compliance with these laws and regulations in Japan and overseas, the Group has formulated a compliance program, established a compliance committee, and made other company-wide efforts to instill a compliance-oriented mindset within all Group officers and employees. However, such measures cannot completely eliminate the compliance risks entailed by the Group’s business activities. Additionally, the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by major statutory or regulatory revisions or application of an unanticipated interpretation of existing laws or regulations.
10) Litigation risks
Litigation or other legal proceedings (e.g., arbitration) may be initiated in Japan or overseas against or with the Group in connection with the Group’s business activities. Due to the uncertain nature of litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not possible at the present time to predict the effect that such risks might have on the Group. Nevertheless, such risks could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
96 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 11) Information system and information security risks
The Group has prescribed regulations and established oversight entities, mainly the Information Security Subcommittee, to appropriately protect and manage information assets. The Group also has implemented safeguards, such as installation of duplicate hardware, against failure of key information systems and network infrastructure. Additionally, the Group is endeavoring to strengthen its safeguards against information leaks through such means as installing firewalls to prevent unauthorized access by outsiders, implementing antivirus measures, and utilizing encryption technologies. While the Group is working to strengthen overall information security and prevent system failures, it cannot completely eliminate the risk of important information assets, including personal information, being leaked or damaged by increasingly prevalent cyberattacks or unauthorized access to its computer systems. Nor can the Group eliminate the risk of its information and communication systems being rendered inoperable by an unforeseeable natural disaster or system failure. In such an event, the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected, depending on the extent of the damage.
12) Natural disaster and calamity risks
The Group could be directly or indirectly affected in the event of an earthquake, flood, storm, or other natural disaster that damages offices or other facilities or injures employees and/or their family members. The Group has prepared disaster response manuals, conducts disaster response drills, and has established an employee safety confirmation system and a business continuity plan, but it cannot completely avoid the risk of damage from natural disasters. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by natural disasters.
13) Risks related to spread of company information via the company website and SNS
Sojitz Group’s website and SNS accounts expose us to the risk of system vulnerabilities leading to doctoring of posted information or leaking of personal information collected via the website or SNS, as well as risk of criticism/claims or infringement of copyrights, trademarks, or rights of likeness stemming from use of the website or SNS accounts. As described in 11) above, we strive to develop measures to protect against system
vulnerabilities to the greatest extent possible within reason. With regards to use of the website or SNS accounts, we require organizations to draft written rules for approving posted materials in advance and regularly reviewing the contents, for each website or SNS account owned by the organization. However, this does not fully eliminate risk, leaving room for the possibility that the website or SNS account could negatively impact trust in the company or value of the Sojitz brand.
14) Risks related to product quality
Through business investment, Sojitz Group is expanding the diversifying the business areas in which we operate. We are increasingly entering manufacturing and
service sectors, and we are thus developing systems to control the quality of products and services which we manufacture and provide. In the event of an unforeseen issue with product quality, however, Sojitz Group may be held accountable for damages stemming from that issue. Sojitz Group’s business performance and financial standing may be negatively impacted in this case.
15) Risks related to innovation
As a general trading company, Sojitz Group is conducting business in a wide variety of business fields. We established the Business Innovation Office in order to respond to changes in business models stemming from new technologies and the digital revolution, as well as to promote work efficiency throughout the company. In the event of sudden changes to the industrial structure due to rapid development of new technologies, however, Sojitz Group’s business performance and financial standing may be negatively impacted.
(2) Risks related to Medium-term Management Plan 2020
Sojitz Group has established Medium-term Management Plan 2020, scheduled to end in the FY2020. Although the plan was drafted based on economic conditions, industry trends, and other information and predictions which were believed to be accurate at the time, the measures and policies therein may not proceed as planned due to sudden changes in the operating environment or other factors, and Sojitz may not arrive at the anticipated results.

  Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 – Commitment to Growth
Under Medium-Term Management Plan 2020, we will endeavor to link prior initiatives to growth while engaging in ambitious undertakings to achieve steady growth going forward.
           (2) Outlook and Issues to Be Addressed Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 Medium-Term Management Plan 2020—Commitment to Growth—is the three-year plan established by the Sojitz Group and started in April 2018. Initiatives are currently being implemented to accomplish the goals of this plan.
Under this plan, the Sojitz Group will pursue steady growth by increasing the value of its assets while managing cash flows to continue conducting disciplined investments and loans (a total of ¥300.0 billion over the three-year period of the medium-term management plan).
Our target for profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) in the final year of the plan will be ¥75.0 billion or more, which is to be achieved through
average annual growth of approx.10% over the plan period from the previous year. More information on Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 can be found on Sojitz’s corporate website (https://www.sojitz.com/en/).
The targeted performance indicators in Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 are as follows.

 indicator of return on equity (ROE) have been set. In addition, Companywide targets have been formulated for return on assets (ROA) along with segment ROA targets for the final year of the medium-term management plan to facilitate efforts to achieve the ROE targets.
In the year ended March 31, 2019, the first year of Medium-Term Management Plan, the deceleration of the Chinese economy and trade friction between the United States and China created signs of slowdown in the global economy, which had previously been supported by strong consumption. In this environment, profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥70.4 billion was recorded. Factors contributing to this outcome included increased sales in the Metals & Mineral Resources Division, a result of rises in prices and transaction volumes for coal and other resources, the profits realized from new investments and loans executed under the period of the previous and current medium- term management plans, and an improved balance of other income and expenses stemming from the increase of gains from an LNG operating company.
In order to achieve the sustainable growth described in Medium-Term Management Plan 2020, the Sojitz Group will continue to adhere to its policy of conducting approximately ¥300.0 billion of new investments and loans. By enacting this policy, we will accumulate quality assets to accomplish the disclosed target of contributions to profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥10.0 billion or more from investments and loans in the year ending March 31, 2021. Investments and loans in the year ended March 31, 2019, amounted to around ¥90.0 billion. Specific investment targets included automotive, power, and other infrastructure projects and coking coal mine, areas in which the Sojitz Group has prior investment experience, and paper manufacturer and containerboard operations in Vietnam, a country in which the Group boasts strengths.
Furthermore, the Sojitz Group is advancing initiatives targeting future growth. For example, a corporate venture capital fund was established to invest in start-ups in countries around the world and measures are being implemented to create innovation and acquire and reinforce functions.
Through the implementation of the Medium-Term Management Plan, the Company seeks to accomplish the goals of the Sojitz Group Statement and achieve ongoing growth. To this end, we are increasing our focus on sustainability in management and furnishing foundations and systems based on our six Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality) and on our policy of incorporating the
resolution of environmental and social issues into Sojitz’s business. In addition, sustainability challenges have been established as a long-term vision to define the Sojitz Group’s stance toward long-term initiatives for addressing climate change, human rights, and other global social issues.
In the year ending March 31, 2020, the Sojitz Group will accelerate the strategies described in Medium-Term Management Plan 2020. At the same time, we will endeavor to boost the value of businesses and assets in which investment has already been conducted even in the current economic climate, which is characterized by high volatility in commodity prices and other conditions, while proactively accumulating quality assets for fueling ongoing growth with emphasis placed on cash flow management. These efforts will be made to ensure the accomplishment of steady growth.
The Company forecasts consolidated profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥72.0 billion in the year ending March 31, 2020.
Note on Forward-Looking Statements
The information about future performance (forward- looking statements) in this integrated report is based on information available to management at the time of its disclosure. Actual results may differ from forecasts as a result of factors including but not limited to those noted in "5. Business and Other Risks."

 7. Basic Policy on Dividends
As a basic policy, Sojitz’s top management priorities include paying stable dividends on an ongoing basis while enhancing competitiveness and shareholder value by increasing internal capital reserves and using them effectively. Under this policy, the consolidated payout ratio during the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 will be approximately 30%.
Sojitz decided to pay a year-end cash dividend as follows after comprehensively considering factors including results for the fiscal year and total equity. As a result, the consolidated payout based on profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) was 30.2%.
Including the interim dividend of ¥7.5 per share paid on December 3, 2018, cash dividends per share for the year ended March 31, 2018 totaled ¥17.00 per share, and dividends paid totaled ¥21,266 million. The effective date of dividends from surplus was June 21, 2019.
Sojitz’s Articles of Incorporation permit the payment of interim cash dividends by resolution of the Board of Directors as stipulated by Article 454, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act of Japan. As a result, Sojitz’s basic policy is to pay dividends twice annually, with the interim dividend being approved by resolution of the Board of Directors and the year-end dividend being approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting.
(Note) Dividends paid from surplus for the 16th term are as shown below.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 1 REPORTING ENTITY
Sojitz Corporation (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Japan. The addresses of the Company's registered headquarters and main office are available on its corporate website (http://www. sojitz.com/en/). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group") and the Group's interests in associates and joint
2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION
(1) Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs").
(2) Basis of measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the following material items in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position:
• Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through
profit or loss are measured at fair value;
• Financial assets measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income are measured at fair value;
• Defined benefit plan assets or liabilities are measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair
value of plan assets; and,
• Inventories acquired with the purpose of generating profits from
short-term fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less sales costs to sell.
(3) Functional currency and presentation currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in Japanese yen has been rounded down to the nearest million yen.
For the convenience of readers outside Japan, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are also presented in United States dollars by translating Japanese yen amounts at the exchange rate of ¥111 to U.S.$1, the approximate rate of exchange at the end of March 31, 2019. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into United States dollars at the above.
(4) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from such estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions thereof are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is included in the following notes:
ventures. The Group is an integrated trading company engaged in a wide range of business activities on a global basis. Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally.
• Note 3 (1)—Scope of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
• Note 3 (14)—Recognition and presentation with respect to revenue
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustments within the next consolidated fiscal year is included in the following notes:
• Note 16—Provisions
• Note 23—Impairment of non-financial assets
• Note 31—Measurement of defined benefit obligations • Note 32—Recoverability of deferred tax assets
• Note 33 (6)—Fair value of financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at
the measurement date.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable, either directly or indirectly. • Level 3: unobservable inputs.
Information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:
• Note 10—Investment property
• Note 18—Assets held for sale and liabilities directly related
thereto
• Note 23—Impairment of non-financial assets
• Note 33 (6)—Fair value of financial instruments
(5)Change presentation
(Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss)
For the year ended March 31, 2019, to present income related to affiliated companies more comprehensively, income from liquidation of subsidiaries/associates, which was previously presented in "Other operating income," has been included in "Gain on sale of subsidiaries/associates." As a result, "Gain on sale of subsidiaries/associates" has been renamed " Gain on recognition of subsidiaries/associates " for the year ended March 31, 2019.
The presentation has not been reclassified because the change had no effect on the consolidated statements of Profit or Loss for the year ended March 31, 2018.

 (Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
"Changes in other assets and liabilities," which was included in "Others" of net cash provided (used) by/in operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2018, has been set down separately for the year ended March 31, 2019 for a clearer presentation.
As a result, "Others" amounted to ¥(36,381) million (U.S.$(327,756) thousand), which was presented as cash flow from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2018, was reclassified into "Changes in other assets and liabilities" amounted to ¥(39,979) million (U.S.$(360,171) thousand) and "Others" amounted to ¥3,597 million (U.S.$32,405 thousand).
(6) Changes in Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates Based on Requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards
With the exception of the following policies, the accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2019, are the same as those applied to consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018.
Effective April 1, 2018, the Company has applied the following mandatory standards.
Company has recognized inventory assets for transactions for which the Company recognized profit at net value as an agent (agent transaction) in cases when the goods or services to be provided were temporarily in the legal possession of the Group. Under IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts, however, the Group is judged not be in control of inventories during agent transactions, and inventories are therefore recognized under trade and other receivables. As a result of the application of this standard, inventories on the consolidated statements of financial position for the year ended March 31, 2019, were reduced by ¥161,418 million (U.S.$ 1,454,216 thousand), and trade and other receivables were increased by the same amount. The impact of this change on revenue and other income items on the consolidated statements of profit or loss for the year ended March 31, 2019, was minimal.
2) IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version) Effective April 1, 2018, the Company has applied IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version). As a transitional measure for the application of this standard, the standard has been applied retrospectively to previous periods and the balance of retaining earnings on April 1, 2018, has been adjusted to reflect the cumulative effect of this retrospectively application. The application of IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version) did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
(a) Classifications of Financial Assets
Under the previously applied IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2010 version), financial assets of a liability nature were classified as either financial assets measured at amortized cost or financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. In IFRS 9— Financial Instruments (2014 version), a new classification for financial assets of a liability nature was created: financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. When the following conditions are fulfilled, the Company classifies financial assets of a liability nature as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
• When the financial asset is held for a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets
• When the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding
Judgements regarding business models were made based on the status of businesses and the circumstances surrounding these businesses as of the date of application.
(b) Impairment of Financial Assets
Previously, impairment of financial assets was performed based on the loss model described in IAS 39—Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. In conjunction with the application of IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version), impairment will be recognized based on an expected credit loss model. The expected credit loss model will be applied to financial assets measured at amortized cost.
(c) Hedge Accounting
Previously, hedge accounting was performed in accordance with IAS 39—Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. With the application of IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version), hedge accounting will be performed based on the new general hedge accounting model. The new general hedge accounting model requires that the hedging relationship be integrated with the risk management objective and strategy for

    Revenue from Contracts with Customers
   Financial Instruments (2014 version)
      1) IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers Effective April 1, 2018, the Company has applied IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a transitional measure for the application of this standard, the standard has been applied retrospectively to previous periods and the balance of retaining earnings on April 1, 2018, has been adjusted to reflect the cumulative effect amount of this retrospectively application.
In conjunction with the application of IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company has adopted an approach of recognizing the amount of profit to which the Company is expected to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers based on the following five- step model.
Step 1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer
Step 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3. Determine the transaction price
Step 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
Step 5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation
Under IFRS 15—Revenue from Contracts, the Company is viewed as the main transacting entity if the goods or services to be provided to the customer are in the Company’s control prior to their provision and will be viewed as an agent if the goods or services are not in its control prior to provision. Previously, the

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group except the items described in "2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (6) Changes in Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates Based on Requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards."
(1) Basis of consolidation
1) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When the Group holds a majority of the voting rights of another entity, such entity is considered to be a subsidiary of the Group as it is determined that control exists, unless there is clear evidence that shares in such entity do not provide for control. In addition, in the case that the Group holds less than or equal to 50 percent of the voting rights of another entity, if it is determined through agreements or the like with other investment companies that the Group has significant control over such entity's finance and management, such entity is considered to be a subsidiary of the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the Group obtains control of the subsidiaries until the date the Group loses such control of the subsidiaries. In the case that the accounting policies adopted by subsidiaries are different from the Group's accounting policies, the financial statements of such subsidiaries are, as needed, adjusted in order to be consistent with the Group's accounting policies.
In addition, the Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of certain subsidiaries, such as those which engage in the development of oil and gas in Egypt, of which the fiscal year end date is different from that of the Company. The reason being the impracticability of unifying the fiscal year end date of such subsidiaries with that of the Company due to requirements of local laws and regulations, characteristics of local business or the like.
When the financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared with fiscal year end dates that are different from that of the Company, adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occurred between the fiscal year end dates of such subsidiaries and that of the Company. The fiscal year end date for the majority of such subsidiaries is December 31. The difference between the fiscal year end dates of such subsidiaries and that of the Company never exceeds three months.
If there are changes in the Group's interest in a subsidiary, but the Company retains control over the subsidiaries, such transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction. Any difference between the adjustment to the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration received is recognized directly in equity as equity attributable to owners of the parent.
If control is lost with respect to a subsidiary, the Group
Measurement on March 31, 2018, were reevaluated as of the application date for IFRS 9—Financial Instruments (2014 version). As these relationships were found to meet all of the requirements for hedge accounting, the hedging relationships are ongoing.
derecognizes such subsidiary's assets and liabilities or any non- controlling interests, or the other components of equity, related to such subsidiary.
Any surplus or deficit arising from such loss of control is recognized as profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in such subsidiary after the control is lost, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.
2) Associates and joint ventures
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and operating policies. Significant influence over each of such entities is presumed to exist when the Group owns between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting rights of each such entity.
In the case that the Group holds less than 20 percent of the voting rights of another entity, if it is determined that the Group has significant influence over such entity based on the provision of a board member, a shareholders' agreement or the like, such entity is considered to be an associate of the Group.
Joint ventures are those entities with respect to which multiple parties, including the Group, have joint control over the economic activities by contract and unanimous consent of all of such parties is required when deciding on financial/management strategies, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Except for those that are classified as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), investments made to associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (such associates and joint ventures hereinafter referred to collectively as "Entities subject to Equity Method"). Investments made to Entities subject to Equity Method are each accounted for as the carrying amount following the application of the equity method less accumulated impairment losses. Such carrying amount includes goodwill recognized at the time of acquisition.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of Entities subject to Equity Method from the date the Group obtains significant influence or joint control until the date the Group loses such significant influence or joint control. In the case that the accounting policies adopted by Entities subject to Equity Method are different from the Group's accounting policies, the financial statements of such entities are adjusted, as needed.
In addition, the Consolidated Financial Statements include investments made to Entities subject to Equity Method on dates that differ from the fiscal year end date. This is due to the impracticability of unifying the fiscal year end date as a result of relationships with other shareholders or the like. The fiscal year end date for the majority of Entities subject to Equity Method is December 31. Adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events occurred between the fiscal year end date of Entities subject to Equity Method and that of the Company.
3) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The Group measures the value of goodwill by deducting
 112 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 from the fair value of consideration for the acquisition (which include the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree at the date of such acquisition) the net recognized amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (which is generally the fair value). When such difference is in the negative, such difference is immediately recognized as profit or loss.
Non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, and the measurement method to be applied at the date of acquisition is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
4) Transactions eliminated under consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized profits or losses through intra-group transactions, are eliminated when preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Foreign currency translation
1) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currencies of each company at exchange rates at the dates of such transactions.
Monetary items in foreign currency at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at such date.
Foreign exchange translation differences on monetary items are recognized as profit or loss in the period incurred.
Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost of the foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items in foreign currency that are measured at fair value of such foreign currency are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate as of the calculation date of fair values thereof. With respect to the foreign exchange translation differences of non-monetary items, if gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognized as other comprehensive income, the exchanged portion of such gains or losses will be recognized as other comprehensive income. On the other hand, if gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognized as profit or loss, the exchanged portions of such gains or losses will be recognized as profit or loss.
2) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from acquisitions thereof, are translated to the presentation currency using the exchange rate at the reporting date. In addition, the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to the presentation currency using the average exchange rate for the year excluding cases in which exchange rates are fluctuating significantly.
Foreign exchange translation differences are recognized as other comprehensive income. If the Group's foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative amount of the foreign exchange translation differences related to such foreign operation are reclassified to profit or loss at the time of such disposal.
Based on the application of the exemption clauses under IFRS 1 "First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards," the Group reclassified the cumulative translation differences as of the Transition Date to retained earnings.
(3) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash in the bank that may be withdrawn at any time and short-term
investments with maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible into cash and not subject to any price fluctuation risk.
(4) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of a historical cost basis and net realizable value.
The costs of inventories include purchasing costs, processing costs and all other costs incurred in the process of bringing such inventories to the present location and condition, and are mainly determined based on the average method. Non-fungible inventories are calculated based on the specific identification method.
Inventories that have been acquired with the purpose of generating profits from short-term fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less costs to sell, and changes in the fair values of such inventories are recognized as profit or loss.
(5) Property, plant and equipment
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model, under which property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The costs of property, plant and equipment include costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. If a material component of property, plant and equipment is consumed differently, then such component is accounted for as a separate item of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is mainly computed under the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each component thereof. The estimated useful lives of the following items are as follows:
Buildings and structures: 2 — 60 years Machinery and vehicles: 2 — 40 years Tools, furniture & fixtures: 2 — 20 years
The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least every financial year end and amended as needed.
(6) Goodwill and intangible assets
1) Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
2) Intangible assets
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model and intangible assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired individually are measured at cost. The costs of intangible assets acquired from business combinations are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. With respect to internally-generated intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition, expenditures related thereto are accounted for as expenses at the time they are incurred. With respect to internally-generated intangible assets that meet the criteria for asset recognition, the total of expenditures related thereto that were incurred from the date such criteria was first met is treated as cost.
Intangible assets, for which useful lives may be determined (excluding mining rights), are depreciated under the straight-line method for the period of such estimated use. With respect to mining rights, they are depreciated using the production output method based on estimated mine reserves. In addition, the estimated useful life of software used by the Group is
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 113

 approximately 5 years.
The depreciation methods, the useful lives and residual values
of intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least every fiscal year end and amended as needed.
Intangible assets for which useful lives cannot be determined are not amortized. The Company conducts a review to determine whether the events or circumstances supporting the judgment that useful lives cannot be determined continue to exist at every fiscal year end.
(7) Investment property
An investment property is a property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both. An investment property does not include a property held for sale in the ordinary course of business or property used for the production or supply of goods or service or for other administrative purpose.
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model and investment property is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of an investment property is mainly computed under the straight-line method based on the applicable estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are between 2 years and 50 years. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least every fiscal year end and amended as needed.
(8) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset, which takes a considerable period of time before it is ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of such asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period incurred.
(9) Impairment of non-financial assets
At each fiscal year end, the Group determines whether there is any indication of an impairment loss with respect to the Group's non-financial assets, and, if so, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, of which their useful lives cannot be determined, are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that there may be an impairment with respect thereof. If the carrying amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, such carrying amount is reduced to equal the recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized.
With respect to impairment losses of assets other than goodwill that were recognized in previous fiscal years, the Group determines at each fiscal year end whether such impairment losses have ceased to exist or there are indications that the same have decreased. If any such indications exist, the Group will estimate the recoverable amount of such assets. If such recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of such assets, the carrying amount of the assets is increased to equal the recoverable amount and reversal of impairment losses is recognized. Impairment losses recognized with respect to goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
In addition, because goodwill that constitutes part of the carrying amount of an investment with respect to an Entity subject to Equity Method is not separately recognized, it is not tested for impairment separately. If it is suggested that there may be an impairment loss with respect to an investment made to an Entity subject to Equity Method, the entire carrying amount of such investment will be tested for impairment as a single asset, by comparing the recoverable amount with such carrying amount.
(10) Financial instruments
(Accounting policy applied from April 1, 2018.)
1) Financial assets
At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. The Group initially recognizes financial assets measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income at the date of occurrence, whereas the Group initially recognizes other financial assets on the transaction date.
In cases in which the contractual right with respect to the cash flow from a financial asset is extinguished or the contractual right to receive cash flow from a financial asset has been transferred, and substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of such asset are removed, the Group derecognizes such financial asset.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset that meets the following conditions is classified as financial asset measured at amortized cost.
• The asset is held based on a business model whose objective
is to hold an asset in order to collect cash flow under a
contract, and;
• Based on the contractual terms with respect to the financial
asset, the cash flow, which is intended only for payment of principal and interests on the outstanding principal balance, arises on a specified date.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, the carrying amount of such financial assets measured at amortized cost is calculated using the effective interest method.
(b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets that meet the following criteria are classified as debt instruments measured through other comprehensive income.
• The asset is held based on a business model whose objective
is to achieve both collecting cash flow under a contract and
selling the financial asset, and
• Based on the contractual terms with respect to the financial
asset, the cash flow, which is intended only for payment of principal and interests on the outstanding principal balance, arises on a specified date.
At initial recognition, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive income. However, when such subsequent changes in fair value are financial revenue based on the effective interest method or differences due to foreign exchange and impairment loss, they are recognized as profit or loss. Furthermore, if the equity investment is derecognized, the accumulated amount is reclassified as profit or loss.
(c) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
In regard to equity instruments invested in not for the purpose
114 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 of purchase and sale, an election may be made at initial recognition to present subsequent changes to the fair value of such instruments as other comprehensive income (such election being irrevocable). The Group makes such election per such financial instrument.
At initial recognition, for investment in equity instruments not for the purpose of purchase and sale and for which the Group has elected to present subsequent changes to fair value as other comprehensive income (such election being irrevocable) are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, and the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive income. When the equity investment is derecognized, or the decrease in fair value compared to acquisition cost is substantial, the accumulated amount of other comprehensive income is reclassified as retained earnings, not as profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as profit or loss.
(d) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
All other financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. These assets are measured at fair value at initial recognition, with transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition recognized as profit or loss at the date of occurrence. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, and the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized as profit or loss.
At initial recognition, trade receivables which do not include any significant financing component are measured at trade value.
2) Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts for expected credit loss on financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, lease receivables, contractual assets, and financial guarantee contracts.
If credit risk for financial instruments has not substantially increased from the initial recognition on the reporting date, the Group calculates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected credit loss that result from default events that are possible within the 12-months after the reporting date (12-months expected credit loss). If credit risk for financial instruments substantially increases, however, the Group calculates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected credit loss from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instruments (lifetime expected credit loss). However, an allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables and contractual assets are calculated based on lifetime expected credit loss. When determining whether credit risk substantially increases or not from the initial recognition, the Group refers to obtainable, reasonable and supportable information, such as changes in external and internal credit ratings and past due information. Expected credit loss is based on the difference between contractual cash flow and collectable cash flow, and its estimate incorporates obtainable, reasonable, and supportable information regarding past non-performance, financial standing of the issuer or borrower, and future predictions.
If it is determined that all or part of the financial assets can not be collected or extremely difficult to collect, such as there has been a significant financial difficulty of the issuer or borrower or a breach of contract including past due event, the financial assets are regarded as non-performing. In confirming evidence of credit impairment, the Group makes this determination based on matters such as a significant financial difficulty of the issuer or borrower or a breach of contract including past due event. And,
when there is evidence of credit impairment for the financial assets on the reporting date, the Group estimates expected credit loss separately and calculates allowance for doubtful accounts. For the financial assets for which there is no evidence of credit impairment, the Group classify these together based on similarities in credit risk specifics and the internal credit rating. Then estimate expected credit risk comprehensively to calculate allowance for doubtful accounts.
If there is no reasonable expectation for the partial or full collection of the Group’s claims associated with a financial asset, the Group directly deducts the value from the carrying amount of total financial assets.
3) Financial liabilities
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized on the occurrence date thereof and other financial liabilities are recognized on the transaction date thereof.
Financial liabilities are no longer recognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when obligations specified under a contract are discharged, cancelled or expires.
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities, other than financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value less any transaction costs directly attributable to incurring of such liabilities. After initial recognition, such financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are recognized as profit or loss.
4) Derivatives and hedge accounting
In order to hedge the foreign currency risk, interest rate fluctuation risk and commodity price fluctuation risk, the Group conducts derivative transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, interest rate swap transactions and commodity futures and forwards transactions.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are accounted for as follows:
(a) Fair value hedges
The changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument are recognized as profit or loss. The carrying amount of hedged items is measured at fair value and the gains or losses on such hedged items arising from changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks are recognized as profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow hedges
Of the changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument, portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income and included as another component of equity.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 115

 The amount recognized as other comprehensive income is reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged transaction affects profit or loss; provided however, that if hedging of a scheduled transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non- financial asset or liability, the amount recognized as other comprehensive income is then accounted for as revision to the initial carrying amount of such non-financial asset or liability. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized as profit or loss.
When the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or designation of the hedge is revoked, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the scheduled transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount of the effective portions of the hedge that have been recognized as other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss.
(c) Hedge of a net investment
Of the changes in fair value of derivatives and non-derivates used as a hedge instrument (loans, etc.), portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income and included as another other component of equity. This effective portion recognized as other comprehensive income is reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss at the time of disposition of a foreign operation.
(d) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The changes in the fair value of such derivates are recognized as profit or loss.
5) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount of such offset is presented in the consolidated statements of financial position only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(Accounting policy applied before April 1, 2018.)
The Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010 version). 1) Financial assets
At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Group initially recognizes financial assets that are measured at amortized cost on the date of occurrence. The Group initially recognizes other financial assets on the transaction date.
In cases in which the contractual right with respect to the cash flow from a financial asset is extinguished or the contractual right to receive cash flow from a financial asset has been transferred, and substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of such asset are removed, the Group derecognizes such financial asset.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset that meets the following conditions is classified as financial asset measured at amortized cost.
• The asset is held based on a business model whose objective
is to hold an asset in order to collect cash flow under a
contract; and,
• Based on the contractual terms with respect to the financial
asset, the cash flow, which is intended only for payment of
principal and interests on the outstanding principal balance, arises on a specified date.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, the carrying amount of such financial assets measured at amortized cost is calculated using the effective interest method.
(b) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Of the financial assets that have been classified as financial assets to be measured at fair value instead of at amortized cost, financial assets other than for investment to an equity instrument, of which subsequent changes to the fair value thereof will be presented as other comprehensive income, are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for purchase and sale.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized as profit or loss. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, and subsequent changes in the fair value of such financial assets are recognized as profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Of the financial instruments that have been classified as financial assets to be measured at fair value instead of at amortized cost, in regards to equity instruments invested in not for the purpose of purchase and sale, an election may be made at initial recognition to present subsequent changes to the fair value of such instruments as other comprehensive income (such election being irrevocable). The Group makes such election per such financial instrument.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive income. When the equity investment is derecognized, or the decrease in fair value compared to acquisition cost is substantial, the accumulated amount of other comprehensive income is reclassified as retained earnings and not as profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as profit or loss.
2) Impairment of financial assets
With respect to financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence that an impairment exists at each fiscal year end. A financial asset is determined to be impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of such asset, and there is an effect on such financial asset's cash flow that can be reliably estimated due to such impairment event.
Objective evidence that proves impairment of a financial asset includes, without limitation, the following: re-evaluation of the repayment terms due to breach of contract caused by the debtor's payment default, delinquency or the like or economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor's financial difficulties; indications that the debtor may become bankrupt; disappearance of an active market; adverse changes in the payment status of the borrower; and, economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets.

The Group individually assesses an individually significant

 financial asset, and collectively assesses financial assets that are not individually significant, for objective evidence of impairment. When there is objective evidence that indicates that a financial asset is impaired, such amount of impairment is measured as the
difference between such asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. Such asset's carrying amount is decreased through allowance for doubtful receivables, and the amount of such impairment is recognized as profit or loss. The amount of allowance for doubtful receivables is reduced from the asset's carrying amount directly afterwards when the uncollectible amount was decided. If the amount of such impairment loss decreases due to an event that occurs after recognition of such impairment, the previously recognized impairment loss will be reversed and recognized as profit or loss.
3) Financial liabilities
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized on the occurrence date thereof and other financial liabilities are recognized on the transaction date thereof.
Financial liabilities are no longer recognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when obligations specified under a contract are discharged, cancelled or expires.
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities, other than financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value less any transaction costs directly attributable to incurring of such liabilities. After initial recognition, such financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are recognized as profit or loss.
4) Derivatives and hedge accounting
In order to hedge the foreign currency risk, interest rate fluctuation risk and commodity price fluctuation risk, the Group conducts derivative transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, interest rate swap transactions and commodity futures and forwards transactions.
When initiating a hedge, the Group designates and documents the risk management purposes and strategies regarding the hedge relationship and initiation of such hedge. Such documentation includes the designation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and methods of assessing the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Although such hedging is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, it is assessed on an ongoing basis for its actual effectiveness throughout the reporting periods for which such hedging was designated.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After initial
recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are accounted for as follows:
(a) Fair value hedges
The changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument are recognized as profit or loss. The carrying amount of hedged items is measured at fair value and the gains or losses on such hedged items arising from changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks are recognized as profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow hedges
Of the changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument, portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income.
The amount recognized as other comprehensive income is reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged transaction affects profit or loss; provided, however, that if hedging of a scheduled transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an non- financial asset or liability, the amount recognized as other comprehensive income is then accounted for as revision to the initial carrying amount of such non-financial asset or liability.
When the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or designation of the hedge is revoked, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the scheduled transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount of the effective portions of the hedge that have been recognized as other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified from other component of equity to profit or loss.
(c) Hedge of a net investment
Of the changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedge instrument under the same accounting applied to a cash flow hedge, portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income. Such effective portions are reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss at the time of disposition of a foreign operation.
(d) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized as profit or loss.
5) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount of such offset is presented in the consolidated statements of financial position only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(11) Provisions
A provision is recognized only when the Group has a present obligation (legal or presumptive) as a result of a past event, there is a probability that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle such obligation and a reliable estimate can be made regarding the amount of such obligation.
Where there is materiality in the effects of time value of money, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to said liability.
(12) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets or disposal groups to be collected mainly through sales transactions (but not for continuous use) are classified as held for sale.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 117

 To be classified as held for sale, an asset must be immediately sellable at its present state and have an extremely high probability for such sale. In addition, management must have firm commitment to execute the plan to sell such asset and complete such sale within one year from the date of such classification.
Immediately before being classified as held for sale, an asset, or components of a disposal group, are re-measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. After the classification as held for sale, such asset is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses of an asset that was initially classified as held for sale or disposal group, and subsequent gains or losses arising following the remeasurement are recognized as profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.
When the Group has committed itself to exercise a sales plan involving the loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in such subsidiary after the sale.
(13) Equity
1) Share capital and capital surplus
Proceeds from issuance of equity instruments by the Company are included in share capital and capital surplus. Transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are deducted from capital surplus.
2) Treasury stock
When the Group reacquires treasury stocks, the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity. Transaction costs directly attributable to the reacquisition of treasury stocks are deducted from capital surplus.
In addition, when the Group sells treasury stocks, the consideration received is recognized as an increase in equity.
(14) Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Accounting policy applied from April 1, 2018)
The Group recognizes revenue as the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, based on the five-step approach below.
Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer.
Step 2: Identify the separate performance obligations in the
contract.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance
obligations.
Step 5: Recognize revenue when or as the Group satisfies each
performance obligations.
The Group identifies distinct goods or services included in a contract with customer and performance obligations (the basic transactional unit). Since the Group may fulfill a intermediaries or agent function in normal business transactions, the Group must consider whether it functions as a principal or agent in identifying performance obligations. In cases where the performance obligations essentially promise that the Group itself will provide specific goods or services, the Group is deemed to be a principal; in cases where the performance obligations is to arrange provision of goods or services by another party, the Group is deemed to be an agent. The following indicators are used to
determine whether the Group is principal or agent.
• The Group has primary responsibility for performance of the promised provision of specified goods or services.
• The Group bears inventory risk prior to transferring the specified goods or services to the customer or after transferring the goods or services under the control of the customer.
• Price of the goods or services is set at the discretion of the Group.
In cases where the Group is the principal party to the transaction, the Group recognizes revenue when or as the Group satisfies each performance obligations, as a monetary amount reflecting the expected consideration that the Group is entitled to receive from the exchange of the specified goods or services. Furthermore, in cases where the Group is acting as agent, the Group recognizes revenue when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligations, in the amount of any fee commission, or net revenue the Group is entitled to receive in exchange for arranging provision of the specified goods or services by another party.
The Group recognizes revenue as the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. Revenue does not include consumption tax, VAT, or other money recovered as tax agent. Variable consideration is only including the transaction price if, and to the extent that, it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future when the uncertainty has been subsequently removed. With regards to transaction price, there is no materiality to revenue which includes variable consideration.
In the case where, at the start of the contract, the Group assumes that it will take a year or less between the Group transferring the promised goods or services to the customer and receiving payment from the customer for those goods and services, the Group does not adjust revenue to reflect the impact of significant financing components on the promised consideration for the goods.
The Group recognizes revenue for major transactions at the following points:
(a) Revenue from sale of products
Revenue from sale of products primarily includes wholesaling, retail, sale of products through manufacturing/processing, and sales of real estate. The Group recognizes revenue at the point goods have been delivered, undergone inspection, and met the terms and conditions for delivery as named in the contract. At this point, the Group deems goods to be under the control of the customer and performance obligations to have been satisfied.
In most cases, the Group will receive revenue from the sale of products with in one year of meeting performance obligations. This amount does not include significant financing components.
(b) Revenue from rendering of services or other kinds of sale
Revenue from rending of services or other kinds of sale mainly includes provision of services related to IT systems, automotive part inspections, and building maintenance. Revenue from these services which meets any of the requirements below entails control of the service being transferred for over time. The Group thus determines whether performance obligations have been fulfilled, before recognizing profit according to the degree of progress on performance obligations. The qualities of the goods or services transferred to the customer will be considered in measuring the degree of progress on
118 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 performance obligations.
Requirements:
• The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the
benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group
performs.
• The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for
example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the
asset is created or enhanced.
• The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an
alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
If the Group does not meet above requirements, the Group will recognize revenue at the point that duties have been completed and the Group may claim payment from the customer, since the Group will have been deemed to have satisfied its performance obligations.
In most cases, the Group will receive revenue from rendering of services or other kinds of sale with in one year of meeting performance obligations. This amount does not include significant financial components.
(Accounting policy applied before April 1, 2018.)
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returned goods, discounts and rebates. If there are multiple identifiable components in a single transaction, such transaction is separated into components, and revenue is recognized per such component. On the other hand, when the actual economic state cannot be expressed without treating multiple transactions as one unit, revenue is recognized by treating such multiple transactions as one unit. The recognition standards and presentation method with respect to revenue are as follows:
1) Revenue recognition standards
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks
and rewards associated with the ownership of such goods;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement
to the degree usually associated with ownership nor
substantial control over the goods sold;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• there is a strong possibility that economic benefits associated
with such transaction will flow to the Group; and,
• the costs incurred with respect to such transaction can be
measured reliably.
(b) Rendering of services
If results of revenue from the rendering of services can be reliably estimated, such revenue will be recognized in accordance with such transaction’s degree of progress as of the fiscal year end. If all of the following conditions are satisfied, it is determined that results of a transaction can be reliably estimated:
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• there is a strong possibility that economic benefits associated
with such transaction will flow to the Group;
• such transaction’s degree of progress can be reliably
measured as of the fiscal year end; and,
• the costs incurred with respect to such transaction and the
costs required to complete such transaction can be measured reliably.
If results of a transaction regarding the provision of services cannot be reliably estimated, then revenue is recognized only with respect to portions of which costs are considered recoverable.
2) Method of presenting revenue
When the Group is a party to a transaction, revenue therefrom is presented in gross. When the Group is acting as an agent for a third party in a transaction, revenue is presented in the amount received by such third party less the amount collected on behalf of such third party (i.e., commission).
The following indices are considered when determining whether the Group is acting as a party or an agent with respect to a transaction:
• whether the Group has the primary responsibility with respect to
providing goods or services to the customer or fulfilling an
order;
• whether the Group has an inventory risk before or after receiving
an order from the customer, during shipping or when goods are
returned;
• whether the Group has the right to establish prices, either
directly or indirectly; and,
• whether the Group bears the customer’s credit risk in regards to
accounts receivables against such customer,
• whether the collection schedule for the proceeds is already
decided by transaction or arranged by rate of the proceeds.
(15) Financial income and costs
Financial income comprises interest income, dividend income, gain on sales of financial instruments and gain arising from change in the fair value of financial instruments. Interest income is recognized at the time of receipt by using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized on the date when the Group's right to receive payment is established.
Financial costs comprise interest expenses, loss on sales of financial instruments and loss arising from change in the fair value of financial instruments.
(16) Employee benefits
1) Post-employment benefits
(a) Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans refer to retirement benefit plans other than a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit obligations are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the future amount of benefits that employees will have earned in return for their services provided in the current and prior periods and discounting such amount in order to determine the present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligations.
The discount rates are principally equivalent to the market yields of AA credit-rated corporate bonds at the fiscal year end that have maturity terms that are approximately the same as those of the Group's obligations and use the same currencies as those used for future benefits payments.
Past service cost is immediately recognized as profit or loss.
The Group immediately recognizes all of the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) as other comprehensive income and promptly reclassifies them as retained earnings.
(b) Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are retirement benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or presumptive obligation to pay any amount over its contribution amount. The obligations already paid or to be paid as contributions under the defined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 119

 contribution plans are recognized as expenses in the period in which the employees provided the services related thereto.
(c) Multi-employer plans
Certain subsidiaries participate in pension plans, which are classified as multi-employer plans. In regards to such pension plans, sufficient information to calculate the proportionate share of such plan assets cannot be obtained. Thus, the Group accounts for such pension plans in the same manner in which it recognizes defined contribution plans. In other words, contributions to such multi-employer plans are recognized as expenses in the period in which the employees provided their services.
2) Other long-term employee benefits
Obligations in respect of long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits are calculated by estimating the future amount of benefits that employees will have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods and discounting such amount in order to determine the present value.
3) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are not discounted. Instead, they are accounted for as expenses at the time services related thereto are provided.
With respect to bonuses, the Group owes legal and presumptive payment obligations as a consequence of past employee services provided. If such amount of payment obligations can be reliably estimated, such estimated amount to be paid based on such bonus system is recognized as a liability.
(17) Share-based remuneration
The Group has introduced an equity-settled share-based remuneration system which provides directors and the like with performance-linked share remuneration.
recognized in the following cases:
• when taxable temporary differences arise from initial recognition
of goodwill;
• when they arise from initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a
transaction that is neither a business combination nor affects accounting profit and taxable profit (or loss) at the time of the transaction; and,
• with respect to taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, or interests in joint arrangements, when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and, such deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied on the same taxation entity. However, even in the case of different taxable entities, the Group can set off if the tax taxable entities intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net bases, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, the unused tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits carried forward to the extent that it is probable that they can be used against future taxable profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reassessed at each fiscal year end, and such carrying amount will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that related tax benefits from such assets will be realized.
(19) Lease
The Group determines whether an agreement is of a lease, or contains a lease, based on the substance of such agreement as of the date of commencement of a lease. The substance of an agreement is determined based on the following factors:
(a) whether the performance thereof is dependent on a specified asset or asset group; and,
(b) whether such agreement includes the right to use such asset.
1) Finance lease
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
Lease assets are initially recognized at lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the total of minimum lease payments. After the initial recognition, such lease assets are accounted for based on the applicable accounting policies. Lease payments are apportioned between financing costs and repayment amounts of the lease obligations so as to maintain a certain interest rate against the balance of the liability.
2) Operating lease
An operating lease is a lease except for finance lease. Lease payments are mainly recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In the case the Group is the lessor of an asset under an operating lease, such asset is recognized in accordance with its nature under the consolidated statements of financial position.
Under this system, the service received are measured at the fair value of Sojitz shares at the grant date, and recognized as expense over the period from the grant date to the vesting date with a corresponding amount as an increase in capital surplus.
(18) Income taxes
Income tax expense comprises current tax expenses and deferred tax expenses. These are recognized as profit or loss, except when they arise from items that are directly recognized as other comprehensive income or equity, and from a business combination.
Current tax expenses are measured by the expected taxes receivable from or taxes payable to tax authorities, and the tax amounts are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the fiscal year end.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset and liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base, the unused tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits carried forward. The amounts of tax assets and liabilities are calculated under the expected tax rate or tax law applicable as of the period in which assets are realized or liabilities settled based on a statutory tax rate or the same substantially enacted as of the fiscal year end. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not

 4 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET APPLIED
Major newly established or amended standard and interpretation that were announced by the date of approval of the consolidated
Reporting period on or after which IFRSs Title the application is required
IFRS 16 Leases Period starting from January 1, 2019
IFRS 16 does not require that a lessee classifies its leases into finance lease or operating lease, and introduces a single lessee accounting model. A lessee recognizes, for all leases, a right-of- use asset representing its right use of the underlying lease asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. However, a lessee may elect not to apply the above requirement to short-term and low value lease. After the initial recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, an entity recognizes depreciation cost of the right-of-use asset and interest expense of the lease liability.
Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from current accounting, so lessor will continue to classify all leases using the same classification principle and distinguish between two types of leases: operating and finance lease.
The Group intends to adopt IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019, using a
5 SEGMENT INFORMATION
(1) Summary of reportable segments
Reportable segments are the Group's components for which discrete financial information is available, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors for the purposes of making decisions about resources to be allocated to such segments and assessing their performance.
The Group is an integrated trading company engaged in a wide range of business activities on a global basis. Headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financial activities, both domestically and internationally.
The Group's reportable segments comprise business divisions categorized by goods, services, functions and industries.

  The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its value in use founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management.
The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performance. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated.
The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates that were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively, were as follows.

Parent company's chemical business ........................................................................................................................ 7.6%
Retail & Lifestyle Business
The domestic subsidiaries' food sales business ...................................................................................................... 6.4%
(b) Ultimate growth rate
In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term.
With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.
(2) Intangible assets
Increases/decreases in costs and accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses of intangible assets were as follows.

    An important part of the carrying value of mining rights on March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 is the mining interest held by the Australian subsidiaries, amounting to ¥10,398 million and ¥12,767 million (U.S.$115,018 thousand).
Customer-related assets are included in the carrying value in the category of "Others" on March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.
The value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included above were ¥6,618 million on March 31, 2018, and ¥6,914 million (U.S.$ 62,288thousand) on March 31, 2019. Such assets consisted primarily of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements were mainly acquired through business combinations and were expected to exist as long as business continues. Therefore, management considers the useful lives of these assets to be indefinite.
There were no internally-generated intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019.
Amortization expenses are included in "Cost of sales" and "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

        The fair values are amounts that the Group calculated based on an independent appraiser's appraisals and the "real estate appraisal standards" of the country in which the investment properties are located. These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index.
As set forth under "2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments," fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3.

        Among the assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly related thereto, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and bonds and borrowings are measured at amortized cost and other investments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
As of March 31, 2018, the main assets and liabilities directly related thereto that were classified as held for sale were assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that were included in the Energy & Social Infrastructure segment, and the equity method affiliates that were included in the Foods & Agriculture Business segment. Sojitz Corporation decided to sell its assets as part of its asset replacement program. Thus, the assets and liabilities of the company were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities directly related thereto. The sales were completed in May 2018 and April 2018.
19 EQUITY
(1) Capital management
In order to enhance its enterprise value, the Company has as its basic policies the maintenance of a healthy financial position and stability in its funding structure, accumulation of its own equity through the realization of sustained growth and expansion of its financial base. The Company uses net DER (Note 1) and risk assets ratio (Note 2) as main indices for managing the Company's equity.
FY2020 was the final year of the "Medium-term Management Plan 2020", which aimed for a net DER of 1.5 times or less. In the same period, the target was to manage the risk assets ratio to within 1.0 times. These targets were reached due to improved asset efficiency caused by asset replacement coupled with suppression of increased borrowings.
Notes: 1. Net DER = (Interest bearing liabilities - Cash and cash equivalents - Time deposits) ÷ Own equity (Own equity = Total equity amount less non-controlling inter- ests)
2. Risk assets ratio = Risk asset (such asset amount calculated based on assessment of such risk in correspondence to the size of such risk) ÷ Own equity
 138 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 Net DERs and Risk assets ratios as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively, were as follows.

  20 REVENUE
(1) Disaggregated Revenue
The Group’s structure consists of nine business divisions: Automotive Division, Aerospace & Transportation Project Division, Machinery & Medical Infrastructure Division, Energy & Social Infrastructure Division, Metals & Mineral Resources Division, Chemicals Division, Foods & Agriculture Business Division, Retail & Lifestyle Business Division, and Industrial Infrastructure & Urban Development Division. The Board of Directors regularly reviews this structure in order to decide allocation of management resources and evaluate company performance. Other departments outside of these divisions-administration, domestic branches, logistics and insurance services etc.-are included in "others," with the revenue from such recorded and displayed as "Revenue."
Revenue for each business division for the year ended March 31, 2019 can be found under 5 – Segment Information, (2) – Information regarding reportable segments. Product and service categorization is identical to business category.
(2) Receivables from contracts with customers, contract asset, and contract liability
Receivables from contracts with customers refer to any notes receivable and accounts receivable included under trade and other receivables. There is no materiality to the balance of receivables from contracts with customers, contract asset and contract liability for the year ended March 31, 2019. The contract asset is displayed in "Trade and other receivables" and contract liability is in "Other current liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities."
(3) Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
The following shows the Group’s assumed timing for revenue recognized and performance obligations remaining as of March 31, 2019. Note that these figures do not include contracts for which performance obligations were initially anticipated to remain for only one year or less.

For the year ended March 31, 2019, there were no material assets recognized from the cost to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer. If the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less, the Group recognizes the additional incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense at time of occurrence, as a practical expedient.

 (e) Maturity profile for the defined benefit obligation
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 was 11.1 years and 11.0 years, respectively.
(f) Expected contribution to the plan for the year ending March 31, 2020
The Group expects to contribute ¥686 million (U.S.$6,180 thousand) to plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2020.
3) Defined contribution plan
Expenses recognized for the defined contribution plan for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were ¥1,752 million and ¥1,964 million (U.S.$17,693 thousand), respectively.
4) Multi—employer plans
Nissho Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, was a member of the Tokyo-to Electric Industry Corporate Pension Fund Organization, which is a multi-employer plan, however, the subsidiary withdrew from this fund on May 1, 2018.
This fund is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund until its withdrawal as a post- employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated.
Also, the latest financial position of the plan and ratio of Group contribution to overall plan are not presented because of the withdrawal from this fund as stated above.
In addition, expenses recognized for multi-employer defined contribution plans for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were ¥125 million and ¥18 million (U.S.$162 thousand), respectively.
(2) Employee benefit expenses
Employee benefit expenses recognized for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were ¥103,660 million and ¥116,613 million (U.S.$1,050,567 thousand), respectively.
Employee benefit expenses are included in "Cost of sales" and "Selling, general and administration expenses" in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

 (2) Basic policies for risk management of financial instruments
The Group is an integrated trading company engaged in a wide range of business activities on a global basis. Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature.
(3) Credit risk management
The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company's credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer's creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer.
In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationally-acknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties.
1) Maximum exposure to credit risk
Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group's maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group's maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were ¥26,820 million and ¥33,064 million (U.S.$297,873 thousand), respectively.
2) Increases/decreases in allowance for doubtful accounts and the carrying amount of financial assets

(4) Liquidity risk management
The Group raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions or issuance of bonds. Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets or a significant downgrade to the Group's credit rating by one or more rating agencies, the Group's ability to raise funds may become more restricted, and consequently the Group may not be able to make payments on debt by the due date. To provide additional financial flexibility and liquidity, the Group maintains long-term Commitment Lines of ¥100.0 billion (not used) and U.S.$1.9 billion (U.S.$310 million used). The Group maintains good relationships with financial institutions, including the counterparties to these commitment line agreements.

       The Group is exposed to market risks, such as exchange rate fluctuation risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments, interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financing, investments or the like, commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements/commodity inventories arising
156 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019

 from operating activities and price fluctuation risk associated with the ownership of listed securities (i.e., stock price fluctuation risk). The Group's basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps.
1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk
1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk
The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group's consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen's value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like.
2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk
In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.
In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

        The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds to acquire fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit (e.g., through trade receivables). Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks.
2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk
In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.
Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: cash and cash equivalents; trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable.

3) Commodity price fluctuation risk
1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk
  As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels.

 2. Sensitivity analysis of commodity price fluctuation risk
In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

     The Group has large holdings of marketable securities and, therefore, is exposed to stock price fluctuation risk.
Against such risk, the Group makes efforts to understand market prices and financial conditions or the like of issuers and, with
respect to listed stocks, the Group reviews their holding purposes by each on a periodic basis.

 The fair values stated above are calculated as follows.
(a) Other investments
The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group's corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies.
(b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities
Currency-related derivatives
The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date.
Interest rate-related derivatives
The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk.
Commodity-related derivatives
The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end.
Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2.
2. Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3
The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

  The Group reclassifies to retained earnings cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in either of the following cases: when an investment is disposed of; and,
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2019 161

 when there is a significant decline in the fair value. Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019 were losses of ¥828 million and ¥2,321 million (U.S.$20,909 thousand), respectively.
(8) Hedge accounting
The Group endeavors to minimize market risk using hedging transactions, including forward exchange contract transactions, commodity futures and commodity forwards, and interest rate swaps. Risk management policies for each risk exposure can be found under (5) – Market risk management.
When initiating a hedge, the Group designates and documents the risk management purposes and strategies regarding the hedge relationship and initiation of such hedge. Such documentation includes the designation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and methods of assessing the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. In order to determine whether these hedges were actually effective at the start of hedging and throughout the reporting period for which such hedging was designated, the Group confirms the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument through a qualitative analysis whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument match up or closely correspond, and quantitative analysis whether the value of the hedged item and hedging instrument mutually offsets any fluctuations in price caused by the same risk the hedged item and hedging instrument seek to hedge.
The Group sets an appropriate hedging ratio when initiating a hedge, in accordance with the number of items to be hedged and available hedging instruments. As a general rule, the company matches one hedging instrument to each item to be hedged. If the hedging relationship is deemed ineffective but the purpose of risk management is not changed, this ratio of hedging instruments to hedged items will be readjusted to make the hedging relationship effective. There is no materiality to the impact of the hedging portion deemed ineffective on hedging relationships, including impact from credit risk.
When the Group targets a specific risk element for hedging, determined using the risk management strategy for each risk category, the Group selects those risk elements which comprise a structural element of the total hedging and which can be examined separately from the whole and used to reliably measure fluctuations in cash flow and fair value in response to changes in those risk elements.
1) Types of hedge accounting
(a) Fair value hedges
A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and forwards contracts as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories.
With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from premeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss.
The Group uses fluctuations in the value of hedged items as the basis for recognizing the amount for which hedging was ineffective. For the years ended March 31, 2018, and March 31,2019, these fluctuations were largely in line with changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, and there was no materiality in the ineffective hedging portion recognized as profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency.
With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.
The Group uses fluctuations in the value of hedged items as the basis for recognizing the amount for which hedging was ineffective. For the years ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, these fluctuations were largely in line with changes to the fair value of hedging instruments, and there was no materiality in the ineffective hedging portion recognized as profit or loss. Furthermore, there was no materiality in the amount transferred from other components of equity to profit or loss, since forecast transactions were not anticipated.
(c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations.
With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.
The Group uses fluctuations in the value of hedged items as the basis for recognizing the amount for which hedging was ineffective. For the years ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, these fluctuations were largely in line with changes to the fair value of hedging instruments, and there was no materiality in the ineffective hedging portion recognized as profit or loss.

 (10) Transfer of financial assets
The Group liquidates certain trade receivables by discounting notes or the like. However, with respect to some liquidated receivables, the Group may be obligated to make payments as recourse for non-payment by the debtor. The Group continues to recognize such liquidated receivables as they do not meet the criteria for derecognition of financial assets.
The Group recognized such liquidated assets as "Trade and other receivables" in the amounts of ¥20,894 million and ¥22,776 million (U.S.$205,189 thousand) as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. In addition, liabilities relating to the deposit amounts which arose upon the transfer of such assets were accounted for as "Bonds and borrowings" in the amounts of ¥20,894 million and ¥22,776 million (U.S.$205,189 thousand) as of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, respectively. Such liabilities are settled when payments for such liquidated assets are made, and the Group may not use such liquidated assets until such settlement occurs.
(11) Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
As of March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, financial assets and financial liabilities recognized for the same counterparties included financial instruments that were not offset even though they were covered by an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement because they did not meet some or all of the offsetting criteria, were as follows.

34 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
The Company has introduced an equity-settled share-based remuneration system which provides directors and the like with performance- linked share remuneration. Under this system, the service received are measured at the fair value of Sojitz shares at the grant date, and recognized as expense over the period from the grant date to the vesting date with a corresponding amount as an increase in capital surplus.
The Company has introduced this system as a remuneration system closely linked to corporate performance and having high transparency and objectivity, with the objective of heightening directors’ and executive officers’ awareness toward making contributions to improving Sojitz’s performance and to increasing its corporate value over the medium-to-long term.
The system uses a BIP trust (Board Incentive Plan trust).
This trust delivers and provides Sojitz shares and cash equivalent to the conversion amount of Sojitz shares ("Sojitz Shares," collectively) as well as dividends on the Sojitz shares to directors, commensurate with factors such as executive rank and achievement level of performance targets.
Shares held by the BIP trust are recorded as treasury stock, with the system recorded as equity-settled share-based remuneration.
The Company recognizes share remuneration expenses for the year ended March 31, 2019 based on the share delivery points which the Company anticipates will be granted to directors for the service for the year ended March 31, 2019. The number of shares held in trust as of March 31, 2019 was 1,727,600.
The Company recorded ¥132 million (U.S.$ 1,189 thousand) in expenses related to this system for the year ended March 31, 2019. There were no such expenses recorded for the year ended March 31, 2018 as the year ended March 31, 2019 is the first year following the system’s introduction.

     * What does “Hassojitz” on the back cover mean?
“Hassojitz” is based on a cross between the Japanese word for “idea” (hasso) and our company name, Sojitz. (Hasso x Sojitz =Hassojitz)
We are a company that creates new value through the power of ideas, and this concept exemplifies our belief that the initiatives taken on by individual employees help contribute to the realization of new businesses.

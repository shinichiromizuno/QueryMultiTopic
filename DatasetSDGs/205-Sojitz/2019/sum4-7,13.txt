HOW WE GET THERE
Sustainability
Working to achieve the Sustainability Challenge (Initiatives in the Year Ended March 2019)
Initiatives for Low Carbon and Decarbonization
   Environment
 Our Group is ”working to achieve a decarbonized society through our business activities” as set out in the “Sustainability Challenge“, and we are promoting initiatives that link business to measures against climate change, such as our renewable energy business. These initiatives are based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement adopted in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in 2015. In August 2018, we declared our endorsement of the final recommendations of the TCFD*1 and are striving to
Status of Initiatives According to the TCFD Framework
Governance
We scrutinize climate-related risks and opportunities and discuss their influence on our business strategies based on promotion and implementation systems centered on the Sustainability Committee (Committee Head: CEO).
The details of these proceedings are regularly reported to the Management Committee and the Board of Directors, and the latter supervise and give direction when necessary.
Strategy
cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders, proactively disclose information, and improve our transparency.
*1 The TCFD recommends disclosure in relation to risks and opportunities linked to climate change in terms of four themes: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.
Risk Management
We assess and identify the CO2 emissions risk of each of our Group-operated businesses by using external investigations by third parties which cover the greenhouse gas emissions statistics by industry, alternative technology trends, and policy and regulatory trends.
In addition to the deliberation process for investments and loans that involves managing individual business risks, we also hold regular meetings between our business divisions and management to discuss and assess the effect of climate-related risks and opportunities on our businesses.
      Based on external investigations and internal analysis, we are working on sequential scenario analysis of the business fields believed to present the greatest risks and opportunities to our Group’s business activities, management strategy, and financial planning. The scenario analysis is then analysed to determine financial impact. *2
Scenario analysis of coal interests business and power generation business
   Method
Financial Impact
Coal interests business
Demand and price forecasting is conducted based on a number of assumed scenarios by 2040, including the 2°C scenario, followed by analyzing the value of Sojitz’s assets
- Our thermal and coking coal businesses have a certain cost competitiveness
- Even in the scenario that might influence asset value, the effect on Sojitz businesses is limited
Power generation business
Analyzing the cost influence of Sojitz’s assets accompanying an anticipated increase in environmental taxes conducted based on a number of assumed scenarios by 2040, including the 2°C scenario
- We have confirmed the cost resilience of our assets
- We have made predictions to enable us to respond to conditions,
even if those conditions change in the future, so the effect on Sojitz businesses is limited

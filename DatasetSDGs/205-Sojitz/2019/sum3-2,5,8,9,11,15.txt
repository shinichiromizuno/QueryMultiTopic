Initiatives for sustainable growth
Vietnam is continuing to experience strong economic growth. Its middle class is growing as the standard of living improves, and the modernization of lifestyles, together with the modernization of forms of distribution and retail, is rapidly progressing. In this context, Sojitz launched a retail business through its convenience store management business in 2015; in 2017 we made use of this to start producing and selling daily/prepared food. We have taken advantage of the high-performance logistics infrastructure of our wholesale food business, which we took on in 2008, and of our four temperature logistics business, which we started in 2016, and are creating food logistics functions from production to retail. In addition, in 2018, we formed a strategic business alliance with The Pan Group Joint Stock Company (PAN), a major food and agribusiness company in Vietnam. Aiming to improve food quality and achieve affluent lifestyles, we are focusing our efforts on creating new businesses relating to farming and food processing.

paper-manufacturing company.
SGP is a market-leading manufacturer of household
paper products, which include tissues and toilet paper, and is widely recognized and trusted throughout Vietnam for its high quality. The company also boasts a top-class track record in the industrial paper sector; approximately 60% of the old paper supply used as a raw material for its containerboard is obtained through the company’s own paper recycling centers, making it a recycling-based business striving to reduce its impact on the environment. Sojitz is taking on the responsibility of supporting fundraising and investment capital and strengthening organizational systems, and is forming policies to drive the expansion of business areas with a view to cooperating with trading partners in the future.
In this way, we have contributed to the development of Vietnam over many years through our wide-ranging businesses. We will utilize our experiences of managing these businesses and our management expertise in developing businesses all around the world, and continue to be helpful to the daily lives of the people of Vietnam.

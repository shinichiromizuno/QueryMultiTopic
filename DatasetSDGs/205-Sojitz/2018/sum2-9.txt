Participation in operations of an international airport to aid sustained development in Palau
 Palau receives about 130,000 tourists annually, and with this number on the rise, the country’ s sole international airport, Palau International Airport has grown in importance. To redevelop this national-level transportation infrastructure, Sojitz set up Palau International Airport Corporation together with the government of Palau in August 2017, through an intermediate holding company established jointly by Sojitz and Japan Airport Terminal Co., Ltd. We also concluded a 20-year contract with the government at that time, entrusting us with refurbishing and expanding the airport terminal, as well as managing its operations.
We will leverage our partner company’s airport industry knowledge and network, as well as their expertise in managing passenger terminals to enrich commercial facilities and improve passenger services and convenience. We will also take an active role in making policies to promote tourism and strive to
contribute to sustainable economic and social development in Palau, where tourism is the key industry.

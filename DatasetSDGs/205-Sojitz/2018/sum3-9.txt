Promoting the construction and business operation of the Ikitelli Integrated Health Campus to contribute to advancement of medical infrastructure in Turkey
How We Get There 2
   The government of Turkey introduced national public insurance system in 2008. This resulted in more Turkish citizens with health coverageâ€”improvements in average life expectancy (rising from 71 to 75 years within a 10-year period) and infant mortality rates being the biggest indicators. Meanwhile, it also led to more patients. Modernization of state hospitals and improvement of medical treatment are challenges for the country. To deal with this pressing healthcare need, the Turkish Ministry of Health planned a range of investment to create more hospitals, using a scheme whereby public and private organizations collaborate to provide nationalized service as well as investment to increase the number of hospital beds to 40,000.
Sojitz concluded a 25-year contract with the Turkish Ministry of Health to participate in the construction and business operation for the Ikitelli Integrated Health Campus. One of the largest Health Campuses is located in Istanbul and houses 2,682 hospital beds with a cardiovascular hospital and an oncology hospital, among others. The facilities are under construction and scheduled to begin operation in October 2020.

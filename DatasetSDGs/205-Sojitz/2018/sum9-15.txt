Forests are not only essential for procuring lumber and woodchips, but also play a role in protecting the environment, such as securing water resources, preventing landslides, and maintaining biological diversity. Therefore, it is imperative that we operate from a sustainability perspective by protecting forests and using forest products efficiently.
The Sojitz Group is working to build businesses that, both, protect the global environment and promote the development of local communities through sustainable procurement and efficient use of forest resources.
To ensure sustainable procurement, we have established a Wood Procurement Policy and set evaluation criteria for the wood we purchase. By surveying each supplier, we have established a stable supply structure for reliable and safe timber products which considers not only the legality of logging operations, but also the impact on ecosystems in the place of origin and the living environments of local residents. Additionally, we are responding to social needs by effectively using forest resources. Specifically, we make an effort to see
that no precious wood (from timber to mill ends) is wasted at each stage. In future, we will use these functions to our strength and consider entering the business for manufacturing fuel for biomass thermal power generation by effectively using mill ends, as well as the business for biomass-fired thermal power generation.

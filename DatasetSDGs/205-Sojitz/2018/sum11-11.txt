In our domestic real estate business, we are expanding out from the general real estate management business, such as managing buildings and condominiums, to a general life solutions business, which will provide high-value-added services to working people and residents. As part of this effort, we considered social needs such as supporting the active participation of women in the workplace, and the problem of children being waitlisted for daycares. Through Sojitz General Property Management Corporation, we moved to acquire full ownership of daycare management company Angelica Co., Ltd., which provides high-level services mainly within the 23 wards of Tokyo. In that sense, while working together with our domestic real estate business, we are advancing the daycare management business in a way that leverages our functions as a general trading company.
We entered the daycare management business in 2016, and the number of children in our daycare centers has already surpassed 1,200, largely in the Tokyo metropolitan area. This number is expected to grow by hundreds in the next three years.
Through this daycare management business, Sojitz will continue to contribute to creating a society which enables guardians to both work and raise children, as well as facilitate the healthy growth of the children who will carry the future of Japan.

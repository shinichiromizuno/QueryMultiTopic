Using IoT and AI for tuna farming to ensure a stable supply of sustainable marine resources
 Marine resources are garnering attention as sources of quality proteins and health foods. As their demand increases globally, stricter international fishing regulations are coming into force for some fish, including tuna. In this context, we became the first general trading company to enter the tuna farming business by establishing Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima in 2008. Our objective was to provide a stable supply of sustainable marine resources by harnessing the knowledge we had acquired from handling imports of frozen tuna. In 2010, we shipped the first batch of cultured tuna to the markets. In 2016, we set up Sojitz Tuna Farm Hassho in the warm climate of Kushimoto City, Wakayama Prefecture, as an intermediate growing business for juvenile tuna to improve their survival rate.
In order to increase efficiency in the aquaculture business, we also jointly developed a system with NTT DOCOMO and Information Services International-Dentsu, Ltd. using IoT and AI to visualize and analyze tuna farming expertise such as for feed
optimization and other farming processes. We will continue verification tests of the system to contribute to the advancement of Japanâ€™s aquaculture business.

Contributing to reduction of environmental impact
of the automotive-related industry through value-added sustainability
 The eco-vehicles market is growing rapidly because of strict regulations on carbon dioxide emissions mainly being implemented in Europe and China. This has led to a rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries for automobiles, which is expected to grow by roughly five times in the coming ten years as practical application of batteries using materials other than lithium continues to be difficult.
Sojitz boasts a track record of over 40 years in trading lithium resources as well as related components and products. It possesses a wealth of knowledge from trading with a broad range of companies, including materials manufacturers, battery materials manufacturers and battery manufacturers. We also hold a premier lineup among trading companies and are contributing to creating a supply chain for customers in the form of a “department store for lithium-ion batteries,” where we are able to supply materials and battery materials all in one place. In MTP 2020, we will strive to develop this business as
an earnings foundation for our Division by conducting businesses focused on the view point of our customers.

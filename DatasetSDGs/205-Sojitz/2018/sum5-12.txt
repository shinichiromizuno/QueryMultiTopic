Focusing on sale and spread of green polyethylene
to promote a shift away from dependence on petroleum
How We Get There 2
   The world is calling for the chemicals industry to shift towards products that are conscious of natural ecosystems and local environmental issues, to help preserve the environment and prevent pollution. Green polyethylene is a concrete example of one such product. It is a plant-based plastic made from sugarcane and is gaining attention in light of the recent surge in crude oil prices and increased emphasis on corporate social responsibility as well as among other perspectives.
As sugarcane absorbs carbon dioxide during growth, green polyethylene is considered to emit zero net carbon dioxide when burned as a waste material. This means that carbon dioxide emissions, when compared to existing petroleum-based polyethylene, can be up to 70% lower—even when emissions from the manufacturing and transportation process are taken into account.
In 2012, Sojitz Pla-Net acquired sales right from a Brazilian petrochemical company “Braskem S.A”—a sole manufacturer of green polyethylene in the world, to sell their products in Asia and Oceania. This has enabled us to strengthen a structure that supports one-stop “greening” solutions for customer products,

from sale of raw materials for resins to final end products. We are striving to spread environment-friendly packaging materials made from green polyethylene by collaborating with major convenience stores, super markets and other retailers, along with developing products and supporting discovery of new markets for small and medium businesses.

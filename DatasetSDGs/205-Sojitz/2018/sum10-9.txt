Contributing to the growth of the region through comprehensive urban infrastructure development, in addition to expanding the industrial park business
How We Get There 2
   More and more companies are looking to expand into Asia, and a new foundation to grow their business is to entry well-located industrial parks equipped with functions, such as water and electricity supply, and communication networks.
In 1996, Sojitz established the LOTECO Industrial Park, becoming the first Japanese company to build an industrial park in Vietnam. We created a maintenance management system that works around the clock all 365 days, and developed a basic infrastructure capable of providing stable electricity, water supply and waste water processing. We also stationed permanent Japanese staff within the park as part of a full support system in response to the needs of each client. Services include assistance with procedures for establishing local subsidiaries, filing various types of applications, constructing plants, and recruiting employees, as well as supplying raw materials. Based on these integrated business functions, ranging from development of an industrial park to its management and operation, we are currently using our diverse know-how to develop Deltamas City, a

Beyond industrial park development, we are also catering to the needs of the locations by building schools for vocational training, shopping centers and houses, and promoting construction of “smart cities”, which will contribute to regional development.

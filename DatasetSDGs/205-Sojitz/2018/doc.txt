Editorial Policy
Sojitz attaches importance to the role of our Integrated Report as a communication tool to help a wide range of readers understand our business activities and business model� The theme of the Integrated Report 2018 is maximizing “two types of value”: “value for Sojitz” and “value for society,” and we have endeavored to edit this report with a focus on creating the Sojitz Group Statement, and the connectivity between our stakeholders and our sustained growth as well as recent management results, based on the Integrated Reporting Framework proposed by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC)�
Note on Forward-Looking Statements
The information about future performance (forward-looking statements) in this integrated report is based on information available to management at the time of its disclosure� Accordingly, readers are advised that actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to a wide variety of factors including, but not limited to, conditions in the Company’s principal overseas and domestic markets, economic conditions, and changes in foreign currency exchange markets�
Priority Initiatives
United Nations Global Compact
Sojitz signed the United Nations Global
Compact (UNGC) to clarify its ideals in its
global operations, including respect for the
environment and human rights through
businesses that comply with international
standards as well as the laws of countries
and regions� The UNGC calls for companies
to exercise leadership as members of the
international community and pursue
sustainability through their businesses� Sojitz joined the UNGC in 2009� We support the 10 principles of the UNGC in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption, and practice these principles through our business activities�
Sustainable Development Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for the resolution of 17 worldwide priority social issues by 2030� Under the leadership of the United Nations, the goals were adopted in 2015 by 193 member nations� Given the medium- to long-term expectations stakeholders have for the resolution of these issues, Sojitz took the SDGs into account when clarifying the Group’s CSR Focus Areas (current key Sustainability Issues (materiality))� P.26
                     
Building on Steady
Growth for the Future
Sojitz continually strives to realize new goals while learning from the past.
We will continue to work to realize fast-paced management from the frontlines of business, and create and expand of “clusters of revenue-generating businesses.”
Since its founding, Sojitz has never ceased to pursue new challenges and further growth, while learning from the past�
In recent years, we have worked to create businesses with stable revenue, or “clusters of revenue-generating businesses” by constructing earnings foundations with market resilience—a challenge faced by trading companies—and implementing a nine-division framework in April, 2015 to achieve value creation more swiftly�
We have also achieved greater speed in management decisions made at the front lines of the business, which has increased our earnings capacity, and allowed us to establish an unprecedented strong earnings foundation over the course of the previous medium-term management plan�
Sojitz announced its “Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 ~Commitment to Growth~” in May 2018 with the aim of accumulating greater clusters of revenue-generating business� We plan to build on our past initiatives to expand Sojitz’s earnings capacity to achieve stable growth, and focus on new challenges aimed at further development� This approach is expressed in the plan’s subtitle, “Commitment to Growth�”
Continuing to take on new challenges is integral to the Sojitz spirit� In doing so, we seek to maximize our two types of value—“value for Sojitz” and “value for society”—to realize sustainable growth and create a more prosperous society�

Masayoshi Fujimoto
Representative Director, President and CEO
 
  Medium-Term Management Plan 2017—Challenge for Growth—wrapped up last fiscal year. How do you view the results of that effort?
We managed to build solid clusters of revenue-generating businesses to live up to performance expectations.
Where We’re Going
 Having established finances through the initiatives of our Medium-Term Management Plan 2014 (hereinafter “MTP 2014”), we designed Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 (hereinafter “MTP 2017”) to expand our earnings foundation via proactive investments and loans, an objective expressed in the plan’s subtitle “Challenge for Growth.” Under MTP 2017, we achieved ¥315.0 billion in new investments and loans—one of our three-year quantitative targets—to rapidly amass a healthy base of prime assets capable of generating stable earnings. The majority of those assets fell into the non-resource sector. In addition to helping us keep our free cash flow positive throughout the period, our investment strategy facilitated a shift away from the high market volatility of resource assets toward non-resource assets, which are less susceptible to the effects of market fluctuations. We also
met four of our five other quantitative targets: an ROA of 2% or higher, an ROE of 8% or higher, a net DER of 1.5 times or lower, and a payout ratio of around 25%. Although we came up short on the fifth target, a net profit of ¥60.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2018, the end total—¥56.8 billion—was just off the mark. In terms of profits by division, we set our sights on creating “clusters of revenue-generating businesses” capable of producing anywhere from ¥5.0 to ¥10.0 billion in net profits. While the Chemicals Division was the only division with over ¥5.0 billion in profits when MTP 2017 started, four more divisions—the Automotive Division, Infrastructure & Environment Business Division, Metals & Coal Division, and Retail & Lifestyle Business Division—reached the target revenue plateau in the year ended March 31, 2018. Earning capabilities are clearly demonstrating an upward trajectory.
          Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 15
 
Message from the President
Why did you decide to raise the dividend payout ratio from 25% or so to around 30%?
A As we keep developing a stronger earnings foundation, we will continue to make growth investments and offer larger shareholder returns.
Our basic policy on dividends focuses on paying stable dividends on an ongoing basis while enhancing competitiveness and shareholder value by increasing internal capital reserves and using them effectively. For us at Sojitz, dividends represent one of our most important management issues.
With that basic policy in place, our dividend target in MTP 2017 was to achieve a consolidated payout ratio of around 25%. We paid out dividends at 11 yen per share this fiscal year, which kept pace with the goal over the MTP period at an average ratio of 25.4% relative to profits for the year attributable to owners of the Company. Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 (hereinafter “MTP 2020”) puts that target even higher: a payout ratio of approximately 30%. The decision to set an even more ambitious objective came from our growing successes; from a management perspective, we know that we are at a sufficient earnings level to secure growth-sustaining investment funding even if we raise the dividend payout ratio. By continuing to expand our earnings foundation, we are confident that we can live up to the expectations of our shareholders and investors.
What are the basic approaches and policies shaping the new Medium-Term Management Plan?
A We are going to keep making investments and loans through our “Commitment to Growth.”

  Q
 Our business environment is getting more and more uncertain by the day. While trade issues dominate US discourse and interest rates in developed countries continue to rise, China is enacting economic policies with a global impact, emerging countries are rife with geopolitical risk, and Japan is bracing for potential economic repercussions in the wake of the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. Macroeconomic factors of all kinds are clouding the picture. Meanwhile, medium- to long-term growth also hinges on businesses that tackle social issues, given the context of increasing ESG investments and the spread of the UN’s SDGs, as well as businesses that contribute to the fourth industrial revolution, a process that revolves around AI, the IoT, and other cutting-edge technologies. These emerging business
areas present major business opportunities, teeming with potential.
In formulating our new MTP, we thus put our core emphasis on achieving steady growth. That basic concept includes two key focus areas. One centers on making our projects from MTP 2017 profitable, an effort that foregrounds progressive continuity with MTP 2014 and MTP 2017. The other main focus is on continuing to make new investments and, loans, and to see those projects through to solid earnings—all the while maintaining proper risk management and sound financial discipline— as we stay on the lookout for growth opportunities and remain mindful of uncertainty. It goes without saying then, that we need to pull out of or overhaul our unprofitable, low-efficiency businesses, while
16 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018
 
 simultaneously taking our functions to the next level, and enhancing the value of our existing businesses. We are also aiming to post annual profits for the year exceeding ¥100.0 billion in the post-MTP 2020 period. To put ourselves in prime position to meet that ambitious goal, we will continue to increase the number of business divisions with the potential to earn ¥10.0 billion—not just the basic benchmark of ¥5.0 billion—in net profits.
We have instructed our divisions to create specific plans to facilitate further improvements in earning
capabilities for the future. As a means of keeping everything on the right track, we will implement regular, ongoing verifications and continually confirm the state of progress on these plans. “Commitment to Growth,” the subtitle of MTP 2020, reflects management’s firm, unbending determination to keep pushing the Company forward. Building on the foundation that we have laid through years of disciplined, growth-oriented investments and loans, we will continue to make meaningful progress on sustained growth into the future.
How do you see the Company’s prospects for achieving its profit target of ¥75.0 billion or more for the year ending March 31, 2021?
A We expect to reach our goal of ¥75.0 billion in profits for the year, with investments and loans playing a vital part in driving earnings.
Q
Where We’re Going
 Earnings contributions from projects realized under MTP 2017 came to a final total of approximately ¥8.0 billion. The plan included ¥315.0 billion in total investments and loans, roughly half of which we effected in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The coming payoffs thus put earnings on an upward trajectory, with investments and loans on course for an earnings contribution of approximately ¥12.0 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021—a figure that accounts for planned projects and bookings by division. We also expect our ¥300.0 billion in investments and loans scheduled for MTP 2020 to contribute over ¥10.0 billion to our total earnings in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, and enable us to recover roughly ¥150.0 billion for the three- year cumulative principal. We have already approved and launched around one-third of the new ¥10.0 billion
investment and loan plans, around 60% of which we believe will turn into solid earnings. With that initial lift, we believe that our net annual profit goal for the year ending March 31, 2021—¥75.0 billion—will be easily within reach.
Profit growth is just one part of the equation, however. We also need to focus on managing our balance sheet effectively. Although we met our MTP 2017 ROA goal of 2%, we will continue to accumulate quality assets and replace assets in hopes of enhancing overall value and pushing our ROA over the 3% threshold. Our efforts under MTP 2017 also successfully brought our ROE right up to the 10% level (9.99%). Moving into MTP 2020, we are now aiming to lift that value over the 10% mark and expand our total equity at the same time.

 Message from the President
What kinds of businesses do you see driving growth into the post-MTP 2020 context?
A As we continue to make our strong businesses even stronger, we are aiming to leverage better inter-division synergy into profits for the year totaling ¥100.0 billion.
Q
 In addition to accumulating a steady stream of prime assets in the automotive, aerospace and transportation project, overseas urban infrastructure, and energy and social infrastructure areas, where we have an established record of investments and loans, we are also putting an emphasis on areas that are anticipated to be central to ongoing development in Asia: segments like chemicals, foods and agriculture, and retail and lifestyle business. We are also going to continue to actively pursue business acquisitions. Our new M&A Management Office, a cross- divisional organization that we set up to steadily and efficiently carry out acquisitions will help facilitate PMI and enable integration effects that will put acquisition projects in position to start paying off right out of the gate.
Making these business areas even stronger is just one part of the effort. We are also working to maximize our “comprehensive strength” by reaching across organizational borders and fusing the unique features that each of our nine divisions brings to the table. That synergy will help in the drive to expand profits, a vital part of our key initiative to achieve ¥100.0 billion in profits for the year in the post-MTP 2020 period. The urban infrastructure business of our Industrial Infrastructure & Urban Development Division is a good example of how that of how cross-collaboration works. The entire constitution of the urban infrastructure business is an amalgam of our different strengths: the planning, development, and marketing capabilities that we have honed through our experience developing and operating industrial parks; the service-provision skills
that the Retail Division offers; the value-enhancing prowess that we owe to our work in running commercial facilities; and the Machinery & Medical Infrastructure Division’s strengths in coordinating with other businesses and formulating business schemes—two capabilities that grew out of our involvement in a PPP project for a Turkish hospital. By bringing those elements together, we can deliver higher-value-added urban infrastructures and contribute to regional development with sustained growth. The Retail & Lifestyle Business Division’s “Meat One” project, which helps establish a distribution network for imported meat in Japan, also draws on collaborations with a variety of partners.
As AI and the IoT propel the digital revolution forward and new technologies emerge, management is also leading the way in enabling the Company to adapt to the resulting changes in business models. We set up the Business Innovation Office, in April 2018 to serve as a dedicated organization to help facilitate the process. Consolidating the information and activities of the company’s various divisions, the new Office works to coordinate with startup companies and other external networks in the hopes of accelerating the processes of tackling innovation and creating viable business in new sectors. At the same time, we are planning to expand the scope of the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) frameworks currently utilized in some of our divisions to cut back on routine tasks and streamline business operations. RPA technologies will help us allocate our human resources more effectively, thereby creating a cycle with enhanced productivity.

 Sojitz’s vision is to achieve “two types of value” through constant, sustained growth. How do you want to make that happen?
A Our new long-term vision of sustainability,
which extends all the way to 2050, will help guide the way.
Q
Where We’re Going
 We at Sojitz strive to create two types of value through our business activities: “value for Sojitz,” which fortifies the profits, human resources, expertise, and other components that make up our business foundation, and “value for society,” which cultivates solutions to the social issues standing in the way of environmental preservation and hindering the healthy development of economies, industries, and daily life infrastructures on regional and national scales. If we can strengthen businesses that deliver both types of value and foster a more sustainable society, we know that we will be able to actualize the Sojitz Group’s Corporate Statement and live up to the expectations and needs of our shareholders and the international community at large. Bringing those efforts to fruition hinges on the idea of sustainability. The sustainability perspective is now critical in shaping discussions conducted by our Finance & Investment Deliberation Council, where members deliberate and make decisions on important investment projects. In April 2018, we also laid out our “Sustainability Challenge”—a long-term vision that centers on realizing a decarbonized society and respecting human rights—to go along with our six Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality). MTP 2020 represents a preparatory phase in that far-reaching vision. In line with our Sustainability Challenge, we have already started to
expand businesses capable of laying the groundwork for a decarbonized society over the next 10 years and set division-specific action plans in motion. We have also renamed the existing CSR Committee as the “Sustainability Committee.” I serve as the committee chair, strengthening the link between our sustainability initiative and overall management. P.29
 What does the Company need to focus
on as it works toward continued growth and sustainability?
A Front-line capabilities, speed, and innovation: our three keys to developing human resources
Q
 For a trading company, there are no business assets more important than human resources. Ever since I took over as president, we have been working to create the right environment for enhancing our front-line capabilities, speed, and innovation—three keys that form a shared consciousness uniting our personnel. The first key is building “front-line capabilities” through experience. We entrust our work to people who have motivation and skill, regardless of age, gender, nationality, or any other characteristic. “Speed” is the next key. Fostering an open corporate culture allows our employees to take on new challenges, and we encourage our staff to make decisions with a sense of speed, while honing their abilities to think and take on responsibility
like a manager. We also need to provide our employees with environments where they can think outside the box, explore ideas collaboratively, and create “innovation,” the third key. How do we go about establishing the ideal environment for developing our human resources? That, I believe, is my responsibility as President & CEO. In addition to providing our resources with a climate to thrive in, I look forward to meeting our stakeholders’ expectations as the Sojitz Group continues to create the “two types of value” so essential to its vision.

  Seiichi Tanaka
Representative Director,
Senior Managing Executive Officer, CFO
Drive ongoing growth through sound financial discipline.
Q What is your assessment of how the year’s financial and capital strategies played out?
A We successfully made new investments and loans totaling roughly ¥300.0 billion, while maintaining good control over our free cash flow.
In MTP 2017, we established two main goals: keeping our free cash flow positive over the plan’s three-year period and making investments and loans with a total value of more than ¥300.0 billion. Successfully completing both of those objectives is, to me, an important step toward solid growth in the next medium term plan.
Another success was our net DER, which ended up at 1.03 times—a solid level that fell within our MTP 2017 target of 1.5 times or lower.
We are also expanding our global cash management system, which enables centralized funding management for our domestic and overseas Group companies, and secure long-term funding in foreign currencies via our financial subsidiaries. As a result, we have been able to improve our funding efficiency on a Group-wide basis and fortify our operations against the impact of rapid changes in the business environment, fluctuations in currency rates and interest rates, and other market risks.
Q What are the balance sheet (BS) and cash flow (CF) management goals in Medium-Term Management Plan 2020?
A Our goal is to maintain
a positive cumulative three-year core cash flow.
MTP 2020 sets a target to post a positive cumulative core cash flow1 over the plan’s three-year period, which runs through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. That goal sends a clear message to both the Sojitz community and outside observers: we place real importance on managing our investments within the limits of our generated cash, which means that we focus on profits accompanied by the recovery of cash. Our efforts to maintain solid control over our free cash flow will also remain a priority.
Although I doubt that keeping our core cash flow positive will prompt increases in leverage, we will work to maintain a net DER of under 1.5 times—like we did under MTP 2017—even amidst the market volatility of potential spikes in the yen and falling stock prices.
Note 1: Core cash flow = Core operating cash flow (excluding changes in working capital from operating cash flow) + Investing cash flow (including asset replacement) - Dividends paid

 Where We’re Going
                          Q What kinds of things do you want to focus on as Sojitz continues to make growth investments?
A We are aiming to ensure that the investments we made under MTP 2017 turn profitable and to enhance the quality of our new investments to an even higher level.
Under MTP 2020, one key focus will be making the investments from the previous MTP profitable, and further enhancing the quality of our new investments. We have always monitored our investments closely, but we want to do an even better job of ensuring investments are successful. Through our new M&A Management Office, we will be able to consolidate our PMI2 and post-merger value enhancement functions, as well as share information more easily with management—a new part of our organizational system that will help drive Sojitz’s success rates upward.
In terms of our future investments, we will work to set up projects and due-diligence frameworks as early as possible so that we can focus our management resources on high-quality investment initiatives.
Keeping a careful eye on the scope of our goodwill, we also want to build a strong, balanced portfolio with an effective mix of low-volatility assets and assets with high potential returns.
Note 2: Abbreviation of “Post Merger Integration.” This refers to the integration process used to maximize the initial integration effects following a planned M&A. The scope of integration includes all related processes, including management, administration, and corporate culture.
Q What is the most important message you wish to convey to your readers?
A We are going to maintain a sustainable growth cycle by continuing to accumulate quality assets and by making our financial discipline stronger than ever.
Given the diversity of potential investment projects, deciding which projects to pursue can pose a challenge. At Sojitz, we take a common-sense approach to that process: we examine each application, check all the details to see if the content is suitable, and make our decisions accordingly. Every step is a careful, measured part of our evaluation. I believe this approach is a proven, surefire way to accumulate quality assets.
To keep that investment process going strong, we also need to recover cash from those quality assets so that we can secure a solid foundation of capital for shareholder returns and new investments.
As we continue to gather quality assets and enhance our financial discipline, the positive growth cycle will go on turning—and help sustain Sojitz’s growth into the future.

Corporate Departments review all investment proposals, forming improvement policies and reconsidering business policies (If an investment proposal conflicts with exit rules, the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council decides whether the business should be continued, or the investment should be discontinued).
     We will accumulate period earnings and continuously replace assets regardless of conflicts with exit rules to create funds for accumulating quality assets with a view to sustainably boost growth and earnings. To replace assets, we will withdraw assets from projects with no potential for future growth and reinvest in high profitability projects while striking a balance between the timeline and profitability. In MTP 2017, we reduced assets by ¥151.0 billion and invested ¥315.0 billion. We will continue striving to accumulate quality assets and replace assets to maintain a positive core CF in the three years of MTP 2020 as well.

The Process for Formulation of
Key Sustainability Issues
With the emergence of international standards, such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement or COP21, businesses are increasingly expected to take steps toward solving environmental and social issues.
In the Sojitz Group, we have set six Key Sustainability Issues (materiality) to promote merging of business activities with resolution of environmental and social issues. We are also working to establish an organization to achieve this goal.
The Key Sustainable Issues were set forth by identifying risks and opportunities based on the analyses of the external environment, including various international standards, and the internal environment, such as the Group’s unique characteristics as a trading company. We also hold Stakeholder Dialogue with external experts to incorporate the stakeholders’ perspective.

Formulation of Long-Term Vision 2050
In order to continue to create value and prosperity, as set forth in the Group’s corporate statement, we established “Sustainability Challenge,” our long-term vision, in April 2018. Working to achieve this vision, we will strive to expand our low-carbon businesses over the next 10 years while developing our initiatives to consistently respect human rights. Through the MTP 2020, our management is leading rapid creation of a business that contributes to decarbonization by reviewing the volume of CO2 emitted in our business activities. We will also analyze scenarios related to climate-related risks.
Even in fields other than environment and human rights, which are part of our Sustainability Challenge, we will continue to consistently address Key Sustainability Issues and improve sustainability at the company-level.

Sustainability
 Toward Realization of the Long-Term Vision
To improve sustainability of the Sojitz Group in the medium- to long-term, there is a need to accumulate sustainable corporate assets in each field of our business portfolio with a long-term perspective on the Sustainability Challenge. Using the MTP as a preparation period for working toward
the achievement of the Sustainability Challenge, our management will lead the company in expanding our contribution to realizing a low-carbon society and speeding up initiatives for consistent respect of human rights.

Contribution to Realization of Low-carbon Society while Moving Toward Achieving a Decarbonized Society and Acceleration of Initiatives for Respect of Human Rights
In developing businesses across a wide range of fields, the Sojitz Group also conducts businesses that result in emission of CO2. Some such businesses are gas-fired power generation, which uses fossil resources as fuels, and trading of raw materials. Additionally, our trading companies
comprise an extensive supply chain across the world and engage in export and import of goods with various countries, making consideration for human rights essential to building a stable supply chain. Therefore, we have set our goals with a focus on the following two themes.
 1. Challenge of realizing a decarbonized society
While striving to expand renewable energy businesses, plant-based fuels, and materials businesses that do not emit CO2, we will also establish and expand low-carbon businesses, such as natural gas/LNG and recycling, and work to reduce CO2 emissions resulting from our corporate activities. Through these initiatives, we will contribute to realizing a low-carbon society over the next 10 years and a decarbonized society in the future.
2. Respect for human rights in supply chains
Sojitz Group will strive to realize a society with respect for human rights in supply chains and build a sustainable supply chain, in cooperation with its suppliers.
 Examples
• Quantitative assessment of the volume of CO2 emissions in own business activities as well as the value chain • Renewable energy businesses • LNG value chain business • Recycling business
 Examples
• Promotion and expansion of human rights due diligence
• Achievement of goals set forth for 2020 in the Wood Procurement Policy in the forest resources field

 Promoting Management from the Perspective of Sustainability
To promote management with a sustainability perspective, we established the Sustainability Committee in April 2018 headed by the CEO and are verifying the conformity of company-wide sustainability policies with the business strategies of the Divisions. We are also in the process of setting up the Sustainability Promotion Office, which will serve as the office for the Committee and execute related work.
Additionally, the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council is checking individual proposals for their relevance in terms of environmental or social risks and sustainability.
The matters discussed by the Sustainability Committee are also reported to the Management Committee. The Board of Directors supervises the matters and gives directions where necessary.

Implementing Sustainable Growth
by Maximizing Employee Capabilities
Sojitz’s Basic View on Human Resource Policy
It is said that a trading company is all about its people, and at Sojitz, human resources are the core of value creation. We will generate new functions and businesses amidst diverse people, cultures and values, and advance our activities by developing human resources who can create “two types of value,” including “value for Sojitz” and “value for society.” Our Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 (hereinafter “MTP 2020”) aims for sustainable growth through maintaining and strengthening the existing earnings foundation and continuing to invest with an eye to further growth.
To implement sustainable growth, it is essential that we maximize the capabilities of our employees through human resource policies, while strengthening governance and managing risks. We believe that it is particularly crucial to develop human resources who can speedily deal with the high-paced changes in the business environment, take on challenges without being overly fearful of failure and overcome hardships to reach goals.
Human Resource Policy in the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020
The human resource policy set forth in our MTP 2020 comprises three aspects: diversity, work style reforms and development of future leaders.
We will improve the quality and productivity of work by implementing diversity to ensure that all employees respect each other’s individuality and work with enthusiasm. Work style reforms will ensure a work style that is healthy for the mind and body. We will also develop future leaders by providing platforms for taking on new challenges. We will strive to achieve sustainable growth by connecting these to maximizing employee potentials and creating innovation.

Our Expectations from the Three Human Resource Policies of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020
MTP 2020 includes three core human resource policies. The first is to promote diversity, ensuring that employees leverage the diverse individualities and respect each other. Although we have always promoted employee participation regardless of age, gender and nationality, we are now striving to establish an environment and culture capable of connecting diverse values to a driving force for creating new value. Additionally, to ensure that all employees can excel in the company, we must review our existing work style that favors working long hours, strive to maintain employees’ health and spread a work style that breeds flexible thinking. We will connect these policies to improve our employees’ health, productivity and enhancement of work-life balance. We will also focus on development of human resources because it is essential to produce personnel who can manage new businesses as our Group expands its business investments. We will strive to develop next-generation leaders who can lead Sojitz in the future, by providing employees with opportunities to take on new challenges.
This is the 15th year since the founding of our company. To mark this occasion, we started the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020. I believe that it is my duty, as the Managing Executive Officer responsible for human resources and general affairs, to implement these policies sincerely and create an environment where all employees can work with higher motivation in our pursuit of sustainable growth in the future.

Future Activities
In terms of work style reform, which we began full implementation from the year ended March 2018, we started working on maintaining and promoting employee health, in addition to encouraging employees to take the majority of their paid leave, reduce overtime, and reform the flexible work hours system (flextime). To further promote diversity, we will continue to strengthen existing systems and measures to support work-life balance. From the year ending March 2019, we also aim to enhance the culture enabling diverse human resources to excel, such as by conducting diversity training seminars for general managers and section managers, and by striving to raise the child care leave acquisition rate among men. Furthermore, we will continue to grow our company by producing human talent who can manage businesses. For this, we will strive to implement human resource policies that encourage a wide range of experiences, conduct training programs and develop a system of placements and transfers, under our policy for developing future leaders.

 Focus Development of Global Talent
As part of its initiative to develop global talent, Sojitz recruits foreign nationals as employees, sends employees for MBA study abroad and conducts trainings for local staff overseas. The training of overseas local staff is particularly significant for future growth of the Group and we have been strengthening efforts in this direction from the year ended March 2018 through joint trainings with Japanese employees and other measures.

  Diversity
All employees excel with their individual strengths and achieve “New way, New value” through new ideas and challenges.
The goal of Sojitz Group’s diversity policy is to achieve “New way, New value” by leveraging attributes such as gender, nationality, age, special needs, and diversity in experience, values and other factors of each employee. We will develop the corporate environment and foster a culture based on the twin pillars of work-life management, which allows individuals to independently manage their personal and work life, and diversity, which enables the organization to harness the different strengths of each individual.

These initiatives have been recognized and we were selected by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a “Nadeshiko Brand” company for the second consecutive year in acknowledgement of our exceptional efforts to promote the success of women in the workplace.

Support for Balancing Childcare/Family Care and Work
We have developed various support systems to allow employees to concurrently work, raise children and provide caregiving to family members. From the year ended March 2019, we have set a goal of raising the rate of men taking child care leave to 30% or more.
It is common for female employees in our company to take childcare leave after giving birth and return to work afterwards, and the rate of women returning to work remains high. However, the percentage of men taking childcare leave is still low at 20%–29%. We will encourage male employees to take childcare leave for three reasons: (1) men will be able to enjoy better work- life balance by welcoming new family members and spending time with them, (2) overall productivity will rise due to a culture of producing results in limited time, and (3) a culture that promotes women’s participation can be created by sharing the responsibilities of childcare, which tend to lean more heavily toward women.

I took childcare leave for one month from November 2017. Although no one had taken such a long leave before me, I was able to
do so with the support of my bosses and colleagues. The days I spent watching our son grow, together with my wife, are my biggest treasure.
I am grateful to the current environment for letting us balance work and childcare.

Promoting the creation of an environment where diverse human resources can perform to the best of their capabilities while maintaining a healthy mind and body
 Work Style Reform
The concept of our work style reform is to develop an environment where diverse human resources can display their abilities to the maximum while maintaining mental and physical health. For this purpose, we reviewed our existing work style and generated spare time by improving productivity. This time is used to create new businesses, develop oneself and expand work-life balance.
In concrete terms, we have taken measures such as reducing overtime work, increasing acquisition of paid leave and providing flexible work styles. In particular, abolishing core time in favor of a flex time system has proved effective to a certain extent in promoting a flexible style of working.
We believe that the physical and mental health of our employees and their families is important for maintaining a high level of motivation in work and have therefore established the Commitment to “Sojitz Healthy Value,” a Sojitz Group charter to protect and improve employee health across the Company. Under this initiative, we are taking various measures for prevention and early detection of diseases, including aiming to raise the
percentage of employees receiving medical check-ups to 100%.
Developing
Future Leaders the foundation of the Company’s earnings
The Sojitz Group has invested ¥315.0 billion, surpassing the initial goals set in MTP 2017, and is focused on expanding its business. It therefore needs leaders to manage the operating companies in which it has invested and steadily accumulate earnings. However, following our merger, the number of employees in their 30s is comparatively low, creating a pressing need to quickly cultivate next-generation leaders and managers.
To this end, we provide opportunities to highly motivated and competent employees, including young
and mid-rank employees, to gain various experiences. Apart from building a system of personnel placements and transfers that help employees gain early experience in business management and decision-making in difficult situations, we will also hold trainings for selected department and section heads who are expected to shoulder management responsibilities going forward, and accelerate the development of future leaders.

Corporate Governance
Message from the Chairman
We will continue to take our corporate value to new heights, always striving towards greater sustainability for both Sojitz and society.
What is your assessment of Sojitz’s Q corporate governance framework?
Drawing on our experiences of guiding the Company through a difficult time, I am confident that we now have a solid framework that meets all the necessary benchmarks.
It has now been 15 years since the establishment of Sojitz. At the time of the merger, both Nichimen and Nissho Iwai were suffering from a difficult business environment. Looking back, I consider the original cause to be the lack of stringent risk management and systems to support the management structure, as well as an excessive focus on P/L-based management. In other words, we acknowledge that one of the factors was insufficient governance with regards to execution. Our companies ultimately could not cope with changes in the business environment, and we were forced to suffer monetary losses greater than what we could bear.
Our understanding of the crisis led us board members at the time to devote ourselves to setting up a system for governance that met necessary benchmarks and secured a certain level of effectiveness from the start. We invited Outside Directors to join us early on in order to bring new life into the Board of Directors and ensure Company rules were strictly applied. In the time since they joined the Board, I truly feel that the Company’s direction has been decided by lively debate between its members, with the Outside Directors helping us to realize more wide-ranging discussion.
Nowadays, we often see even globally successful enterprises sapped of their corporate value due to slip-ups in governance; thinking about the kind of corporate governance we need today, I believe that it is important we figure out how to cascade a governance mindset throughout the Group. As Sojitz continues to actively involve itself in investments and loans in pursuit of further growth as a corporate group, it is vital we enhance transparency across the entire Sojitz Group. I hope we can meet society’s demand for transparency by further deepening the mutual exchange of information and bidirectional discussion between the Sojitz head office and Group companies.

Integrated Report 2018

 Q Last year saw the Company working hard to bolster its governance structure. How did your efforts improve the framework?
A Last year, we worked hard to strengthen our internal audit framework and reform the compensation system for corporate officers.
You can see the fruits of that effort in two big developments. First, we established the Internal Audit Committee
under the Board of Directors. Sojitz’s Audit & Supervisory Board, where Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members comprise a majority, has exercised a high degree of independence and had their lively, active exchange of ideas reflected in our Company polices. When it comes to the actual execution of company business, however, there are certain elements that can be hard for people outside the Company to detect—latent risks inherent to business execution. We thus decided to establish the Internal Audit Committee, chaired by our Representative Director and Vice Chairman. This committee leads the Internal Audit Department and receives direction from the Board of Directors. Through this setup, we have created a structure whereby the Audit Department can express their opinions from an independent standpoint separate from business operations, and which enables reports to be made to the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board in a timely manner. I believe this will create a highly transparent system from the perspective of the shareholders, which facilitates discussion between the Outside Directors and the Audit Department.
The other major development was our revision of the compensation system for corporate officers. Since Sojitz’s founding, we have not had a system to offer bonuses to officers. Without systems for rewarding good work, however, it can be difficult to motivate people. Furthermore, our Outside Directors had often pointed out that from the perspective of shareholders, we really should have a performance-linked compensation system. Recognizing the need for change, we thus implemented a new compensation system alongside the launch of MTP 2020. This will help to enhance corporate value by enabling management which better reflects the same perspectives and sensibilities held by our shareholders. Specifically, this means we have added bonuses and share remuneration on a per-year basis into officers’ regular monetary compensation. I believe that with this, we have been able to construct a highly transparent compensation system for corporate officers, which will increase our medium- to long- term corporate value. P.44
Efforts to Bolster the Governance Framework
Q How does Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 address the effort to boost Sojitz’s corporate value?
A We are working toward sustainability through our business activities and developing organizations to see that effort through.
For MTP 2020, we initiated a long-term vision which we call our “Sustainability Challenge.” It will help pave the way for a sustainable Sojitz and a sustainable society by driving efforts to tackle important social issues, especially in terms of the environment and human rights.
The only way to achieve the “two types of value” so vital to the Sojitz philosophy is by joining our efforts to secure earnings for Sojitz with valuable contributions to society made through our business operations. Take our initiatives to realize low-carbon and decarbonized societies, for example. By shifting toward renewable energy business, we are setting a clear policy that says we will both lessen society’s environmental load and garner new business opportunities at the same time.
In order to achieve the goals of that policy, we have positioned this three-year period beginning April 2018, as preparation time as we gear up to formulate concrete plans and identify quantitative targets. We also recently reorganized our existing CSR Committee into the Sustainability Committee, chaired by the President and CEO, and set up a new Corporate Sustainability Office. I hope that each department maintains a focus on sustainability and nurtures its junior staff, cultivating their knowledge of sustainability and ability to take action.

A Discussion Between the Former and Current Outside Directors
To Strengthen Corporate Governance
From the year ended March 2005, Sojitz has been appointing individuals with a wide range of knowledge, deep insight and abundant experience as Outside Directors, in order to reinforce the supervisory function of the Board of Directors. This page introduces a discussion in which the two people who served as Outside Directors until the year ended March 2018 and the two newly appointed Outside Directors talk about their policy initiatives to date, and their ambitions going forwards.
- Firstly, the two Outside Directors who retired, can you look back at all your activities until now?
 Kitazume In the past, during the time I was working for the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry (now the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry), I heard that business conditions were difficult, and so
I faced the fact that sometimes we must have the resolve to make harsh judgements.
However, the Sojitz of today has greatly improved its financial situation, and entered a new growth stage. During this period, through my involvement in establishing two
Sojitz is in a growth stage.
In the future, I want the company to have an even greater presence,
and pursue Sojitz’s unique strengths.
medium-term management plans
(MTP), I have been able to spend my
time with positive feelings.
Ishikura I also felt a strong will to
growth. When I took on this role, the
previous Outside Director told me,
“The remuneration system needs
reforming,” and when I heard the details, I understood that the creation of this system amid the difficult management environment of the past had been postponed. So, as the head of the Remuneration Committee, I started discussions that were joined by external specialists, and finally created a remuneration system with an awareness of company performance and stock prices, which are a matter of interest to shareholders. It is a relief that I was able to introduce the system to the General Shareholders’ Meeting at the start of the new MTP 2020.
    40 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018
  
 Kitazume Continuing on from the MTP 2017, which involved investments and loans of ¥315.0 billion, the new MTP 2020 anticipates investments and loans on a scale
of around ¥300.0 billion. Using this opportunity, I want the Company to reinforce “businesses unique to Sojitz,” by further strengthening its strong businesses, and multiplying them with each other.
Ishikura I agree. I have been able to study trading companies by visiting a Californian dealership, as well as through many meetings with each managing COO together with Mr. Kitazume, and attended the Finance
& Investment Deliberation Council as an observer. At
the time, “Whether this is a case where we can leverage Sojitz’s strengths,” always became a topic. At the Board of Directors’ meetings, at first I was unsure about my decisions, but gradually I became able to express the core of my decisions in my own way. There are many trading companies that explain their presence by the size of their sales, but I would really like the two new Outside Directors to aim for the “creation of two types of value,” as set out by Sojitz, and do their best so people can say, “It’s a good thing for society that Sojitz is here.”
How We Get There 1
 - Please give some message for the future of Sojitz.
  - What encouragement can you give to the two newly appointed Outside Directors?
Ishikura The knowledge you have of the manufacturing industry and foreign and domestic legal affairs will definitely be necessary expertise for Sojitz, as it tries to succeed
in growth on a global level. I’d like you to create a “new Sojitz” with your abilities. Ms. Naito has achieved much
in business in Vietnam, as has Mr. Otsuka as a global manufacturer, and so I have great expectations.
Kitazume I have always said that we need to bring the expertise a manufacturer has in cost management and pricing to our trading company business, and increase our profitability. I would like to entrust this to Mr. Otsuka. I also hope that Ms. Naito will use her wide-ranging knowledge, including that of global norms, and assist in raising Sojitz’s company value.
 - Sojitz is creating “two types of value.” How will the two newly appointed Outside Directors support the achievement of this mission?
Naito In order to integrate the two types of value, “Value for society” and “Value for Sojitz,” it is necessary to emphasize a framework for legal compliance and risk management, and at the same time to focus on soft law, which continues to be important
globally; in other words, the matter of global norms and socially accepted ideas, even if they are not enforceable
by law. I want to proactively participate in the process
of Sojitz’s value creation, as it demonstrates solutions
for issues in the global environment and society through business, using my experience in corporate legal affairs and legal affairs overseas.
Otsuka I have advanced management in machine components manufacturing, mainly focusing on accounting and financial affairs, and human resources. I remember that at first I was slightly confused by the request to take up this position for a trading company. However, I was told that, as its growth strategy, “Sojitz is increasing its investments and loans from conventional trading to business management,
Attaching importance to global norms, and bringing expertize in management from other industries, to further strengthen Sojitz’s company value.
including that of the manufacturing
industry; as we wish to approach
the management of these operating
companies as an important issue in
the future, we need your perspective
as a manufacturer.” How will I apply
my expertise in cost management
and quality control, expertise based on the fundamental principle of thoroughness in safety, quality, and delivery times cultivated in manufacturing, to the trading company business model? I want to contribute to the creation of two types of value while emphasizing the “front lines,”
in the true manner of someone who comes from the manufacturing industry.

Corporate Governance
Improving Effectiveness and Transparency
 Basic Concept
Sojitz strives to improve its corporate value over the medium to long term based on the “Sojitz Group Statement” (“The Sojitz Group creates value and prosperity by connecting the world with a spirit of integrity”).
In order to materialize this, based on its belief that the enhancement of its corporate governance is an important issue of management, Sojitz has built the following corporate governance structure in its effort to establish a highly
sound, transparent and effective management structure, while also working toward the fulfillment of its management responsibilities and accountability to its shareholders and other stakeholders.
Management and Business Execution System
Sojitz employs an executive officer system for the purpose
of clarifying authority and responsibilities, and ensuring the smooth and swift execution of business through the separation of managerial decision-making from business execution. The Board of Directors, chaired by the Chairman of the Board,
is the highest decision-making body reviewing and resolving fundamental policies and most important cases concerning the management of the Group. The Board of Directors also supervises business execution through proposals of important matters and regular reports from the executing body. As
the executing body, we have established the Management Committee, chaired by the President, who is also the Chief Executive Officer. The committee is responsible for the review
and approval of the Group’s important managerial and executive agendas, from a Group-wide and medium- to long- term viewpoint. In addition, we have established the Finance
& Investment Deliberation Council for the review and approval of investments and loans, the Human Resource Deliberation Council for the review and approval of major human resource matters, and internal committees to handle issues to be addressed from cross-organizational perspectives, as executing bodies all directly reporting to the President & CEO.
The term of Directors and Executive Officers is set to one year, in order to respond swiftly and appropriately to rapid changes in the business environment and clarify their responsibilities to management.
Monitoring and Supervisory Functions for Management
Sojitz appoints multiple Outside Directors for the purpose of receiving appropriate advice and proposals on management of the Group from an outside, objective standpoint and to reinforce the supervisory function of the Board of Directors. In addition, We ensure appropriateness and transparency with regard to the appointment of Directors and remuneration by having Outside Directors serve as the chair of the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee, both advisory bodies to the Board of Directors.
Sojitz is a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, which independently oversees and audits the operations of the Group.

Audit Structure
Audit & Supervisory Board members, accounting auditors and the Audit Department boost the effectiveness of their respective audits by exchanging information to ensure their efforts are complementary and efficient.
Furthermore, in April 2018, the company established
an Internal Audit Committee under the Board of Directors
to strengthen supervision of audits, and separate internal audits. The Audit Department is well-versed in the company's business and performs internal audits based on the structure mentioned above, resulting in the creation of a highly effective audit structure in combination with audits conducted by the Audit & Supervisory Board members and accounting auditors.
Audits by Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Pursuant to the Corporate Audit Standards established
by the Audit & Supervisory Board, Audit & Supervisory Board members attend meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings such as those of the Management Committee and the Finance & Investment Deliberation Council. Audit & Supervisory Board members oversee and audit the operations of the Group based on audit plans and task assignments and perform audits using means such as interviewing directors and other members
of senior management regarding business execution, reviewing important documents relevant to major business decisions and checking business reports and other information from subsidiaries.
In addition, Sojitz has established the Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ Office as an auxiliary body to its audit structure. Its staff of full-time employees assists Audit & Supervisory Board members and is independent from the directors to ensure effective performance of duties.
Accounting Audits
Sojitz has appointed the independent auditing firm KPMG AZSA LLC to conduct accounting audits in accordance with the Companies Act, as well as audits of financial statements, quarterly reviews and internal control audits in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.
Internal Audits
Internal audits are based on audit plans resolved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each fiscal year, and mainly cover the business group, corporate departments, and consolidated subsidiaries including major overseas affiliates.
Training Policy for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
We take the following initiatives to enable Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members to appropriately fulfill their roles and responsibilities.
• We provide newly appointed Directors and Audit &
Supervisory Board Members with opportunities for lectures by lawyers on legal obligations and responsibilities of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, as
well as programs by outside consultants for management consultations.
• In order for internal and Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members to deepen their understanding
of our extensive business activities, Chief Operation Officers (COO) of each business division hold business briefing sessions, and in order for them to deepen their understanding of the latest macroeconomic conditions, our research institute holds monthly briefing sessions.
• We offer Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members opportunities to attend seminars, etc. held by external organizations such as the Japan Association of Corporate Directors and the Japan Audit & Supervisory Board Members Association.
Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Each year, Sojitz analyzes and assesses the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole by appointing third parties, with a view to enhancing its performance.
Note: For details regarding corporate governance or status of response to corporate governance code, see our website and Corporate Governance Report. (https://www.sojitz.com/en/corporate/governance/)

        Performance-Linked Share Remuneration
Introduction of share remuneration and performance-linked share remuneration are recommended nowadays as part of corporate governance reforms and are already common in the West. The introduction and expansion of share remunerations, in particular, are considered to be in line with investors’ demands because this helps encourage the management to consider the shareholders’ viewpoint.
Based on this background, we introduced the Performance-Linked Share Remuneration System in June 2018. Under this system, Directors and Executive Officers of our company will be delivered Sojitz shares and paid cash equivalent to the conversion amount of Sojitz shares in accordance with achievement level of performance targets and other factors, after their retirement from the office of Directors, with the objective to heighten awareness toward increasing not only short-term business performance but
also the value of Sojitz shares over the medium-to-long term. It has been decided that remuneration will comprise “basic remuneration,” “performance-linked cash remuneration” and “share remuneration.”
Remuneration under this system will consist of the “performance-linked portion” and “fixed portion.” For the performance-linked portion, delivery of a certain number
of the Sojitz shares will be made based on the rank of Directors and Executive Officers and linked to consolidated net profit for each year for the three fiscal years of the Medium-Term Management Plan of the Company. For
the fixed portion, delivery of a certain number of the Sojitz shares will be made based on the rank and basic remuneration of Directors and Executive Officers, without any link to business performance.
Outline of the Performance-Linked Share Remuneration System
•Directors (excluding Outside Directors and non-residents of Japan) •Executive Officers (excluding non-residents of Japan)
A total of ¥700 million for three fiscal years
•The upper limit of the total share delivery points to be granted to Directors and others during the trust period of the applicable three fiscal years will be three million points (equivalent to three million shares)
•The average for one fiscal year will be one million points (equivalent to one million shares) and nearly 0.08% of the total number of shares issued by the Company (as of March 31, 2018 after deduction of treasury stock)
•No dilution will occur due to this system as Sojitz shares will be acquired in the share market Calculation of Share Delivery Points

Policy for Cross-Shareholdings
We make decisions on acquiring listed shares for purposes other than portfolio investment, comprehensively taking into account whether revenue is expected to be earned
by strengthening relationships for marketing strategies and whether there are opportunities of medium- to long-term revenue by acquiring the shares.
In addition, with regard to the shares currently held by the Company, we review the reasons for holding the shares
from the qualitative perspective as mentioned above, and also by quantitatively verifying investment returns such
as revenue and dividend income in connection with each investment target on a yearly basis, and report the results to the Board of Directors. The number of stocks held by Sojitz had decreased to less than half in the 10 years up to the end of March 2018.

 Risk Management
Basic Policies of Risk Management
As a general trading company, the Sojitz Group is engaged in a diverse and globally dispersed range of businesses. Due to the nature of its businesses, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks. In compliance with its Basic Code
of Corporate Risk Management, the Sojitz Group defines and categorizes risks, and manages them according to the nature of each risk. For quantifiable risks such as market risks, credit risks, business investment risks and country risks, risk assets are calculated and reported to management. Non-quantifiable risks, such as legal risks, compliance risks, environmental and social (human rights) risks, funding risks, disaster and other risks and system risks, are managed in the same manner as quantifiable risks, with the status of the risks and other issues being
Risk Measurement and Control
The goals of risk measurement are (1) to manage risk assets within the strength of the Company (total equity), and (2) to maximize earnings in line with the level of
risk exposure. Based on that recognition, the Sojitz
Group manages risks with a focus on both stability and profitability. The Sojitz Group’s objective for risk control is to keep the ratio of risk assets to total equity within 1.0 times. The ratio of risk assets to total equity was 0.5 times as of March 31, 2018, within the target range. Risk assets are measured quarterly and reported to the Board of Directors and the Management Committee, and each business department receives the results of analysis of the change
in risk assets for application in risk management activities. The Sojitz Group plans to continue its risk control efforts to maintain the ratio within 1.0 times, even as the operating environment grows increasingly uncertain.
The external environment affecting the Sojitz Group’s businesses is constantly changing, with uncertainty in global politics, geopolitical risk, macroeconomic conditions and volatility in markets (exchange rates, interest rates, stocks, commodities, etc.) all on the increase. The Sojitz Group
reported to management based on the Risk Management Policy and Plan formulated by the executive officers responsible for managing those risks.
In MTP 2020, we have added and started monitoring several other emerging risks, including risks related to use of web sites or SNS (i.e. those requiring crisis management, including efforts to protect personal information and countermeasures for online shaming on social media),
risks related to quality control (liability risk for new products arising from diversification of the areas in which we do business), and risks related to industry innovation (risk of being left behind in the technological revolution occurring in AI, etc., rendering existing business models obsolete).
promptly conducts appropriate risk management for this external environment. As a specific response, risk assets are calculated factoring in stress to stock price and exchange rate volatility and country credit ratings, and the ratio of risk assets to total equity is monitored to remain within 1.0 times even under stress conditions. In addition, as a countermeasure
to tail risk, Sojitz analyzes the impact on its business
portfolio under stress scenarios. While promoting disciplined investment in the MTP 2020, we have been reviewing the method of measuring risk assets, mainly for goodwill, in a way more suitable for growth investment since FY 2019.
Implementation status of risk management trainings
Sojitz organizes yearly trainings for all its employees with the objective to foster a thorough risk management mindset.
• Participants (total number): 2,070 (as of the fiscal year ended
March 2018)
• Training contents: Spreading awareness about rules, case
studies, measures for preventing/reducing country risks or market risks, such as inventory transactions, and others

 Growth Strategy
We see an ever greater movement of people and goods alongside economic development, particularly in emerging countries in Asia, South America, and other regions, and demand for automobiles is expected to continue rising in these areas. In the same time, drastic changes are taking place in developed countries, mainly in Europe and America, due to technological innovations in electrification, autonomous drive and the emergence of sharing services, among other factors.
In such circumstances, the Automotive Division expects to invest 30 billion yen during the period of Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 (hereinafter “MTP 2020”). We will position the dealership business, which we expanded and gained experience in during Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 (hereinafter “MTP 2017”), as a stable earnings foundation. We will also strive to further increase the value of the business by expanding maintenance services, sale of parts and pre-owned vehicles, in addition to sale of new vehicles, along with securing outstanding new M&A in promising markets such as the US, Brazil and Japan, where we have already established a track record.
In addition to focusing on the auto financing business to promote purchases in emerging countries, we will also expand our automotive parts quality assurance business to meet the increasing demands for quality parts in the supply chain, which continues to diversify across nations. While strengthening these functions and accumulating business know-how, we will also

strive for stable growth by replacing and enhancing assets in view of market changes for our existing businesses as well.
The Automotive Division manages 35 operating companies across the world with about 4,900 employees, including personnel recruited locally. In its efforts to strive for steady growth for these operating companies, the division is constantly developing next-generation management personnel by having them accumulate on-site experience while contributing to the development of the region. Aside from training of managers, MTP 2020 will also work on developing personnel capable of creating new functions and businesses that cater to changes in the automobile industry.

 Growth Strategy
The Aerospace & Transportation Project Division’s mission is to generate solutions by incorporating both railway and marine vehicles businesses and provide new value in line with the needs of the international community. This is based on the trust we have built with aircraft manufacturers, airline companies, and airport operators over our many years working on aircraft business. To achieve this mission, we will move forward with three approaches.
Our first approach is to build a new earnings foundation by expanding the value chain for our aircraft business, utilizing our ample experience acting as Japan sales representative for commercial aircraft companies. This is symbolized by our part-out business, which sells disassembled parts from retired and aged aircraft to airlines and aircraft maintenance companies.
Our second approach is to strengthen our new products and services in addition to our existing aircraft sales and leasing businesses. For example, the demand for business jets is increasing globally with economic development in Asia and the globalization of business. This is because business jets can set flight paths freely, even in regions without scheduled flights, and can therefore drastically shorten travel time. This business environment led the Aerospace & Transportation Project Division to establish a business jet operating company in the US in 2017 to meet growing demand in Asia.
Our third approach is to develop our business centered on airport operation, which installs transportation infrastructure to

contribute to regional revitalization in Japan and abroad, including in emerging countries. As the locus of movement for both goods and people, airports and the areas around them serve as commercial gateways. This means we can branch out from airports to set up shopping centers, office buildings, accommodations, and industrial parks in the surrounding areas, in addition to developing secondary modes of transportation, such as railways and marine vehicles. We believe that we can vitalize regional infrastructure in a way that is uniquely Sojitz by leveraging the facility management know-how of other divisions.

Hospital PPP Project in Turkey
Promoting the construction and business operation of the Ikitelli Integrated Health Campus to contribute to advancement of medical infrastructure in Turkey
How We Get There 2
    The government of Turkey introduced national public insurance system in 2008. This resulted in more Turkish citizens with health coverage—improvements in average life expectancy (rising from 71 to 75 years within a 10-year period) and infant mortality rates being the biggest indicators. Meanwhile, it also led to more patients. Modernization of state hospitals and improvement of medical treatment are challenges for the country. To deal with this pressing healthcare need, the Turkish Ministry of Health planned a range of investment to create more hospitals, using a scheme whereby public and private organizations collaborate to provide nationalized service as well as investment to increase the number of hospital beds to 40,000.
Sojitz concluded a 25-year contract with the Turkish Ministry of Health to participate in the construction and business operation for the Ikitelli Integrated Health Campus. One of the largest Health Campuses is located in Istanbul and houses 2,682 hospital beds with a cardiovascular hospital and an oncology hospital, among others. The facilities are under construction and scheduled to begin operation in October 2020.

 Growth Strategy
The world’s energy market is facing a major turning point due to the cross effects of major shifts in regional supply and demand, and the global movement towards decarbonization.
From the supply side, the shale revolution has rapidly expanded the US’s presence. On the demand side, China, India and other emerging Asian countries are expected to play a central role in the market’s growth as the decarbonization trend drives rapid introduction of natural gas, LNG, and renewable energy.
To deal with these rapid changes in the business environment, we established the Energy & Social Infrastructure Division as a new division in April 2018. Our new division integrates the functions of LNG, gas-fired power plants, and renewable energy, with added IT components.
Our focus is now on Gas-to-Power, which is expected to serve as a central means of supporting the growing energy demands in Asia’s emerging countries. We will position Gas-to-Power as a core business and strive to maximize the combined strengths of our long-held prowess in the integrated LNG business and our experience in the gas-fired power plant PPP/PFI business to drive further momentum.
There is an increase in demand to replace aged coal-fired power plants with gas-fired ones in the US, which is a major energy consumer. We will redouble our efforts to contribute to the realization of a low-carbon society by operating cutting-edge, high-efficiency gas-fired power plants in the US that use abundant and low-priced domestic shale gas as fuel.
In the renewable energy business, we will utilize the extensive

● Rapidly accelerated trend of privatization in public business and services with PPP/PFI
● Revolutionary changes in business environment as a result of irreversible progression of global megatrends in energy sector3
● Increase in country risk including project delay and cancellation in countries where new energy demand is sharply rising
● Stricter global environmental restrictions due to the Paris Agreement (e.g. unforeseen implementation of new levy such as carbon tax)
● Delay of implementation or deterioration of business conditions in government policy such as deregulation, privatization, subsidies, and so on
● Products and services suddenly becoming obsolete due to destructive innovation of IT technologies
Notes: 3. Mainly refers to the 5Ds—Depopulation, Decarbonization, Decentralization, Deregulation and Digitalization
knowledge gathered through our solar power generation businesses in Germany and Japan to advance our capabilities further to keep up with the pace of rapid decarbonization. We have already succeeded in establishing a solar power generation business in South America and onshore wind power projects in Europe. In future, we will continue to expand globally with a focus on identifying a wide reach of suitable lands and diversifying power (onshore wind, biomass, etc.).
In addition, we set up a new Social Infrastructure Development Office to manage business model transformations accompanying advancements in AI and IoT.
Our mission is to develop advanced social infrastructure that promises reliability, safety, and comfort. To fulfill this mission, we will cooperate with valuable partners in Japan and overseas who share our values to contribute to the development of industrial societies in different countries around the world.

Contributing to development of the integrated energy infrastructure: including LNG plant, LNG terminal and gas-fired power plant
 In Asia, where the demand for energy is rising dramatically, significant advances are expected as a result of introducing LNG, which provides an optimal balance of low environmental impact, stable supply, and economic efficiency. However, this requires sophisticated management of a packaged scheme (Gas-to-Power) that covers all stages from optimal procurement to long-term, stable operations of receiving terminals and large power plants. Japan is an advanced country in terms of introduction of LNG, so other countries look to Japan to provide support. In this context, Sojitz will contribute to establishing social infrastructure that promotes both the environment and the economy by leveraging the experience it has accumulated in operating large IPP-type gas-fired power plants in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, and 50 years of experience managing integrated LNG businesses. In addition, as privatization (PPP/PFI) of public businesses and services gains momentum, we will seek to use the knowledge gained through the Gas-to-Power business to provide society with comprehensive solutions in the energy field. This could include, for instance, applying our Gas-to-Power expertise to the business of supplying natural gas as a fuel for industrial use.

 Growth Strategy
Metals and mineral resources are indispensable for driving development and growth in countries around the world. In particular, their stable procurement is a national issue for Japan, which lacks natural resources, and emerging countries undergoing rapid economic growth. Throughout its long history, the Metals & Mineral Resources Division has continued to fulfill its duty of supplying metals and mineral resources to these countries. Increase in demand for resources and steel, due to the recovery of the global economy and market conditions, have resulted in a steady improvement in our performance. However, two significant issues must be addressed over the next three years to sustain this growth— establishing a stable earnings foundation resilient to the volatile market conditions unique to the resources industry, and maintaining growth while implementing measures contributing to a low-carbon society, which is the current global demand. Therefore, we are implementing the following three strategies for growth.
First, we are strengthening trade by introducing new functions. In order to expand trade with emerging countries while maintaining and expanding commercial rights for Japan, we will secure earnings by further solidifying our ties with customers and meeting their diverse needs. Simultaneously, we will expand our dealings in products which contribute to reducing environmental impact, such as low-sulfur coal and raw materials for next-generation batteries.
Second, we are improving our upstream businesses. In addition to further cost reductions in existing projects, we will
External Environment
● Increase demand for resources, steel and industrial materials driven by economic growth in emerging countries
● Solid demand for new products as environmental regulations are strengthened and revised in response to the rising global environmental sentiment
● Increased demand for innovations and new materials which contribute to the development of a sustainable society
● Increased demand for environmentally friendly businesses, such as recycling and byproduct management
● Reduction in operating revenue due to volatility in market prices and foreign exchange rates
● Rising resource nationalism, compliance, and geopolitical risks
● Decline in competitiveness of certain products due to emergence of alternative products and stricter environmental regulations
● Stringent global environmental regulations resulting from the Paris Agreement, such as carbon tax
also restructure our portfolio through replacement and acquisition of profitable assets, in order to construct an asset portfolio that will generate earnings even in a market downturn. For example, we are rebalancing our thermal coal-inclined portfolio by replacing them with coking coal, which encourages higher sustained growth.
Third, we are developing new midstream and downstream businesses resilient to market conditions. One such initiative is our 3D metal printer business launched in the year ended March 2018, with its manufacturing plant scheduled to begin full-scale operations in autumn 2018. We will also continue to seek out new business areas which answer to social needs and environmental changes, such as recovery and recycling of resources.

Stable supply of rare metals for the production of durable lightweight high-grade steel materials and innovative batteries
How We Get There 2
   The demand for lightweight and durable high-grade steel products is increasing dramatically due to industrial development in emerging countries. The automotive industry, in particular, is adopting these products as materials for vehicle bodies and parts. Seeing this opportunity, Sojitz along with major steel companies invested in Brazilian Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração (hereinafter, “CBMM”) in 2011. With CBMM being the top global producer of niobium, a rare metal necessary for producing high-grade steel, this has enabled us to provide a stable supply of niobium to steel makers in Japan. We have also establish a joint agreement on the development of anode materials using Niobium Titanium Oxide with CBMM and Toshiba Infrastructure Systems & Solutions Corporation in June 2018. Our aim is to enable mass-production of next-generation lithium-ion batteries characterized by high-energy density and ultra-rapid recharging capability required for electric automobiles.
By providing Japan with stable niobium supply, we will not only

 CBMM Niobium Mine (Brazil)
 Propelling innovation in the metal products industry with the cutting-edge technology of 3D metal printers
 In recent years, there has been a growing focus on Additive Manufacturing (hereinafter, “AM”), a technology which makes use of 3D printers to laminate metal powders, and market demand is rapidly growing for high-precision utility products created using AM in fields such as aerospace and medical care. In 2017, Sojitz and Koiwai Co., Ltd. established JAMPT Corporation (hereinafter, “JAMPT”) as the first Japanese company to provide integrated services, from 3D printing of metal products using AM technology to product certification support for client companies. In addition to creating complex structures that could not be achieved with traditional manufacturing methods, it is expected that the use of AM technology will improve yield and reduce logistic costs by directly manufacturing products from metal powders. Sojitz will support JAMPT by promoting sales of its metal powders and metal products, and using our know-how as a general trading company to further expand its business.
In autumn 2018, commercial operations will start in JAMPT’s new production plant, located in Tagajo City, Miyagi Prefecture, in an area recovering from the Great East Japan Earthquake. By collaborating with the local government and
research institutions, we aim to become the leading company in the metal laminating industry and simultaneously contribute to the economic revitalization of disaster-hit areas.

(2) In the plastic resins business, we will strive to expand transaction volumes by focusing on the keywords – “environment”, “strengthening customer/partner relations” and “innovation,” as well as expanding our major automotive-related and packaging materials businesses. (3) In the petroleum resin and C5 business, we will broaden our supplies to meet the growing demand in Asia, and utilize the experiences we have gathered through the supply chain business in the US to build an all-in-one-package solution-type business model that can cater to a wide range of applications
and services. (4) In the industrial salt business, we strive to further expand and solidify our business which has now reached the scale of four million tons/year through our continuous expansion investments in India. (5) In the rare earths business, we will work toward reducing procurement risks and stabilizing supply by increasing procurement from Australia.
Additionally, in 2017, we invested in a European chemical marketing and distribution company “solvadis,” and are currently working to improve corporate value and create synergy between our division and solvadis. We hope to employ the PMI knowledge we have gained through this investment, and connect it to investing in a second chemical distribution company.
Under the Division policy of making strong businesses even stronger, we will enhance our existing business, at the same time creating a solid new business pillar by extending and strengthening environment-conscious business areas such as carbon fiber (which is gaining popularity for making aircraft and automobiles lighter), high-strength glass fiber and other composite materials, lithium-ion battery materials and environmentally friendly plant-based resin business.
The Chemicals Division will aim to further grow as a division dealing with materials that both support our business industry and our everyday life.

Green Polyethylene Business
Focusing on sale and spread of green polyethylene
to promote a shift away from dependence on petroleum
How We Get There 2
    The world is calling for the chemicals industry to shift towards products that are conscious of natural ecosystems and local environmental issues, to help preserve the environment and prevent pollution. Green polyethylene is a concrete example of one such product. It is a plant-based plastic made from sugarcane and is gaining attention in light of the recent surge in crude oil prices and increased emphasis on corporate social responsibility as well as among other perspectives.
As sugarcane absorbs carbon dioxide during growth, green polyethylene is considered to emit zero net carbon dioxide when burned as a waste material. This means that carbon dioxide emissions, when compared to existing petroleum-based polyethylene, can be up to 70% lower—even when emissions from the manufacturing and transportation process are taken into account.
In 2012, Sojitz Pla-Net acquired sales right from a Brazilian petrochemical company “Braskem S.A”—a sole manufacturer of green polyethylene in the world, to sell their products in Asia and Oceania. This has enabled us to strengthen a structure that supports one-stop “greening” solutions for customer products,
Lithium-ion Battery Business
from sale of raw materials for resins to final end products. We are striving to spread environment-friendly packaging materials made from green polyethylene by collaborating with major convenience stores, super markets and other retailers, along with developing products and supporting discovery of new markets for small and medium businesses.
 Green polyethylene tank
  Contributing to reduction of environmental impact
of the automotive-related industry through value-added sustainability
 The eco-vehicles market is growing rapidly because of strict regulations on carbon dioxide emissions mainly being implemented in Europe and China. This has led to a rise in demand for lithium-ion batteries for automobiles, which is expected to grow by roughly five times in the coming ten years as practical application of batteries using materials other than lithium continues to be difficult.
Sojitz boasts a track record of over 40 years in trading lithium resources as well as related components and products. It possesses a wealth of knowledge from trading with a broad range of companies, including materials manufacturers, battery materials manufacturers and battery manufacturers. We also hold a premier lineup among trading companies and are contributing to creating a supply chain for customers in the form of a “department store for lithium-ion batteries,” where we are able to supply materials and battery materials all in one place. In MTP 2020, we will strive to develop this business as
an earnings foundation for our Division by conducting businesses focused on the view point of our customers.

 Growth Strategy
Southeast Asia is undergoing diversification in lifestyles and increase in demand for foodstuffs as its populations rise and economies continue to develop. To take advantage of this growth, our division will operate businesses in this region with the objective to boost and expand profitability.
In agribusiness, we are operating fertilizer businesses with a leading market share in Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, and will leverage this strength to expand into Myanmar and other neighboring countries. We will also venture into agricultural fields peripheral to the fertilizer business.
In the food business, we joined processing businesses, such as confectionery, bakery and sugar refinery, and also conduct delivery of raw materials and product sales. We will expand this model to Southeast Asia as well.
We established a milling company, food ingredient wholesaling company and packaged bread manufacturing company in the Philippines in 2017. In Vietnam, we joined a milling company in 2007, and will strive to forge ahead in the food processing business that connects with downstream businesses.
In the marine products business, we have built a value chain for tuna—from farming to processing and sales—which we will strengthen moving forward. We strive to realize full-cycle aquaculture of tuna and increase the number of our processing plants in Dalian, among other activities.
External Environment
● Diversification of lifestyles in Asia
● Increase in demand for foodstuffs due to population growth and economic development in Southeast Asia
● Heightened concern for the reliability and safety of food and the protection of food resources
● Price fluctuations in the event of supply—demand imbalance, due to factors including climate change and changes in government policies
● Decline in sales/profit margins caused by factors such as downtrend of economy
In the feed and livestock business, we have entered grain port operations and the feed production business in Vietnam and will work to expand using these businesses as a base on which to build.
We will capitalize on the company’s established business foundation in Vietnam, which includes businesses such as prepared food, wholesale food, convenience store, industrial park and other businesses, managed by other Sojitz divisions. At the same time, we will collaborate with leading local partners to supply products not only in Vietnam and the ASEAN region, but also throughout the world.

Fertilizer Business
Helping farmers increase their income by supplying fertilizers that improve farming productivity
How We Get There 2
    One of the issues emerging Asian countries face as they continue their growth trajectory is how to improve agricultural productivity to enrich everyday life, such as higher quality agricultural products and the diversification of food.
In light of these circumstances, Sojitz has worked to increase farming yield and income for farmers through its business operations in three countries—Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam—which involves manufacturing and selling compound chemical fertilizers as well as conducting activities to spread technologies for agriculture and cultivation centered around the use of fertilizers. As a result, Sojitz’s fertilizers boast a top market share in each of these countries. We also began import and sales of compound chemical fertilizers in Myanmar in 2018. Demand for quality fertilizers is rising in the country, which is one of Southeast Asia’s major agricultural producers with approximately 70% of the population engaged in farming. We contribute to the development of agriculture in Southeast Asian countries, such as Myanmar,

  Using IoT and AI for tuna farming to ensure a stable supply of sustainable marine resources
 Marine resources are garnering attention as sources of quality proteins and health foods. As their demand increases globally, stricter international fishing regulations are coming into force for some fish, including tuna. In this context, we became the first general trading company to enter the tuna farming business by establishing Sojitz Tuna Farm Takashima in 2008. Our objective was to provide a stable supply of sustainable marine resources by harnessing the knowledge we had acquired from handling imports of frozen tuna. In 2010, we shipped the first batch of cultured tuna to the markets. In 2016, we set up Sojitz Tuna Farm Hassho in the warm climate of Kushimoto City, Wakayama Prefecture, as an intermediate growing business for juvenile tuna to improve their survival rate.
In order to increase efficiency in the aquaculture business, we also jointly developed a system with NTT DOCOMO and Information Services International-Dentsu, Ltd. using IoT and AI to visualize and analyze tuna farming expertise such as for feed
optimization and other farming processes. We will continue verification tests of the system to contribute to the advancement of Japan’s aquaculture business.

Growth Strategy
In the midst of unprecedented diversification in consumer preferences and accelerated changes, the Retail & Lifestyle Business Division conducts various customer-based business activities that aim to create more prosperity and convenience in people’s lives. In particular, our future growth strategy is founded on business expansion and strengthening of business functions in the ASEAN region, where the middle-income segment is growing due to steady economic development.
For instance, our wholesale food business, which began in Vietnam, led to the establishment of cold chain logistics as a means of responding to customers’ need for tastier food products, and is contributing to sales growth for local food service distribution businesses and supermarkets. In addition, we are engaged in the convenience store business and have set up a plant to support supply of daily/prepared foods and processed meats. We also used this know-how to enter the food service distribution business in Thailand, where we are building a one-stop system for handling all phases from wholesale distribution to food processing. We are also involved in the food wholesaling business in Myanmar.
In the commercial facilities operation business, we have established a business model based on the shift in consumer trends from tangible (product-oriented) to intangible (experience-oriented) elements, which utilizes our expertise in managing facilities in Japan, and adds value to our company and other stores. We are leveraging this know-how in other
countries as well to operate Japanese eateries and restaurants. In the traditional trading business, we established an integrated materials-to-construction system to enter the
wooden interior materials business overseas, where demand for luxury products is growing. We have also built an integrated production system that covers the spinning to sewing processes in the textile business, and are offering products to major specialty retailers. Through these efforts, we will provide business functions that respond to the needs of our customers (key consumers), and live up to the expectations and interests of society.

Contributing to a richer variety of foodstuffs through the establishment of food and retail business in the ASEAN
How We Get There 2
   Middle classes with high purchasing power are emerging in the rapidly growing ASEAN economies, where people are demanding services that cater to diverse palates and provide a high level of satisfaction. Sojitz emphasizes an integrated customer-based business not only in Japan, but also in growing Asian markets, and is promoting diverse retail businesses, including logistics and wholesale foods business, that increase prosperity and convenience in everyday life.
For example, as the modern retail industry in Vietnam continues to develop, we sought to respond to consumers seeking a wider variety in food by acquiring one of the largest food wholesalers in the country. We are now creating a sophisticated distribution infrastructure for handling foods in four temperature zones—room temperature, fixed temperature, refrigerated and frozen. Furthermore, in addition to operating convenience stores, we are involved in establishing and supporting operations of factories for daily/prepared food and

  Sustainable afforestation, procurement and production in Vietnam
 Forests are not only essential for procuring lumber and woodchips, but also play a role in protecting the environment, such as securing water resources, preventing landslides, and maintaining biological diversity. Therefore, it is imperative that we operate from a sustainability perspective by protecting forests and using forest products efficiently.
The Sojitz Group is working to build businesses that, both, protect the global environment and promote the development of local communities through sustainable procurement and efficient use of forest resources.
To ensure sustainable procurement, we have established a Wood Procurement Policy and set evaluation criteria for the wood we purchase. By surveying each supplier, we have established a stable supply structure for reliable and safe timber products which considers not only the legality of logging operations, but also the impact on ecosystems in the place of origin and the living environments of local residents. Additionally, we are responding to social needs by effectively using forest resources. Specifically, we make an effort to see
that no precious wood (from timber to mill ends) is wasted at each stage. In future, we will use these functions to our strength and consider entering the business for manufacturing fuel for biomass thermal power generation by effectively using mill ends, as well as the business for biomass-fired thermal power generation.

The foundation of the Industrial Infrastructure & Urban Development Division is our asset management business. We have established this business through many years of experience developing infrastructure, such as industrial parks and condominiums. In addition to these stable earnings foundations, we invest in new infrastructure for which we conduct appropriate risk management and portfolio management. Our business will not be limited to developing and selling lots, but we will also add new facilities and service functions that leverage the Group’s synergy to carry out our mission of improving people’s living standards.
One major project that symbolizes our endeavors to achieve this mission is Deltamas City, a comprehensive urban infrastructure development project in Indonesia. Through Deltamas City, we are working on the issue of how to expand Jakarta’s urban functions. Deltamas City is located on a vast extent of land with an area of 3,200ha—equivalent to nearly 50% of the area encircled by the Yamanote Line in Tokyo— where we are conducting integrated development not only of an industrial park, but also government institutions, educational facilities, commercial spaces, residences, and other facilities.
In recent years, we have taken advantage of the proximity between workplaces and residences to begin a community management program through which we are creating new facilities and services to address social issues and needs unique to the community. Some of these initiatives include inviting hospitals and Japanese schools, as well as our housing projects with Japanese partners within the city. We are also

● Risks associated with revisions to legal and other regulatory systems in Japan and other Asian countries, and fluctuations in economies, exchange rates and interest rates
striving to establish this business model by adding shopping malls and other businesses to the project, while investing in new regions such as the Philippines.
For our domestic real estate business, we are expanding the scale and areas of business, while linking and creating cycles for our three functions: 1) development of and investment in housing and other projects, 2) asset management (real estate finance field), and 3) building facility management and lifestyle-related services.
We are also promoting expansion of the value chain using assets, through activities such as development and operation of town houses and rental housing.
Our J-REIT business already manages assets worth ¥250.0 billion, and we aim to increase this number to ¥300.0 billion in the medium- to long-term.

Contributing to the growth of the region through comprehensive urban infrastructure development, in addition to expanding the industrial park business
How We Get There 2
    More and more companies are looking to expand into Asia, and a new foundation to grow their business is to entry well-located industrial parks equipped with functions, such as water and electricity supply, and communication networks.
In 1996, Sojitz established the LOTECO Industrial Park, becoming the first Japanese company to build an industrial park in Vietnam. We created a maintenance management system that works around the clock all 365 days, and developed a basic infrastructure capable of providing stable electricity, water supply and waste water processing. We also stationed permanent Japanese staff within the park as part of a full support system in response to the needs of each client. Services include assistance with procedures for establishing local subsidiaries, filing various types of applications, constructing plants, and recruiting employees, as well as supplying raw materials. Based on these integrated business functions, ranging from development of an industrial park to its management and operation, we are currently using our diverse know-how to develop Deltamas City, a

  Daycare management business to help address social issues such as the need for women’s active participation in the workplace and children waitlisted for daycare
 In our domestic real estate business, we are expanding out from the general real estate management business, such as managing buildings and condominiums, to a general life solutions business, which will provide high-value-added services to working people and residents. As part of this effort, we considered social needs such as supporting the active participation of women in the workplace, and the problem of children being waitlisted for daycares. Through Sojitz General Property Management Corporation, we moved to acquire full ownership of daycare management company Angelica Co., Ltd., which provides high-level services mainly within the 23 wards of Tokyo. In that sense, while working together with our domestic real estate business, we are advancing the daycare management business in a way that leverages our functions as a general trading company.
We entered the daycare management business in 2016, and the number of children in our daycare centers has already surpassed 1,200, largely in the Tokyo metropolitan area. This number is expected to grow by hundreds in the next three years.
Through this daycare management business, Sojitz will continue to contribute to creating a society which enables guardians to both work and raise children, as well as facilitate the healthy growth of the children who will carry the future of Japan.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
1. Overview
In the year ended March 31, 2018, conditions in the global economy proved firm thanks to growth in developed countries where consumption expanded and in emerging countries where markets were buoyed by the growth in developed countries. Resource prices were likewise solid amidst bullish demand.
The United States witnessed the continuation of steady economic growth fueled by increases in capital investment and consumer spending, which was the impetus for an additional hike in the policy interest rate. Furthermore, stock prices reached record highs as a result of strong corporate performance and the ratification of the new tax reform plan. However, there was a slight slowdown that arose leading up to the end of the fiscal year due to concern stemming from the interest rate hike and trade negotiations, particularly with regard to the restrictions on steel imports.
Meanwhile, firm export and consumer spending trends contributed to increasingly strong economic recovery in Germany and other European countries, prompting the European Central Bank to announce plans to scale back quantitative easing measures in October 2017. However, there was a lingering sense of opaqueness in light of factors including negotiations regarding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
In China, economic conditions proved firm, despite faltering growth in consumer spending, as positive trends resumed in relation to exports and investments in infrastructure, real estate, and other areas. Nonetheless,
this country faces an increasingly uncertain outlook due to concerns related to factors including trade disputes stemming from the United States’ steel import restrictions, excessive production facilities, and the need to respond to environmental issues and the debt issues of regional governments.
Despite concerns for possible outflows of capital following the interest rate hike in the United States, Asia experienced overall stable economic growth. Factors contributing to this growth included economic recovery in developed countries, increased exports accompanying economic growth in China, and favorable internal consumption.
In Japan, a fairly high growth rate was posted due to strong consumer spending, improvements in corporate performance and capital investment levels.
2. Financial Performance
Sojitz Corporation’s consolidated business results for the year ended March 31, 2018 are presented below.
Revenue increased 16.7% year on year to ¥1,816,459 million as a result of an increase in net sales in the Chemicals Division due to the new acquisition of a European chemical distributor and marketing company and higher volume of plastic resin transactions and in net sales in the Metals & Coal Division due to higher prices and transaction volumes for coal and other resources.
Gross profit was up ¥31,695 million year on year, to ¥232,380 million. This increase can be attributed to profit growth in the Automotive Division due to higher

 automobile sales volumes in overseas automobile wholesale businesses; the Metals & Coal Division, resulting from higher selling prices for the overseas coal businesses; and a rise in profit in the Infrastructure & Environment Business Division due to earnings contributions from infrastructure-related businesses.
Operating profit increased ¥8,220 million year on year, to ¥59,838 million, as a result of the rise in gross profit.
Profit before tax increased ¥22,388 million year on year, to ¥80,343 million, as a result of the rise in operating profit and in share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method.
After deducting income tax expenses of ¥18,648 million from profit before tax of ¥80,343 million, profit for the year amounted to ¥61,694 million, up ¥17,619 million year on year. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) increased ¥16,082 million year on year, to ¥56,842 million.
3. Segment Information
Results by segment are as follows.
(1) Automotive
Revenue increased 30.4% year on year to ¥188,118 million due to new acquisition of quality inspection business related to automotive components in North America and a rise in automobile sales volumes in overseas automobile wholesale businesses. Segment profit for the year went up ¥2,929 million to ¥6,515 million thanks to the increase in gross profit and other factors.
The assembly/wholesale business, which forms the
core of this Division, saw a rise in demand for automobiles, largely in emerging countries. Business performed well, with an increase in the number of automobiles sold. We also expanded and entered dealership businesses in the U.S.A. and Russia, and acquired a new function in the automobile-related business area by joining the automobile parts quality inspection business in North America, in our bid to build more revenue-generating clusters.
(2) Aerospace & IT Business
Revenue decreased 14.84% year on year to ¥75,414 million due largely to the decline in aircraft-related transactions. Segment profit for the year decreased ¥5,391 million to ¥4,514 million due to lower gross profit and the impact of the conversion of an IT business subsidiary into an equity-method associate through the sale of part of its equity in the previous fiscal year.
Although profits were lower year on year because of a one-time loss in the previous fiscal year, our strong commercial aircraft business performed well. The business jet business expanded this fiscal year, and this segment grew due to Sojitz’s participation in a project to manage operations at the Palau International Airport, among other activities. We also implemented policies with the objective to strengthen future profitability. In addition, the merger of the subsidiary Nissho Electronics with Sojitz Systems has enabled us to cater to the diverse needs of our customers by combining ICT infrastructure software and construction with the ability for enterprise system development and operation.

Revenue increased 28.97% year on year to ¥515,601 million largely due to the new acquisition of a European chemical trading company and higher plastic resin transaction volumes. Segment profit for the year increased ¥366 million to ¥8,702 million because of an increase in gross profit among other factors.
In addition to the stable performance of methanol,
one of our major products, increase in transactions
related to liquid chemicals and plastic resins in the
Asian region and favorable sales of rare earths,
business performance was steady this fiscal year thanks
to solid earnings from the European chemical trading
company acquired in the previous fiscal year. We are
stable. We also started warehouse operations at the sales company we established in Myanmar in the previous fiscal year, further strengthening our business. We also supply and sell reliable and safe foods. Our entry into flour production, food ingredient wholesaling and bread production in the Philippines and operation of a new tuna processing factory in China are part of this business.
(8) Retail & Lifestyle Business
Revenue increased 2.33% year on year to ¥292,462 million due largely to increased meat transactions. Segment profit fell ¥1,595 million to ¥5,698 million due to lower gross profit affected by the sale of domestic

 (9) Industrial Infrastructure & Urban Development
Revenue increased 59.44% year on year to ¥45,884 million due largely to an increase in real estate transactions. Segment profit stood at ¥2,139 million, ¥807 million more than the previous fiscal year.
Major business deliveries were completed successfully in the overseas industrial parks business as well as real estate development business in Japan.
Japan Town and smart town development plans were started in Indonesia this fiscal year, heightening complex urban infrastructure function. Sojitz also opened a new sales agency for a new industrial park in the Phillippines. Within Japan, we are executing a portfolio building policy to attain stable earnings through steady growth in asset management, real estate management, nursery management and other businesses.
4. Financial Position
(1) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
Total assets on March 31, 2018, stood at ¥2,350,351 million, up ¥211,885 million from March 31, 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to the expansion of tobacco and automotive and a rise in other current assets associated with aircraft-related transactions.
Total liabilities at March 31, 2018, amounted to ¥1,725,227 million, up ¥164,732 million from March 31, 2017, following an increase in trade and other payables under current liabilities associated with tobacco transactions.
Total equity attributable to owners of the Company was ¥586,464 million on March 31, 2018, up ¥35,951 million from March 31, 2017. This increase was largely due to the accumulation of profit for the year, which offset a decrease in other components of equity resulted from foreign exchange movements.
● Cash Flow (Years ended March 31)
Consequently, on March 31, 2018, the equity ratio* was 25.0%. Net interest-bearing debt (total interest- bearing debt less cash and cash equivalents and time deposits) totaled ¥603,450 million on March 31, 2018, ¥7,557 million decrease from March 31, 2017. This resulted in the Company’s net debt equity ratio* equaling 1.03 times at March 31, 2018.
* The equity ratio and net debt equity ratio are calculated based on total equity attributable to owners of the Company.
(2) Cash Flow
In the year ended March 31, 2018, operating activities provided net cash flow of ¥98,812 million, investing activities used net cash of ¥86,407 million, and financing activities used net cash of ¥13,052 million. Sojitz ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of ¥305,241 million, adjusted to reflect foreign currency translation adjustments related to cash and cash equivalents.
1) Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥98,812 million, up ¥97,955 million year on year. Major factors increasing cash included revenue growth and higher trade and other payables. These factors outweighed major factors decreasing cash, namely outflows accompanying an increase in tobacco-related inventories.
2) Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities totaled ¥86,407 million, up ¥54,228 million year on year. Investment outlays for financing infrastructure and automotive-related businesses exceeded inflows from the sale of investments.
3) Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥13,052 million, largely as a result of the repayment of borrowings. It was up ¥9,023 million year on year.

 (3) Liquidity and Funding
Under the Medium-Term Management Plan 2017, the Sojitz Group continued to advance financial strategies in accordance with the basic policy of maintaining and enhancing the stability of its capital structure. In addition, Sojitz has been endeavoring to maintain a stable financial foundation by holding sufficient liquidity as a buffer against changes in the economic or financial environment and by keeping the long-term debt ratio at its current level.
Consequently, on March 31, 2018, the current ratio was 162.7% and the long-term debt ratio was 87.5%.
As one source of long-term funding, Sojitz issued straight bonds in the amount of ¥10.0 billion in June 2017 and issued another ¥10.0 billion worth of straight bonds in March 2018. Sojitz will continue to closely monitor interest rates and market conditions and will consider floating additional issues whenever the timing and associated costs prove advantageous. As supplemental sources of procurement flexibility and precautionary liquidity, Sojitz maintains a ¥100.0 billion long-term yen commitment line (which remains unused) and long-term commitment line totaling US$1.9 billion (of which US$760 million has been used).
5. Business and Other Risks
(1) Business Risks
The Sojitz Group is a general trading company that operates a diverse portfolio of businesses globally, and is exposed to various risks due to the nature of these businesses. Therefore, the Group defines and classifies risks in compliance with its Basic Code of Corporate Risk Management and assigns managers responsible for each risk classification. These managers formulate a risk management operating policy and management plan at the beginning of each fiscal year, monitor progress and risk mitigation quarterly, and summarize performance at the end of each fiscal year. The Group manages quantifiable risks (market risks, credit risks, business investment risks, and country risks) based on risk asset scores derived from risk measurements. Non-quantifiable risks (legal risks, compliance risks, environmental and social [human rights] risks, funding risks, disaster risks, and system risks) are managed based on quarterly monitoring. The Group has the risk management systems required to address the risks it faces, but cannot completely avoid all risks. Risks involved in the Sojitz Group’s businesses include, but are not limited to, the following.
1) Risk of changes in the macroeconomic environment
The Group operates a wide range of businesses in Japan and overseas that are engaged in a broad array of activities. Political and economic conditions in Japan and other countries and the overall global economy influence the Group’s results. Therefore, global and/or regional economic trends could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
2) Market risks
The Group is exposed to market risks, including exchange rate risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments; interest rate fluctuation risk associated with debt financing and portfolio investment; commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements and commodity inventories incidental to operating activities; and market price fluctuation risk associated with holding listed securities and other such assets. The Group has a basic policy of minimizing these market risks through such means as matching assets and liabilities and edging with forward exchange contracts, commodity futures/forward contracts, and interest rate swaps.
(a) Currency risk
The Group engages in import and export transactions, and offshore transactions, denominated in foreign currencies as a principal business activity. The revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly paid in foreign currencies, whereas the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is the Japanese yen. The Group is therefore exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies, and hedges its foreign currency exposure with forward exchange contracts and other measures to prevent or limit losses stemming from this currency risk. Even with such hedging, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid currency fluctuation risk. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. Additionally, the Group’s dividend income from overseas Group companies and the profits and losses of overseas consolidated subsidiaries and equity method associates are largely denominated in foreign currencies. Their conversion into yen entails currency risk. The Group also owns many foreign subsidiaries and operating companies. When these
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 95

 companies’ financial statements are converted into yen, exchange rate movements could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions or issuing bonds to extend credit (e.g., for trade receivables), invest in securities, acquire fixed assets, and for other purposes. Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks. However, the Group cannot completely avoid interest rate fluctuation risks. An increase in funding costs due to a sharp rise in interest rates could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
(c) Commodity price risk
As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities in its various businesses. It is consequently exposed to the risk of commodity price fluctuations. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels for each of its organizational units. The Group also imposes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., organizational units must promptly liquidate losing positions and are prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if unit losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with these controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by unanticipated market or other movements. The Group also monitors commodity inventories by business unit on a monthly basis to control inventory levels.
(d) Listed securities price risk
The Group has large holdings of marketable securities. For listed shares in particular, the Group periodically confirms the holding purpose for a security. Nonetheless, a major decline in the stock market could impair the
Group’s investment portfolio and, in turn, adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
3) Credit risks
The Group assumes credit risks by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risks by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on an 11-grade rating scale. The Group also controls credit risks by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer by- customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group also employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables in which it screens the customers to which it has extended trade credit to identify those that meet certain criteria. It then reassesses the selected customers’ creditworthiness and the status of the Group’s claims against these customers. Through this approach, the Group is endeavoring to more rigorously ascertain credit risks and estimate provisions to allow for doubtful accounts for individual receivables. For credit risks associated with deferred payments, loans, and credit guarantees, the Group periodically assesses whether profitability is commensurate with credit risks on a case by- case basis. For transactions that do not generate risk commensurate returns, the Group takes steps to improve profitability or limit credit risks. However, even with such credit management procedures, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid credit risks. If, for example, receivables are rendered uncollectible by a customer’s bankruptcy, the Group’s operating performance and/ or financial condition could be adversely affected.
4) Business investment risks
The Group invests in a wide range of businesses as one of its principal business activities. In doing so, it assumes the risk of fluctuations in the value of business investments and investments in interests. Additionally, because many business investments are illiquid, the Group also faces the risk of being unable to recoup its investment as profitably as initially anticipated. With the aim of preventing and limiting losses from business investments, the Group has established standards for
96 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018

 rigorously screening prospective business investments and monitoring and withdrawing from investments. In screening prospective investments, the Group analyzes business plans, including cash flow projections, and rigorously assesses the businesses’ prospects. It has also established procedures, including an IRR (internal rate of return) hurdle rate screen, to enable it to identify investments with the potential to generate returns commensurate with risk. Once the Group has invested in a business venture, it conducts thorough business process management, which includes periodic reassessment of the business’s prospects, to minimize losses by identifying problems early and taking appropriate action. To identify problems with business investments at an early stage or before they materialize and thus minimize losses on divestiture or liquidation, the Group sets exit conditions and acts decisively to opportunely exit investments that have failed to generate risk commensurate returns. Even with such procedures for screening prospective investments and monitoring existing investments, the Group cannot completely avoid the risk that investment returns will fall short of expectations or the risk that businesses will fail to perform according to plan. Moreover, the Group could incur losses when exiting business ventures or may be precluded from exiting business ventures as intended due to circumstances such as relationships with partners in the ventures. Such events could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
5) Country risks
To minimize losses that may result from country risks, the Group recognizes that it must avoid concentrated exposure to any single country or region. In conducting business in countries that pose substantial country risks, the Group hedges against country risks on a transaction by- transaction basis in principle through such means as purchasing trade insurance. In managing country risks, the Group assigns nine level country-risk ratings to individual countries and regions based on objective measures according to the size of the country risks. It then sets net exposure (gross exposure less trade insurance coverage and/or other country-risk hedges) limits based on the country’s size and assigned rating. The Group limits its net exposure to individual countries to no more than the net exposure limit. However, even with these risk controls and
hedges, the Group cannot completely eliminate the risk that businesses will fail to perform according to plan or the risk of losses due to changes in political, economic, regulatory and societal conditions in the countries in which the Group conducts business or countries in which the Group’s customers are located. Such events could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
6) Impairment risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of impairment of the value of its non-current assets, including real estate holdings, machinery, equipment and vehicles, goodwill and mining rights, as well as its leased assets. The Group recognizes necessary impairment losses at the end of the fiscal year in which they are identified. If assets subject to asset impairment accounting decline materially in value due to a decline in their prices, recognition of necessary impairment losses could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
7) Funding risks
The Group largely funds its operations by issuing bonds and borrowing funds from financial institutions, and therefore maintains good business relationships with financial institutions and keeps the long-term debt ratio at a specified level, which ensures stable funding. However, in the event of a disruption of the financial system or financial and capital markets, or major downgrades of the Group’s credit rating by rating agencies, funding constraints and/or increased financing costs could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
8) Risks related to environment/society (human rights)
The Group has identified significant sustainability issues (human rights, environment, resources, local communities, human resources, and governance) and determined policies for the environment, CSR supply chain action and human rights. By ensuring thorough adherence of these policies within the Group and raising awareness among suppliers about the company’s policies, the Group is striving to minimize risks related to environment and society (human rights) that arise from business activities. It is also paying attention to domestic and international regulatory trends, such as the Paris Agreement, on
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Operations
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 97

 reducing carbon emissions and decarbonization. However, environmental, occupational health and
safety, or human rights issues may arise in the Group’s business activities or supply chain. Moreover, environmental or human rights groups or other members of society could accuse the Group of being involved in such issues. Such events could force the Group to temporarily or permanently cease operations or to conduct environmental remediation or purification procedures. The Group could also face litigation, incur expenses related to compensation for affected parties, or suffer damage to its reputation. Such developments could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
9) Compliance risks
The Group’s diverse business activities are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations, including the Companies Act of Japan, tax laws, anti-corruption laws, antitrust laws, foreign exchange laws and other trade related laws, and various industry-specific laws, including chemical regulations. To ensure compliance with these laws and regulations in Japan and overseas, the Group has formulated a compliance program, established a compliance committee, and promotes rigorous regulatory compliance on a Group-wide basis to instill and establish a compliance mindset among all executives and employees. However, such measures cannot completely eliminate the compliance risks entailed by the Group’s business activities. Additionally, the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by major statutory or regulatory revisions or application of an unanticipated interpretation of existing laws or regulations.
10) Litigation risks
Litigation or other legal proceedings (e.g., arbitration) may be initiated in Japan or overseas against or with the Group in connection with the Group’s business activities. Due to the uncertain nature of litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not possible at the present time to predict the effect that such risks might have on the Group. Nevertheless, such risks could adversely affect the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition.
11) Information system and information security risks
The Group has prescribed regulations and established oversight entities, mainly the Information Security
Subcommittee, to appropriately protect and manage information assets. The Group also has implemented safeguards, such as installation of duplicate hardware, against failure of key information systems and network infrastructure. Additionally, the Group is endeavoring to strengthen its safeguards against information leaks through such means as installing firewalls to prevent unauthorized access by outsiders, implementing antivirus measures, and utilizing encryption technologies. While the Group is working to strengthen overall information security and prevent system failures, it cannot completely eliminate the risk of important information assets, including personal information, being leaked or damaged by increasingly prevalent cyberattacks or unauthorized access to its computer systems. Nor can the Group eliminate the risk of its information and communication systems being rendered inoperable by an unforeseeable natural disaster or system failure. In such an event, the Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected, depending on the extent of the damage.
12) Disaster risks
The Group could be directly or indirectly affected in the event of an earthquake, flood, storm, or other natural disaster that damages offices or other facilities or injures employees and/or their family members. The Group has prepared disaster response manuals, conducts disaster response drills, and has established an employee safety confirmation system and a business continuity plan,
but it cannot completely avoid the risk of damage from natural disasters. The Group’s operating performance and/or financial condition could be adversely affected by natural disasters.
(2) Risks Related to Medium-Term Management Plan 2020
The year ending March 31, 2021 is the final year of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020. The Group formulated the plan based on economic conditions, industry trends, forecasts and a variety of other information believed to be appropriate at the time. However, initiatives directed at achieving the targets of the Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 may not progress as planned or may not produce the expected results due to various factors, including rapid change in the business environment.

 (2) Outlook and Issues to Be Addressed
Medium-Term Management Plan 2017
Under Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 — Challenge for Growth, the three-year plan that began in April 2015, the Sojitz Group sought to improve corporate value by expanding its foundations for generating stable earnings through the ongoing pursuit of future growth. Espousing the principle of growth driven by trading, investments, and loans, the Sojitz Group conducted investments and loans to the tune of ¥300.0 billion as budgeted for over the three-year period of the Medium- Term Management Plan 2017 and succeeded in constructing foundations capable of stably generating earnings of more than ¥50.0 billion. We were also able to achieve our targets of return on assets (ROA) of 2% or higher and return on equity (ROE) of 8% or higher while keeping the net debt equity ratio below 1.5 times through financial discipline. Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) did not reach the level of ¥60.0 billion or higher targeted in the final year of the plan, but it did exceed the initial forecast for the year ended March 31, 2018, at ¥56.8 billion.
Medium-Term Management Plan 2020
Medium-Term Management Plan 2020 —Commitment to Growth— is the new three-year plan established by the Sojitz Group started in April 2018. Under the new plan, we will continue initiatives on the growth track put forth by Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 while utilizing the assets acquired during the period of this plan

 7. Basic Policy on Dividends
As a basic policy, Sojitz’s top management priorities include paying stable dividends on an ongoing basis while enhancing competitiveness and shareholder value by increasing internal capital reserves and using them effectively. Under this policy, the consolidated payout ratio during the Medium-Term Management Plan 2017 will be approximately 25%.
Sojitz decided to pay a year-end cash dividend as follows after comprehensively considering factors including results for the fiscal year and total equity. As a result, the consolidated payout based on profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) was 24.2%.
Year-end cash dividends paid totaled ¥7,505 million. Including the interim dividend of ¥6.00 per share paid on December 1, 2017, cash dividends per share for the year ended March 31, 2018 totaled ¥11.00 per share, and dividends paid totaled ¥13,760 million. The effective date of dividends from surplus was June 20, 2018.
Under the newly anounced Medium-Term Management Plan 2020, Sojitz will target a consolidated payout ratio of 30% in accordance with the aforementioned basic policy.
Sojitz’s Articles of Incorporation permit the payment of interim cash dividends by resolution of the Board of Directors as stipulated by Article 454, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act of Japan. As a result, Sojitz’s basic policy is to pay dividends twice annually, with the interim dividend being approved by resolution of the Board of Directors and the year-end dividend being approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting.

Note:
We calculate exposure for the consolidated Sojitz Group by tallying assets that are exposed to country risk.
We disclose exposure for the entire Sojitz Group and for the following assets: investments, loans, guarantees, and operating receivables and inventories (grouped as “operating receivables”); cash and deposits and financial assets (grouped as “cash and deposits, etc.”); bad debts, noncurrent assets, etc. (grouped as “other assets”).
Exposure is tallied on the following bases:
• Country risk: Exposure is calculated based on the country in which credit counterparties, etc., are present.
• Substantial country risk: Exposure is adjusted based on the substantial country of risk, regardless of counterparties’ country of domicile.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 1 REPORTING ENTITY
Sojitz Corporation (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in Japan. The addresses of the Company's registered headquarters and main office are available on its corporate website (http:// www.sojitz.com/en/). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interests in associates and joint
2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION
(1) Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”).
The Consolidated Financial Statements were authorized for issue by Masayoshi Fujimoto, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Seiichi Tanaka, Chief Financial Officer, on June 19, 2018.
(2) Basis of measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the following material items in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position:
• Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through
profit or loss are measured at fair value;
• Financial assets measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income are measured at fair value;
• Defined benefit plan assets or liabilities are measured at the
present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair
value of plan assets; and,
• Inventories acquired with the purpose of generating profits
from short-term fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less sales costs to sell.
(3) Functional currency and presentation currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented in Japanese yen has been rounded down to the nearest million yen.
For the convenience of readers outside Japan, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are also presented in United States dollars by translating Japanese yen amounts at the exchange rate of ¥106 to U.S.$1, the approximate rate of exchange at the end of March 31, 2018. Such translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into United States dollars at the above.
(4) Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from such estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions thereof are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected.
Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts
ventures. The Group is an integrated trading company engaged in a wide range of business activities on a global basis. Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally.
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is included in the following notes:
• Note 3 (1)—Scope of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
• Note 3 (14)—Recognition and presentation with respect to revenue
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustments within the next consolidated fiscal year is included in the following notes:
• Note 22—Impairment of non-financial assets
• Note 30—Measurement of defined benefit obligations • Note 31—Recoverability of deferred tax assets
• Note 32 (6)—Fair value of financial instruments
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows. • Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access
at the measurement date.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable, either directly or indirectly. • Level 3: unobservable inputs.
Information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:
• Note 10—Investment property
• Note 18—Assets held for sale and liabilities directly related
thereto
• Note 22—Impairment of non-financial assets
• Note 32 (6)—Fair value of financial instruments
(5) Changes in accounting policies
There have been no material changes to the accounting policies applied by the Group from the year ended March 31, 2017.
 110 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018

  3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements, and have been applied consistently by the Group.
(1) Basis of consolidation
1) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When the Group holds a majority of the voting rights of another entity, such entity is considered to be a subsidiary of the Group as it is determined that control exists, unless there is clear evidence that shares in such entity do not provide for control. In addition, in the case that the Group holds less than or equal to 50 percent of the voting rights of another entity, if it is determined through agreements or the like with other investment companies that the Group has significant control over such entity’s finance and management, such entity is considered to be a subsidiary of the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the Group obtains control of the subsidiaries until the date the Group loses such control of the subsidiaries. In the case that the accounting policies adopted by subsidiaries are different from the Group’s accounting policies, the financial statements of such subsidiaries are, as needed, adjusted in order to be consistent with the Group’s accounting policies.
In addition, the Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of certain subsidiaries, such as those which engage in the development of oil and gas in Egypt, of which the fiscal year end date is different from that of the Company. The reason being the impracticability of unifying the fiscal year end date of such subsidiaries with that of the Company due to requirements of local laws and regulations, characteristics of local business or the like.
When the financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared with fiscal year end dates that are different from that of the Company, adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occurred between the fiscal year end dates of such subsidiaries and that of the Company. The fiscal year end date for the majority of such subsidiaries is December 31. The difference between the fiscal year end dates of such subsidiaries and that of the Company never exceeds three months.
If there are changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary, but the Company retains control over the subsidiaries, such transaction is accounted for as an equity transaction. Any difference between the adjustment to the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration received is recognized directly in equity as equity attributable to owners of the parent.
If control is lost with respect to a subsidiary, the Group derecognizes such subsidiary’s assets and liabilities or any non- controlling interests, or the other components of equity, related to such subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising from such loss of control is recognized as profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in such subsidiary after the control is lost, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.
2) Associates and joint ventures
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and
operating policies. Significant influence over each of such entities is presumed to exist when the Group owns between 20 percent and 50 percent of the voting rights of each such entity.
In the case that the Group holds less than 20 percent of the voting rights of another entity, if it is determined that the Group has significant influence over such entity based on the provision of a board member, a shareholders’ agreement or the like, such entity is considered to be an associate of the Group.
Joint ventures are those entities with respect to which multiple parties, including the Group, have joint control over the economic activities by contract and unanimous consent of all of such parties is required when deciding on financial/management strategies, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
Except for those that are classified as assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), investments made to associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (such associates and joint ventures hereinafter referred to collectively as “Entities subject to Equity Method”). Investments made to Entities subject to Equity Method are each accounted for as the carrying amount following the application of the equity method less accumulated impairment losses. Such carrying amount includes goodwill recognized at the time of acquisition.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of Entities subject to Equity Method from the date the Group obtains significant influence or joint control until the date the Group loses such significant influence or joint control. In the case that the accounting policies adopted by Entities subject to Equity Method are different from the Group’s accounting policies, the financial statements of such entities are adjusted, as needed.
In addition, the Consolidated Financial Statements include investments made to Entities subject to Equity Method on dates that differ from the fiscal year end date. This is due to the impracticability of unifying the fiscal year end date as a result of relationships with other shareholders or the like. The fiscal year end date for the majority of Entities subject to Equity Method is December 31. Adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events occurred between the fiscal year end date of Entities subject to Equity Method and that of the Company.
3) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The Group measures the value of goodwill by deducting from the fair value of consideration for the acquisition (which include the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree at the date of such acquisition) the net recognized amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (which is generally the fair value). When such difference is in the negative, such difference is immediately recognized as profit or loss.
Non-controlling interests are measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, and the measurement method to be applied at the date of acquisition is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
4) Transactions eliminated under consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized profits or losses through intra-group transactions, are eliminated when
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 111

 preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Foreign currency translation
1) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currencies of each company at exchange rates at the dates of such transactions.
Monetary items in foreign currency at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at such date.
Foreign exchange translation differences on monetary items are recognized as profit or loss in the period incurred.
Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost of the foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items in foreign currency that are measured at fair value of such foreign currency are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate as of the calculation date of fair values thereof. With respect to the foreign exchange translation differences of non-monetary items, if gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognized as other comprehensive income, the exchanged portion of such gains or losses will be recognized as other comprehensive income. On the other hand, if gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognized as profit or loss, the exchanged portions of such gains or losses will be recognized as profit or loss.
2) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from acquisitions thereof, are translated to the presentation currency using the exchange rate at the reporting date. In addition, the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to the presentation currency using the average exchange rate for the year excluding cases in which exchange rates are fluctuating significantly.
Foreign exchange translation differences are recognized as other comprehensive income. If the Group’s foreign operation is disposed of, the cumulative amount of the foreign exchange translation differences related to such foreign operation are reclassified to profit or loss at the time of such disposal.
Based on the application of the exemption clauses under IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,” the Group reclassified the cumulative translation differences as of the Transition Date to retained earnings.
(3) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash in the bank that may be withdrawn at any time and short-term investments with maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible into cash and not subject to any price fluctuation risk.
(4) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of a historical cost basis and net realizable value.
The costs of inventories include purchasing costs, processing costs and all other costs incurred in the process of bringing such inventories to the present location and condition, and are mainly determined based on the average method. Non-fungible inventories are calculated based on the specific identification method.
Inventories that have been acquired with the purpose of generating profits from short-term fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less costs to sell, and changes in the fair values of such inventories are recognized as profit or loss.
(5) Property, plant and equipment
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model, under
which property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The costs of property, plant and equipment include costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. If a material component of property, plant and equipment is consumed differently, then such component is accounted for as a separate item of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is mainly computed under the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each component thereof. The estimated useful lives of the following items are as follows:
112 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018
Buildings and structures: Machinery and vehicles: Tools, furniture & fixtures:
2 – 60 years 2 – 40 years 2 – 20 years
The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least every financial year end and amended as needed.
(6) Goodwill and intangible assets
1) Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
2) Intangible assets
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model and intangible assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired individually are measured at cost. The costs of intangible assets acquired from business combinations are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. With respect to internally-generated intangible assets that do not meet the criteria for asset recognition, expenditures related thereto are accounted for as expenses at the time they are incurred. With respect to internally-generated intangible assets that meet the criteria for asset recognition, the total of expenditures related thereto that were incurred from the date such criteria was first met is treated as cost.
Intangible assets, for which useful lives may be determined (excluding mining rights), are depreciated under the straight-line method for the period of such estimated use. With respect to mining rights, they are depreciated using the production output method based on estimated mine reserves. In addition, the estimated useful life of software used by the Group is approximately 5 years.
The depreciation methods, the useful lives and residual values of intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least every fiscal year end and amended as needed.
Intangible assets for which useful lives cannot be determined are not amortized. The Company conducts a review to determine whether the events or circumstances supporting the judgment that useful lives cannot be determined continue to exist at every fiscal year end.
(7) Investment property
An investment property is a property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both. An investment property does not include a property held for sale in the ordinary course of business or property used for the production or supply of goods or service or for other administrative purpose.
After initial recognition, the Group applies the cost model and investment property is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of an investment property is mainly computed under the straight-line method based on the applicable estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives are between 2

 years and 50 years. The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least every fiscal year end and amended as needed.
(8) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset, which takes a considerable period of time before it is ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as part of the cost of such asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period incurred.
(9) Impairment of non-financial assets
At each fiscal year end, the Group determines whether there is any indication of an impairment loss with respect to the Group’s non-financial assets, and, if so, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, of which their useful lives cannot be determined, are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that there may be an impairment with respect thereof. If the carrying amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, such carrying amount is reduced to equal the recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized.
With respect to impairment losses of assets other than goodwill that were recognized in previous fiscal years, the Group determines at each fiscal year end whether such impairment losses have ceased to exist or there are indications that the same have decreased. If any such indications exist, the Group will estimate the recoverable amount of such assets. If such recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of such assets, the carrying amount of the assets is increased to equal the recoverable amount and reversal of impairment losses is recognized. Impairment losses recognized with respect to goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
In addition, because goodwill that constitutes part of the carrying amount of an investment with respect to an Entity subject to Equity Method is not separately recognized, it is not tested for impairment separately. If it is suggested that there may be an impairment loss with respect to an investment made to an Entity subject to Equity Method, the entire carrying amount of such investment will be tested for impairment as a single asset, by comparing the recoverable amount with such carrying amount.
(10) Financial instruments
The Group has applied IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2010 version).
1) Financial assets
At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Group initially recognizes financial assets that are measured at amortized cost on the date of occurrence. The Group initially recognizes other financial assets on the transaction date.
In cases in which the contractual right with respect to the cash flow from a financial asset is extinguished or the contractual right to receive cash flow from a financial asset has been transferred, and substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of such asset are removed, the Group derecognizes such financial asset.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
A financial asset that meets the following conditions is classified as financial asset measured at amortized cost. • The asset is held based on a business model whose
objective is to hold an asset in order to collect cash flow
under a contract; and,
• Based on the contractual terms with respect to the financial
asset, the cash flow, which is intended only for payment of principal and interests on the outstanding principal balance, arises on a specified date.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, the carrying amount of such financial assets measured at amortized cost is calculated using the effective interest method.
(b) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Of the financial assets that have been classified as financial assets to be measured at fair value instead of at amortized cost, financial assets other than for investment to an equity instrument, of which subsequent changes to the fair value thereof will be presented as other comprehensive income, are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for purchase and sale.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized as profit or loss. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, and subsequent changes in the fair value of such financial assets are recognized as profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Of the financial instruments that have been classified as financial assets to be measured at fair value instead of at amortized cost, in regards to equity instruments invested in not for the purpose of purchase and sale, an election may be made at initial recognition to present subsequent changes to the fair value of such instruments as other comprehensive income (such election being irrevocable). The Group makes such election per such financial instrument.
At initial recognition, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of such assets. After initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and the subsequent changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive income. When the equity investment is derecognized, or the decrease in fair value compared to acquisition cost is substantial, the accumulated amount of other comprehensive income is reclassified as retained earnings and not as profit or loss. Dividends are recognized as profit or loss.
2) Impairment of financial assets
With respect to financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence that an impairment exists at each fiscal year end. A financial asset is determined to be impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of such asset, and there is an effect on such financial asset’s cash flow that can be reliably estimated due to such impairment event.
Objective evidence that proves impairment of a financial asset includes, without limitation, the following: re-evaluation of the repayment terms due to breach of contract caused by the debtor's payment default, delinquency or the like or economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor's financial difficulties;
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 113

 indications that the debtor may become bankrupt; disappearance of an active market; adverse changes in the payment status of the borrower; and, economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets.
The Group individually assesses an individually significant financial asset, and collectively assesses financial assets that are not individually significant, for objective evidence of impairment.
When there is objective evidence that indicates that a financial asset is impaired, such amount of impairment is measured as the difference between such asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Such asset’s carrying amount is decreased through allowance for doubtful receivables, and the amount of such impairment is recognized as profit or loss. The amount of allowance for doubtful receivables is reduced from the asset’s carrying amount directly afterwards when the uncollectible amount was decided. If the amount of such impairment loss decreases due to an event that occurs after recognition of such impairment, the previously recognized impairment loss will be reversed and recognized as profit or loss.
3) Financial liabilities
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss or financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized on the occurrence date thereof and other financial liabilities are recognized on the transaction date thereof.
Financial liabilities are no longer recognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when obligations specified under a contract are discharged, cancelled or expires.
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities, other than financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value less any transaction costs directly attributable to incurring of such liabilities. After initial recognition, such financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are recognized as profit or loss.
4) Derivatives and hedge accounting
In order to hedge the foreign currency risk, interest rate fluctuation risk and commodity price fluctuation risk, the Group conducts derivative transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, interest rate swap transactions and commodity futures and forwards transactions.
When initiating a hedge, the Group designates and documents the risk management purposes and strategies regarding the hedge relationship and initiation of such hedge. Such documentation includes the designation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and methods of assessing the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Although such hedging is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk, it is assessed on an ongoing basis for its actual effectiveness throughout the reporting periods for which such hedging was designated.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value and subsequent changes in the fair value thereof are accounted for as follows:
(a) Fair value hedges
The changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument are recognized as profit or loss. The carrying amount of hedged items is measured at fair value and the gains or losses on such hedged items arising from changes in the fair values attributable to the hedged risks are recognized as profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow hedges
Of the changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedging instrument, portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income.
The amount recognized as other comprehensive income is reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged transaction affects profit or loss; provided, however, that if hedging of a scheduled transaction subsequently results in the recognition of an non- financial asset or liability, the amount recognized as other comprehensive income is then accounted for as revision to the initial carrying amount of such non-financial asset or liability.
When the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or designation of the hedge is revoked, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the scheduled transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amount of the effective portions of the hedge that have been recognized as other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified from other component of equity to profit or loss.
(c) Hedge of a net investment
Of the changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedge instrument under the same accounting applied to a cash flow hedge, portions determined to be effective are recognized as other comprehensive income. Such effective portions are reclassified from other components of equity to profit or loss at the time of disposition of a foreign operation.
(d) Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized as profit or loss.
5) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount of such offset is presented in the consolidated statements of financial position only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(11) Provisions
A provision is recognized only when the Group has a present obligation (legal or presumptive) as a result of a past event, there is a probability that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle such obligation and a reliable estimate can be made regarding the amount of such obligation.
Where there is materiality in the effects of time value of money, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to said liability.
114 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018

 (12) Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets or disposal groups to be collected mainly through sales transactions (but not for continuous use) are classified as held for sale.
To be classified as held for sale, an asset must be immediately sellable at its present state and have an extremely high probability for such sale. In addition, management must have firm commitment to execute the plan to sell such asset and complete such sale within one year from the date of such classification.
Immediately before being classified as held for sale, an asset, or components of a disposal group, are re-measured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. After the classification as held for sale, such asset is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets on a pro rata basis. Impairment losses of an asset that was initially classified as held for sale or disposal group, and subsequent gains or losses arising following the remeasurement are recognized as profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment property classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.
When the Group has committed itself to exercise a sales plan involving the loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in such subsidiary after the sale.
(13) Equity
1) Share capital and capital surplus
Proceeds from issuance of equity instruments by the Company are included in share capital and capital surplus. Transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are deducted from capital surplus.
2) Treasury stock
When the Group reacquires treasury stocks, the consideration paid is recognized as a deduction from equity. Transaction costs directly attributable to the reacquisition of treasury stocks are deducted from capital surplus.
In addition, when the Group sells treasury stocks, the consideration received is recognized as an increase in equity.
(14) Revenue
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returned goods, discounts and rebates. If there are multiple identifiable components in a single transaction, such transaction is separated into components, and revenue is recognized per such component. On the other hand, when the actual economic state cannot be expressed without treating multiple transactions as one unit, revenue is recognized by treating such multiple transactions as one unit.
The recognition standards and presentation method with respect to revenue are as follows:
1) Revenue recognition standards
(a) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when all of the following conditions have been satisfied:
• the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks
and rewards associated with the ownership of such goods;
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement
to the degree usually associated with ownership nor
substantial control over the goods sold;
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• there is a strong possibility that economic benefits associated with such transaction will flow to the Group; and,
• the costs incurred with respect to such transaction can be measured reliably.
(b) Rendering of services
If results of revenue from the rendering of services can be reliably estimated, such revenue will be recognized in accordance with such transaction’s degree of progress as of the fiscal year end. If all of the following conditions are satisfied, it is determined that results of a transaction can be reliably estimated:
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• there is a strong possibility that economic benefits
associated with such transaction will flow to the Group;
• such transaction’s degree of progress can be reliably
measured as of the fiscal year end; and,
• the costs incurred with respect to such transaction and the
costs required to complete such transaction can be measured reliably.
If results of a transaction regarding the provision of services cannot be reliably estimated, then revenue is recognized only with respect to portions of which costs are considered recoverable.
2) Method of presenting revenue
When the Group is a party to a transaction, revenue therefrom is presented in gross. When the Group is acting as an agent for a third party in a transaction, revenue is presented in the amount received by such third party less the amount collected on behalf of such third party (i.e., commission).
The following indices are considered when determining whether the Group is acting as a party or an agent with respect
to a •
•
• • •
transaction:
whether the Group has the primary responsibility with respect to providing goods or services to the customer or fulfilling an order;
whether the Group has an inventory risk before or after receiving an order from the customer, during shipping or when goods are returned;
whether the Group has the right to establish prices, either directly or indirectly; and,
whether the Group bears the customer’s credit risk in regards to accounts receivables against such customer, whether the collection schedule for the proceeds is already decided by transaction or arranged by rate of the proceeds.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(15) Financial income and costs
Financial income comprises interest income, dividend income, gain on sales of financial instruments and gain arising from change in the fair value of financial instruments. Interest income is recognized at the time of receipt by using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized on the date when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
Financial costs comprise interest expenses, loss on sales of financial instruments and loss arising from change in the fair value of financial instruments.
(16) Employee benefits
1) Post-employment benefits
(a) Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans refer to retirement benefit plans other than a defined contribution plan. Defined benefit obligations are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the future amount of benefits that employees will have earned in
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 115

 return for their services provided in the current and prior periods and discounting such amount in order to determine the present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the present value of the defined benefit obligations.
The discount rates are principally equivalent to the market yields of AA credit-rated corporate bonds at the fiscal year end that have maturity terms that are approximately the same as those of the Group’s obligations and use the same currencies as those used for future benefits payments.
Past service cost is immediately recognized as profit or loss.
The Group immediately recognizes all of the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) as other comprehensive income and promptly reclassifies them as retained earnings.
(b) Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are retirement benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or presumptive obligation to pay any amount over its contribution amount. The obligations already paid or to be paid as contributions under the defined contribution plans are recognized as expenses in the period in which the employees provided the services related thereto.
(c) Multi-employer plans
Certain subsidiaries participate in pension plans, which are classified as multi-employer plans. In regards to such pension plans, sufficient information to calculate the proportionate share of such plan assets cannot be obtained. Thus, the Group accounts for such pension plans in the same manner in which it recognizes defined contribution plans. In other words, contributions to such multi-employer plans are recognized as expenses in the period in which the employees provided their services.
2) Other long-term employee benefits
Obligations in respect of long-term employee benefits other than post-employment benefits are calculated by estimating the future amount of benefits that employees will have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods and discounting such amount in order to determine the present value.
3) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are not discounted. Instead, they are accounted for as expenses at the time services related thereto are provided.
With respect to bonuses, the Group owes legal and presumptive payment obligations as a consequence of past employee services provided. If such amount of payment obligations can be reliably estimated, such estimated amount to be paid based on such bonus system is recognized as a liability.
(17) Income taxes
Income tax expense comprises current tax expenses and deferred tax expenses. These are recognized as profit or loss, except when they arise from items that are directly recognized as other comprehensive income or equity, and from a business combination.
Current tax expenses are measured by the expected taxes receivable from or taxes payable to tax authorities, and the tax amounts are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the fiscal year end.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset and liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base,
the unused tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits carried forward. The amounts of tax assets and liabilities are calculated under the expected tax rate or tax law applicable as of the period in which assets are realized or liabilities settled based on a statutory tax rate or the same substantially enacted as of the fiscal year end. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized in the following cases:
• when taxable temporary differences arise from initial recognition of goodwill;
• when they arise from initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is neither a business combination nor affects accounting profit and taxable profit (or loss) at the time of the transaction; and,
• with respect to taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, or interests in joint arrangements, when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and, such deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied on the same taxation entity. However, even in the case of different taxable entities, the Group can set off if the tax taxable entities intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net bases, or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, the unused tax losses carried forward and unused tax credits carried forward to the extent that it is probable that they can be used against future taxable profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reassessed at each fiscal year end, and such carrying amount will be reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that related tax benefits from such assets will be realized.
(18) Lease
The Group determines whether an agreement is of a lease, or contains a lease, based on the substance of such agreement as of the date of commencement of a lease. The substance of an agreement is determined based on the following factors:
(a) whether the performance thereof is dependent on a specified asset or asset group; and,
(b) whether such agreement includes the right to use such asset.
1) Finance lease
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
Lease assets are initially recognized at lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the total of minimum lease payments. After the initial recognition, such lease assets are accounted for based on the applicable accounting policies. Lease payments are apportioned between financing costs and repayment amounts of the lease obligations so as to maintain a certain interest rate against the balance of the liability.
2) Operating lease
An operating lease is a lease except for finance lease. Lease payments are mainly recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
In the case the Group is the lessor of an asset under an operating lease, such asset is recognized in accordance with its nature under the consolidated statements of financial position.

 2) Impairment tests
A cash-generating unit group to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that such unit may be impaired. Material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating unit groups were as follows.

    The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its value in use founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management.
The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performance. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated.
The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates that were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, were as follows.
(a) Discount rate before tax
2017
Chemicals
Parent company’s chemical business .......................................................................................... 6.7%
Consumer Lifestyle Business
The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ........................................................................... 6.8%
(b) Ultimate growth rate
In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term.
With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.
(2) Intangible assets
Increases/decreases in costs and accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses of intangible assets were as follows. [Costs]

    An important part of the carrying value of mining rights on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 is the mining interest held by the Australian subsidiaries, amounting to 11,122 million yen and 10,398 million yen (U.S.$98,094 thousand).
Customer-related assets are included in the carrying value in the category of “Others” on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.
The value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included above were 4,936 million yen on March 31, 2017, and 6,618 million yen (U.S.$62,433 thousand) on March 31, 2018. Such assets consisted primarily of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements were mainly acquired through business combinations and were expected to exist as long as business continues. Therefore, management considers the useful lives of these assets to be indefinite.
There were no internally-generated intangible assets as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.
Amortization expenses are included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

     The fair values are amounts that the Group calculated based on an independent appraiser’s appraisals and the “real estate appraisal standards” of the country in which the investment properties are located. These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index.
As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments,” fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3.

          Among the assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly related thereto, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and bonds and borrowings are measured at amortized cost and other investments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
As of March 31, 2018, the main assets and liabilities directly related thereto that were classified as held for sale were assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that were included in the Infrastructure & Environment Business segment, and the equity method affiliates that were included in the Foods & Agriculture Business segment. Sojitz Corporation decided to sell its assets as part of its asset replacement program. Thus, the assets and liabilities of the company were classified as assets held for sale and liabilities directly related thereto. The sales were completed in May 2018 and April 2018.
19 EQUITY
(1) Capital management
In order to enhance its enterprise value, the Company has as its basic policies the maintenance of a healthy financial position and stability in its funding structure, accumulation of its own equity through the realization of sustained growth and expansion of its financial base. The Company uses net DER* and risk assets ratio** as main indices for managing the Company’s equity.
FY2017 was the final year of the “Medium-Term Management Plan 2017”, which aimed for a net DER of 1.5 times or less. In the same period, the target was to manage the risk assets ratio to within 1.0 times. These targets were reached due to improved asset efficiency caused by asset replacement coupled with suppression of increased borrowings.
In the “Medium-Term Management Plan 2020”, with FY2020 as the final year, the aim for net DER is also 1.5 times or less. Further, in FY2018 the target is to manage the risk assets ratio to within 1.0 times. These will be achieved through continuing investment initiatives for further growth, and strengthening functions for upholding financial discipline and growth. These indicators are periodically reported and monitored by management.
* Net DER = (Interest bearing liabilities - Cash and cash equivalents - Time deposits) ÷ Own equity (Own equity = Total equity amount less non-controlling interests) ** Risk assets ratio = Risk asset (such asset amount calculated based on assessment of such risk in correspondence to the size of such risk) ÷ Own equity
Net DERs and Risk assets ratios as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively, were as follows.
2017 Net DER ..................................................................................................................... 1.1 times
Risk assets ratio.......................................................................................................... 0.6 times

      During the year ended March 31, 2017, with respect to its investment in Brazil in which it has a 43.1% equity stake through a consolidated subsidiary and to which it applies the equity method, it is estimated that it could be impossible to secure the levels of income initially projected. Upon reviewing the recoverable amount, the Company recognized an impairment loss of 6,693 million yen (U.S.$63,141 thousand) based on fair value. The loss is included in “Loss on reorganization of subsidiaries/associates” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 135

 hierarchy level 3. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments,” fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques.
During the year ended March 31, 2018, the impairment losses were mainly related to equity method affiliates within the Infrastructure & Environment Business segment and to machinery within the Energy segment, with both impairments stemming from decreased profitability of these assets and other factors.

4) Multi-employer plans
Nissho Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company, is a member of the Tokyo-to Electric Industry Corporate Pension Fund Organization, which is a multi-employer plan.
The contributions for this fund are calculated as a fixed percentage of the average salary or the like of participating employees. In addition, each fund ensures future solvency by revising the contribution a minimum of every five years in accordance with relevant regulations.
If the funds are dissolved and liquidated, they will charge participants to cover deficits or distribute residual assets calculated by minimum funding standards based on regulations or the like. In addition, companies that elect to withdraw from the funds are subject to a charge to cover any liabilities and deficits projected to result from their withdrawal.
This fund is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated.

                              The Group is an integrated trading company engaged in a wide range of business activities on a global basis. Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature.
(3) Credit risk management
The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial
146 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018

 transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer- by-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer.
In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationally-acknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties.
1) Maximum exposure to credit risk
Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 were 21,320 million yen and 26,820 million yen (U.S.$253,018 thousand), respectively.
2) Financial assets that are past the due date
The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like.

3) Financial assets of which impairment has occurred
    The Group establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts for each major customer by reviewing, among other matters, such customer's financial condition and credit ratings, status of collection of receivables with respect to such customer, amendments to payment conditions, industry trends and state of affairs of the country/region in which such customer was situated. Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows.

Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 147

 (4) Liquidity risk management
The Group raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions or issuance of bonds. Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets or a significant downgrade to the Group’s credit rating by one or more rating agencies, the Group’s ability to raise funds may become more restricted, and consequently the Group may not be able to make payments on debt by the due date. To provide additional financial flexibility and liquidity, the Group maintains long-term Commitment Lines of 100 billion yen (not used) and 1.9 billion U.S. dollars (760 million U.S. dollars used). The Group maintains good relationships with financial institutions, including the counterparties to these commitment line agreements.

       The Group is exposed to market risks, such as exchange rate fluctuation risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments, interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financing, investments or the like, commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements/commodity inventories arising from operating activities and price fluctuation risk associated with the ownership of listed securities (i.e., stock price fluctuation risk). The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps.
Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2018 149

 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk
1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk
The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like.
2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk
In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.
In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations.

     The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds to acquire fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit (e.g., through trade receivables). Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks.
2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk
In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.
Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable.

3) Commodity price fluctuation risk
1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk
 As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group's management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels.

In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

(a) Trade notes and accounts receivable
Each receivable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk.
(b) Trade notes and accounts payable
Each payable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk.
(c) Bonds and borrowings
The fair value of bonds payable is the market price when available.
The fair value of long-term loans is the present value of total principal and interest discounted using an assumed interest rate on
equivalent new borrowings.

 The fair values stated above are calculated as follows.
(a) Other investments
The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group’s corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies.
(b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities
Currency-related derivatives
The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date.
Interest rate-related derivatives
The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk.
Commodity-related derivatives
The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end.
Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2.
2. Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3
The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

 4) Reclassification to retained earnings
The Group reclassifies to retained earnings cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in either of the following cases: when an investment is disposed of; and, when there is a significant decline in the fair value. Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 were losses of 1,229 million yen and 828 million yen (U.S.$7,811 thousand), respectively.
(8) Hedge accounting
1) Types of hedge accounting
(a) Fair value hedges
A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories.
With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss.
Gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments included net gains of 154 million yen and net gains of 21 million yen (U.S.$198 thousand) for the years ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018, respectively. Gains or losses on the hedged items or less corresponded to the gains or losses on the hedging instruments.
(b) Cash flow hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency.
With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.
For the years ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were losses of 661 million yen and 665 million yen (U.S.$6,273 thousand), respectively.
(c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations.
With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.

           The Group liquidates certain trade receivables by discounting notes or the like. However, with respect to some liquidated receivables, the Group may be obligated to make payments as recourse for non-payment by the debtor. The Group continues to recognize such liquidated receivables as they do not meet the criteria for derecognition of financial assets.
The Group recognized such liquidated assets as “Trade and other receivables” in the amounts of 23,127 million yen and 20,894 million yen (U.S.$197,113 thousand) as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. In addition, liabilities relating to the deposit amounts which arose upon the transfer of such assets were accounted for as “Bonds and borrowings” in the amounts of 23,127 million yen and 20,894 million yen (U.S.$197,113 thousand) as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Such liabilities are settled when payments for such liquidated assets are made, and the Group may not use such liquidated assets until such settlement occurs.

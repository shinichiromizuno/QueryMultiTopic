Conserving resources by promoting reuse of retired aircraft
How We Get There 2
   Amidst heightened concerns about environmental destruction and ecosystem impact from resource mining, finding ways to effectively use resources has become a global issue. This led to the creation of Sojitz Groupâ€™s part-out business, whereby we purchase decommissioned passenger aircraft and dismantle them in cooperation with external partners, selling the parts to companies in the aerospace industry.
The part-out business completes our aircraft business value chain, covering the entire aircraft lifecycle, from selling new aircraft to financing, leasing, operation, maintenance, and remarketing. We give new life to decommissioned aircraft using the knowledge and know-how we have acquired as a leading company in the aircraft-related industry. Through this business that contributes to conservation and effective use of resources, we will expand our aircraft aftermarket business to meet the rising demand for aircraft worldwide.

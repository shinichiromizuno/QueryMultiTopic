Sustainable Procurement Education for Suppliers
Based on the Sapporo Group Procurement Basic Policy and the Sapporo Group Supplier Sustainability Procurement Guideline, the Group has chosen six main subjects to frame two-way communication with suppliers and undertake cooperative sus- tainability-related efforts: safety and quality, compliance with laws, human rights and labor, environmental conservation, coexistence with society, and alcoholic beverage-related issues. Through these efforts, we aim to realize a healthy and enrich- ing society.
At supplier-oriented information sessions about our market- ing policies, we provide explanations and education regarding the Sapporo Groupâ€™s approach to sustainable procurement.

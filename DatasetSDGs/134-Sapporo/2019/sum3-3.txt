Spreading of Japanese Beer Culture and Contributions to Fulfilling Lives
The one and only Beer Museum in
Japan—Sapporo Beer Museum
The museum conveys the history of
Japanese beer, born of the devotion
and passion of great figures, and
also imparts the spirit and stories
passed on through the beer inherited by Sapporo Breweries.
Museum of YEBISU BEER—Built on the Birthplace of YEBISU
YEBISU was born in 1890 in Ebisu, Tokyo. The museum is a place where you can take in the birthplace of YEBISU, transcendent of history
and time.

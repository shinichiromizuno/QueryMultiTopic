Acquisition of Safety Certification for Breweries and Plants
Previously, the Sapporo Group owned eight major breweries and one plant, POKKA SAPPORO Food & Beverage’s Gunma Plant, all with FSSC 22000 certification, which targets food manufacturing organizations and is the international standard for food safety management systems.
In 2019, POKKA SAPPORO Food & Beverage’s Nagoya Plant became the newest plant to receive this certification. Moreover, OKINAWA POKKA FOODS CO., LTD. acquired ISO 22000:2018 certification, the most recent version of the certi- fication that targets food safety management systems. Going forward, the Sapporo Group will continue to improve its quality assurance systems.

Supporting Local Communities
Resolution of Social Issues through
Collaborative Agreements
Since its founding, the Sapporo Group has cherished its ties to the areas and local communities with which it has a long history. Beginning with a comprehensive collaborative agreement with Hokkaido Prefecture in 2007, the Group has gone on to establish a collaborative agreement with Fukushima Prefecture. All in all, the Sapporo Group has established 63 agreements with local municipalities and universities across Japan as of February 2020. We will continue our ongoing efforts to promote regional revitalization, urban development, disaster prevention, and the resolution of other social issues into the future.
Thirty-Four Years of Support for the Hakone Ekiden
The Hakone Ekiden is a relay marathon synonymous with the Japanese New Year. Sapporo Breweries has supported the Hakone Ekiden since 1987, for a total of 34 years.
Every year, Group employees conduct charity sales near the outbound finish of Lake Ashi and donate a part of the sales to the Hakone Trust Fund, established by Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture.
As we value our connections with the athletes who support the Hakone Ekiden, the people involved and their families, and the surrounding area, we will continue to connect with more people in the future.

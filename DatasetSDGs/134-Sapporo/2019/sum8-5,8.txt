Diversity & Inclusion and Human Rights
Sapporo Management Seminar
The Sapporo Group promotes “diversity and inclusion,” in which the experience, abilities, and ideas of its entire range of diverse employees can be utilized.
In 2020, we held a management seminar for management- level employees featuring members of the LGBT community and cancer survivors from within the country. By helping attendees recognize the existence of diverse communities and get a grasp of the feelings of people in these communities— which can be difficult to understand from an outside perspec- tive—this seminar served as a chance to encourage managers to see and respect their fellow employees as equals and think of how to create work conditions that allow a diverse set of human resources to fully display their abilities.
Going forward, we will continue to educate managers on their important roles in the workplace.
Human Resource Development and Training
In-House Internship Program
In 2019, the Sapporo Group introduced its In-House Internship Program on a trial basis as a new measure aimed at career development. The program is an initiative aimed at fostering a culture that encourages career development for young and mid-career employees and communication across departments (going “Beyond Boundaries”) and at allowing participants (“interns”) to perform duties in a department of their choosing. This enables the intern to gain experience with the current work being done in their accepting department and apply it to their future careers. We expect this program to have synergistic benefits, in that the accepting department will be able to gain new, never-before-seen perspectives from the influx of new, short-term human resources.

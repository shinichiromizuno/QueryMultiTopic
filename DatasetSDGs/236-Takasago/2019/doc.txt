  Value Creation and Performance
   Top Message
Turning changes in the business environment into good opportunities for innovations,
we will get closer to the realization of
our long-term management framework
The current business environment provides a boost to the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group and encourages us to strive for innovations. Demand for construction in Japan has remained strong, supported by preparation for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, large-scale redevelopment projects in the Tokyo metropolitan area and active capital investment by companies. Orders placed with the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group have also increased. In the meantime, demand for work style reform, the shortage of construction workers and the anticipation of a low birthrate and an aging population motivate us to pursue the thorough improvement of productivity. The global movement toward the realization of a decarbonized society by the mid-21st century based on the Paris Agreement also gives great opportunities to our Group, which sets environmental engineering as a motto, in Japan and overseas.
In our current medium-term business plan, which is the second step of our long-term management framework named GReeN PR!DE 100, we have promoted actions that take advantage of changes in the business environment while setting eight priority action items, which are the enhancement of on-site capabilities, strengthening of group collaboration, re-establishment of the international business, advances to the areas other than the contracting or subcontracting business, the creation of new services, the building of workplace environments that allow a work-life balance, the development of various human resources and the strengthening of investments for innovations and management infrastructure. While working to maintain profits in the building service business, we are making growth investment from a medium- to long-term perspective under the themes including mergers and acquisitions (M&A), the acceleration of globalization, the strengthening of IT infrastructure, the promotion of new business creation and the strengthening of management infrastructure.
In our performance for fiscal 2018, all of the orders received, net sales and income indexes were the highest in our history since our foundation. Accordingly, the annual dividend of 52 yen per share was paid to shareholders, which was increased by 2 yen from the previous fiscal year. Although we still have a long way to go, we consider that our efforts based on the long-term management framework have produced certain achievements.
In fiscal 2019, which is the final fiscal year for the current medium-term business plan, we are developing initiatives for the shift to a hybrid form of business in which we conduct both construction and the provision of solutions in a comprehensive manner. As a representative example of the businesses in a hybrid form, we focus on the facility management (FM) business. Our commitment to the business is moving to a new stage through the synergy of group collaboration, the development of human resources with advanced skills, the establishment of IT infrastructure, etc. In addition, our efforts to accelerate innovations are being enhanced mainly with the cooperation of startup companies and the construction of a new research and development base. We also set up a new organizational structure and personnel systems that support those initiatives in April 2019. Moreover, we focus on measures that accelerate the development of a health management system. With the recognition that health is the most important asset for companies, we have issued a health declaration with an aim of becoming a company where all executives and staff are physically and mentally healthy and work energetically ("Well-being Company").
Through those initiatives, we will further enhance our commitment to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Please look forward to the continuous growth of the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group as an environmental engineering company that contributes to the global environment.

    Main kinds of social value
that the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group creates through its business
          In December 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 21), and a shift to a low-carbon society began to be further promoted on a global scale. Supporting this trend is the social mission of the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group, which has been providing air environments friendly to humans, products, and nature for various kinds of buildings including office buildings, hotels, hospitals, and factories, and the specific outcomes of getting closer to a low-carbon society will be the core of the social value that we will create in the future.

Intellectual capital
Social capital
Since its foundation under the company name of Takasago Heating Works Co., Ltd. in 1923, Takasago Thermal Engineering has engaged in the construction of the HVAC systems of many renowned buildings, as well as district heating and cooling, and developed numerous systems and devices to the present. Through the operation, we have not only cultivated the techniques in the HVAC construction business but also established trust with partner companies. The circle of our partners has grown to involve more than 1,600 companies. Together with Kowakai (partner company organization)*, we will make social contributions as an environmental engineering company that helps realize a sustainable world such as the creation of a decarbonized society and a recycling-oriented society.
* Kowakai was organized with our partner companies as the members in 2003 to enhance cooperation with the partner companies working on the construction sites. The organization shares information on quality, health, safety, environmental conservation and other subjects of management with Takasago Thermal Engineering and also gives such information to the members to ensure proper management.
Human and
       Since its foundation in 1923, Takasago Thermal Engineering has been involved in the design and construction of a large number of offices, factories and various other types of buildings. Through the design and construction work, we have accumulated a wealth of know-how on engineering and construction management of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. We organize internal seminars and have databases to share the know-how throughout the company and also have in place a system to meet the latest demand from various customers. We aggressively present the outcomes of our activities to "develop technology that serves our customers’ needs," which is mentioned in our management principles, at the conferences of the Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Sanitary Engineers of Japan. The number of awards we have received has been the largest in the HVAC industry for many years and we also remain the leader in the industry in terms of the number of patents, etc. owned. We also set a basic approach that "we will work to enhance the legal protection and use of intellectual properties while respecting legitimate intellectual property rights of third parties" and promote intellectual property activities in coordination with "contact personnel" in each of the main office and branches.

Takasago Thermal Engineering adopted a new personnel system in fiscal 2019 to systematize career paths and enhance the motivation of employees through such measures as the introduction of a flexible age-limit system where employees can select the age of retirement between 61 and 65, the integration of duties of the limited-area main career track with those of the general track with an aim to expand the career of female employees, the replacement of an age-based pay system with a role-based pay system and the adoption of an overseas trainee program for young employees with an aim to develop global human resources. In addition, in order to develop human resources who will create Takasago’s future, we have established the Takasago Academy, at which we offer practical and multifaceted educational programs through the combination of various types of training (Off-JT: off the job training) and various experiences (OJT: on the job training).
As initiatives for work style reform, we have introduced a teleworking system and a system of paid holidays that can be taken by the hour to help employees work without being bound by time or place. We have also set up a health management office where an industrial physician and public health nurse are stationed to support employees and promote health management.

  For the establishment of a hybrid form
in the Kyoto Station Building
Kyoto Station Building heat source and HVAC system repair work commissioning project
of business in which we conduct both
construction and the provision of solutions
To provide high added value to customers through environmental engineering using advanced technologies beyond the conventional borders of the building service business, the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group promotes a "shift to a hybrid form of business in which we conduct both construction and the provision of solutions" as the main subject for the current medium-term business plan.
The core business in this initiative is the support of customers in their facility management (the effective use and management of facilities as long-term management resources), which is called "FM solution" in our Group. Through cooperation within the Group, we will make facilities such as offices, commercial buildings, hospitals, universities and museums more comfortable and energy saving and also reduce the burdens on customers. Then, while establishing long-term relationships with customers, we will offer new value in accordance with their needs, which are different between the cases. We have already promoted the activities on a trial basis for several years. At present, our branches are involved in pilot projects (model construction sites). The activities in the pilot projects are adjusted to ensure that they cover all of the promising areas for our Group.
Keys to the provision of a wide range of FM solutions are the establishment of infrastructure to analyze and use data for the optimization of the life cycle of equipment and facilities and the development of human resources who will be in charge of the solutions. In fiscal 2018, we made significant progress in both aspects.
The Kyoto Station Building, which was constructed in 1997 and serves an entrance to Kyoto, an Eco-Model City, was consuming more primary energy than any other single building in the city and its CO2 emissions accounted for approximately 3% of total emissions in the commercial sector in Kyoto City. In response, Kyoto Station Building Development Co., Ltd., which was the contractee of the project, implemented renewal work that adopted "full-spec commissioning," which comprehensively covers surveying, basic design, execution design, construction and operation, for the first time in Japan for a large-scale building. This project was a part of the efforts of Kyoto City to achieve its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60% over 60 years. As a result, the repaired equipment reduced the consumption of primary energy by 60% and the whole building including the parts that have not been repaired reduced the consumption by 30%. Thus, a significant reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions has been achieved.
The commissioning team consisted of the commissioning management team (with the members organized by the
Building Services Commissioning Association), which was responsible for the promotion of the project, along with contractees, designers, contractors and operation managers. Takasago Thermal Engineering was involved in the construction and operation phases of the project as a contractor and contributed to it by optimizing the equipment capacity and specifications (VE), preparing a construction work plan that can be executed even in a 24-hour operation and proposing the improvement of efficiency of the functionality and performance test using cloud BEMS (GODA® cloud of our Group).
In recognition of this project, the commissioning team jointly received the Minister’s Prize, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in the Successful Case of Energy Conservation Category of the FY2018 Grand Prize for Excellence in Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Renewal Award in the 7th Special Award of the Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Sanitary Engineers of Japan and the 7th Carbon Neutral Award.

We launched Takasago Thermal Engineering Accelerator “just move on!," which is a program to create new businesses and services by combining the ideas, technologies and performance capabilities of startup companies with our resources, in fiscal 2017. LiLz Inc., which was selected in the first program, jointly developed LiLz Gauge with Takasago Thermal Engineering and Takasago Marusei Engineering Service, a Group company. LiLz Gauge is a cloud-based service that helps improve the efficiency and quality of building maintenance based on automatic reading of meters with IoT cameras and machine
learning.
The data read by LiLz Gauge are stored in the cloud and the accumulated data can be analyzed with various tools. As more various meters can be read, the accumulated data also increase to analyze a wider range of data.
We will repeat such a process to expand the scope of FM solutions. Moreover, we will consider the use of them for preventive maintenance of equipment so that we can create a unique "eco-system" on a platform to offer new value.

    Effective use of operation data of equipment and devices
The Takasago Thermal Engineering Group provides Eco-Tuning® support, which properly improves the operation of equipment, devices and systems while maintaining comfort and productivity, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, plants and other establishments for the realization of a decarbonized society. In a building, a central monitoring system collects operational data of the equipment. However, there are not many facilities where those data are effectively used.
This problem can happen when the data are held only in the local system or when the facility manager stationed on-site does not have sufficient skills or time to analyze the data. As a solution to it, we have developed a cloud-based version of GODA®, a data analysis tool that enables users to operate it flexibly, to allow the local facilities to be connected to analyzers in a remote place.
In addition, to provide a wide range of FM solutions to various issues of customers such as the shortage of facility management personnel and the optimization of the life cycle of facilities, we have promoted the establishment of the Takasago Smart Platform, which is also a priority measure in our medium-term business plan. This platform collects measurement data and equipment operation data using the IoT to automatically give advice on the optimal equipment operation method and enable automatic control of equipment in an optimal manner. We launched the services in April 2019 and have promoted even more effective use of data since then.

      Development of human resources
who can propose solutions to management issues
  Our FM solution services bring wide-ranging advantages to clients by supporting them in the use of their commercial real estate. Proposals from the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group have conventionally placed an emphasis on the reduction of the running cost of facilities. In the future, we need to pay close attention to the management issues of clients and present solutions to them when we make proposals. Our FM solutions have great potential to respond to such management issues because they can mix a wide range of approaches such as the operation of equipment on behalf of customers by using GODA® Cloud and Takasago Smart Platform, the supply of renewable energy and the maintenance of business continuity in case of a disaster. A key is the human resources who can realize it. We will endeavor to develop as many human resources as possible who will be committed to understanding customers and identifying and solving their problems.

  Value Creation and Performance
  The improvement of productivity is a significant challenge to be addressed when we work to properly meet the growing construction demand
and implement work style reform. Using this situation as an opportunity,
the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group has started to try to create new ways of doing jobs on a full scale.

Implementation
of Work Style Reform
Commitment to the Improvement of Productivity
While construction demand is growing prior to the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020, social awareness of work style reform is being enhanced with the establishment of the related laws in Japan. As a result, the improvement of productivity has become an urgent task in the construction industry. This is also an extremely important factor for the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group to maintain its medium- to long-term competitive strength.
We have set up dedicated divisions and cross-sectoral internal working groups to work for the improvement of productivity from various perspectives. One of the effective approaches is an internal outsourcing mechanism, which centralizes common duties for different sites in a functional unit to reduce on-site duties and improve the efficiency of overall tasks at the same time. We have named this functional unit "Process Support Section."
The Process Support Section has been set up in each of our branches in Japan. We give a certain degree of flexibility to its roles, which can be adjusted by the branches according to their respective circumstances. In some branches, the Process Support Section serves as a sort of internal consultant that supports staff on a construction site with accumulated knowledge and technology or promotes the improvement of the efficiency of operations in the whole company.

  Tohoku Branch is establishing a new workflow
Yokohama Branch is working to further improve the mechanism for the improvement of productivity
 Our Tohoku Branch, which is in charge of the six prefectures in the Tohoku Region, set up the Process Support Section in fiscal 2017. The section has expanded its structure in a phased manner and now operates with three employees, including the manager, and four external staff members. It has three main duties, namely the preparation of construction drawings, overall drawings, etc., the preparation of documents including working instructions and the development and online entry of safety information. In fiscal 2018, the preparation of drawings represented 60% of its total jobs.
At present, the most important function of the Tohoku Branch is to support large-scale construction sites. It gives intensive support to the review of construction and other drawings that is too burdensome for on-site staff to handle alone. Our branch is also becoming more aware that on-site staff members should be responsible for core duties only and the Process Support Section should be responsible for the duties that can be addressed outside the site. In fiscal 2019, we also plan to conduct a questionnaire survey of on-site staff, which has not been conducted, to improve our approach to support for them.
The Process Support Section of the Yokohama Branch currently consists of eight employees along with nine external staff members in charge of drawing and planning. The section is divided into the four groups of Construction Drawing Group, Construction Planning Group, Electric Instrumentation Group and Training and Office Work Group. Each of the groups conducts duties under the group leader. Our activity policy for fiscal 2019 is to "become a section that creates extraordinary construction sites." With this policy, we aim to allocate jobs to workers on each construction site in coordination with the Process Support Section to ensure that they can concentrate on core duties and their excellent skills and abilities can be effectively used for the operation of the sites. Having developed a list of the duties of the Process Support Section, we meticulously adjust which part of the
construction process should involve the section in coordination with on-site staff in view of the difficulty level of the on-site duties as well as the capabilities of the staff in charge. The leveling of duties in the Process Support Section is also promoted in cooperation with the Tokyo Main Office.
The Yokohama Branch recognizes that the Process Support Section should be in charge of wide-ranging duties and actively encourages the section to have a perspective beyond the scope of the branch. We also plan to promote initiatives to enhance the efficiency of duties through digitizing business forms, improving labor management in coordination with the technical administration work section and facilitating collaboration with partner companies.
     We will enhance the productivity of the branch as a whole through the accumulation of efforts
We will establish a mechanism involved in all construction processes
  Atsushi Hara
Manager, Process Support Section, Technology Division Tohoku Branch, Takasago Thermal Engineering Co., Ltd.
I was assigned to the Process Support Section in Tohoku last year after 10 years of engagement in construction work in Tokyo and one year of work in the Process Support Section in Tokyo. So, this is my second year in the section. When I was transferred from outside work to office work, I realized that it is reasonable for the Process Support Section to be in charge of some on-site duties including drawing and document preparation tasks.
The target of our section for this fiscal year is "Process Support Section that is helpful for the construction site." In my opinion, to achieve it, we should consider that the construction site is our workplace, rather than thinking that we support the site. I also try to get other staff to understand the idea continuously.
Although we cannot address all on-site duties at present, we will try our best to increase the jobs for which on-site staff can depend on the Process Support Section with a sense of trust. We will also let on-site staff know that they can improve work efficiency by devising the way of making requests to the Process Support Section. An accumulation of such efforts will lead to a further increase in requests for support from the construction site and thereby allow the staff to concentrate more on core duties. As a result, the productivity and quality of the duties of the branch as a whole will be improved. I am engaged in daily jobs with such a virtuous cycle in mind.
The Yokohama Branch places the most importance on ensuring that the Process Support Section establishes a mechanism involved in all construction processes from groundbreaking to completion. All members of the section recognize and consider the ideal state of the Process Support Section and make best efforts to execute their duties proactively. To build a foundation for it, we also work to improve the skills of the section staff. We repeat trial and error every day while also aiming at the ultimate situation that the jobs that can be done only on the site are left to the site and the Process Support Section is in charge of the other jobs including the preparation of construction drawings and construction plans and technical calculations. A view of our section staff working hard while talking with persons in charge of the site makes me feel confident about our commitment.
On the other hand, it is also true that some on-site workers may not have opportunities to experience the difficulty of on-site duties as a result of the proactive implementation of the duties by the Process Support Section. How to rotate staff between construction sites and the Process Support Section, as well as within the section, to avoid imbalance or shortage of experience or knowledge is an important future challenge and we have to examine it.
Shinji Inogaki
Manager, Process Support Section, Technology Division Yokohama Branch, Takasago Thermal Engineering Co., Ltd.
   The Nanba Office of the Osaka Branch has drastically renovated the workplace for the improvement of productivity. To allow staff to choose the working conditions according to the content and situation of their jobs, the workplace is basically used as a free-address office and divided into different zones such as concentration zone, drawing zone, project zone and relaxing zone. While fixed desks are maintained in part to ensure user-friendliness, the conference and main conference zone and refreshing space are also provided to facilitate communication between employees. We have also introduced a "power nap" program to encourage employees to take a nap for 20 minutes as well as an initiative to urge them to return home by playing music on a "no overtime" day.

Medium-term Business Plan
We are trying to "take a leap into the comprehensive building service business with HVAC system construction as our core business" and "create our second and third businesses" as the second step to establish the long-term management framework“GReeN PR!DE 100.
Medium-term business plan
To enhance its corporate value in a sustainable manner, the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group has designed a long-term management framework“GReeN PR!DE 100” towards its 100th anniversary in 2023. In the long-term management framework, Takasago Thermal Engineering aims to achieve three goals, namely "Company group continuously meeting customers expectations and always relied on and trusted by them," "Environmental company whose presence is admired in the global market" and "Environmental solution professional contributing to the global environment." We have developed and promoted a medium-term business plan that is divided into three steps as a roadmap to achieve the goals.
For the three years to fiscal 2016, as the first step of the long-term management framework, we were committed to the establishment of a foundation of innovations with the aims of enhancing on-site capabilities, developing human resources and ensuring stable profitability. Based on the outcomes, as the second step of the framework, we are working to "take a leap into the comprehensive building service business with HVAC system construction as our core business" and "create our second and third businesses" with the slogan of "iNnovate on 2019 just move on! Bold implementation of innovations for growth" for three years from fiscal 2017.
In the current medium-term business plan, we set eight priority action items to promote the bold implementation of innovations for growth, including the enhancement of on-site capabilities and strengthening of group collaboration. The whole Takasago Thermal Engineering Group is committed to the "shift to a hybrid form of business
in which we conduct both construction and the provision of solutions," which also includes facility management (FM) and property management (PM), to offer higher added value based on environmental engineering using leading-edge technologies. We have also decided to establish the Innovation Center (tentative name) as a collaborative research base to create new businesses and conduct technical research jointly with companies and research institutes outside the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group. The construction of the center is underway to start the operation in the spring of 2020.
For the strengthening of investments for innovations and management infrastructure, we have reconsidered the shares held for purposes other than investment, issued straight bonds and green bonds and developed a growth investment plan to invest 35 billion yen over the three years from fiscal 2017. The raised funds have been invested for subjects such as M&As that support the strengthening of the construction system and the expansion of our business fields, as well as the acceleration of globalization, the reinforcement of IT infrastructure, the promotion of new business creation and the strengthening of management infrastructure.
Business results and forecast
In the consolidated settlement of accounts for fiscal 2018, the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group posted sales of 319.8 billion yen (an increase of 10.3% from the previous fiscal year), operating income of 17.2 billion yen (an increase of 5.2% from the previous fiscal year), ordinary income of 18.3 billion yen (an increase of 5.1% from the previous fiscal year) and net income attributable to parent
company shareholders of 12.6 billion yen (an increase of 6.8% from the previous fiscal year), all of which were the record high since our foundation.
Demand for facility construction has been strong due to special demand for construction prior to the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, vigorous investments in large redevelopment projects in the Tokyo metropolitan area and active capital investment by companies, supported by the gradual recovery of the Japanese economy. On the other hand, a decline in capital investment due to the trade conflict between the US and China, etc., a sharp rise in labor costs because of the shortage of workers and other issues have become apparent. In consideration of those market changes, as well as our construction system, etc., we have set new business targets to maintain a solid trend.
As to our performance in fiscal 2019, we anticipate sales of 320.0 billion yen (an increase of 0.1% from the previous fiscal year), operating income of 17.7 billion yen (an increase of 2.8% from the previous fiscal year), ordinary income of 18.5 billion yen (an increase of 0.8% from the previous fiscal year) and net income attributable to parent company shareholders of 12.8 billion yen (an increase of 1.5% from the previous fiscal year). We have also set a target for the amount of orders received of 285.0 billion yen (a decrease of 13.6% from the previous year) assuming that we will work to receive orders according to the plan that takes profitability and our construction system into consideration.
Contribution to the establishment
of a decarbonized society
Triggered by the Paris Agreement adopted by the UN in 2015, environmental awareness has spread on a global scale. Decarbonization is a key challenge for the achievement
of a sustainable society and wide-ranging measures are taken to contribute to the global environment in various parts of the world. The Takasago Thermal Engineering Group pursues harmony with the international community and promotes initiatives that contribute to the global environment as an environmental engineering company. To this end, the group is affiliated with Global Compact Network Japan and other organizations involved in activities to conserve the global environment with an aim to establish a decarbonized society. We are also considering the development of a business strategy that sets SDGs, which are guidelines for the solution of global issues including climate change, environmental destruction and energy, as the core of our corporate management. Specifically, in the Innovation Center (tentative name) that we are currently constructing in Tsukubamirai, Ibaraki Prefecture, we plan to use energy harvesting such as renewable energy, heat in groundwater and natural sunlight to achieve ZEB (net zero energy building; ZEB Ready (50%) in the buildings as a whole and Net ZEB (100%) in the office building). We are also committed to research and development of an adsorbent thermal storage system that stores and uses low-temperature waste heat of 100oC or lower and a hydrogen energy system, which is expected as next-generation energy, with an aim to put them into practical use. In addition, we are working to develop and introduce AI- and IoT-based energy management systems for the optimization of energy use in buildings for the decarbonization of the whole value chain.

company and develop a corporate culture in which innovations can naturally occur.
Financial and investment strategies
1. Financial strategies
We will work to increase our sales cash flow by making improvements in income and expenditures related to construction in order to ensure funds for growth investment. Furthermore, we will endeavor to make effective use of our assets through the sale of shares held for purposes other than investment and other measures.
【About Takasago Thermal Green Bonds】
The Takasago Thermal Engineering Group promotes business activities while setting "Contributing to a decarbonized society for the world through environmental engineering" as the future goal for the group. Specific activities we perform for the purpose are "Contribution to establishing a decarbonized society," "Contribution to a society harmonized with nature" and "Contribution to creating a recycling-oriented society." In July 2019, we issued Takasago Thermal Green Bonds (third round of unsecured bonds) (seven-year bonds with an issuance amount of 5 billion yen at an interest rate of 0.27%). The funds raised with the bonds are
scheduled to be used as new investment funds for the construction of the Innovation Center (tentative name), which is under construction in Tsukubamirai, Ibaraki Prefecture, as well as equipment in the center.
 2 Maintenance of financial discipline
While working to maintain a sound ROE, we will raise funds through borrowing, etc. at low interest rates and in a planned manner.
3 Proactive returns to shareholders
With the basic policy of maintaining stable dividends while improving profitability and capital efficiency, we will pay dividends based on the consolidated dividend payout ratio of 30% and the minimum ratio of consolidated dividend on equity (DOE) of 2%. We will promote shareholder returns including treasury stock acquisition while keeping the total return ratio in mind.
2. Investment strategies
For growth investment, we have set funds of up to 35 billion yen in total to be invested over three years for the following five subjects and are currently implementing the investments.
   Meanwhile, we are also making efforts to apply existing technologies to other uses. For example, we have created a new business called SIS-HF®(Super Ice System® for HIGH FRESHNESS), which applies an ice thermal storage of an air conditioning system using supercooled water to the distribution of marine products while keeping their freshness. The product is highly valued in the fishery market because of the sales method that takes a series of processes for an on-site demonstration.
In addition, in an effort to promote open innovation, we have launched a program called Takasago Thermal Engineering Accelerator“just move on!,”which combine the ideas and technologies of startup companies with the strengths of the Takasago Thermal Engineering Group to create new businesses and services. The technologies of startup companies in such fields as AI technologies, AR/VR, IoT, robots and building information modeling (BIM) are integrated to expand our business fields.
We will continue to proactively engage in exchanges through various opportunities, such as industry-academia- government collaboration, to expand our view as a

    New roles of the Business Management Headquarters
In fiscal 2019, we reorganized the Business in Japan Headquarters into the Business Management Headquarters to further expand the areas it controls while domestic business and international business used to be controlled by different units. This reorganization aimed to place importance on taking actions on a global scale through the eyes of customers and promote our business including international business with united efforts in Japan and overseas. We also set up Facility & Property Management Promotion Office, Market Cultivation Management Office and Customer Center under the Sales & Marketing Management Division with an aim to enhance the capabilities of the headquarters to support sales activities in the main office and branches. With the three promotional organizations, the headquarters will strengthen its abilities to increase sales from customers and expand the business. It will also cooperate with the Work Style Reform Office for more viable business operation while shortening the distance between it and the construction sites.
Efforts to realize the medium-term management plan
We will be committed to innovations for the future in preparation for new growth opportunities and promising markets with an eye to the busy period with high demand related to the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games as well as the period after the event.
● Strengthening of the system for prosperous coexistence with partners optimized in each region that takes advantage of the strengths of our group
● Maintenance of skilled craftworkers and transfer of their techniques by using the Takasago Technical School and other educational organizations
● Advance into FM/PM domains and new business areas such as non-construction fields ● Development of criteria on the roles of human resources for sales jobs
and tools to develop them and systemization of career plans for them
● Dispatch of young domestic sales staff to overseas bases for the promotion of globalization
● Initiatives to create new services such as those for the reduction of burdens on the global environment and the utilization of unused energy
● Promotion of the understanding of SDGs to help solve international challenges
After the second year of the medium-term business plan
Construction demand remained strong due to the reasons including the full-scale progress of large redevelopment projects mainly in metropolitan areas and active investments for increases in production capacity, etc. in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries. On the other hand, the costs of materials, equipment and labor rose and the shortage of construction workers became apparent. Accordingly, we were required to take a conservative approach to business operation and improve our productivity.
Under such a business environment, we were committed to the promotion of the establishment of a construction system in a planned manner, the outsourcing of part of our jobs on construction sites to reduce the burdens on our staff, the improvement of our safety and quality management abilities through organizational improvement efforts and the enhancement of on-site construction capabilities.
We were also able to secure stable earnings by ensuring order receiving activities with an emphasis on profitability and strengthening cost management. Those efforts resulted in the strategic achievement of the targets set in the medium-term business plan to some extent.

The essence of "the creation of the best product quality," which is mentioned in our management principles, is to provide systems with high added value for customers and thereby enhance customer satisfaction. Our group has a chance to demonstrate our abilities when we respond to customer demand as much as possible and identify and meet the needs that have not been recognized even by customers.
Our commitment to the creation of product quality is about to enter a new stage. The period when the construction industry is exempt from the Act on the Arrangement of Related Acts to Promote Work Style Reform will end in 2024. While restrictions on working hours will be tightened, we cannot compromise our efforts to pursue quality. Accordingly, we have to take measures that have not been implemented before. While we are currently promoting activities for the improvement of productivity and the effective use of information-communication and IoT technologies, I consider that those efforts will be key factors that support the creation of product quality in the future.

  Provision of the Quality with which We Can Gain Customers’Satisfaction and Their Trust
To ensure that our construction sites can constantly achieve the aggressive target of "the creation of the best product quality," we are committed to initiatives on various aspects including process, support system, platform and human resources.
The basic approach of Takasago Thermal Engineering to quality is based on our Management Policy, which aims at "Contribution to society through personal harmony and creativity," and our Management Principles, which set "To serve society through the development of business activities that focus on the creation of the best product quality" as the first principle.
Moreover, the first basic policy in our Quality and Environmental Basic Rules stipulates that we shall endeavor to grasp customer needs and provide the optimal quality that contributes to the corporate activities of customers, which indicates an idea that the best product quality is achieved by providing an optimal system for customers. As the title of the rules shows, we handle the creation of quality and environmental conservation in an integrated manner. We also regard safety as part of quality.
Meanwhile, our Quality Basic Bylaws clarify how to guarantee quality. As part of it, they also set two types of standards, which are the standard that must be surely followed and "Takasago standards," which we recommend to customers.
Based on our quality management system (which has received ISO 9001:2015 certification), we work for construction work and construction management that meet requests on delivery period while ensuring quality, as well as the support of the operation, to satisfy customers.
Our Quality Basic Bylaws stipulate that our quality assurance activities mainly aim to ensure the management of the quality assurance work standards at each important point through the concerted efforts of the organization and that the activities place a particular emphasis on the management at the important points in the upstream stages.
In a project, we hold a kick-off meeting involving interested persons first prior to the construction work. We check and examine the key issues for the construction work to share them and pursue the improvement of work efficiency and quality assurance.
In-process inspections are conducted in the course of the construction work. Inspection items are wide ranging including pressure and airtightness tests of pipes, factory inspections of equipment and devices (check of the appearance and performance) and on-site installation tests. As an inspection is conducted for each process, it is common to conduct some sort of inspection once a week or so and it may be conducted for two consecutive days in some cases. After the completion of the construction work, it takes at least a month for commissioning and adjustment. Three months or more may be needed when the demand level is high as in the case of a semiconductor plant.
The procedures to achieve the quality defined in each project are incorporated into the on-site workflows by
making use of the internal system. Based on our creed that quality can be achieved only with the accumulation of on-site efforts, we control quality at important points in a meticulous manner while also considering the speed. We have established the Safety/Quality Management Group as a cross-sectoral organization that supports those activities. Internal human resources who have knowledge and skills and are also familiar with quality control are deployed as members of the group in each of the branches. They are effectively working as advisers and consultants for on-site staff and as specialized staff members who also patrol the sites.
An IT platform developed by Takasago Thermal Engineering is also used to create the best product quality. We receive facility operation data from customers to make proposals based on the results of the analysis of the data and visualize problems. These activities help us share recognition with customers. If any problem is found, we can feed it back to our quality assurance activities promptly.
Our Quality Basic Bylaws stipulate that we shall give education and training on proprietary technologies and management technologies to employees to maintain and raise the level of quality assurance.
We established the Takasago Academy in fiscal 2014 to develop a technical staff training and education system and improve the skills of our employees as well as the
employees of our group companies. In particular, we focus on position-based training and education of technical staff to improve their capabilities and also encourage them to obtain qualifications that can lead to their skill improvement. We also renewed the new employee training program in fiscal 2017 to launch practical training at the Fuji Education and Training Center, which is operated by the National Association of Construction Industry Education and Training in Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture. In the program, trainees directly experience piping and other work conducted on actual construction sites to deepen their knowledge on safety and quality that construction managers should have. We also organize company-wide technical presentation fairs and technical seminars every year and publish periodical technical newsletters.
In the meantime, we support the growth of partner companies and give instructions to them in the Takasago Technical School. We have prepared training and education materials to reduce burdens on on-site staff and improve the quality of construction work. A program to certify skilled workers of partner companies who are superior in technical skills and leadership as top-notch technicians ("Takasago Meisters") was set up in fiscal 2007. In addition, we established a new program to certify the Takasago Meisters who have especially high skills and awareness to contribute to the transfer of techniques and call them "Takasago Senior Meister: Koki (Brilliance)" in fiscal 2017. Through these initiatives, we will help improve technical abilities in the whole industry.

    FM Solution Activities
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to make effective use of facilities for the purpose of responding to changes in work styles due to work style reform and other reasons as well as globalization and environmental issues (energy saving and reduction of CO2 emissions). Facility management using IoT and ICT is also becoming widespread. Takasago Thermal Engineering provides "FM solutions," which support the facility management of customers (execution of facility strategies related to management strategies), to help customers solve their management issues and also enhance the added value of facilities.
FM solutions aim at offering value throughout the lifecycle of buildings and facilities and involve the establishment and maintenance of a close relationship with customers, as well as the identification of unspoken demand in some cases, to make new proposals. Such a pattern of actions is totally different from the conventional facility construction business. Accordingly,
the human resources who engage in FM solutions are required to have a new awareness in addition to expertise in the related fields such as building equipment, facility management and data analysis.
We introduced the FM domain into our education program this fiscal year to develop human resources who offer FM solutions.
● Example of solutions
Challenges for a customer: Wants to visualize energy use of not just the air conditioning system but the factory as a whole including production facilities. Wants to establish a low-cost system that can also adapt to flexible production conditions to optimize energy use.
Solution: Use IoT sensors* that are wireless to eliminate wiring and can be easily installed and relocated. Grasp energy use per production volume and combine it with the energy consumed for building facilities to establish an energy management system that has a direct impact on business management.

Environmental Conservation
We work on our contributions to the realization of a decarbonized society,
a society harmonized with nature, and the establishment of a recycling-oriented society by proactively using environmental conservation technologies.
We support the efforts made by our customers for environment conservation,
as well as continuing to reduce the environmental load generated by our own business activities.
      Realization of a decarbonized society
Takasago Thermal Engineering is committed to the realization of a decarbonized society in its business activities based on the Basic Policy for the Environment through the active use of energy saving and CO2 saving technologies and the optimization of facility operation in cooperation with customers. Meanwhile, we ensure compliance with all relevant environmental laws and work to prevent environmental pollution while also actively promoting efforts to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions in the company through our production activities on construction and other sites as well as activities in offices. As a result, we reduced CO2 emissions from HVAC systems delivered to customers by 105,200 tons-CO2 while also achieving CO2 emission reductions of 45,200 tons-CO2 through resource-saving efforts at the construction stage in fiscal 2018.
* For our Basic Policy for the Environment and environmental management system, see the CSR pages of our website.
● Reduction of waste
We regard waste as precious domestic resources and aggressively strive for 3R in production sites and offices to recover useful resources from waste and use them effectively. In addition, we thoroughly control waste until final disposal.
*3R means Reduction, Reuse and Recycling.
● Production sites
We worked to reduce construction facility waste from contract work through such initiatives as the use of prefabricated facilities, elimination of packaging, promotion of recycling and thorough separation of waste. Our recycling rate in fiscal 2018 was 88%, which met the target. We will endeavor to further promote the sorted collection of waste to increase the recycling rate.
● Thorough control of CFCs and industrial waste
We started to collect CFCs in fiscal 1995, ahead of other members of the industry. In fiscal 2018, we collected 100% of the CFCs to be collected in 316 sites, which weighed approximately 30 tons in total. The amount of CFCs we have collected since the start of the activities is equivalent to 738 tons. We also controlled all of the construction facility waste manifests in 923 contract work sites. In the meantime, we have turned 92% of the manifests into an electronic format.
Consideration for ecosystem
We recommend the purchase of products with low environmental burdens (green procurement) to customers and buy environmentally friendly office supplies out of consideration for biodiversity and the ecosystem. In addition, we are involved in tree planting and other forest conservation activities through local environmental initiatives. Moreover, we have developed a flushing technique involving no water discharge to reduce the environmental burden of effluent discharged from construction sites and are working to put the technique into practical use and disseminate it.
● Proposal of products with low environmental burdens (green procurement) to customers
To support green purchasing by customers, we provide them with related data including information on environmental burdens of the items designated as the targets of green procurement in a notification of the Ministry of the Environment and a table to compare environmental burdens. We have established guidelines for green procurement and developed a database in the internal network. The database shows environmental data on freezers and other HVAC devices by manufacturer and by model in a comprehensible manner to support customers in green purchasing. We made 298 proposals in fiscal 2018.
●100% green purchasing for 13 items of the designated office supplies
Again in fiscal 2018, we achieved 100% green purchasing in the procurement of 13 designated products including copying paper. We will continuously work to enhance our green purchasing efforts to reduce environmental burdens.
● Practical use of the flushing technique involving no water discharge
We conduct various research and development activities to reduce the impact of effluent and exhaust gas on the biological environment during construction work and in the operation of facilities after completion. With respect to effluent treatment, we developed a technique to purify the effluent containing zinc eluted from coated zinc as a result of flushing in pipes at the completion of piping and return the effluent to the pipes instead of discharging it. The technique was introduced to 47 construction sites in fiscal 2018.
Targets and achievements of environmental conservation activities
In fiscal 2018, we implemented environmental conservation activities to meet the quantitative target set for each of the activity items in construction sites
and offices. As a result, we met the target for all items. We will further promote environmental conservation activities to further improve them in fiscal 2019.

Employee Satisfaction
In accordance with the management policy
“Contribution to society through personal harmony and creativity,”
we make efforts for systematic and organized human resource development and strive to create an environment in which employees can work actively.
Basic concept for human resource development
Operation of a fair personnel evaluation system
Our personnel evaluation system aims to properly evaluate targets and their achievement level and thereby motivate employees and facilitate human resource development. Specifically, we set targets appropriate for the respective occupational abilities and roles of employees and evaluate their achievements through interviews with their superiors to operate the evaluation system in a convincing way. We also give evaluator training to all management staff to improve the skills of the evaluators for the setting of proper targets, application of consistent evaluation standards, etc.
Based on the social background such as a declining labor force population in Japan due to the low birthrate and a rise in the age at which people may receive pension benefits, as well as the diversification of personal lifestyles, we introduced a flexible age-limit system where employees can select the age of retirement with 65 set as the upper limit to extend the retirement age in fiscal 2019 to enable employees to work actively while finding the job rewarding even after the age of 61. We help employees develop more fulfilling career plans through initiatives including the organization of career design training at the time when employees select their retirement age.
For the realization of work-life balance
Enhancement of leave systems
For the establishment of a working environment where people can work with a sense of security, it is essential to fully consider the health and safety of employees and promote their work-life balance. To this end, we have
improved relevant systems through concerted efforts of labor and management.
● Leave systems
In fiscal 2019, we started to grant five days of annual paid holidays each year in a planned manner and also introduced a system of paid holidays that can be taken by the hour to allow employees to take annual paid holidays more flexibly. We have other leave systems such as a vacation given as a reward for many years of service (20, 30 and 40 years), refreshment leave and anniversary leave. For the cases where employees need to take a leave of absence due to non-work related injury or illness, we have established a system with which we grant the annual paid holidays for the last ten years that have not been taken to the employees as a special leave so that they can concentrate on their treatment. We also have a volunteer leave system and encourage employees to take refreshment leave for a consecutive week in order to create an environment where employees can take holidays with a sense of security.
Enhancement of the childcare and nursing care system
To ensure that employees can balance work and family life, we have introduced a leave system and a reduced working hour system for employees engaged in childcare or nursing care of family members. In fiscal 2019, we also established a system to appoint the employees who cannot be easily relocated because of childcare or nursing care as employees to work in a specific area with no transfers. Furthermore, we enable our employees to use day-care centers in the premises of other companies. We have also concluded an agreement with an NPO "Umi wo Koeru Care no Te" to organize nursing care workshops and provide opportunities to consult for free across Japan. In addition, we encourage male employees to take childcare leave for raising children with family cooperation. Moreover, we promote the achievement of work-life balance through the establishment of systems to facilitate response to changes in the family circumstances such as leave for the care of sick children and nursing care leave.
    To contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society through environmental engineering as a pioneer in the building facility business, Takasago Thermal Engineering is committed to the development of human resources with abilities to "create the best product quality and develop technology using creativity," as mentioned in our management principles. In line with our philosophy that "people are our most important assets" in our Basic Policy for Human Resource Development, we conduct employee education in a systematic and organized manner and strive to create an organizational culture that cultivates a mindset to enjoy taking on new challenges, as well as inventive ingenuity.
Educational programs tailored to individual career stages
In order to develop human resources who will create our future, we have established the Takasago Academy, at which we offer practical and multifaceted educational programs in a planned manner by combining various types of training (Off-JT: off the job training) and various on-site experiences (OJT: on the job training).
Deepening technical training
● Training system chart
At the Takasago Academy, individual human resources seek to acquire necessary capabilities and business skills and foster ethics so that they can work actively at all stages from the time of joining the company through retirement. We reformed new employee education in the training programs by job type in fiscal 2018. In the revised programs, new employees participate in a common curriculum for two years after joining the company regardless of whether they are technology-related or administrative employees. After the period, they are assigned to the respective departments to help them pursue diverse career paths. In the position-based training programs, while focusing on management skills, we offer opportunities to acquire an MBA degree and implement the Young Board Project to train next-generation leaders, Transformative Manager Seminars for management candidates, Transformative Leader Seminars for young employees and other programs to continuously develop human resources who will play the main role in our future management. By continuing to expand the training programs for employees, we will try to be a company that learns and keeps growing.

 Takasago Thermal Engineering encourages male employees to take childcare leave and I had also wished to take childcare leave if the opportunity was given. When I found out that my wife was pregnant and then applied for the leave, my superiors and colleagues in the section kindly accepted it. While I worried most about my duties during the leave, there was no problem thanks to support from my superiors and colleagues. Full participation in childcare allowed me to feel the daily growth of my child and realize anew how tough childcare is. The experience was very significant for me and also broadened my view to have a favorable impact on my job after I returned to work. I strongly suggest to male employees who will become fathers that they should take childcare leave.

Harmony with Society
Our basic concept for social contribution is to fulfill our social responsibility as a good corporate citizen by engaging voluntarily in social contribution activities.
We inform all executives and employees of the basic policy and actively become involved in the support of local environmental activities as well as art and cultural activities and other initiatives to pursue harmony with the local communities.
    Stricter measures to handle harassment issues
To prevent sexual and other forms of harassment including discrimination against pregnant employees and abuse of authority, we send messages of top management and clarify our stance to never allow any forms of harassment. We have set up consultation counters on and off the company premises to address the matter and also conduct regular questionnaire surveys to check whether there is any harassment in the workplace. Moreover, we continuously provide training to enhance awareness of the prevention of harassment and endeavor to develop a comfortable work environment where all employees can fully demonstrate their abilities.
Efforts to become a company with physically
and mentally healthy and vigorous employees
To become a company where all executives and employees are physically and mentally healthy and work energetically ("Well-being company"), we take various initiatives including the issuance of a "health declaration" by the CEO. In April 2019, we set up the Health Care Office to further help executives and employees maintain and improve their health. In the office, an industrial physician and public health nurse are stationed to give advice on physical and mental health to executives and employees when necessary. The office is also involved in the support of balancing treatment and work, follow-up actions after health checkups and education and enlightenment activities to improve health literacy.
Efforts to ensure occupational safety
Basic concept for occupational health and safety
In 2000, we established our safety and health philosophy, "Safety is the top priority in carrying out all business tasks." Under this philosophy, we strive for health and safety activities in construction sites based on the basic approach "The employees working for Takasago Thermal Engineering and their families must never suffer from accidents at construction sites."
Analysis and identification of risks
and measures to address them
We have introduced risk assessment for safety and health management. In fiscal 2019, with the slogan "the elimination of fall accidents," we are taking measures including the effective use of health and safety work procedure manuals, confirmation of health and safety management activities by business operators and enhancement of safety awareness.
The Safety/Quality Management Group, which was established for the strengthening of safety and health activities, engages in on-site patrols to evaluate activities for the achievement of priority targets while also planning and managing measures taken commonly across the company to ensure safety and checking the situation of construction site management to provide instructions based
on the review of it.
In addition, we raise awareness of safety and health activities through the Company-wide Safety and Health Conference held annually.
Company-wide Safety and Health Conference
Safety records by year
In fiscal 2018, despite the activities of the Safety/Quality Management Group (on-site patrols and checks), 51 accidents (7 lost-time injuries and 44 non-lost-time injuries) occurred. We will improve our activities with a focus on the elimination of fall accidents, which can directly lead to a serious accident, the elimination of accidents at the time of transporting heavy objects, which increased in the previous fiscal year, and the elimination of accidents caused by unskilled workers, which have been increasing recently.
Activities for the local environment
Takasago Thermal Engineering is continuously involved in local cleanup activities in various parts of Japan through cooperation with group companies and partner companies. They give us precious opportunities to communicate with local people. In fiscal 2018, a total of 895 persons participated in those cleanup activities.
Eco-cap campaign
Our business offices collect caps of PET bottles ("eco-caps") and send them to Ecocap Movement, which is an NPO approved by the Cabinet Office, to support various social contribution activities including medical support, donation of vaccines, support of persons with disabilities and environmental education of children.
The recycling of "eco-caps" also helps conserve the environment because it prevents CO2 emissions that would have been caused if the caps had been incinerated.

Education, follow-up and collaboration
with Kowakai to eliminate accidents
The Safety/Quality Management Group checks the management items specified in the safety priority targets and gives instructions based on the results. Those efforts have produced certain results including the improvement of safety management of young employees, who have been increasing in recent years. In fiscal 2019, we will have each of the branches conduct patrols to enhance its safety management and we will provide adequate education and conduct follow-up activities to prevent accidents.
Kowakai, which is composed of our partner companies, has also implemented activities for the improvement of health and safety since 2003, including the transmission of information on technologies related to health and safety, PR activities and notification of relevant laws and regulations to ensure compliance with them.

Fair and highly transparent management
We make efforts for thorough consciousness and practice,
with a recognition that compliance is an essential element of CSR management.
In addition, we are making efforts for measures to prevent management risks from arising, and minimizing the impact of crises.
    Compliance
Based on the recognition that the establishment of compliance is the foundation of CSR management, we are continuously working to enhance the awareness of compliance and ensure it in daily activities.
We have also set up the Compliance Committee chaired by the executive in charge of the Corporate Operations Headquarters to ensure thorough compliance with
Ten Group Action Guidelines
corporate ethics. In addition, we develop and promote the compliance system through such initiatives as the transmission of information from the Compliance Office and dissemination of the consultation and reporting counters.
The Takasago Thermal Engineering Group has established the "Ten Group Action Guidelines" and we distribute a portable booklet "Group Corporate Code of Ethics" to executives and employees to use it for daily duties, in-house training and other purposes.
In April 2014, the Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was established in preparation for a large-scale earthquake. We have determined procedures for initial responses and restoration efforts to organize the business continuity system within the target time after the occurrence of a large-scale earthquake. In addition, we have developed a system to fulfill our social responsibility as a building constructor at the time of a disaster, such as
assistance for the recovery of hospitals and other facilities of a highly public nature as well as the supply chains of our customers.
In FY2018, we carried out initial training at the head office and the Nagoya branch (Nagoya city, Aichi prefecture) to prepare our initial response in case a capital earthquake should occur.
We are working on a so-called BCM* to enhance the
effectiveness of the BCP.
* BCM (Business Continuity Management): Activities that enhance the effectiveness of a BCP such as implementing training and strengthening necessary business resources whereas BCP means a plan to continue operations when there is a disaster.
  1. Act in compliance with laws and regulations and internal rules and according to ethical standards.

Risk management
We conduct risk management in order to prevent all risks from materializing and to minimize damage in case a risk actually materializes to cause a crisis.
To prevent risks from materializing, we established the Risk Management Committee chaired by the officer in charge of the Corporate Strategy Headquarters, in which the CEO serves as the chief officer, in accordance with the Risk Management Regulations. The committee is responsible for the determination of the risk management policy, the identification of risks and the

We have developed a system to minimize damage and loss in case a risk materializes to cause a crisis in accordance with the Crisis Management Regulations. In risk management, we give first priority to the risks that especially have a large impact on business management and can occur with a high probability as focused key risks. We are enhancing the PDCA cycle in which progress and problems are reviewed every quarter and fed back for risk reduction activities.
Improvement of information security
To prevent the leakage of personal information, customer and supplier information and all other information handled in the course of business operations, we have developed our Information Security Policy to clarify our policy on information security in the whole group, as well as Confidentiality Regulations on the maintenance of confidentiality, Social Media Guidelines for Individuals on the use of social media and the Emergency Response Manual to specify the basic actions to be taken in case of
an information related accident. We work to familiarize relevant persons with them.
Moreover, we take technical measures for the improvement including the encryption of all PCs installed in the offices of construction sites, which have closer contact with customer information, and promote the strengthening of the information management system through the establishment of the Information Security Management Office. Other initiatives include the implementation of information security education to enhance the awareness of information management and the issuance of an information security pamphlet.

At the meetings, the Board of Directors passes resolutions on the matters specified by laws and the articles of incorporation as well as important matters based on the Board of Directors Regulations to supervise the execution of duties by the directors.
Through these activities, the board aims to improve management efficiency and ensure the legitimacy and adequacy of business execution.
The Audit & Supervisory Board currently consists of five members (including three outside corporate auditors). Its meeting is held once a month in principle and an extraordinary meeting is also held when necessary. The Audit & Supervisory Board supervises the execution of duties by the directors through the reporting of audit results to the Board of Directors and other activities.
We have also established the Management Committee to enhance deliberation on important matters concerning management and make more prompt decisions on the allocation of management resources, as well as the Internal Control Committee to promote the improvement and operation of the internal control system of Takasago Thermal Engineering and its group in a cross-sectoral manner.
In addition, we have set up the Nomination Compensation Committee as an arbitrary advisory body for the Board of Directors. The committee deliberates on the new appointment, reappointment and dismissal of directors, corporate auditors and executive officers of Takasago Thermal Engineering and its subsidiaries to make recommendations to the board (however, the new appointment or reappointment of corporate auditors requires the approval of the Audit & Supervisory Board) as well as the remuneration of the directors and executive officers of our company and its subsidiaries while also checking the policy for the plan on CEO successors developed by the CEO and its progress. A majority of the committee must be outside directors.
Furthermore, we have formed the Advisory Council as an arbitrary advisory body for the Board of Directors, which helps activate the board through such activities as the examination of the structural balance of the Board of Directors as a whole, the analysis and assessment of its effectiveness and the check of the policy for training to directors and corporate auditors and the provision of information.
In addition to the activities mentioned above, corporate auditors coordinate with accounting auditors and the
Internal Audit Office to enhance corporate governance by conducting effective audits through active communication between them.
(1) Corporate auditors
The corporate auditors monitor the implementation status of governance, attend the Board of Directors’ meetings and other important meetings, review important approval documents and visit business sites for on-site audits in accordance with the audit policy and audit plan set by the Audit & Supervisory Board. They also strive to increase the effectiveness of the audits to monitor the execution of duties by the directors through coordination with accounting auditors and the Internal Audit Office and other efforts. For subsidiaries, the corporate auditors exchange information with the directors and corporate auditors of subsidiaries at group-wide meetings of the Management Committee and the Group Audit & Supervisory Board and other occasions. Outside corporate auditors obtain and provide information from an independent standpoint and strive for monitoring from an external perspective. On the other hand, full-time corporate auditors conduct monitoring based on their familiarity with our operations. The corporate auditors are thus enhancing the effectiveness of audits from their respective positions.
(2) Internal audits
Having established as a section under the direct control of the CEO, the Internal Audit Office (with six staff members) conducts systematic audits on the appropriateness and efficiency of business operations from an independent standpoint based on the Internal Audit Regulations. With respect to subsidiaries, it engages in the exchange of information and other activities on an as-needed basis. The Internal Audit Office reports the results of audits to the Representative Director, CEO and also checks the measures to be taken based on the results and the implementation of improvement. It also evaluates the operational status of internal control concerning the financial reporting of our company and important consolidated subsidiaries. While working closely with corporate auditors and accounting auditors, the office works to conduct effective internal audits.
(3) Accounting auditors
The certified public accountants engaged in the execution of our accounting audit work are Mr. Atsuki Kanezuka and Mr. Junichi Kimura, who belong to KPMG AZSA LLC. Mr. Kanezuka and Mr. Kimura have served as our accounting auditors for two and three years, respectively. They also have six certified public accountants as their assistants along with six other assistants.
Policy on the appointment of executives
In the nomination standards, candidates for directors are required to have qualities including: insight on business management and excellence in foresight, vision and objective judgment; abilities to demonstrate leadership for the sustainable growth of the group and improvement of the corporate value; potential to make an active contribution to the development of the next generation of management personnel; integrity, popularity, high ethical standards and courage; physical and mental health to have no problem to execute their duties; and the absence of specific problems such as special business interests. Those conditions are examined comprehensively to evaluate the candidates.
Candidates for corporate auditors are required to have qualities including: the quality to fulfill the duties
of corporate auditors; high ethical standards; physical and mental health; and the absence of specific problems such as special business interests, which are examined in a comprehensive manner for the nomination of the candidates.
When executive officers are appointed, we comprehensively evaluate candidates based on their competency. For example, they are required to have the following qualities: high levels of expertise and achievements and abilities to be in charge of important management duties for the business strategy; abilities to demonstrate leadership for the sustainable growth of the group and improvement of the corporate value; potential to make an active contribution to the development of the next generation of management personnel; integrity, popularity, high ethical standards and courage; physical and mental health to have no problem to execute their duties; and the absence of specific problems such as special business interests.

      Remuneration of executives
As to the remuneration of directors and corporate auditors, we set the upper limit for the total amount of the remuneration, etc. of all the directors and corporate auditors by resolution at a shareholders' meeting.
For the medium- to long-term growth of our business and continuous and sustainable increases in our corporate value and common interests of shareholders, we have resolved on adopting a policy to ensure that the remuneration system for our directors gives a healthy incentive to them in consideration of various issues including trends on corporate governance, survey data provided by external specialized agencies and the remuneration level in other companies. The specific levels are decided by resolution of the Board of Directors after deliberations in the Nomination Compensation Committee. The remuneration of directors consists of basic remuneration, a bonus as a short-term (annual) incentive and a trust-type stock-based compensation system as a medium- to long-term incentive. The composition is set in consideration of the relevant policy.
Outside directors receive only basic remuneration while no bonus or trust-type stock-based compensation system is provided.
The basic remuneration is determined as a fixed amount according to the position of each of the directors.
As to the bonus, on April 1, 2019, we introduced a mechanism to change the amount from 50% to 150% of the basic
● Image of the composition
of the remuneration of directors
amount for each position based on the performance in the previous fiscal year and qualitative assessment of the individual executives in order to improve morale for the achievement of single-year performance targets and other purposes.
The trust-type stock-based compensation system aims to further enhance motivation to contribute to the improvement of medium- to long-term performance and corporate value. Points are granted according to the position of the director every year and the shares of our company that are equivalent to the total points are issued at the time of resignation. The remuneration of executive officers also consists of basic remuneration, a bonus as a short-term (annual) incentive and a trust-type stock-based compensation system as a medium-to long-term incentive as in the case of directors. The levels are decided by resolution of the Board of Directors after deliberations in the Nomination Compensation Committee. The directors (excluding outside directors) and executive officers make efforts to acquire our shares by voluntary contribution through the Official Shareholding Association. Remuneration, etc. of corporate auditors is basic remuneration only and the amount of the basic remuneration of each corporate auditor is decided through consultation with corporate auditors based on the comprehensive examination of the content, volume and difficulty of his/her duties, the degree of responsibility, etc. In view of their duties, etc., corporate auditors receive no bonus or trust-type stock-based compensation system or other stock-based remuneration.

Constructive dialogue
Takasago Thermal Engineering makes full use of opportunities to give explanations and have constructive dialogue in the stock market in an effort to promote the understanding of our business management. We will continue to share the information obtained through the dialogue in the company and also consider the incorporation of the information into our business management when necessary.
Our policy on constructive dialogue with shareholders is as mentioned below.
(1) For the dialogue with shareholders, we appoint the Representative Director, CEO as the person who controls the dialogue, the General Manager of Corporate Operations Headquarters as the person responsible for handling the information, the Head of the Public Relations Division as the person in charge of timely disclosure and the Head of the Accounting Finance Division as the person in charge of annual securities reports, etc. (the structure is shown in the schematic diagram of the outline of the timely disclosure system later in this page).
(2) The sections mentioned above, which belong to the Corporate Planning Division or the Corporate Operations Headquarters, share information and issues on a daily basis through regular meetings and other opportunities for the promotion of coordination while making efforts to take appropriate actions.
(3) In addition to biannual financial results briefing sessions, we plan and organize opportunities for dialogue such as briefing sessions for investors on an as-needed basis. We also participate in external events for investors.
(4) Directors and senior executives will obtain information directly through attendance at briefing sessions for investors, development of analyst reports and other channels and receive reports from responsible sections regularly and when necessary.
(5) In order to prevent insider trading, we strictly adhere to the Insider Trading Management Rules, which stipulate regulations concerning matters such as compliance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and other related laws as well as the management of internal information. When we have dialogue, we try to manage the information in a way to avoid being suspected of giving any insider information while disclosing information not selectively but fairly. We set the period from the following day of the end of the settlement term (quarterly and full-year) to the date of the announcement of financial statements as a "period of silence." In the meantime, we obtain knowledge on the prevention of insider trading and give education to update the knowledge.
Outline of the timely disclosure system
Our internal system for the timely disclosure of corporate information is described below.
(1) The representative and the person responsible for handling the information endeavor to ensure the timeliness, legitimacy, accuracy and fairness of the information to be disclosed. The information is discussed and reported at the Management Committee and Board of Directors meetings as necessary.
(2) The person in charge of timely information disclosure complies with the Timely Disclosure Rules and relevant laws on a daily basis and also collects information from related sections in a prompt and comprehensive manner for the execution of his/her duties. He/she also makes efforts to prepare proper disclosure materials and enhance the disclosure such as investigation of cases of information disclosure in other companies.
(3) Corporate auditors and accounting auditors provide advice and instructions on information disclosure to us in addition to periodical audits. We also seek opinions from third-party experts, etc. when necessary.
(4) We have established the Insider Trading Management Rules and the Disclosure Policy (Information Disclosure Rules) as internal rules, as well as the Group Corporate Code of Ethics, which mentions that they must be strictly followed. Through these and other initiatives, we strive for the prevention of insider trading in our group including affiliates as well as compliance with the fair disclosure rules.

Reduction of waste
We regard waste as precious domestic resources and aggressively strive for 3R in production sites and offices to use it effectively. All of the waste manifests in contract work sites are controlled for the thorough management of waste up to the final disposal.
* 3R means Reduction, Reuse and Recycling.
Achievement of a recycling rate of 86% on sites
We worked to reduce construction facility waste from contract work through such initiatives as the use of prefabricated facilities, elimination of packaging, promotion of recycling and thorough separation of waste. As a result, the overall recycling rate in our 994 contract work sites in fiscal 2019 was 86%. We will continuously endeavor to increase the recycling rate.
Recovery of 100% of CFCs
We started to recover CFCs in fiscal 1995, ahead of other members of the industry. In fiscal 2019, we recovered 100% of the CFCs to be collected in 375 sites, which weighed approximately 33 tons in total. The amount of CFCs we have recovered since the start of the activities is equivalent to 771 tons. We will continue to control the recovery process completely and strive to recover CFCs to protect the ozone layer.

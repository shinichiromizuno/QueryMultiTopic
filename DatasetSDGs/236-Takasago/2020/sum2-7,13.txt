While volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene and ethyl acetate are used in great quantities in printing factories, adhesive tape production plants, etc., it is known that VOCs emitted into the air are responsible for the generation of suspended particulate matters (SPMs) and photochemical oxidants, which cause photochemical smog and thereby create health damage to the respiratory system and mucous membranes.
The most common method to treat VOC exhaust gas from plants is incineration, which generates a large amount of CO2. Therefore, the treatment of VOCs without incineration is needed for the prevention of global warming.
We have developed a system that recovers and treats VOCs without incineration and also reduces the amount of VOCs emitted into the air significantly. This system has been realized by adopting a closed recovery system that purifies exhaust gas including VOCs emitted from drying furnaces in plants with an adsorption rotor and then reuses the gas as the air supplied to the furnaces.
This fiscal year, we started the operation of a demonstrated system in an adhesive tape plant as the first attempt in an operating plant with the cooperation of Teraoka Seisakusho Co., Ltd. We will collect data from the actual operation including VOC treatment ability and the conditions of the recovered solvent and also verify the yield of adhesive tape products and other data.
We will promote the introduction of this system, which achieves the reduction of CO2 emissions through non- incineration treatment and the reduction of VOC emissions to the air at the same time, to contribute to the conservation of the global environment.

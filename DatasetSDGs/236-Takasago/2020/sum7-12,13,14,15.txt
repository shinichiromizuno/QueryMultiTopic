Practical use of technology
for flushing without any water drainage
To reduce the environmental impact of effluent from production sites, we have developed technology for flushing without any water drainage and are committed to the practical and widespread use of it. For effluent treatment, we have developed a technique to purify effluent containing zinc eluted from coated zinc as a result of flushing in pipes at the completion of piping and to return the purified effluent to the pipes instead of discharging it. We worked to disseminate the technique and had 49 cases of the introduction into sites in fiscal 2019.

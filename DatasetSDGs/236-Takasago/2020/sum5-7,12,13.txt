Our basic philosophy on environmental conservation is to "contribute to the conservation of the global environment while working for the sustainable development of society by fully using environmental conservation technologies and our corporate power." Based on this philosophy, we have established the Basic Environmental Policy to specify rules on the promotion system. We will actively develop energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction technologies in our business activities and achieve optimal operation of facilities through cooperation with customers to help create a low-carbon society. Meanwhile, we have estimated CO2 emissions in fiscal 2019 for the disclosure of environmental data (CO2 emissions), etc. The value is used as a benchmark for long-term targets to be achieved in fiscal 2025 and 2030.

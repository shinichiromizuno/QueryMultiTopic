ManufacturingSupporting Innovation Through Sustainable Manufacturing Practices
Without sustainable manufacturing practices, OMRON could not produce innovations responding to rapid technology breakthroughs and emerging social needs. Sustainable manufacturing requires practices that consider product safety, labor conditions, and the
environment. At the same time, we must deliver products that customers can use with confidence. In keeping with this commitment, OMRON is working toward our fiscal 2020 sustainability goals.

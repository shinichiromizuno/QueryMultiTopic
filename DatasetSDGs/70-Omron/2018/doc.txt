 SINIC* Theory:
A Compass for Corporate Management
Our founder, KazumaTateishi, believed that solving social issues through business to create a better society required the ability to anticipate future social needs. He believed that a company needed a compass to help predict the future.
As our compass, Mr.Tateishi formulated the SINIC predictive theory, which projects the future based on the cycle of interrelationships between Science,Technology, and Society. OMRON first announced this predictive theory to the world at the International Future Research World Congress in 1970. Since then, the SINIC Theory has been our compass for projecting into the future.

From an Information Society to an Optimization Society, and, Finally, an Autonomous Society
The SINIC Theory predicts the future by looking at the past through the lens of three central elements: Society, technology, and science. The theory states that the transition from the Primitive Society of 1 million years ago to the Autonomous Society of the future is one cycle. According to SINIC, the year 2033 is predicted to be the year in which we reach the Natural Society, signalling the beginning of the second cycle. In the Natural Society, human creativity and technology harmonize with natural mechanisms.
At present, we live in an Optimization Society in which the focus shifts from products and goods to more mindful endeavors. The Industrialization Society to this point generated products and wealth in abundance, the pursuit of which led to dramatic economic growth. However, the advent of this society brought with it significant new issues, including crowding, class divisions, destruction of the community, and more. The Autonomous Society will bring solutions to these social issues based on new sets of values. This society will share values, pursue meaningful experiences and psychological abundance, and allow individuals to live any way they see fit. This society will be a mature society in which people find joy in life and living. Seeking approval through social media, the spread of the sharing economy, and the rise of the circular economy are just a few signs that perfectly align with SINIC Theory predictions.
Predicting the Future Through the Interrelationships of Science,Technology, and Society
The basic philosophy behind the SINIC Theory is that the interrelationships among science, technology, and society lead to social change. Let us use the Cybernation Society as an example. We can see how the rise of cybernetics, computer science, and other synthetic sciences in the 1940s became the seeds of electronic control technologies, programming, and other technology. These technologies gave rise to the PC and the internet, leading to the advent of the Cybernation Society. At the same time, the Cybernation Society demanded more data, along with more accurate and rapid data analysis. These demands forced us to produce CPUs and GPUs with faster processing power, make advancements in deep learning and other artificial intelligence technologies, and reach higher levels of sophistication in neuroscience and cognitive science.
The evolution of these interrelationships serves as a driving force behind humanity’s desire to progress.

 Message from the CEO
“OMRON is solving social issues through our business, accelerating Innovation Driven by Social Needs.”
Since our very founding, the OMRON mission has been to improve lives and contribute to a better society, believing that a business should create value for society through its key practices. We have become the company we are today by seeing the signs of global change, leading the world in taking on the issues of the times. We have become the company we are today by creating innovative value for society, through an idea we call Social Needs.
Our aspirations to create innovation driven by social needs through our day-to-day efforts are defined in our corporate philosophy, the OMRON Principles.
Today, the world changes at a speed and scale unprecedented in history. In response, we began implementing our new VG2.0 medium-term management plan in fiscal 2017, setting record highs for earnings and proving the success of strategies that are distinct from those of the past. During fiscal 2018, we intend to deliver even greater growth, guided by VG2.0 and our aspirations to create innovation driven by social needs.

 VG2.0 represents the final medium-term management plan incorporated into VG2020, our long-term vision leading through fiscal 2020. VG2.0 also includes growth strategies we intend to implement through the year 2030. Under VG2.0, we have defined four focus domains: (1) Factory Automation; (2) Healthcare; (3) Mobility; and (4) Energy Management.
We believe these four domains present the most promising businesses for market growth in future society, as well as areas in which OMRON technologies and products have the best chance to make a positive difference in the world. Executing VG2.0 will not only help us solve social issues, but also generate self-driven growth for our businesses.

In fiscal 2017, our first year operating under VG2.0, we set record highs in net sales, gross profits, and net income, driven by strong performances in our Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business segments. We also set records for gross profit margin, a yardstick by which we measure our customers’ assessment of our products and services. We have used the profits generated to invest in future growth, including two acquisitions in our Industrial Automation Business segment. This positive cycle of growth has already shown tangible results.

Fiscal 2017 was also a year in which we made great strides in innovative-Automation, our strategic concept for innovation in manufacturing. Our progress was especially apparent in our Industrial Automation Business segment, a key growth driver. We have developed innovative solutions hand in hand with customers who practice advanced manufacturing methods, in turn introducing these innovations to other customers for major successes. As a result of these activities, our Industrial Automation Business
segment recorded sales growth of 19.7% (profit growth of 42.3%) year on year. Our Healthcare Business segment, another key growth driver for our company, captured rising global demand for blood pressure monitors among people suffering from high blood pressure. Combined with growth in emerging markets, this segment generated sales 10.9% higher (profit growth of 28.2%)* year on year.
*Excluding sales of OMRON Colin Co., Ltd. (sold in December 2016)
 Looking Forward to VG2.0 in Fiscal 2018
Our financial goals for fiscal 2018 are ¥900 billion in net sales, ¥93 billion in operating income, ¥64.5 billion in net income, and 42.5% in gross profit margin. As you will read below, fiscal 2018 is an important year for us in progressing toward our goals and greater growth for fiscal 2020 and beyond.
Accelerating Growth Through Focus Domains
Fiscal 2018 will be a year of accelerating growth in our four focus domains. In particular, we will continue to drive group-wide growth through our Factory Automation and Healthcare businesses, which address significant social issues.
Our Industrial Automation Business will execute innovative-Automation to work even closer with customers on their production floors. Here, the segment will solve customer challenges and bring innovation to manufacturing via automation, enriching the lives of people all over the world. As one example, we plan to double the number of our Automation Centers to 35 worldwide this year. Industrial Automation engineers will work with customers to offer innovative solutions through unique product lines and services, developed over many years. i-BELT is another example of innovation in manufacturing. This service collects, analyzes, and utilizes production floor data in
conjunction with AI-equipped controllers. i-BELT replicates and automates the skills of experienced engineers to detect the warning signs of production line stoppages. This, in turn, contributes one solution to the desperate shortage of skilled workers who are well-versed in manufacturing processes.
We plan to grow our Healthcare Business segment through three core categories contributing to healthy and comfortable lives for the people of the world: (1) Cardiovascular Disease; (2) Respiratory Disease; and (3) Pain Management. Of these three, our main focus will be to achieve Zero Events related to cardiovascular disease and complications therefrom. Our ultimate vision is to ensure zero events of life-threatening seizures, including stroke and myocardial infarction associated with high blood pressure. We plan to unveil new products this year to support this mission,

including a combination blood pressure monitor/ electrocardiograph. When we combine the data gathered by these breakthrough devices with patient monitors and biological information from external partners, we will learn much more about the causes of high blood pressure and blood pressure fluctuations than we know today. We will use the results of these studies to work closely with personal care physicians to achieve our dream of Zero Events for patients throughout the world.
ManagingTechnology for Innovation Driven by Social Needs
The pace of technological innovation and changes in cultural values is more dramatic than ever, and we envision many serious social needs at local and global levels arising in the future. In the meantime, AI, IoT, robotics, and other technological innovations have advanced much more quickly than anyone thought possible. These technology innovations lie at the core of the OMRON evolution in Sensing & Control + THINK. At OMRON, we see the coming social and technological changes as opportunities to grow, as we fulfill our mission to solve social issues. In fiscal 2015, we created the new role of chief technology officer to capture every technology- related opportunity available. Our CTO formulates group technology strategy and identifying technology development for core cross- organization technologies, as well for the core technologies used in each business. This new role is just one more way in which OMRON leverages the strengths of our entire organization to make advancements in creating innovation driven by social needs.
This is just one way in which OMRON will engage in open innovation with partners and customers to solve serious social issues.
Creating Innovation in Focus Domains (P42,48)
To accelerate technological development further, we established the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ in April 2018. This entity reports directly to the CTO and functions as the hub for technology innovation across our organization. The Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ is responsible for end-to- end technology management, coordinating with divisions and functional departments to perform near-future design for society, draft technology strategies, and incubate potential businesses. We have also taken the step to establish OMRON SINIC X Corporation (OSX), under the umbrella of the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ. OSX is responsible for near-future design and backcasting strategies to develop those technologies necessary for a brighter future. Stronger technology management of this kind will ensure that we create innovation driven by social needs.

OMRON practices ROIC management as the best method to speed our engagement of social issues around the world. We operate nearly 90 business units through various companies, each striving to solve social issues to improve lives and contribute to a better society. To accomplish this mission, we must prioritize and allocate resources to maximize value in return. We believe ROIC to be the fairest method to assess the performance of our diverse group of businesses, each facing different challenges. As one specific example, we have invested in acquisitions and production capacity expansion in our Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business segments,
which have proven to have the greatest potential for growth.
Meanwhile, we are optimizing our Backlights Business, selling OMRON Laserfront, Inc.* (part of our Industrial Automation Business), and taking other measures deemed rational under ROIC.
In this way, OMRON makes smarter investments for our future, while at the same time engaging in ongoing structural reform to secure our platform for profitability and growth in line with the rules of ROIC management.

Sustainability Initiatives
OMRON set sustainability goals in fiscal 2017, ensuring sustainability was a part of our VG2.0 plan. This demonstrates our commitment to solving issues we consider material.
Our sustainability issues focus on two major areas: issues to solve through our business and those for sustainable business practices. Our initiatives based on these goals tie directly to our vision of a better society, the Sustainable Develop Goals of the United Nations, and other targets to ensure a sustainable international society in the future. Solving through business means to create new value through innovative products and
services, working with customers, partners, and society. Sustainable business practices mean that we meet the expectations of our stakeholders. We do this by building a stronger business platform, supported by talented employees and competitive product quality management. In the year since we set our goals, we have monitored and made directional adjustments to our sustainability initiatives. I believe we have started to see true progress in accelerating innovation driven by social needs through sustainability.
 VG2.0 (P16)
 Progress of Sustainability Goals (P18)
 Newly Emerging Social Needs Drive New Innovation
In fiscal 2018, we will continue to invest in future growth and corporate value improvement.
Of our six financial goals for fiscal 2020, we expect to achieve four of them in fiscal 2018 (Gross profit margin, ROIC, ROE, and EPS). OMRON is growing steadily in earning power, and we will continue to grow as we work to achieve our fiscal 2020 goals for net sales and operating income, as well.
Change is the only constant. It is a truism that means new social needs will always emerge. As technological and social change become more disruptive, OMRON will have more opportunities to improve lives and contribute to a better society. Despite deepening trade frictions and other uncertainties, we will seize the opportunities presented. We will monitor changes in the market environment, execute our action plans, and invest in people and in research and development. As our investments in future growth translate into results, we will take on even bigger social issues. OMRON is a corporate group on which people can always depend, and we are an organization that continues to live up to the high expectations of people from all over the world.

VG2.0 Medium-Term Management Plan
A Road Map Anchored in the Future
In 2011, OMRON started Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), a plan that outlines a 10-year vision for our company. VG2.0, our medium-term management plan launched in fiscal 2017, is the last stage of VG2020. Spanning four fiscal years, VG2.0 also defines our long-term strategy to respond to social change beyond the timeframe. In drafting VG2.0, we forecast future world trends and social changes, incorporating these projections of the future into our strategies. VG2.0 also reflects considerations of the SINIC theory (OMRON’s unique future predictive model) and Sustainable Development Goals*.
Innovation driven by social needs. It is a core tenet of the OMRON Principles and a concept driving us to work with customers and partners, leveraging open innovation to address four core areas of emerging social needs: Factory Automation, Healthcare, Mobility, and Energy Management.

 VG2.0 and Sustainability Initiatives
OMRON has aligned sustainability targets with our VG2.0 goals to pursue sustainable corporate value through the generation of social value. Based on the OMRON Sustainability Policy, we identified social issues in VG2.0 to be solved through four focus business domains, while selecting core sustainability issues to support our execution of VG2.0 as well as answer the expectations of our stakeholders. We set goals in these areas to achieve by fiscal 2020, and began working toward these goals in fiscal 2017. In the same year, we added progress toward VG2.0 and sustainability indicators* evaluated by third parties into the medium- and long-term performance-linked stock based compensation system for our officers and directors.

 Message from the CFO
20
I was named senior general manager of the Global Strategy HQ in March 2014. In April 2017, I assumed the post of chief financial officer of the OMRON Group. At present, I hold both CFO and senior general manager titles, responsible for both group finance and management strategy. I joined OMRON as a freshly graduated engineering student. Over the next ten years, I worked on development for automatic control technics. Later, I went on to hold positions in business and headquarters management strategy, group resource management (including human resources and administration), and a variety of other posts. A CFO with both technical and business backgrounds might be an exception to the norm today; however, I believe my experience is a strength for a company like OMRON that has declared itself a leading technology company since the beginning.Technological innovation has changed so much in our world. I believe any financial strategy now must integrate management, business, and technology strategies. I will continue to rely on my experience, offering a high-level perspective to the OMRON decision-making process.
Koji Nitto
Director, Senior Managing Executive Officer CFO and Senior General Manager, Global Strategy HQ
 August 2018
 
   I view fiscal 2017, our first year under the VG2.0 plan, as a year in which we created a positive cycle of growth.
First, I will address measures we took to strengthen corporate earning power through improved gross profit margin. For fiscal 2017, we recorded a gross profit margin of 41.6%, a sharp 2.3-point jump compared to the prior year. What drove this improvement? Our practice of ROIC management, two specific factors that I wish to mention here. The first factor was improved value added ratio. This growth in value added ratio stems from coordinating production, development, sales, and planning functions. This coordination leads to a better mix of high-value- added products, as well as cost savings through standardized components. The second factor was lower fixed manufacturing costs, achieved through gains in productivity generated by industrial engineering (research into manufacturing processes). Consistent, intentional efforts in three
Sales Growth
areas shifted our product mix and led to gross profit margin gains: (1) Constant attention to improving value added and reducing fixed costs (just mentioned); (2) Concentration of management resources for growth in our high- margin Industrial Automation Business; and (3) Ongoing company-wide structural reform. I am confident that our corporate earnings power has reached a new stage.
We are using our profits as a resource to accelerate growth investments in technology management in our organization as a whole, and in our mainstay Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business in particular. These two businesses were the workhorses driving us to record-high OMRON Group sales.
We will reach new levels of corporate value as we continue to repeat this growth cycle, building our earnings power, investing for market dominance, and growing our revenue base.

 ROIC Management BuildsTrue Earnings Power
OMRON has selected ROIC as a key management indicator to measure the profitability of our invested capital. We believe ROIC correctly assess the profitability across multiple businesses having different characteristics. This, in turn, allows us to invest our resources wisely. ROIC management has become familiar throughout our business, an accepted company-wide measure we use to encourage ongoing improvement. Our activities to improve gross profit margin, mentioned earlier, stem from our focus on ROIC. ROIC management consists of two components: Down-top management and portfolio management. Down- top ROIC management is a more detailed key performance indicator tied to activities in the local workplace. Portfolio management assesses our more than 90 business units using a combination of sales growth and market growth. We ensure ROIC management is the tool by which management and local workplaces view our business. This is how we strengthen our ability to generate value and earnings power, as well as establish a persistent growth cycle. For fiscal 2017, we generated an extremely high ROIC of 12.7%.
Under VG2.0, we consider ROIC of between
10% and 15% to be appropriate. Accordingly, we require business divisions to deliver a minimum 10% ROIC. Where a business cannot reach 10% ROIC, we assess the business’s future and market value, taking action as necessary. For example, during fiscal 2017 we introduced structural reforms in our Micro Devices Business, which has struggled with profitability. More specifically, we closed the smartphone microphone business, while we integrated the competitive MEMS business into our Electronic and Mechanical Components Business. At the same time, we moved the important technologies and expertise of the R&D and manufacturing departments under the management of headquarters. We also sold the shares of OMRON Laserfront Inc. and continued with structural reform measures at our Backlights Business, downsizing the scope operations.
Practicing ROIC management in this way, we generate value (profits), which is used to create even greater value through correct cash allocation and investment management.
 22
Balancing Discipline and Risk in Investment Management
We will focus the resources we generate through improved earnings power to invest in promising growth areas, speeding initiatives for innovation driven by social needs.
The first half of VG2.0, fiscal years 2017 and 2018, is a time for us to solidify our growth structure, bolstering sales and other front office functions. We will also increase investments in research and development, facilities, and M&A. Speaking of M&A, we made two acquisitions during 2017 in our Industrial Automation Business. When we consider an acquisition, we give priority to the type of synergies and innovation we expect from combining the resources of the target with our own. Simple addition is not acceptable. We must be confident of multiplicative effects gained through synergies. As an objective standard, we
set a minimum 10% ROIC as the hurdle for recovering our investment. Obviously, we require a higher rate of return for projects that demand higher returns from a standpoint of strategic value. Acquisitions are subject to annual performance reviews to determine whether results are in line with plans. If progress is not satisfactory, we monitor the project to understand what measures are being taken. I am proud to say that each of the five M&A transactions over the past four years have outperformed our expectations, offering dramatic synergies with our existing businesses.

Research and development expense is an important long-term investment for the OMRON Group. We have set a standard for R&D expense at 7% of sales, and we intend to raise this level to 7.5% by fiscal 2020. Our target for investments in core technologies, including AI and robotics, is about 1% of sales. Dedicating capital to the progress of technology represents up-front investments that will bear fruit for corporate growth 10 and 20 years down the line. This is the

             Appropriate Cash Management and Profit Distribution
OMRON distributes profits according to principles of appropriate cash management and our own profit distribution policy. Our profit distribution policy prioritizes growth investment, stable dividends, and stock buybacks, in that order. We engage actively in growth investments, including M&A activities. At present, we hold cash reserves at a level of between one and two months’ sales, a policy we intend to continue. We used internal reserves for the past five corporate acquisitions. However, we would consider borrowing funds from outside sources—after considering the impact on our credit rating—if a promising growth investment demanded more cash than we held in reserve.
Once we have allocated profits to growth investment, we next look to shareholder return. Under the fiscal years covered by VG2.0, our
target for dividend payout ratio and dividend on equity is approximately 30% and 3%, respectively. Why did we add a dividend on equity target of 3% to a dividend payout ratio? We did this to avoid wide swings in dividend payments, even in the event we change earnings forecasts during the fiscal year. Share buybacks will be performed as opportunities present themselves, balanced by growth investment plans and cash on hand. In July 2017, we set a one-year scope of ¥20 billion for share repurchases, securing the entire amount as of May 2018.
Speaking on behalf of OMRON management, we will redouble our efforts to build corporate value as we implement the growth cycle.
Thank you for your support of the OMRON Group.

ROIC Management
OMRON has selected ROIC as a key performance indicator for our business. We stress ROIC management throughout our organization to encourage further improvement. Our VG2.0 medium-term management plan emphasizes ROIC management, which we will use to reach a new level of growth.
 Why ROIC?
OMRON encompasses a number of business divisions with varied characteristics. We believe ROIC is an excellent measure for assessing business performance fairly for each business. Using operating income or operating income margin as an indicator doesn’t account for variances due to the nature or scope of a business. ROIC, on the other hand, measures return on invested capital, providing a fair assessment. Under VG2.0, we have defined four focus domains. ROIC is an indispensable tool as we continue to grow our unique business portfolio.
More specifically, ROIC management consists of Down-Top ROIC Tree and Portfolio Management.
Down-Top ROIC Tree
Down-Top ROIC Tree breaks ROIC into key performance indicators for each department, allowing us to improve ROIC at the most basic operating level. Using simple ROS or invested capital turnover as ROIC indicators are ineffective, since they do not relate directly to front-line operations. On-site managers would have trouble thinking of ways to improve ROIC using these indicators. However, we can break ROIC down into automation/head count reduction or facilities turnover as KPIs of manufacturing departments. With these indicators, managers can finally see how their goals tie directly to ROIC improvement initiatives. At OMRON, one of our greatest strengths is our unified approach to improving ROIC from the ground level up.

 Portfolio Management
OMRON consists of approximately 90 business units, each subject to a portfolio management system that assesses the economic value of the unit according to (1) ROIC and (2) sales growth rate. In this way, OMRON management can make proper and timely decisions related to new business entry, growth acceleration, restructuring, or divestiture to drive improvements in OMRON Group value.

Embracing ROIC Management
To promote ROIC management more widely, we introduced ROIC Management 2.0 in 2015. ROIC Management 2.0 incorporates a qualitative interpretation of ROIC. The interpreted formula tells us to add needed management resources (N) and generate greater levels of value to our customers (V), while reducing loss-making management resources (L). Using this simple interpreted formula, our employees in charge of sales or development functions who may be unfamiliar with financial statement concepts are able to envision ROIC improvement measures in their day-to-day work.
Staff in charge of business unit accounting and finance act as ambassadors responsible for promoting ROIC Management 2.0. Ambassadors provide simple case studies of successful ROIC Management 2.0 initiatives to raise awareness of ROIC on the front lines of our businesses around the world.
We consider both the economic value and the market competitiveness of a business to allocate limited resources in an optimal manner. This assessment system allows us to identify the growth potential of each business unit, making an optimal allocation of our resources.

Here, we discuss some ways in which we engaged with stakeholders during fiscal 2017.
Shareholders
(General Meeting of Shareholders)
We encourage our shareholders to attend the general meeting of shareholders. We hold our meeting at least three business days prior to the date used by the majority of companies in Japan. We send convocation notices at least four weeks prior to the meeting, ensuring shareholders have sufficient time to study proposals in advance. Feedback from the meeting indicated an overall favorable assessment of our willingness to answer questions and of the positive tone of the meeting.
Institutional Investors (Interviews, Conferences, Factory Tours, etc.)
OMRON engages actively with institutional investors in Japan and across the world through meetings and telephone conferences. During fiscal 2017, we held factory tours in Chicago and Shanghai, mainly for our institutional investors. These tours included presentations about our productivity improvements and regional growth strategies, as well as question and answer sessions, helping investors learn more about sustainable growth at OMRON.
Investors and Other
Stakeholders (ESG Meeting)
In December 2017, OMRON held our first-ever ESG information session. The event featured presentations by executive officers discussing how we incorporate the OMRON Principles in our approaches to human capital, manufacturing and risk management. Attendees learned about OMRON in ways not possible via usual investor relations activities. Some 120 investors attended, as did ESG experts and scholars, students, and media representatives. The event also served as an opportunity to receive direct feedback about expectations of OMRON.

  Suppliers
(Global Partner Conference)
Suppliers are important OMRON partners. Every year, we hold the OMRON Global Partner Conference to encourage a shared vision toward creating new value. At the end of the conference, we have a gathering for sharing opinions, which builds a stronger mutual understanding and a more effective event. The May 2017 conference covered many important topics, including the OMRON long-term vision, partnership frameworks for innovative products, and initiatives for sustainability through supply chain management.
Employees
(OMRON Principles Missionary Dialogues)
Our chairman conducts OMRON Principles Missionary Dialogues as one opportunity to engage with employees. During fiscal 2017, dialogues were held in Korea, the Americas, Europe, and Japan. These meetings are an opportunity for employees to discuss real-world examples of solving social issues through practice of the OMRON Principles, to address the importance of sustainability, and to interact with the chairman of OMRON in an open and honest setting. These interactions help OMRON continue to build a resilient organization.
Other Stakeholders (Exhibitions)
We exhibit at trade shows and other events to allow customers and other stakeholders the chance to experience our business and technologies firsthand. We exhibited for the first time at the U.S. Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. Our table tennis coaching robot, FORPHEUS, was a highlight of the show, demonstrating our latest developments in factory automation and mobility. Many luminaries from a wide range of industries visited our booth, including Tom Soderstrom, Chief Technology & Innovation Officer at NASA - Jet Propulsion Laboratory, experiencing the OMRON vision of harmony between human and machine.

   Special Feature 1: CTO Interview
 Creating Innovation Driven by Social Needs Anchored in the Future
Kiichiro Miyata
Director, Senior Managing Executive Officer, CTO
36
Over the years, OMRON has introduced numerous world-first innovations driven by social needs, including the non-contact switch, the automated ticket gate, and many others. How has one company been able to come up with innovation after innovation? One key is the backcasting method of technology management practiced in our company beginning with our founder. OMRON established the position of chief technology officer in 2015 in response to the increasingly disruptive changes in society and technology. In our CTO position, we have recreated that technology management as practiced under the keen insight of our founder. In this special feature, we discuss creating innovation driven by social needs with CTO and OMRON technology leader Kiichiro Miyata.
— Three years have passed since you were named OMRON CTO. Can you tell us about your thoughts when first named to the position and your experiences to date?
 OMRON is a leading technology company that searches for solutions to customer and social issues proactively through technology development. The result is a unique collection of nearly 90 business units, ranging from several hundreds of millions of yen in sales to several billions. In 1999, we adopted an internal company structure, with each business division responsible for its own technology strategy. Under this structure, we experienced a significant leap forward in the sophistication of our division technologies. Over the past several years, however, we have seen rapid innovations in AI,
IoT, robotics, and other new technologies. The environment surrounding our businesses has changed dramatically. To respond quickly and flexibly, we felt the need for a cross-organizational approach, establishing the position of CTO to oversee group-wide technology strategy.
As the first OMRON CTO, I have been responsible for developing our approach to technology management and formulating an OMRON-wide technology strategy to implement over the long term. I believe we have set OMRON technology management on a solid course over the past three years.

— The technology management you mentioned is regarded as a subset of general business management. What makes the OMRON style of technology management unique?
 Technology management at OMRON relies on technology innovation to perform near-future design tailored to solving social issues. We then outline and execute the strategy required to realize this future design. The foundation of our approach is the SINIC predictive theory espoused by our founder, Kazuma Tateishi, in 1970.
SINIC predicts how the interplay among science, technology, and society changes the future social order and propels further social evolution. New developments in science result in new technology. New technology brings about change in society, which give rise to new social issues. These issues drive more technological innovation, which impacts science. At OMRON, we work to solve customer and social issues
arising in the interplay among these elements. In other words, we create businesses based on signals from society.
Under VG2.0, we exercise technology management with a focus on the three areas related to science, technology, and society: Open innovation, core technologies (cross-organizational and business-specific), and business incubation through trial-and-error. I think our efforts in these focus areas have been successful so far.

  — In the three years since being named CTO, you have been able to create an effectively functioning technology management framework. As CTO, what do you see as the next task for OMRON growth?
We must speed our pace of creating innovation driven by social needs if we are to deliver new value for a better society.
I mentioned earlier that OMRON is a collection of nearly 90 businesses. We have exercised a degree of portfolio management in consolidated some of those entities. Now, we need to create new businesses to take their place and drive continued growth. In other words, management at OMRON is concerned with producing new value from every corner of our organization, leading to new products and services that become an indispensable part of society.
We are building frameworks and organizations that support new value creation, making the process of innovation driven by social needs part of our organizational knowledge. This process consists of forecasting and backcasting. Traditionally, OMRON has been skilled in identifying social needs and then backcasting to create unprecedented value. Under our company structure, however, we began focusing mainly on forecasting. Now, backcasting will have a comparatively greater weight in our technology management process.

To support this initiative, we created the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ, or IXI, in March 2018 as a company-wide innovation platform. IXI has all the resources it needs to backcast innovation driven by social needs, providing end- to-end oversight of the process. As a platform, IXI will work with entities both inside and outside our organization to raise the output of innovation at OMRON.

   — Many other companies have set up organizations to promote innovation, some more effective than others. Why do you think innovation acceleration initiatives are proving successful at OMRON?
For many years now, OMRON has used a process template for backcasting to create innovation driven by social needs. Another big factor is our ingrained corporate culture in which employees take the initiative to do courageous things.
This process template was in the mind of our founder, an amazing entrepreneur. He was both businessperson and engineer, combining both aspects to identify signs of change in the world and develop a super-specific image of the future. At OMRON, we call this near-future design. We contribute to a better society by developing technologies and products necessary to achieve near-future design, incubating businesses that become an indispensable part of society. What we will do is take the concept of backcasting near- future design for innovation driven by social needs, which existed as tacit knowledge in the mind of our founder, and convert it into a process based on explicit knowledge for use across our organization.
As an example, let’s look at the innovative- Automation and Zero Event goals we are pursuing through our Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business. We have backcast from a near-future vision to start businesses in factory automation and healthcare domains. We will roll this process out across our entire group in the future.
The OMRON Principles play a very big role in our corporate culture, which is one of our major strengths. The OMRON Principles espouses three important values: (1) Innovation Driven by Social Needs; (2) Challenging Ourselves; and (3) Respect for All. These values have taken hold in our employees. When we challenge them to create innovation driven by social needs, many respond enthusiastically, without fear of failure. We remain committed to incorporating ideas from outside our organization, and we have embraced open innovation.

       Vision Strategy Business Governance Financial Information Corporate Information

  As our corporate innovation platform, the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ (IXI) is responsible for backcasting the social needs process for near-future design, strategy formulation, and business verification IXI is home to many experts from both inside and outside our organization. We established OMRON SINIC X Corporation (OSX) as a separate company under the umbrella of IXI to develop near-future design. OSX has brought in many top talents from outside in the fields of AI, IoT, robotics, and other leading- edge technologies. This company makes the best use of its talented staff, while working with research groups inside and outside OMRON, engaging in open innovation and performing near-future design. To maximize the effectiveness of these activities, OSX provides unique human
personnel hiring and evaluation systems, including allowing side businesses and moonlighting, that could only work practically under the structure of a separate company. I think the freedom with which OSX researchers work will be a model of work-style reform.
Another important role of IXI is to be the storehouse of knowledge for OMRON in order to speed innovation driven by social needs. To create new value, we must double and triple our attempts. I’m sure we will see our share of failures. Each failure is one more point of learning we can accumulate to ensure future success. Our performance evaluations stress process even more than results, encouraging employees to try and try again without fear of setbacks.

 — Last question. What do you think is most important for innovation driven by social needs?
Managing our processes effectively and fostering our people.
We have mechanisms and organizations in place. In the future, we need to carefully study whether these frameworks are working effectively. One job of the IXI is to make sure information within divisions is identified and shared across our entire group. At the same time, IXI is responsible for communicating information to entities outside the company on a timely basis. Active internal and external communications in this way will help our mechanisms function effectively.
Our people, however, are the most important factor. We have charged IXI with a responsibility for providing a space to develop our strategic personnel. Strategic personnel are those people who will carry OMRON forward, displaying the architecture skills, communications skills, and
follow-through necessary to lead our business. When we want to launch a new project, we put the idea together with strategic personnel from the business division in question under the offices of the IXI, after which a team is formed consisting of people from different backgrounds. After participating in and gaining experience in several projects, these strategic personnel return to their divisions providing even greater contribution. In this way, we make full use of our strategic personnel in mechanisms and organizations, producing innovation after innovation for social needs. This process makes sure innovation at OMRON does not rely on a single person of genius. Rather, innovation for social needs at OMRON is driven organizationally.
You can expect more innovation driven by social needs from OMRON in the future.

Introducing i-BELT, a Co-Creation Business Model for Innovation
World-wide shortages of technical staff have presented challenges for maintaining and improving productivity and quality. This situation calls for replicating the skills and knowledge of experienced employees through automation, using AI, IoT, robotics, and other technologies. However, many customers have yet to adopt specific manufacturing productivity initiatives based on IoT data, etc., being unable to develop practical solutions on their own. In answer to this problem, OMRON launched i-BELT as a new and innovative business model in fiscal 2017. i-BELT is a service that uses data based on expertise and skills from OMRON and customer sources to allow anyone the ability to incorporate IoT easily into their manufacturing practices.

Case Study 1: Using Data to Automate Artisanship
   Today’s employment environment struggles with shortages
of skilled workers and apprentices. To solve this issue, our
Kusatsu Plant has taken up the challenge to replicate and
automate the skills and knowledge of experienced
engineers. Making metal molds requires a machining center*
operated under the experience and intuition of a skilled
machinist. This is a key to quality and productivity for a mold
manufacturer. In observing a skilled machinist at work, we
noticed their careful attention to the differences in sound
from the piece they were grinding. Accordingly, we went
about automating this experience and skill. After much
trial-and-error, we developed a proprietary algorithm to convert vibration data into sound. Using changes in sound combined with insight from experts, we were able to incorporate this technology into machine control, reducing processing time by 40 percent and tool wear by 20 percent.

Case Study 2: Freeing Workers From Monotonous Labor Through Robotics and Manufacturing Technologies
 Our plants in Shanghai, Kusatsu, and Ayabe are working to solve the issue of labor shortages by automating lifting and transport tasks using autonomous mobile robots. Mobile robots outfitted with proprietary AI sensing technology can move autonomously through a plant without causing injury to humans or damage to property. We are working with customers to develop mechanics integrating robot, conveyor, and equipment, allowing these robots the ability to handle products of various sizes, shapes, and weights. Adaptive lifting and transport of this type will not only solve labor shortages, but also create an environment in which humans can focus on creating higher value.

Rising Use of Home-Use Blood Pressure Monitors to Battle High Blood Pressure in Emerging Economies
More than 1 billion people are believed to suffer from high blood pressure around the world. In emerging economies, where middle-class populations are exploding, we expect to see a major rise in patients suffering from high blood pressure due to lifestyle diseases.
At OMRON, we believe in-home blood
pressure management is an important part
of prevention and improvement. We have
been working with governments and
medical institutions for many years to speed
the adoption of home-use blood pressure
monitors. Under this initiative, we
cooperated with the International Society of
Hypertension and the World Hypertension
League in a blood pressure measurement project, conducted in 100 countries in conjunction with World Hypertension Day on May 17, 2017. For our part, we sponsored activities in India, China, and several other countries to educate citizens about measuring blood pressure regularly. In India, we held blood pressure measurement events in 13 cities, taking measurements for more than 1,300 people in total. In China, we worked with the Chinese hyper tension association, the Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine) and the Shanghai Research Institute of Hypertension, donating 8,720 blood pressure monitors and taking measurements for nearly 490,000 people. Our fiscal 2018 goal is to conduct similar activities across 200 cities, taking blood pressure readings for 1 million people.
Expanding Production Capacity for Latin American
Markets
Brazil and other Latin American markets are experiencing a rise in high blood pressure and asthma patients, linked to a growing middle class and lifestyle changes. In response to these circumstances, OMRON acquired Brazilian nebulizer maker NS Indústria de Aparelhos Médicos (NS) in 2014. This acquisition provided access to NS sales channels for our blood pressure monitors and nebulizers. In 2017, we built a new blood pressure monitor production line inside NS, starting production of wrist blood pressure monitors for sale in Brazil. In May 2017, we began construction of a new plant in Brazil to manufacture blood pressure monitors and nebulizers for sale in Latin American markets. We expect the plant to commence operations in 2019. Our aim is to increase production capacity in Brazil from 1.2 million units in 2017 to 5.4 million units in 2022, meeting the growing demand in Latin America for our products.

New Products for Driver Safety
3D-LIDAR and DriveKarte are two leading examples of driver support technology under development at OMRON.
3D-LIDAR is a jump forward in the advancement of self-driving vehicles on public roads. The cameras and millimeter-wave radar used in most forward-detection sensors today have major weaknesses, including performance in bad weather and the detection of certain types of obstacles. 3D-LIDAR, on the other hand, can be used in parallel to detect curbs, drop- offs, and other obstacles as small as 10 centimeters and as far away as 30 meters.
The DriveKarte is a management service that uses data collected from on-board driver monitoring sensors. We have started sales of DriveKarte to customers in the logistics and other industries struggling with chronic labor shortages. The system detects dangerous driving conditions (sleep, distracted driving, etc.) based on the driver’s eyelids, line of sight, and other attributes. When a dangerous condition is detected, the system warns the driver and sends an email to an operations manager. We are developing a score that will be useful in detecting dangerous driving conditions and providing guidance for safe driving.
Looking to the Near Future
Advanced Driver Information Sensing
We have launched a new initiative in safe driving technology: Driver biological information diagnosis. We are integrating our industry-leading biological information sensing technologies (blood pressure, pulse wave) into safe driving systems to manage the physical condition of a driver. We expect this technology will be used in applications to prevent accidents of the type caused by the incapacity of an elderly person behind the wheel.

    Case Study
  TOGA and Engagement Surveys for Sustainable Growth
OMRON seeks leaders who can drive innovation and talented employees to solve social issues through our businesses. Launched in 2012, the Omron Global Awards (TOGA) is an annual global employee- participation awards presentation. TOGA is an important part of how ORMON builds a culture motivated to put the OMRON Principles into practice through their work. In 2016, we introduced the VOICE engagement survey (VG OMRON Interactive Communication with Employees). This voice-interactive survey for employees dealing with social issues encourages frank feedback by which management uncovers and addresses issues in our business. These two initiatives are critical parts of sustainable growth for our people and our organization.
TOGA Evolution and
Advancement
TOGA is becoming a more important part of our global organization with every year. We saw record participation in fiscal 2017 with more than 50,000 employees. At first, many entries dealt with the employee spirit of challenge. Today, we see more initiatives that address solving social issues. We are also seeing more projects that span national, regional, and business borders, as well as examples of solving social issues through innovative partnerships with customers, government institutions and others.

 Engagement Surveys to Identify and Address Issues
Based on survey results from the prior year, we explored a number of different work styles (teleworking, etc.) and self-development programs in Japan during fiscal 2017. Overseas, we stepped up our talent search and human resources training. We discussed our fiscal 2017 results in the Executive Council, identifying five important issues and launching specific programs in response. These issues include decision-making speed and encouraging our younger employees to be more proactive. As an example, we are moving and evaluating human resources development functions traditionally performed in Japan overseas to increase the speed of decision-making at our operations around the world. Our head office in Europe is taking the lead in standardizing processes overseas, aimed at the future global integration of accounting and finance operations.

  Special Feature 2: Putting the OMRON Principles Into Practice
 TOGA (The OMRON Global Awards)
TOGA is a program for sharing real-world examples of the OMRON Principles in action, fostering a culture motivated to create value.This year, we saw many TOGA entries highlighting innovation driven by social needs.These entries were inspired by creating value for society, creating value through paradigm change, and working effectively with partners inside and outside our organization.
Case Study 1
More than 110 million Chinese suffer from diabetes, many also struggling with kidney, eye, or other diabetes- related complications. Meanwhile, China has only 20,000 or so diabetes specialists to offer care. Many patients must visit several different doctors, wasting precious time and money. In response to this situation, OMRON MEDICAL (Beijing) Co., Ltd. brought together diabetes specialists, pharmaceutical companies, and medical IT companies to launch standardized metabolic management centers, or MMCs, providing proper treatment for diabetes patients. The MMC is a part of a system using big data to combine examination and treatment data from hospitals with measurement data take in the home. This standardized administration platform now allows for uniform treatment for patients in China. Since its founding in 2016, the MMC system has been joined by 188* medical institutions from 28 provinces and districts across China.

   Comments from Outside Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member
Kuniko Nishikawa, Outside Director
OMRON TOGA entries consist of initiatives that address real issues, built on a practice of the OMRON Principles. Based on my own past experience, the Metabolic Management Center project must have been an extremely complex venture. Despite the challenges, OMRON provided an amazing solution. This program will tie in to the OMRON blood pressure monitor business and other services, potentially rolling out in other countries struggling with similar issues. The project in Mexico was another example of addressing a real issue. The manufacturing industry is grappling with the issue of declining productivity due to the lack of skilled technicians. I can see how employees who understand both technology and customer production floor operations contribute to business growth.

     Hideyo Uchiyama, Audit & Supervisory Board Member (Independent)
As an outside Audit & Supervisory Board member, I have the opportunity to participate in board of director meeting discussions of OMRON’s medium-term management plan, human resources strategy, and other matters. At the same time, I am deeply interested in whether frontline employees are motivated to achieve these plans and execute strategies. Does every employee have a real awareness and understanding of management goals? Seeing the TOGA presentations and talking with employees,
I understand how employees worldwide put the OMRON Principles into practice in the workplace. I see how they apply the principles to their own roles within the organization. I think we can say many employees resonate with the goal of solving social issues within their own set of values, linking achievement of this goal to motivation in their work. Once again, I am convinced that the long-term improvement in OMRON corporate value is supported by the daily work and actions of focused and motivated employees.

Case Study 2
Omron Automotive Electronics de Mexico S. de R.L.de C.V. (OAX) is located in the state of Guanajuato, home to the largest concentration of automobile manufacturers in Mexico. Here, employment is expected to grow 46 percent through the year 2020. This environment has led to competition for employees, creating serious issue of turnover not only for OAX, but also for many other local manufacturers. OAX took the OMRON Principles declaration of Respect for All to heart, starting the OMRON High School (high school education) for the more than 100 OAX factory employees. The company also introduced 35 other projects for the local community. OAX employees felt more pride as part of an organization contributing to the economy, and fiscal 2017 employee turnover fell 21 percent year on year. These initiatives have fostered a culture of mutual respect and encouraged a culture of innovation. These programs have also forged stronger relationships between the company, customers, and the local community.

  Supporting Innovation Through Sustainable Manufacturing Practices
Without sustainable manufacturing practices, OMRON could not produce innovations responding to rapid technology breakthroughs and emerging social needs. Sustainable manufacturing requires practices that consider product safety, labor conditions, and the
environment. At the same time, we must deliver products that customers can use with confidence. In keeping with this commitment, OMRON is working toward our fiscal 2020 sustainability goals.

  Building Sustainability Together With Suppliers
As we deal with a more diverse and global group of new suppliers, we recognize the pressing need to bolster sustainability in our supply chain. At OMRON, we work with our suppliers to build a sustainable society, identifying as partner suppliers those whom we judge as outstanding in quality, cost, delivery, environment, and safety. We ask major suppliers to complete a sustainability self-check in accordance with standards established by the Responsible Business Alliance. Besides self-checks for partner suppliers, we have defined minimum sustainability standards for all global suppliers. In fiscal 2017, our joint efforts with suppliers resulted in every partner supplier scoring 65 points or higher on sustainability self-checks.

 Environment
  Introducing OMRON Carbon Zero*1
We believe that building an environment for a sustainable society is part of improving lives and contributing to a better society, as stated in the OMRON Principles. In support of this ideal, we pursue initiatives under our Green OMRON 2020 environmental vision.
In July 2018, we set new environmental targets under OMRON Carbon Zero, aligned with the recent Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Our target is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2*2 greenhouse gas emissions to zero by fiscal 2050. Our interim goal is to reduce emissions 32 percent (vs. Fiscal 2016) by fiscal 2030. Backcasting from these targets, we have
set a fiscal 2020 goal to reduce emissions by four percent. We are even starting to consider reducing Scope 3*3 gas emissions in the near future. OMRON has announced that it will set its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target based on scientific grounds for the SBTi*4.
We has built a global framework to achieve our environmental targets, and we are adopting energy conservation and renewable energy practices across our organization. At the same time, we are moving forward with projects that use the expertise developed in our renewable energy businesses in our own company.
*1 OMRON Carbon Zero: a term used to gain recognition for OMRON’s efforts for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
*2 Scope 1 and Scope 2: Direct greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fuels at our company (Scope 1) and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from the use of electricity and heat purchased by our company (Scope 2).

 Risk Management
  Supporting Global Expansion
In 2011, we launched the OMRON VG2020 long-term vision. This led to review our existing risk management activities to adopt a new Integrated Risk Management platform. Our new risk management platform reflected the thinking of the top management that the faster pace of change in the operating environment and rising levels of uncertainty called for preparation and rapid response to risk. Management felt the need for OMRON to become more attuned to risk, identifying and addressing risks at the earliest stages.
OMRON faces a variety of risks as we expand across the globe. Accordingly, we have identified and categorized the entire spectrum of risks that impact management performance and financial health. Having
Businesses and Risk
defined these risks, we then charted their interrelationships. The risk categories defined consist Macro Environment Risk; Natural Disaster Risk; Management, Business Strategy, and Financial Risk (including Human Risk and Legal Risk); and Resource and Infrastructure Risk.
We use this framework as a link between management and the local workplace, helping management work with local staff to deal with OMRON Principles-based risk management issue. Under our current VG2.0 plan, we take actions related to business risk management that help us respond to new challenges including creating value through innovation.

  Integrated Risk Management Structure
Integrated risk management at OMRON consists of three main activities:
1. Performing an annual global risk analysis to identify
important risks and formulate responses
2. Forming a crisis response measure when a risk
develops into a crisis
3. Reporting important risk information promptly and
providing information to relevant parties (risk information management)
Activity Cycle for Integrated Risk Management
We formalized this shared framework into a document titled, OMRON Group Rules for Integrated Risk Management. This document clarifies the role of risk management. We have appointed risk managers in each head office department, each division, each regional headquarters, and each group company in Japan and around the world. These risk managers are responsible for coordinating risk management activities at the local office level.

OMRON assigns a rank of “S” to the most critical risks that may endanger business continuity of the OMRON Group, or call into questions important issues of group social responsibility. We assign a rank of “A” to risks that may impede achievement of key group goals. Every year, the Corporate Ethics & Risk Management Committee discusses risks, while the Executive Council assigns categories to these risks.
As part of our risk information management system, we monitor the status of important events related to external risks. We check nearly 100 global information sources on a daily basis. As a rule, important risk information within the group is reported to our head office within 24 hours.

   Case Study
  Instilling OMRON Group Rules Worldwide
We established the OMRON Group Rules (OGR) as a framework to promote efficient and effective risk management, compliance, and other matters of group governance on a global scale. In addition to OMRON Principles as a shared group management policy, the rules provided in OGR will help us accomplish goals in three areas: Group Management, Business, and Employees.
 Group Management Business
Employees
Appropriate and minimum necessary controls
Management transparency, fairness, and global vision
Appropriate, responsive decision-making based on shared understanding
Quick integration of acquisitions, establish companies in emerging economies, and localize company management
Raise employee motivation through clear rules, allowing employees to focus on their business activities
We spent three years to produce OGR. OMRON employees from around the globe participated in the project, ensuring the rules took regional differences in law, societal demands, and culture into consideration. We adopted OGR fully during fiscal 2017, holding training programs, publishing information releases through our global website, monitoring, and performing audits to make the rules an integral part of our organization. We still have work to do, however, to instill OGR group-wide. We will continue to provide communications, training, and standardization across the group to raise awareness of the rules. We also facilitate information exchange among local leaders on a regular basis, promoting ways to incorporate OGR into business processes and daily operations.
The New Global OGR Database
OGR global team members discuss how the rules are being adopted in each location
Post-Merger Integration Process
Prior to VG2020, we had no standard rules for post-merger integration (PMI). Quickly integrating new businesses into the group was not an easy task. After implementing a PMI program as part of the OGR, we have been able to integrate understanding of the OMRON Principles, management, human resources, sales, facilities, and other matters smoothly, comprehensively, and according to schedule. We used this program in our fiscal 2015 acquisition of Delta Tau Data Systems and Adept Technologies and achieved effective integration process.

 Message from the Chairman
“We are reaching for new levels of corporate governance in pursuit of sustainable growth for OMRON and society.”
 66

In 1959, OMRON founder Kazuma Tateishi formally defined the OMRON corporate motto, “To improve lives and contribute to a better society.” In 1990, OMRON updated this motto under the OMRON Principles, revised a third time in 2015. As OMRON has grown in scope and geographical reach, the role of the OMRON Principles has become even more important as a unifying force. Our last revision reflected our strong emphasis on innovation driven by social needs. We began operating under the VG2.0 medium-term management plan in 2017. Our goal under this plan is to improve corporate value while solving social issues in domains likely to experience the most in terms of social needs.
In the second year of VG2.0, OMRON is speeding new initiatives to bolster technology management and co-create with our customers. In meeting the new challenge, the role of corporate governance is to oversee management in making business decisions to enhance corporate value. This role is more important than ever.
The OMRON style of corporate governance reflects our willingness to change as necessary in moments of growth. We work to build a better society while striving for sustainable improvement in corporate value. Along the way, we have introduced new stages of improved structures and management that contribute to our quest to achieve our ideal as a company.
For example, in 2001, we were one of the first companies to adopt independent directors. Today, one-third of our board members are independent. While maintaining our status as a company with an audit and supervisory board, in the year 2000, we established the Personnel Advisory Committee (initially the Management Personnel Advisory Committee in 1996). Following we established our Compensation Advisory Committee (2003), CEO Selection Advisory Committee (2006), and Corporate Governance Committee (2008). We have created a hybrid governance framework, combining the best features of a company with an
audit and supervisory board and a company with a nominating committee. Each of these committees is chaired by an independent director. All of OMRON’s independent directors are persons with a diverse business background. In 2015, we began evaluating the effectiveness of our board of directors through the Corporate Governance Committee, made up of independent directors and independent Audit & Supervisory Board members. Also in 2017, we introduced a new stock-based compensation system tied to long- term performance. This system serves to motivate inside directors and executive officers by tying compensation to sustainable improved corporate value, evaluated based on VG2.0 progress, corporate value improvement, and third-party evaluations.
Having continued to improve corporate governance, in 2017, our board of directors engaged in serious discussions of our progress toward VG2.0, as well as the human resources and technology strategies that form the foundation of our business plans. Throughout 2018, we will hold in-depth talks related to information systems and product quality management. During 2017 we also began executing sustainability policy finalized by the board in 2016. The board will monitor the progress of our sustainability efforts, exercising governance to ensure our initiatives respond to the expectations of international society.
We will continue to follow the OMRON Principles as we strive for corporate value improvements through sustainable growth gained by solving social issues. We will evolve our system of corporate governance, while working toward the sustainable growth for OMRON and society.

 Corporate Governance Framework
OMRON has elected to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board.
The OMRON board of directors is made up of eight members to ensure substantive discussion and deliberation about important corporate matters. OMRON has separated the management oversight and business execution functions within the company, creating a system whereby the majority of board directors are not engaged directly in business operations. We have also adopted a policy setting the ratio of outside directors to at least one-third of the total number of directors on the board.
To increase objectivity on behalf of the board of directors, the titles and roles of chairman of the board and president (CEO) have been separated. The chairman serves as chair of the board of directors, without direct corporate representational authority.
OMRON has established several advisory committees to enhance the oversight functions of the board of directors. These committees include the Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection
Fiscal 2018 Corporate Governance Structure
Advisory Committee, the Compensation Advisory Committee, and the Corporate Governance Committee. The Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection Advisory Committee, and the Compensation Advisory Committee are all chaired by outside directors, with at least half of the committee members being outside directors. The chair and members of the Corporate Governance Committee are outside directors and outside corporate auditors, which offers yet another layer of transparency and objectivity onto its decision-making process.
In these policies, we have created a hybrid governance framework, combining the best features of a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Board and a Company with a Nominating Committee.
Outside directors attended the 13 meetings of the board of directors held during fiscal 2017 at a rate of 94.4%. Outside auditors attended at a rate of 100%. Outside auditors attended the 13 meetings of the Audit & Supervisory Board at a rate of 100%.

Financial Results
Fiscal 2017 in Review
Consolidated Earnings
Fiscal 2017 was our first year operating under VG2.0. We defined our basic policy for the year as Start up VG2.0: A Firm First Step Toward Innovation. During the year, we took on three key initiatives: (1) Group growth driven by focus domains (Industrial Automation Business, Healthcare Business); (2) Profit creation through improved group-wide earnings; and (3) Stronger investment in growth fields and technologies.
Consolidated Statement of Income
Net Sales
The OMRON Group set a record high for net sales in fiscal 2017, driven by strong performance in our core Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business. Overseas sales were largely responsible for group earnings, amounting to ¥531.5 billion, ¥67.7 billion (14.6%) higher than the prior fiscal year. Our operations in Greater China and Southeast Asia delivered particularly significant growth. We recorded ¥328.5 billion in sales in Japan, a slight decrease of 0.6% year on year.
Gross Profit Margin, SG&A Expenses, and R&D Expenses
Gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 41.6%, a 2.3-point increase compared to the prior fiscal year and an all-time high for the OMRON Group. This improvement was mainly due to a stronger earnings structure that drove gross profit margin higher, a result
Consolidated Operating Income Analysis (YoY)
Fiscal 2017 results were significantly higher compared to the prior fiscal year. Net sales rose 8.3% to ¥860.0 billion, while operating income was up 27.1% at ¥85.9 billion and operating income margin rose 1.5 points to 10.0%. Net income attributable to OMRON shareholders amounted to ¥63.2 billion, an increase of 37.3%.
of closer coordination among our production, sales, development, and planning groups. Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to ¥212.6 billion, a ¥19.1 billion (9.9%) increase, mainly in connection with stronger revenue performance. Research and development expenses rose ¥8.4 billion (16.6%) to ¥59.1 billion for the year.
Operating Income, Income before IncomeTaxes and Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, and Net Income Attributable to OMRON Shareholders
OMRON Group operating income for the year was ¥85.9 billion (27.1% increase), while our operating income margin was 10.0% (1.5-point increase). Income before income taxes (excluding other income) amounted to ¥83.4 billion (27.3% increase), while net income attributable to OMRON shareholders came in at ¥63.2 billion (37.3% increase).

   Review of Operations by Business Segment
Industrial Automation Business (IAB)
Our Industrial Automation Business recorded domestic net sales of ¥152.0 billion for fiscal 2017, an increase of 13.8% year on year. This result was mainly due to higher investment demand in the global automobile and digital markets, as well as our own progress in our ability to propose solutions to our customers. Overseas net sales rose 23.7% to ¥244.2 billion, reflecting positive developments across the world. The Americas experienced strong investments in semiconductor- related markets and firm investment demand in automobile markets. Meanwhile, a more settled
political situation and gradual economic recovery in Europe, accompanied by strong machinery exports, led to greater demand, particularly in the food industry. Greater China and Asia experienced increases in both pace and scale of investment in the digital industries (semiconductors and smartphones) throughout the year. In total, the IAB segment recorded net sales of ¥396.1 billion (19.7% increase). An extensive product lineup and improved skills in selling solutions led to a sharp rise in operating income, up 42.3% to ¥74.0 billion.

 Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC)
 Our Electronic and Mechanical Components Business recorded domestic net sales of ¥22.8 billion for fiscal 2017, up 1.4% year on year. This increase was mainly due to an increase in inquiries from the automotive industry and strong sales of new vehicles among our customers. Overseas net sales rose 12.0% to 80.1 billion due to several factors. Performance was strong in the Americas and Europe, as we captured demand for consumer and commercial products in this growing market. Sales were strong in Greater China, supported
by higher incomes and improving living standards in inland regions, which led to higher demand in the high-function appliances market. Last, sales rose in Asia, owing to higher demand for motorcycles and an increasing number of our products being used in home appliances. Total fiscal 2017 net sales for the EMC segment rose 9.5% to ¥102.8 billion, while operating income amounted to ¥12.1 billion, up 28.7%, due in part to higher revenues and internal sales to the Industrial Automation Business.

   Healthcare Business (HCB)
Our Healthcare Business recorded domestic net sales of ¥26.0 billion, down 10.0%. While sales of blood pressure monitors and low-frequency therapy equipment were strong in response to stepped up online promotions, sales from professional-use products were lower due to the transfer of shares of Omron Colin Co., Ltd. In December 2016. Overseas net sales were up a healthy 13.9% year on year, reaching ¥82.5 billion. Sales of blood pressure monitors and nebulizers in the Americas were strong, mainly due to promotional activity in online sales channels in the U.S. and an expansion of our store network. Our business in
Europe saw firm sales of blood pressure monitors in Russia, while our businesses in Greater China reported higher sales of blood pressure monitors and nebulizers through online channels. Sales of blood pressure monitors in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia were strong, mainly due to an expansion in our store network. As a result, the HCB segment recorded a total of ¥108.5 billion in net sales for fiscal 2017, up 7.1%. Higher sales and productivity improvements combined for a sharp rise in segment operating income, up 31.4% to ¥11.2 billion for the year.

  The Other Businesses segment recorded ¥54.8 billion in net sales for fiscal 2017, down 20.0% year on year. Despite ongoing structural reforms, lower sales and other factors combined to produce an operating loss of ¥2.1 billion. Despite the positive impact of expanding our lineup of storage battery products, sluggish demand for PV inverters used in solar panels drove down sales in our Environmental Solutions Business. In contrast, our Electronic Systems and Equipment Business
experienced strong demand for uninterruptible power supply units and contract services for the development and production of electronic devices. Accordingly, sales in this business increased for the year. Micro Devices Business sales were higher, mainly due to a temporary rise in demand for smartphone microphones. Finally, sales in our Backlights Business fell year on year by a wide margin, largely due to further business optimization initiatives.

Review of Financial Condition
Total assets at the end of fiscal 2017 amounted to ¥745.0 billion, an increase of ¥47.3 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. This increase stems mainly from an increase in inventories, machinery and equipment, and other capital assets.
Total liabilities increased ¥10.6 billion to ¥237.6 billion. Current liabilities amounted to ¥182.8 billion, ¥10.7 billion higher due mainly to increases in accounts payable.
Net assets increased ¥36.6 billion to ¥507.4 billion, owing mainly to higher net income attributable to

The OMRON Group made ¥38.9 billion in total capital investments during fiscal 2017, representing a 51.2% increase compared to the prior fiscal year. We engaged
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2017 amounted to ¥113.0 billion, a decrease of ¥13.0 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥73.7 billion. This was a ¥4.2 billion decrease compared to the prior fiscal year, reflecting net income of ¥63.5 billion (¥17.2 billion increase) and ¥29.5 billion in depreciation and amortization (¥500 million increase). Net cash used in investing activities amounted to ¥55.8 billion. This was an increase of ¥40.8 billion in net cash outlays,
Dividend Policy
Our policy for profit distribution is to prioritize investment in R&D necessary for ongoing corporate value improvement, capital expenditures, and M&A. At the same, we strive for stable, consistent returns for our shareholders. The OMRON Group established a guideline of 30% in payout ratio and 3% of dividend on
OMRON shareholders. Net income attributable to OMRON shareholders and other factors led to an increase in retained earnings of ¥45.0 billion. As a result, shareholders’ equity amounted to ¥505.5 billion (year-on-year increase of ¥36.5 billion), while shareholders’ equity ratio increased 0.7 points to 67.9%. While total liabilities and shareholders’ equity were higher year on year, our debt-equity ratio remained nearly level at 0.47, a 0.01-point decrease.

mainly due to capital expenditures and business acquisitions. As a result, free cash flow (total of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities) amounted to ¥17.8 billion, a decrease of ¥45.0 billion versus the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥33.1 billion, an increase of ¥18.1 billion, partly due to ¥15.4 billion in dividend payments (¥800 million increase year on year).
equity ratio for profit distributions for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 covered by our medium-term management plan, VG2.0. As guided by this policy, we paid ¥76 per share in dividends for fiscal 2017. This resulted in a dividend on equity ratio of 3.3%.

Outlook for Fiscal 2018
Consolidated Earnings
While the fiscal 2018 economic environment for certain regions is difficult to predict with clarity, we expect the global economy to continue to demonstrate strength overall. Looking to the OMRON Group’s major markets, we expect strong demand in Japan as capital investment expands in the automobile and digital industries. Overseas, we forecast an economic recovery in the U.S. spurred by major tax cuts and other policies, while capital investment and production increases in Europe should lead to a gradual recovery in that region. The rate of growth in China will likely slow down. However, demand for our products and services should be strong in response to manufacturing labor shortages and the resulting needs for automation. In Asia, the economies of Thailand, India, and Indonesia should continue to recover throughout the year.
We will respond to these conditions in fiscal 2018, our second year under VG2.0, striving for revenue and
Industrial Automation Business (IAB)
We expect the IAB to benefit from strong demand for labor-savings and automation globally. In particular, we forecast higher demand for capital investment in the digital (rising needs for IoT) and automotive (investment in automated driving technologies, eco-friendly vehicles) industries. We plan to leverage the industrial code reader and industrial camera businesses we acquired in fiscal 2017 to capture global demand for
profit growth, pursuing a policy under the banner of
Creating Change: Accelerate growth and transform profit structure through innovation. As with fiscal 2017, we will continue to bolster our earnings ability, investing profits in our Industrial Automation Business, Healthcare Business, and core technologies. We will create innovations that keep the growth cycle on an upward path, accelerating OMRON Group growth.
Our fiscal 2018 plan calls for net sales of ¥900 billion (4.7% increase) versus fiscal 2017, operating income of ¥93.0 billion (8.3% increase), and net income attributable to OMRON shareholders of ¥64.5 billion (2.1% increase). Our target for gross profit margin, an indicator of earnings ability, will be 42.5%, representing a 0.9-point increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Finally, we will dedicate organization-wide efforts to reaching the important ROIC and ROE targets for the year, which we have set at approximately 12%.
traceability, which is rising in response to greater awareness of product quality. Based on our projections, our fiscal 2018 net sales plan calls for ¥428.0 billion in IAB sales, representing an 8% increase compared to fiscal 2017. While we will continue to invest in future growth, we expect rising revenues and other factors to drive operating income 10.8% higher year on year, reaching ¥82.0 billion for fiscal 2018.
Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC)
We forecast a significant decline in EMC sales in Japan, impacted by level demand in the automobile-related industries and contracting demand in the amusement industry. Overseas, we expect to see strong demand in the consumer markets of the Americas and Europe. In Greater China, demand in the high-function home appliance market should continue to grow, while government environmental policies are likely to drive growth in markets for water heaters and home furnaces. The markets for semiconductor inspection
equipment and home appliances are also likely to expand in Asia. Based on these projections, we forecast ¥102.0 billion in EMC net sales, which will be a decrease of 2.3% year on year. Given our expectations for higher overseas sales and internal sales, we forecast EMC operating income of 12.5 billion, essentially level at 0.2% above fiscal 2017 results.
*Comparisons to fiscal 2017 figures are calculated on revised business classifications for fiscal 2017 actuals (¥104.4 billion in net sales, ¥12.5 billion in operating income).

Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC)
Our forecast for AEC sales in Japan calls for lower fiscal 2018 sales versus fiscal 2017, mainly due to projected decreases in Japanese automobile production volume. Overseas, expectations are for level year-on-year auto production in the Americas and North America. However, vehicle model changes will result in the termination of models using OMRON products, driving sales down compared to fiscal 2017. We forecast higher sales in Asia, where strong auto production should
bolster our performance. Given these assumptions and the likely negative impact of foreign exchange, we expect AEC sales to underperform fiscal 2017. Accordingly, our forecast for AEC fiscal 2018 net sales is ¥128.0 billion (2.4% decrease). In contrast, we forecast productivity improvements and other factors to generate a 3.2% rise in operating income, reaching ¥6.0 billion.
Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB)
In the SSB segment, we project higher Public Transportation Business sales, mainly due to firm replacement demand. Our Traffic and Road Management Systems Business should likewise see
Healthcare Business (HCB)
We forecast higher fiscal 2018 net sales in the HCB segment. An increase in individuals suffering from lifestyle diseases associated with Japan’s aging society, as well as greater overall interest in health, should drive firm demand, mainly via online channels. Overseas, economic growth should spur lifestyle changes and an
Other Businesses
We forecast higher fiscal 2018 sales in our Environmental Solutions Business, driven by growth in the storage battery market and recovery in the solar power market. Electric Systems and Equipment Business sales should likewise grow, benefiting from the expansion of our uninterruptible power supply line. Our Backlights Business, on the other hand, is likely to see largely decreasing sales due to the effects of business optimization. The combination of these factors
firm demand resulting from ongoing needs for security and safety. Given these assumptions, we forecast SSB fiscal 2018 net sales of ¥67.0 billion (5.2% increase) and operating income of ¥4.5 billion (9.5% increase).
increase in interest in health, while the emerging economies of the world, particularly in Asia, should see higher demand for health-related products. Based on these projections, we forecast HCB fiscal 2018 net sales of ¥119.0 billion (9.7% increase) and operating income of ¥12.5 billion (11.5% increase).
lead use to forecast Other Businesses segment net sales of ¥50.5 billion (0.9% year-on-year decrease). We expect to break even in terms of operating income.
*Comparisons to fiscal 2017 figures are calculated on revised business classifications for fiscal 2017 actuals (¥51.0 billion in net sales, ¥500.0 million in operating loss).

From the Editor-In-Chief
 Integrated Report 2018 marks the
seventh integrated report published
by the OMRON Group. We believe
this report represents an important opportunity to deepen engagement with our stakeholders. Accordingly, we have endeavored to make this report a logical story that encompasses the results of our initiatives to improve corporate value during the course of the year. Our story tells how OMRON has created value to date, how we intend to continue to create value in the future, and why we think this is possible. We hope that communicating the commitment of OMRON management to sustainable corporate growth over
the medium and long term encourages greater engagement with our stakeholders.
The theme of this year’s report is Accelerating the Creation of Innovation Driven by Social Needs. What do we mean by Innovation Driven by Social Needs? We mean taking up the challenge to lead the world in solving social issues through groundbreaking innovative value. This stance has been part of the OMRON DNA since our founding, and it continues to live on in the OMRON Principles. In
this year’s report, we make the case that it is our initiatives to create innovation
driven by social needs that are the very source of our value creation. We have also gone to great lengths to show how sustainability initiatives are tied to the efforts of OMRON business segments to create innovation, and how the functional divisions and departments supports the OMRON business with these initiatives.
Integrated Report 2018 was edited by
a team of individuals selected from
our Global Investor Relations & Brand Communications HQ and Sustainability Office. We also owe a word of thanks to others within and outside of OMRON who provided their valuable input.This entire process proved to be an opportunity for seeing OMRON strengths and issues from new perspectives. Our report production team will continue to work hard on future integrated reports, just as they look forward to further opportunities to interact with you, our important stakeholders. We hope you take the chance to share your opinions about Integrated Report 2018 with us.

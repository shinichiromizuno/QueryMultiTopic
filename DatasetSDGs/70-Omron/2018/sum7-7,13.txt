 Introducing OMRON Carbon Zero*1
We believe that building an environment for a sustainable society is part of improving lives and contributing to a better society, as stated in the OMRON Principles. In support of this ideal, we pursue initiatives under our Green OMRON 2020 environmental vision.
In July 2018, we set new environmental targets under OMRON Carbon Zero, aligned with the recent Paris Agreement and the SDGs. Our target is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2*2 greenhouse gas emissions to zero by fiscal 2050. Our interim goal is to reduce emissions 32 percent (vs. Fiscal 2016) by fiscal 2030. Backcasting from these targets, we have
set a fiscal 2020 goal to reduce emissions by four percent. We are even starting to consider reducing Scope 3*3 gas emissions in the near future. OMRON has announced that it will set its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target based on scientific grounds for the SBTi*4.
We has built a global framework to achieve our environmental targets, and we are adopting energy conservation and renewable energy practices across our organization. At the same time, we are moving forward with projects that use the expertise developed in our renewable energy businesses in our own company.
*1 OMRON Carbon Zero: a term used to gain recognition for OMRON’s efforts for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
*2 Scope 1 and Scope 2: Direct greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fuels at our company (Scope 1) and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from the use of electricity and heat purchased by our company (Scope 2).
*3 Scope 3: Greenhouse gases emissions from our company’s value chain.
*4 SBTi: Science Based Targets Initiative. International initiative recommending science-based medium- and long-term targets to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.

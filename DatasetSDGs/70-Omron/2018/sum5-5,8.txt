Case StudyTOGA and Engagement Surveys for Sustainable Growth
OMRON seeks leaders who can drive innovation and talented employees to solve social issues through our businesses. Launched in 2012, the Omron Global Awards (TOGA) is an annual global employee- participation awards presentation. TOGA is an important part of how ORMON builds a culture motivated to put the OMRON Principles into practice through their work. In 2016, we introduced the VOICE engagement survey (VG OMRON Interactive Communication with Employees). This voice-interactive survey for employees dealing with social issues encourages frank feedback by which management uncovers and addresses issues in our business. These two initiatives are critical parts of sustainable growth for our people and our organization.
TOGA Evolution and
Advancement
TOGA is becoming a more important part of our global organization with every year. We saw record participation in fiscal 2017 with more than 50,000 employees. At first, many entries dealt with the employee spirit of challenge. Today, we see more initiatives that address solving social issues. We are also seeing more projects that span national, regional, and business borders, as well as examples of solving social issues through innovative partnerships with customers, government institutions and others.

 Engagement Surveys to Identify and Address Issues
Based on survey results from the prior year, we explored a number of different work styles (teleworking, etc.) and self-development programs in Japan during fiscal 2017. Overseas, we stepped up our talent search and human resources training. We discussed our fiscal 2017 results in the Executive Council, identifying five important issues and launching specific programs in response. These issues include decision-making speed and encouraging our younger employees to be more proactive. As an example, we are moving and evaluating human resources development functions traditionally performed in Japan overseas to increase the speed of decision-making at our operations around the world. Our head office in Europe is taking the lead in standardizing processes overseas, aimed at the future global integration of accounting and finance operations.

 Message from the CEO
OMRON is solving social issues through
our businesses, creating innovation through technological evolution.
Since our very beginning, our corporate principles have been the cornerstone upon which we continue to build sustainable businesses.
We still aspire to the words of our founder, when he said,“We will contribute to global society through our business.”These words have been the underpinnings of our strong management foundation, inspiring us to build bigger and better.
Looking at the world of today, we see familiar social issues that have only become more grave over time. Labor shortages, rising payroll costs, more people suffering from advanced age-induced lifestyle diseases. We have built our reputation upon on successfully solving these issues through our businesses. This is why we see these changes as a major business opportunity. Our initiatives in solving these issues ties neatly together with contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.
Our new medium-term management plan outlines our strategy for sustainable growth. We will be bold in pursuing new technological innovations. And we will use these technologies as drivers of our business to solve social issues. These technologies will drive steady, sustainable growth in our businesses and in our corporate value.

  EARTH-1 STAGE Review (Fiscal Years 2014-2016)
■ Basic Strategy Successes and Issues
EARTH-1 STAGE represents the second medium- term management plan under our long-term vision, VG2020. Under this plan, we pursued three basic strategies*1 under an overall policy of establishing a structure for self-driven growth. Our top priority under this plan was to maximize growth in our IA-related businesses*2. The Industrial Automation Business (IAB) is the driving force within the IA- related businesses. Here, our investments beginning with GLOBE STAGE (the first medium- term plan) and new strategies under EARTH-1 STAGE have succeeded in generating steady growth for the segment. Specifically, fiscal 2016 sales for the IAB amounted to ¥331 billion, a 13% increase compared to fiscal 2013. This result even outperformed our EARTH-1 STAGE goal of ¥325 billion. This result was entirely due to new innovations and our focus on four industries*3 we believe will contribute to future societal development. In our Industrial Automation
Business, we have created a strong foundation that will serve to propel growth under our next medium-term management plan.
At the same time, we expected our Backlights Business and Environmental Solutions Business to be two sources of new business opportunities. Sales in these businesses declined due to dramatic changes in the market. The impact of the downturn in these businesses prevented us from achieving the six goals outlined under EARTH-1 STAGE. We intend to roll the successes and issues from our EARTH-1 STAGE basic strategies forward in the strategies of our next medium-term management plan.
*1 Existing Businesses Strategy (Maximization of IA-related businesses), Super-Global Growth Strategy, and New Business Strategy for the Optimization Society
*2 IA-related businesses: Extends to both the Industrial Automation Business and the Electronic and Mechanical Components Business
*3 Four focus industries: Automobiles, digital, food & beverages, and social infrastructure
■ Profitability Improvement under ROIC Management
I am happy to say that we have made steady advancements in our ROIC management. OMRON management is focused on portfolio management, continuing our transition to a business structure that generates both growth and profit. As an example, our Industrial Automation Business acquired a robot
manufacturer and a motion controller manufacturer in the U.S. during fiscal 2015. On the other hand, we sold off our oil and gas business in the U.S. during fiscal 2016. Our Healthcare Business acquired a Brazilian nebulizer maker during fiscal 2014, further strengthening

    the footing of our business. In contrast, we sold our hospital-use medical equipment business in Japan. By seizing the opportunity to add or replace businesses, even in our industrial automation and healthcare growth segments, we are building a stronger foundation for growth and improving our profit structure.
One of our key indicators is gross profit margin. Here, we posted a record-high 39.3% for fiscal 2016. This is the equivalent of a 40.7% gross profit margin if we use the fiscal 2013 foreign exchange rate with which we set our EARTH-1 STAGE goals. Not only does this exceed our EARTH-1 STAGE goal of 40%, it also happens to be among the highest gross profit margins in the Japanese electronics industry.
We believe our advancements in ROIC management is largely responsible for this result. Beyond portfolio management, we can also point to thorough company-wide practice of our Down-Top ROIC Tree concept. This concept links ROIC goals down to the very front lines of our business. We are improving our profitability surely and steadily through these types of ongoing internal efforts.
And, we intend to further develop our portfolio management and Down-Top ROIC Tree management, advancing ROIC management for greater earning power at OMRON.

■ Greater Growth Opportunities through Technological Innovation
                          We have worked hard over many years to create innovations through our unique Sensing & Control + THINK core technologies that solve customer issues. More recently, we have taken on the challenge to create products and services with even higher added value as we make advances in IT-compatible factory automation equipment and other areas. Meanwhile, we look outside our environment seeing familiar social issues becoming even more severe. Labor shortages, a rapidly aging population, frequent motor vehicle accidents and congestion, climate change, and so many more. Further, new technologies (Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT)*4 robotics, etc.) have
developed with much greater speed than we could have imagined when we started our VG2020 plan. We see these changes as a favorable development for our businesses. Riding the wave of new technological innovation to lead the world in solving social issues is not only in line with the OMRON Principles and our mission (i.e. To improve lives and contribute to a better society), it is also an incredible business opportunity. We intend to seize the opportunities in these global changes, using technology to drive dramatic growth. To this end, we formulated VG2.0, a new four-year medium-term management plan.

 ■ Three Basic Strategies
VG2.0 is built on three basic strategies. The first is to redefine our focus domains and maximize the strengths of our businesses. We have defined four businesses that both reflect our strengths and represent potentially large growing markets through which we can solve social issues: Factory Automation, Healthcare, Mobility, and Energy Management. Under VG2.0, we will focus mainly on Factory Automation and Healthcare as two sectors in which we can leverage our strengths with the most effectiveness.
The second basic strategy is to evolve our business model. Our plan is to deliver total solutions that solve customer issues. Rather than develop stand-alone products and services, we will provide applications based on new, integrated technologies, incorporating AI, IoT, and more.
The third basic strategy is to reinforce our core technologies. As discussed above, VG2.0 is our strategy to generate innovation based on technology. For example, we will continue to clearly identify and develop cross-organizational core technologies (AI, image processing / recognition,
etc.) and other core technologies unique to each particular business.
Open innovation will play a critical role in propelling these three basic strategies forward. We intend to work closely with customers, companies in other industries, universities, research institutes, and others to drive technological innovation.

    ■ Annualized Growth of 10% in Factory Automation and Healthcare Businesses
By segment, we intend to make a leap forward in growth in our Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business.
Through our innovative-Automation Manufacturing concept, the Industrial Automation Business will deliver a stream of products with new value to our customers. OMRON is unique as a manufacturer of entire product lines across all categories of manufacturing controls. We see this as our greatest strength. By capturing detailed interactions among our devices, we make the difficult task of controlling complex, advanced movements a simple matter. For example, equipment adjustments that used to take an experienced engineer more than a month to complete can now be performed in just a few days. We can also automate processes that used
to rely heavily on human labor due to the difficulty in automation. In the future, we will be able to use Internet-connected products, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, and controllers outfitted with AI to capture all data from the manufacturing line. This will allow manufacturers to predict and prevent equipment trouble to a degree never possible before. In April, we announced our acquisition of industrial camera maker, Sentech. Here, we bolstered our already strong and diverse product lines, establishing a competitive advantage through total solutions. Our sales target for fiscal 2020 is ¥480 billion, or 10% annual growth. innovative-Automation will serve as a base for business expansion as we raise the Industrial Automation Business share of total sales from 40% to 50%.
10 OMRON Corporation

     In our Healthcare Business, we plan to promote Zero Events , an initiative to use blood pressure monitors to help eliminate life- threatening seizures. Critical to this initiative will be creating a new mainstay business that combines the world’s first wearable blood pressure monitor and a data management service connected to a medical clinic. We also plan to expand and strengthen our sales channels in the emerging economies. We will establish an even stronger competitive
advantage beyond the 50% global market share we hold for blood pressure monitor today. Aiming to be the undisputed leader in market share, our Healthcare Business will grow an annual 10% through these initiatives and more, including products offering new concepts in respiratory diseases and pain management.

 ■ Investment Discipline Backed by ROIC Management
Under VG2.0, we have set six new management indicators as targets for revenue and profit growth. Our target for net sales is ¥1 trillion for fiscal 2020. Looking beyond 2020, we plan to make well-analyzed investments critical for
future growth. More specifically, we intend to increase M&A investments and R&D expenditures to bolster core technologies, mainly to grow our Industrial Automation Business and Healthcare Business. At the same
Integrated Report 2017 11

   time, we will use the Down-Top ROIC Tree approach, as well as portfolio management and other deeply rooted ROIC management principles to generate operating income of ¥100 billion. We will also work to control selling, general and administrative expenses as a ratio of net sales.
Continuing to improve gross profit margin represents another major part of VG2.0, which sets a target of 41% or greater. This gain in profit will be used as a resource for investment and even greater profit gains. As a company focused on investing in our future, an ideal level of ROIC and ROE for our company would be between 10% and 15%. Under VG2.0, we have set targets for both at 10% as the minimum
level to see us through an unpredictable and changing business environment.

       ■ Sustainable Increase in Shareholder Value through Medium- and Long-Term Corporate Growth
Our profit distribution policy remains unchanged. Our first priority is on investment for future growth. Our second priority is dividends, and our third priority is stock buybacks. As always, we prioritize investment for growth to improve profits, using these profits as resources for sustainable increase in shareholder value. We intend to secure stable dividend distributions, aiming for an annual dividend payout ratio of approximately 30% and DOE of 3%. Over the long term, we will take opportunities to use reserves for stock buybacks as they arise. Over the six years since taking over as CEO (2011 to 2016), OMRON’s total shareholder return (TSR) (annualized) has been 15%, greater than the
TOPIX average of 12% for the same period. Our total return ratio for the most recent three-year period is 48%. VG2.0 was planed with a keen awareness of capital efficiency and shareholder returns. We will continue to operate our business with our shareholders in mind, as we always have in the past.

We will perform this survey annually, incorporating the results into our management and human resources strategy to create a more satisfying work environment for our employees. We must also engage in other initiatives, including reinforcing our supply chain management and socially sustainable manufacturing practices that reduce our carbon footprint. We incorporated these matters into our VG2.0 strategy. We also included other structural matters related to sustainability, such as governance and risk management, which will lead to greater trust in our management foundation.
We see a variety of risks in this era of rapid and dramatic change. In terms of protecting ourselves from political risks or natural disasters, we pursue a course of integrated risk management, practicing the PDCA cycle. To respond to changes in our operating environment, we have developed a number of
We then identify operational and structural issues important as above and social issues we can solve through our businesses to be addressed as our sustainability issues. We have linked these issues with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Each sustainability issue has corresponding non-financial goals.

VG2.0: New Medium-Term Management Plan Management Issues
VG2.0 is the final four-year business plan under our VG2020 long-term management strategy, which we started in 2011. VG2.0 is also our growth strategy in anticipation of the social changes beyond that timeframe. We are looking at the trends, the business environment, and social changes over the next 10 years in light of our SINIC predictive theory*1 and Sustainable Development Goals*2. Here, we set the four focus domains since we expect to see social needs emerging in these domains most. New technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics are evolving at a rate and scope beyond anything we could have imagined. These technologies dovetail with the evolution of our own core Sensing & Control + THINK technologies. We are redesigning our business models as we work to solve social issues through technological innovation.

         In April 2016, OMRON began strategic planning for VG2.0. The following August, executive officers discussed intensively about the plan at an Executive Council meeting chaired by the CEO. After reviewing our results so far under EARTH-1 STAGE, we identified ongoing issues to address in VG2.0. We also forecasted likely changes over the next 10 years, identifying our strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we discussed our objectives and what we hoped to achieve. After discussions in subsequent board of director meetings, each individual business unit and functional division department were tasked to propose specific
strategies, which were communicated down to every work location. In this way, the planning process was not a one-sided management affair. Many different departments and employees also participated.
Prior to launching the plan, our CEO and other top managers explained the plan to OMRON employees, sharing strategies company-wide to promote better understanding of and motivation for VG2.0. We will continue to promote the objective and progress through internal communication.

Note: Figures represent results as of April 20.
  FY 11 12 13 14 15 16 20(Target)
Our human resources strategy is one of the important policies in VG.2.0. We believe that it is best to entrust the management of our overseas business units to local managers. We have endeavored to localize key positions in our overseas operations. Our fiscal 2020 goal is to have local managerial talent fill 66% of key managerial positions, and we are advancing the training and promotion of local management talent.

 Achieving Zero Incidents of Severe Asthma
The number of people suffering from asthma around the world continues to rise. At the same time, many people are unaware of nebulizer therapy, especially among the emerging economies. OMRON is working with medical institutions and drug companies to increase the
number of hospitals equipped with nebulizer treatment rooms and pharmacies that carry these devices. We are contributing to early treatment and the prevention of severe asthma by making more patients aware of treating asthma correctly through treatment devices.
     Asthma Wheeze Monitors
Research suggests that 80% of asthma patients suffer their first attack before the age of five. However, families are not readily equipped to assess their child’s symptoms. Delays prevent the child from receiving proper treatment in the early stages, resulting in a more severe case of asthma. Severe asthma can be prevented by providing patients with medication before they suffer a major attack.
OMRON is now developing monitors that can measure, record, and manage the type of wheezing that signals an impending asthmatic attack. Through collaborative research with medical institutions, we are building algorithms into our devices that can tell the difference between different types of wheezing. These monitors will allow families to prevent asthmatic attacks at home. At the same time, asthma patients will have better access to appropriate treatment as doctors will be able to diagnose
symptoms more accurately.
Through greater use of nebulizers and asthma
wheeze monitors, OMRON aspires to prevent severe juvenile asthma, reaching the ultimate goal of eliminating severe asthma altogether.

OMRON will strive to provide the world with products and systems for a mobility society in which people around the world can live in a safe, secure, comfortable, and clean environment.
Social Issues
Increase in accidents involving senior citizens among advanced countries; more accidents, congestion, and environmental burden in emerging economies
 Cars have made our lives more convenient. At the same time, however, we seem to find more and greater issues in mobility society every year. For example, advanced countries are experiencing an increase in the number of accidents caused by senior drivers (mistaking the accelerator for the brake; wrong-way driving on freeways, etc.) And it’s not just senior drivers; as many as 80% of automobile accidents are caused by human error. Clearly, something must be done. As emerging economies rapidly become motorized, accidents and congestion multiply. Automobile emissions place a heavier burden on the environment.
To solve these problems, auto makers and others are working on automated driving and eco cars. These companies are engaged in improving road traffic and social infrastructure to realize the goal of a safer, more eco-friendly

Safe and secure urban development
To solve the problems of mobility society, we must deal with cars, people, and traffic.
In 2016, we developed the world’s first on- board sensor featuring driver sensing technology, which senses a driver’s condition in
society. At OMRON, we are solving these problems through technology and innovations based on our years of experience in developing automotive components and traffic and road management systems.

real time. This technology prevents accidents caused by drivers who are not in a condition to continue driving. Developments here promise to assist safe driving, eventually leading to automated driving.
       
  One of our strengths is in technologies and products that provide optimal control of the flow of cars, traffic, and people. For example, our traffic and road management systems incorporate traffic sensing and automotive sensors that sense people and cars. This sensing and control coordinates traffic and roads, resulting in a safer, more comfortable mobility society. We can help alleviate traffic congestion by sensing car behavior and optimizing road and traffic control according to
the conditions detected.
OMRON is also deeply engaged in developing
automotive electronic products to reducing CO2 emissions and environmental load. These products help us fulfill our goal of creating a sustainable, eco-friendly society.
We aim to assist in the advancement of mobility society and preserve the global environment at the same time through our products and services.

   Energy Management
The Energy Management domain addresses a market that aims to create a world in which people can live comfortably through increased use of renewable energy in response to climate change caused by rising levels of CO2 emissions. The business segment in this domain is Environmental Solutions Business under the Other Businesses.
At OMRON, we contribute to a cleaner global environment by providing PV inverters for solar energy systems that create renewable energy. We also provide electricity storage systems that make effective use of energy.
Social Issues
Acceleration of global warming due to increasing CO2 levels
Global warming is a global environmental issue caused by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. Scientists predict an increase in unusual weather patterns and a rise in sea level as our atmosphere heats up. These changes will bring environmental destruction and economic losses on a global scale. While ever-increasing industrial activity may enrich people’s lives, it is also damaging the global environment.
In response to these issues, Japan submitted a draft resolution to the United Nations in 2015. This resolution targets a 26% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. The Japanese government announced the need for a 40% reduction in residential and business emissions to reach this goal. Worldwide, policies have been proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with COP21*1.
In response to these initiatives, OMRON will

Automation Tailored to Individual Needs
 Differences in the physical abilities and skills of each worker, as well as the particular demands of each job, call for a variety of innovations. For example, workers who have the use of only one hand work on the socket production line. Normally, workers produce one product at a time. On this line, however, the production process is broken down into several steps. For example, a worker who has the use of only their right hand does that part of the job requiring a right hand and vice-verse. This way, individuals with disabilities can work on a production line without any loss of productivity. The factory also

uses jigs, tools, assistive devices, and semi- automated machines according to the characteristics of each worker’s disability. All workshops within the factory have been tailor- made by technicians who themselves have disabilities. Over the past 30 years, nearly 380 jigs and tools have been developed. The expertise gained from developing these devices has been systemized at the Keihanna Technology Innovation Center. Such knowledge is used to develop new technologies and designs that create harmony between humans and machines.

  Unique Approaches to Skills Development and Production Capacity Enhancement
 In addition to developing assistive tools using jigs and fixtures, OMRON Kyoto Taiyo improves production capacity by developing individuals’ skills in a unique way to work more efficiently. Their skills development initiatives start by measuring each worker’s knowledge and abilities based on skills, accuracy, and work speed. This data is used to produce a human resources map. Next, managers sort out the abilities necessary for each production step,
■ Work Map
● Improved level of ability ● Necessary ability
resulting in a work map. Managers factor in the degree of each worker’s disability and skill to match personnel to suitable tasks. Where it is simply impossible to compensate for the disability of a worker, the factory brings in tools to eliminate the need for skills in the production step. These initiatives expand to the employment potential of individuals with severe disabilities, while still making gains in productivity.

 A Barrier-Free Workplace for All Workers
 OMRON Kyoto Taiyo has introduced innovations that allow any worker to perform the 3S essential basics in the factory: Sort, Set in Order, and Shine. For instance, sloped shelves make it impossible for workers to leave unnecessary objects on the shelf carelessly. A simple twist to the spines of files make it possible for anyone to organize them easily. The factory also has a firm rule that the name of the worker and the time of return for any borrowed piece of equipment be written on a whiteboard. In this way, the borrower and availability of the equipment are
identified. Every year, workers are divided into teams to compete for the best improvement initiatives (kaizen). Best practices are shared through a factory newsletter and an annual presentation. Factory managers realize that each disability has its own unique nature. Managers strive to make the best use of an individual’s abilities, while providing support and developing original, creative solutions. The OMRON Kyoto Taiyo factory is truly a model of making the best use of diversity.

ROIC Management
OMRON has selected ROIC as a key performance indicator for our business. We stress ROIC management throughout our organization to encourage further improvement. Our new VG2.0 medium-term management plan emphasizes ROIC management, which we will use to reach a new level of growth.
 Why ROIC?
OMRON encompasses a number of business divisions with varied characteristics. We believe ROIC is an excellent measure for assessing business performance fairly for each business. Using operating income or operating income margin as an indicator doesn’t account for variances due to the nature or scope of a business. ROIC, on the other hand, measures return on invested capital, providing a fair assessment. Under VG2.0, we have defined four focus domains. ROIC is an indispensable tool as we continue to grow our unique business portfolio.
Down-Top ROIC Tree
Down-Top ROIC Tree breaks ROIC into key performance indicators for each department, allowing us to improve ROIC at the most basic operating level. Using simple ROS or invested capital turnover as ROIC indicators are ineffective, since they do not relate directly to front-line operations. On-site managers would have trouble thinking of ways to improve ROIC using these indicators. However, we can break ROIC down into automation / head count reduction or facilities turnover as KPIs of manufacturing departments. With these indicators, managers can finally see how their goals tie directly to ROIC improvement initiatives. At OMRON, one of our greatest strengths is our unified approach to improving ROIC from the ground level up.
More specifically, ROIC management consists of Down-Top ROIC Tree and Portfolio Management.

Embracing ROIC Management
To promote ROIC management more widely, we introduced ROIC Management 2.0 in 2015. ROIC Management 2.0 incorporates a qualitative interpretation of ROIC. The interpreted formula tells us to add needed management resources (N) and generate greater levels of value to our customers (V), while reducing loss-making management resources (L). Using this simple interpreted formula, our employees in charge of sales or development functions who may be unfamiliar with financial statement concepts are able to envision ROIC improvement measures in their day-to-day work.

 Human Resources Strategy
Accelerating the growth of our people and our organization to drive VG2.0 forward
 Three Key Global Initiatives
The goal of our human resources strategy under VG2.0 is to create a strong company where people grow, enjoy their work, and keep improving performance. We have established three initiatives to accomplish this goal.
The first is to foster leaders.
We included this initiative when we first launched VG2020. To achieve VG2.0 and sustainable growth in the future, we must do even more to accelerate the training of leaders who will drive management and business. In particular, we must focus on leadership overseas, raising the ratio of local employees in key positions from the current one-half to two-thirds within four years.
The second initiative is the hiring, training, and effective utilization of a diverse employee base.
This is a new initiative under VG2.0. We want to generate a new chemical reaction by linking the talents of those employees who have brought us to where we are and those employees necessary for
for creating innovation. We must hire and train employees who have the skills and unique experiences to help us achieve this goal. By encouraging the growth and performance of individuals with unique characteristics, we can maximize the potential of a diverse workforce and provide an environment and systems for maximum performance.
The third initiative is to foster self-motivated employees.
The OMRON Group human resources development policy is to give opportunities to those who are ambitious and who are well prepared. We encourage and support those who take the challenge to generate greater growth. We plan to offer more programs to improve capabilities and skills, providing more support for new career choices that allow individuals to express their talents and strengths. We will also implement a ground-up review of the programs

 Health Management and Other Specific Action Plans
 We intend to execute a number of specific action plans for these three initiatives. Here, we will discuss several of these action plans in detail.
The first deals with fostering leaders. When we began in fiscal 2011, only one-third of our key positions overseas were held by local employees. Today, that ratio is 49 percent. In Asia, in particular, we started a talent management system during fiscal 2014 to find and train future leaders. As a result, the number of individuals capable of serving in key positions has increased steadily. We are adopting similar systems in North America and other regions, promoting talented individuals.
The next deals with redesigning work styles to encourage innovation. For example, we plan to offer a wider variety of work arrangements, providing an improved communications and collaboration infrastructure, as well as more choices in work
locations, work schedules, and work styles. We believe flexible work arrangements will motivate employees to greater productivity, attract a more diverse workforce, and result in even more chemical reactions.
We further believe that diversity and inclusion lead to innovation, and are a critical element to our future competitiveness. For Japan, in particular, we have set goals to address the important issue of promoting career advancement for women. As of fiscal 2016, we achieved our goal of having a 3.3 percent ratio of women in managerial roles. Our goal is to raise this ratio to 5 percent by the end of fiscal 2018, and to 8 percent by the end of fiscal 2020. Further, we will provide more opportunities for persons with disabilities to take an active part globally.
The foundation of our entire human resources
    Integrated Report 2017 53
                Vision Overview Strategy Governance Financial Information

strategy is that every employee is able to be healthy and display their talents. Accordingly, we will promote health management throughout our entire company. In July, we made a declaration of health management, identifying five indicators we believe will result in better employee focus: Exercise, sleep, mental health, diet and smoking. This program represents what a company such as OMRON should be. We plan to address these five indicators throughout the year, encouraging greater physical and mental health in our employees and creating a more happy workplace. Using the expertise regarding high blood pressure developed within our Healthcare Business, we aim to implement full blood pressure management among all employees, taking yet another active role in helping promote employee health.
During fiscal 2012, we launched a very important initiative for the OMRON Group, which we still carry out today. We have challenged ourselves to practice the OMRON Principles through our businesses. One key initiative to
share the OMRON Principles among our employees worldwide is the OMRON Global Awards, or TOGA. Fiscal 2017 will be the sixth year of our TOGA program. We plan to improve and expand TOGA, promoting the shared belief in our principles and self-directed action.
Last, we began conducting an engagement survey in fiscal 2016 to ensure progress toward our human resources strategy. This survey serves as the starting point for a cycle that includes action plan execution, evaluation of results, analysis of issues, and improvements.
We intend to continue with this survey as a means to improve our initiatives. We aspire to be a company in which a diverse employee base feels comfortable exchanging opinions, having fun, and creating innovations. By attracting and connecting unique individuals from outside our company, we will accelerate diversity and innovation, building an attractive company that fosters this kind of chain reactions.
  OMRON Health Management Declaration
OMRON aims to be a pioneer in creating social needs, and the health of our employees is accordingly fundamental to our business. We OMRON Group will unite to do our utmost to create positive working environments full of smiles and vitality so all of our
people can innovate to solve various social issues.

  Building a Stronger Business through Diversity Solving Women’s Health Issues from the Perspective of Women
The passing of the Equal Opportunity Employment Law in Japan 30 years ago marked the beginning of major changes in the lives of women. At the same time, women gained new life choices related to marriage, birth, and more. A decrease in the number of births per person and changes in lifestyles have corresponded to an increase in dysmenorrhea, uterine disease, and other female- specific health issues, which are said to cost ¥6 trillion annually in lost labor productivity.
 In response to these developments, OMRON Healthcare launched the OMRON Style Beauty Project in 2010. The objective of this project is to balance beauty and health in equal proportions, making a serious effort to create products and services that address female-specific health issues. OMRON Healthcare has developed products in painstaking detail from a number of potential-use cases. In addition, the company has sponsored seminars and other programs to educate both men and women about female- specific health issues.
 As a result of these initiatives, OMRON brand recognition rose from 50% in fiscal 2014 to 54% in fiscal 2016, while favorability ratings rose from 30%

The company is also creating a corporate culture in which male employees learn more about female-specific health issues, fostering a greater cooperative environment. Moving forward, we will work with even greater urgency to incorporate the female perspective in our approach, tackling new health issues head on.

 Message from the Chairman
Our Commitment to Corporate Governance for Sustainable Growth and Greater Corporate Value
To improve lives and contribute to a better society
In 1959, the year that this corporate motto was created by our founder, OMRON net sales were a mere ¥400 million. Since that time, we have been growing our business, introducing numerous world- and Japan-first innovations driven by social needs. To contribute to society through our OMRON Principles, we must evolve our corporate governance as a framework for supporting bold decisions and answering the expectations of our stakeholders. Further, we must do so in an environment that changes rapidly and dramatically.
In our efforts for sustainable corporate value
growth, we recently did away with all director titles, except for the title of board chair, who leads the board of directors. The president (who is also our chief executive officer) is now positioned as an executive officer. With this change, we have further separated the roles of oversight and business execution, strengthening our supervisory function. Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of our board of directors, during fiscal 2016 we expanded discussions regarding medium- and long-term management strategy. More specifically, we discussed and approved initiatives and goals under our VG2.0 medium-term management plan, which we launched in April 2017. At the same time, we
56 OMRON Corporation

  revised the compensation structure for directors and executive officers to achieve these goals. We have tied the achievement of VG2.0 financial goals and the non-financial factors of sustainability to medium- term performance-based compensation pay for our directors and officers. In this way, compensation is linked to long-term corporate value.
Fiscal 2017 will be the first year of our VG2.0 plan. We have welcomed new members to our board of directors, and expect to benefit from a stronger supervisory function based on the strengths and expertise that these new members bring. In addition to reviewing specific progress in VG2.0, the board will discuss important management issues related to sustainability, including strategies for technology and human resources. We will strive to be even more effective as a board of directors for OMRON Corporation.
In September 2015, the United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Goals, reflecting common global social issues to be resolved by the year 2030. The Paris Agreement establishing new international
rules to counter global warming came into force in November 2016. In these and other ways, the world is demanding sustainability on a global scale. Today, growing corporate value requires an aggressive and dynamic response to sustainability-related issues in our environment and society. OMRON has defined a Sustainability Policy and built a framework and a system by which we put these policies into practice. As the Board of Directors, we will exercise governance to ensure business activities under VG2.0 raise OMRON corporate value and answer the needs of international society.
We will continue to practice the OMRON Principles as they guide us toward sustainable corporate value growth and social development from a global perspective.

  Corporate Governance Framework
OMRON has elected to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board. 
The OMRON Board of Directors is made up of eight members to ensure substantive discussion and deliberation about important corporate matters. OMRON has separated the management oversight and business execution functions within the Company, creating a system whereby the majority of Board directors are not engaged directly in business operations. We have also adopted a policy setting the ratio of outside directors to at least one third of the total number of directors on the Board.
To increase objectivity on behalf of the Board of Directors, the titles and roles of Chairman of the Board and President (CEO) are separated. The Chairman serves as chair of the Board of Directors,
without direct corporate representational authority.
OMRON has established several advisory committees to assist the Board of Directors. These committees include the Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection Advisory Committee, the Compensation Advisory Committee, and the Corporate Governance Committee. The Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection Advisory Committee, and the Compensation Advisory Committee are all chaired by outside directors, with at least half of the committee members being outside directors.

another layer of transparency and objectivity onto its decision-making process.
In these policies, we have created a hybrid governance framework, combining the best features of a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Board and a Company with a Nominating Committee.
More Effective Oversight
In 1999, OMRON adopted the executive officer system of management. Since that time, we have endeavored to separate the roles of oversight and business execution, setting up advisory committees, separating the role of chairman of the Board and that of president, and ensuring that a majority of the Board consists of non-executive directors. In this way, we have improved the supervisory functions of the board of directors.
Beginning fiscal 2017, no OMRON director has a specific title, with the exception of the chairman of the Board. We believe this measure will help improve the oversight function of the Board of Directors. As the awareness of oversight becomes stronger among directors, the functions of the Board of Directors will

become more effective.
At the same time, the president, who is the
chief executive officer, is now elected from among the executive officers in order to establish an optimum and flexible execution system. With the president now an executive officer, we are able to select the president via Board resolution in conformity with the fiscal business year. We believe naming the president at the beginning of the fiscal year will aid in creating a more optimum and flexible system of business execution.
This is one more way in which OMRON strives for sustainable corporate value growth through a well-defined separation between oversight and execution, each side clearly aware of their responsibilities.

Fiscal 2016 Evaluation of the Effectiveness
The Corporate Governance Committee is the body responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors.
As with fiscal 2015, all directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members filled out self- evaluations anonymously. These evaluations served as the basis for the evaluation formula. Evaluations addressed Board deliberation styles and operating methods. Further, the Corporate Governance Committee evaluated the fiscal 2016 policy for the operation of the Board of

The Corporate Governance Committee concluded that there are no problems with the current governance system or operations. The committee further concluded that the Board is functioning appropriately, and confirmed the initiatives based on the fiscal 2016 policies for the operation of the Board of Directors. The committee also confirmed matters identified as future issues.

Directors and related specific initiatives. In addition, the Board chair and directors were interviewed individually to provide them with an opportunity to give their opinions on the effectiveness of our Board.
The Corporate Governance Committee analyzed these self-evaluations and interviews, reporting the results to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors then developed operating policies for fiscal 2017 based on these evaluation results.

   A Step Forward in Compensation Governance
- Toward Sustainable Corporate Value Growth-
 OMRON has been working to strengthen its corporate governance based on the OMRON Principles. In fiscal 2017, we revised our compensation structure for directors and executive officers, aiming to spur even greater corporate value growth. Chairman Fumio Tateishi and outside director Eizo Kobayashi, who served as chairman of the Compensation Advisory Committee until last year, discussed how this structure will accelerate sustained corporate value growth at OMRON.
   The Approach of OMRON Management and the Role of Compensation
 Tateishi Based on the OMRON Principles, our aim is to contribute to a better society by sustained enhancement of corporate value. To accomplish this, we develop our long-term vision every 10 years. We create a medium-term management plan that covers a span of three to four years, while we also create short-term plans for a single fiscal year. Of course, we must strengthen our corporate governance as we execute on this vision and these plans, continuing to raise corporate value. We consider compensation and appointment to be an
Evolution of Compensation
Kobayashi Even before I was named an outside director, I knew OMRON for its strong corporate governance. I became a director in fiscal 2013. From the start, I was truly surprised by the level of commitment to strengthening corporate governance.
important pillar supporting corporate governance. We have two goals we want to accomplish with compensation. The first is to motivate directors and executive officers practicing the OMRON Principles to boldly pursue our long-term vision. The second is to use the disclosure of compensation policy to demonstrate our commitment to raising sustainable corporate value. This is one way we help our stakeholders understand our philosophy and initiatives regarding management.
We deliberated compensation within the Compensation Advisory Committee, and in fiscal 2014 we decided to adopt a compensation structure that provided a stronger link between medium-term performance and compensation. Our objective here was to ensure that we

   Fumio Tateishi
Chairman

 accomplished our medium-term management plan.
Tateishi Specifically, we adopted medium-term performance-linked bonuses that varied according to the achievement level of the operating income target defined in our medium-term management plan. We also tied performance-linked stock acquisition rights according to the achievement level of the net sales target.
Kobayashi That’s correct. A number of companies have adopted some type of annual performance- based compensation using a variety of different performance indicators. However, I think we are one of the leaders in focusing more on medium- to long-term performance, linking pay to how well we meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders.
Tateishi This revised compensation structure resulted in an even higher motivation among directors and executive officers to engage with a focus on reaching our medium- to long-term goals.
Unfortunately, we were not able to accomplish our initial targets. We did, however, strengthen our
management in terms of medium- to long-term focus. I consider our M&A activities and growth investments to be cases in point.
Kobayashi Seeing what is discussed at the Board meetings, I am sure OMRON is shifting its management to a more medium- to long-term orientation.
The Compensation Advisory Committee conducted a review of the effectiveness of the compensation structure.
This was the second revision since fiscal 2014. The Compensation Advisory Committee paid particular attention to two factors: Whether the compensation system functioned as a motivation for directors and executive officers to improve sustained corporate value growth and whether the system was clear enough for our stakeholders to understand and see whether it was aligned with their expectations.
Tateishi Global technology innovation takes place at near blinding speed today. This innovation is changing our society in significant ways. How will we solve the social issues that these changes

bring? Today, it is more important than ever that we engage in opportunistic policies looking toward the society for the year 2030.
Our VG2.0 medium-term management plan, which we launched in fiscal 2017, provides specific
Highlights of the Fiscal 2017 Revision
Tateishi With this revision, the ratio of compensation for our CEO, for example, has been changed from 1:1:1 (base salary: short-term performance linked compensation : medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation) to 1:1:1.5. I think this change is truly groundbreaking. The higher the position in our company, the greater the responsibility for the medium and long term. By weighting the ratio toward medium- to long-term performance, we are making it clear what we expect of people in these positions. This is very significant for OMRON management.
Kobayashi In addition, the performance indicators tied to performance-linked compensation are very important. We have short-term and medium- to long-term performance-linked components. Of course, we must meet the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders every fiscal year. To do this, we will use an evaluation of ROIC (the fundamental measure of our management), operating income, and net income as the indicators
and actionable measures for accomplishing this task. I believe that the upgraded compensation structure will be a driving force to move VG2.0 forward.
for annual bonuses.
Another question is how to generate business
and management innovation. This includes new products and services based on new technologies, M&A, and more. We adopted net sales, EPS, and ROE as of fiscal 2020 for our medium- to long- term performance indicators. We believe these indicators will help us make steady progress in accomplishing VG2.0. Further, we adopted a performance-linked stock-based compensation system to encourage directors and executive officers to focus on sustainable corporate growth from the same perspective as our shareholders.
Tateishi With this recent revision, we added a sustainability evaluation* to the indicators we use for medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation. In the fall of 2015, the United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Goals. OMRON needs to accelerate our sustainability initiatives to contribute to society through our businesses.
       64 OMRON Corporation
“I believe that the upgraded compensation structure will be a driving force to move VG2.0 forward.”

   “It is important to meet the expectations of our stakeholders and to spur greater corporate
value growth.”
    Kobayashi With this revision, we spent quite a while discussing how to evaluate sustainability and which objective indicators we could use. We took great pains to determine objective measures that weren’t simply self-serving. Finally, we decided to refer to sustainability indicators obtained from a third-party organization for transparency and accountability.
Tateishi I believe OMRON has demonstrated to our stakeholders how serious we are about raising corporate value by solving social issues through our businesses, particularly given our adoption of a sustainability evaluation.
■ Overview of Revised Compensation Structure Fiscal 2014-
Kobayashi While single-year performance is important, it is even more important to meet the expectations of our stakeholders with our CEO, directors and executive officers keeping long-term corporate growth in mind. We believe this new compensation structure will be very effective in helping us achieve our VG2020 goals for the year 2020 and raise corporate value.

 Future Compensation Structure and Expectations
  Kobayashi A compensation structure must evolve in response to the times and business environment. As a Compensation Advisory Committee, we will continue to review and improve our compensation structure, ensuring that it functions as a motivation for strong decision-making by directors and executive officers and that it meets standards of transparency and accountability to our stakeholders.
Tateishi The goal of corporate governance is to enhance sustainable corporate value by achieving our long-term vision based on the OMRON Principles. When corporate governance (including compensation structure) functions as it should, directors and executive officers will embrace a medium- to long-term perspective, leading to faster execution of policies for creating value into the future. OMRON directors and executive officers will work as one united entity to achieve our long-term vision and raise our corporate value.
  New Compensation Policy for Directors
❶ Basic policy
・The Company shall provide compensation sufficient to recruit as directors exceptional people
who are capable of putting the OMRON Principles into practice.
・The compensation structure shall be sufficient to motivate directors to contribute to sustainable enhancement of corporate value.
・The compensation structure shall maintain a high level of transparency, fairness, and rationality to ensure accountability to shareholders and other stakeholders.
❷ Structure of compensation
・Compensation for directors shall consist of a base salary, which is fixed compensation, and
performance-linked compensation, which varies depending on the Company’s performance. ・Compensation for outside directors shall consist of a base salary only, reflecting their roles and
the need for maintaining independence.
❸ Base salary
・The amount of a base salary shall be determined by taking into account the salary levels of other
companies, as surveyed by a specialized outside organization.
❹ Performance-linked compensation
・As short-term performance-linked compensation, the Company shall provide bonuses linked to
yearly performance indicators, and to the degree of achievement of performance targets.
・As medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation, the Company shall grant stock compensation linked to the degree of achievement of the goals of the medium-term management plan, and to the improvement in corporate value (value of stock).
・The Company shall determine the target amounts for short-term performance-linked compensation and medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation based on the target pay mix specified according to each director’s role and responsibility.
❺ Compensation governance
・All compensation for directors shall be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors
reflecting the deliberations and recommendations of the Compensation Advisory Committee.
* A similar policy has been adopted for executive officers toward achieving medium- to long-term performance targets.

  Overview of New Compensation Structure (Directors, Executive Officers)
1)Ratio of compensation
Compensation consists of base salary (fixed compensation) and compensation according to Company performance, namely short-term performance-linked compensation and medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation.
The ratio of compensation consisting of performance-linked compensation compared to base salary has been determined for each role:
Base salary : Short-term : Medium- to long-term = 1:1:1.5  (CEO)
2)Base salary (directors, executive officers)
A base salary is paid as fixed compensation. Base salaries are determined for each role by taking into account the salary levels of officers at other companies (benchmarked companies of the same industry and scope selected by the Compensation Advisory Committee), as surveyed by a specialized outside organization.
3)Short-term performance-linked compensation (internal directors, executive officers)
Bonuses are paid based on yearly performance indicators and the degree of achievement of performance targets.
Director bonuses (excluding outside directors) vary from 0% to 200% according to the achievement of operating income, net income, and ROIC targets defined in the annual operating plan.
Bonus = Target amount for × Performance score × ROIC score each position (Operating income 50%, Net income 50%)
Performance indicators for executive officers are established individually according to their respective responsibilities.
4)Medium- to long-term performance-linked compensation (internal directors, executive officers)
The performance-linked component (60%) and non-performance-linked component (40%) are paid as stock-based compensation.
The performance-linked component may vary from 0% to 200%. This range is based on achievement of net sales, EPS, and ROE targets based on our medium-term management plan, as well as a sustainability evaluation* based on a third-party organization.
Stock-based = Target amount for × Performance score × ROE score × Sustainability score compensation each position (Net sales 30%, EPS 70%)
The non-performance-linked component aims for retention and motivation to improve share prices over the medium- to long-term. Payment is conditioned on a certain term of service.
As a rule, stock paid in stock-based compensation must be held by the individual during their term of service. In the event that an individual in question engages in serious misconduct during their term of service, and such misconduct harms the Company, the Compensation Advisory Committee will deliberate and make a recommendation. Based on this recommendation, the Board of Directors (when said individual is a director) or the CEO (when said individual is an executive officer) shall resolve to limit the payment of stock-based compensation.
* Sustainability Evaluation
An evaluation based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). The DJSI are a series of ESG Indices which include companies evaluated and selected based on long-term shareholder value perspective, reflecting economic, environmental, and social factors comprehensively.
Fiscal 2016 director compensation was paid based on the former compensation structure. For more information, see the following URL:

A Review of EARTH-1 STAGE Business Plan (Fiscal 2014 to 2016)
The OMRON Group aims to become a value generator for people and the Earth that is qualitatively and quantitatively superior by managing our businesses under Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), our ten-year long- term vision formulated in 2011. The EARTH-1 STAGE business plan, as the second stage of VG2020, covered the fiscal years 2014 to 2016. This plan defined a self-driven growth structure by which OMRON can grow independently under our own power in any operating environment. During the three years of EARTH-1 STAGE, we

concentrated on (1) strategy for our existing businesses, (2) super-global growth strategy, and (3) new business strategy for the optimization society. The following is a review of our progress.
In terms of executing strategy for our existing businesses, we focused on maximizing the strength of our Industrial Automation Business. We improved our ability to provide technologies to solve customer issues by expanding our mainstay businesses in four focus industries and by launching automation centers. We also acquired U.S.-based companies in motion

 controller and robot manufacturing, and took on other initiatives to accelerate the creation of new value and build a foundation for future business growth. As a result, we accomplished our EARTH-1 STAGE sales target for our Industrial Automation Business.
In pursuit of our super-global growth strategy, we achieved high growth rates in our Industrial Automation Business and our Healthcare Business, particularly in China and Asia. We held OMRON Total Fairs in Thailand and Indonesia, which led to a large number of new business discussions. In our Healthcare Business, we acquired a Brazilian nebulizer company and engaged in other measures to grow sales steadily throughout Central and South America. Further, we strengthened our business foundation by bolstering our production centers in Mexico and Indonesia, as well as by hiring and training core human resource leaders for our businesses in Asia.
To optimize strategy for new businesses, we
pursued industry-academia partnerships, alliances with other companies, and collaborations with external resources to create new businesses. However, we were not successful in creating other businesses with the scale and growth of our Environmental Solutions Business.
As a result of the initiatives above, we improved our earnings ability in the EARTH-1 STAGE, while accelerating the transition to a business foundation supporting sustainable revenue growth. We were also able to put our Industrial Automation Business on a new growth path. At the same time, due to the impact of changes in the business environment and other factors, we did not achieve either of our initial quantitative goals of more than ¥900 billion in sales and operating income margin of at least 10%. We do believe that we are on our way to establishing a self-driven growth structure. Our next medium-term business plan will continue this theme.

Fiscal 2016 in Review
Consolidated Earnings
Fiscal 2016 was the final year of EARTH-1 STAGE. During the year, our goals were to rebuild our earnings structure and to create an engine for self-driven growth. During the year, we worked to rebuild our earnings structure, as well as to generate businesses and innovations that drive growth. Fiscal 2016 net sales decreased 4.7% year on year to ¥794.2 billion. In addition to growth in our mainstay Industrial Automation Business, we also made strides in improving our
company-wide ability to generate earnings.
This improvement resulted in operating income of ¥67.6 billion (8.5% increase year on year) and operating income margin of 8.5% (1.0-point increase).
Net income attributable to OMRON shareholders amounted to ¥46.0 billion, which was 2.8% lower than prior year. This decrease was primarily due to restructuring in our Backlights Business.
 Consolidated Statement of Income
 Net Sales
OMRON Group net sales for fiscal 2016 fell to ¥794.2 billion, down 4.7% from the prior year. This decrease owed in part to the negative impact of yen appreciation. Overseas net sales amounted to ¥463.8 billion, a ¥39 billion (7.8%) decrease. Our divestment of a oil-related business in the Americas and the impact of lower Backlights Business sales in Greater China were the major factors that combined to drive sales down. OMRON recorded ¥330.4 billion in net sales in Japan, a slight decrease of 0.1%.
Gross Profit Margin, SG&A Expenses, and R&D Expenses
Gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 39.3%, a 0.8-point increase compared to the prior fiscal year. This improvement was mainly due to ongoing efforts to improve variable cost ratios
and lower fixed manufacturing costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were ¥193.5 billion, down 5.9% from the prior year. Research and development expenses amounted to ¥50.7 billion, down 4.0%.
Operating Income, Income before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, and Net Income Attributable to OMRON Shareholders OMRON Group operating income for the year was ¥67.6 billion (8.5% increase), while our operating income margin was 8.5% (1.0-point increase). Non-operating expenses, including impairments and restructuring in our Backlights Business, drove income before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates down 0.3% to ¥65.5 billion. Net income attributable to OMRON shareholders amounted to ¥46.0 billion, down 2.8%.

 Review of Operations by Business Segment
 Industrial Automation Business (IAB)
Our Industrial Automation Business recorded domestic net sales of ¥133.5 billion for fiscal 2016, a 2.3% increase year on year. This result was mainly due to higher sales in our digital and other focus sectors. Sales were lower overseas, mainly due to the divestment of an oil-related business in the Americas. At the same time, however, demand was solid in the automobile- related industries. Sales increased in Europe year on year, due to the contributions of a U.S.-based subsidiary acquired by the OMRON Group. The weak euro also led to strong demand for export company products. In Greater China, demand
was strong in the digital, infrastructure, and environmental-related industries. Increased digital industry investment in South Korea helped spur greater sales in Asia. However, the negative impact of foreign exchange and other factors resulted in overseas net sales falling 3.9% year on year to ¥197.5 billion. While the segment reported lower sales of ¥331.0 billion (1.5% decrease) as a whole, ongoing efforts to add more value to products resulted in higher gross profit margin, leading to an 8.5% increase in operating income at ¥52.0 billion.

Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC)
Domestic net sales for the segment decreased by 3.4% to ¥22.5 billion. This decrease was mainly due to declining demand in the amusement industry. Overseas, inventory adjustments among our customers in the automotive-related industries in the Americas resulted in lower demand. In Europe, demand in automotive-related industries was strong. In Greater China, demand in the consumer and commercial products industries decreased while demand was solid in the automotive-related industries. In Asia, demand
was robust in both the consumer and commercial product industries and the automobile-related industries. Owing in part to the strong yen, overseas net sales fell 11.1% to ¥71.5 billion, while the segment as a whole recorded net sales of ¥93.9 billion, a 9.4% decrease. Profits improved over the prior fiscal year, mainly due to productivity improvements enacted during fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 operating income amounted to ¥9.4 billion, a gain of 11.0%.

 Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC)
In Japan, net sales decreased 10.0% to ¥19.0 billion. This was mainly the result of declining production of mini vehicles (Kei cars). Overseas sales amounted to ¥113.1 billion, a decrease of 4.9%. Economic growth in the U.S. drove demand growth in the Americas. At the same time, government tax breaks in Greater China resulted in strong sales and demand for automobile-related
products in that region. Despite these positive factors, the appreciation of the yen had a major negative impact on overseas results. As a result, sales for the segment as a whole fell to ¥132.1 billion, down 5.6% for the year. Operating income fell 2.9% to ¥7.1 billion, mainly due to lower sales for the segment.

 Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB)
Sales in our public transportation business declined significantly compared to the prior year, as the demand cycle for upgrading station equipment reached a low point during fiscal 2016. Demand for both upgrades to traffic-related terminals and investment in expressways
was weak. As a result, sales in the traffic and road management system business also decreased compared with the previous fiscal year. Further,
demand fell in the solar power and related markets, driving down performance in the environmental solutions business significantly. As a result, segment net sales fell 13.4% to ¥67.1 billion. Despite lower sales for the year, fiscal 2016 operating income was significantly higher, increasing 25.3% to ¥4.0 billion. This result was mainly due to productivity improvement initiatives.

 † We have revised our business classification, reclassifying certain operations under SSB to the Other Business segment beginning with fiscal 2017. Healthcare Business (HCB)
Despite steady growth in sales of online home- use healthcare equipment in Japan, demand for these products was weak at big home appliance retailers in suburban areas. Sales of institutional equipment decreased, primarily due to the transfer of shares of a medical equipment subsidiary. As a result, sales in Japan fell to ¥28.9 billion, a decrease of 7.1% for the year. Overseas, sales of blood pressure monitors in Brazil were strong. In addition to sales of new blood pressure monitor products in Russia, the expansion of dealer networks throughout Europe contributed to
ongoing solid performance throughout the region. In Greater China, the online market continued to expand while demand in pharmacies and other store channels was weak. Demand was strong in Asia. Despite these positive factors, the strong yen had a major negative impact on overseas results, driving sales down 6.0% for the year to ¥72.4 billion. Segment sales amounted to ¥101.3 billion, down 6.3%. However, productivity improvements and other initiatives combined for significant profit gains. As a result, operating income amounted to ¥8.5 billion, up 17.2%.

Other Businesses
Sales decreased significantly for the year, mainly due to performance in our Backlights Business, affected by falling prices in the smartphone market and weak demand for high-end smartphones in Greater China. While our Environmental Solutions Business continued to experience weak demand in the solar power generation-related market, expanded product offerings in storage batteries contributed to year- on-year sales gains. In our Electronic Systems and Equipment Business, demand was strong for uninterruptible power supply units and contract
services for the development and production of electronic devices. Accordingly, sales increased compared to the prior fiscal year. Due to weak demand for smartphone microphones, sales in our Micro Devices Business fell year on year. The Other Businesses segment as a whole, recorded ¥63.3 billion in net sales, an increase of 0.4% year on year. The segment recorded an operating loss of ¥2.1 billion, narrowing losses compared to the prior year, primarily due to more effective controls over fixed costs.

Review of Financial Condition
Total assets at the end of fiscal 2016 amounted to ¥697.7 billion, an increase of ¥14.4 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. This increase stems from an increase in cash and cash equivalents of ¥43.1 billion.
Total liabilities decreased ¥9.3 billion to ¥226.9 billion. While current liabilities increased ¥9.4 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year, termination and retirement benefits decreased by ¥18.6 billion.
Net assets increased ¥23.7 billion to ¥470.8 billion. Net income attributable to OMRON shareholders and other factors led to an increase in retained earnings of ¥28.8 billion. As a result, shareholders’equity amounted to ¥469.0 billion (year-on-year increase of ¥24.3 billion), while shareholders’equity ratio increased 2.1 points to 67.2%. This decrease in liabilities and increase in shareholders’equity resulted in a debt-equity ratio of 0.48, an improvement of 0.05 points.

Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of fiscal 2016 amounted to ¥126.0 billion, an increase of ¥43.1 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¥77.9 billion. This was a decrease of ¥6.3 billion compared to the prior fiscal year, mainly due to decreases in net income (¥46.3 billion, decrease of ¥1.4 billion year on year) and depreciation and amortization (¥29.0 billion, decrease of ¥2.5 billion). Net cash used in investing activities amounted to ¥15.0 billion. This was a decrease of ¥52.1 billion in outlays, mainly

Free cash flow (total of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities) amounted to ¥62.8 billion, increased ¥45.7 billion versus the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¥15.0 billion, a decrease in outlays of ¥16.5 billion. The OMRON Group paid ¥14.5 billion in dividends (¥1.5 billion decrease compared to fiscal 2015).

Outlook for Fiscal 2017
Consolidated Earnings
While the global economic environment for fiscal 2017 remains in a moderate recovery, uncertainty will continue, depending on the impact of the direction of economic policies of the U.S. and Europe. In the OMRON Group's major markets in Japan, we expect firm demand for capital investment, mainly in the automobile and digital industries. Overseas, activity in the U.S. automobile-related market is expected to decelerate. However, we expect continued strong consumer spending and capital investment.
In Europe, growing consumer spending should result in a gradual recovery for corporate capital investment. In China, recovery of consumer spending is likely to enter a lull. On the other hand, the effects of expanded government investment and other policies are likely to continue, resulting in a steady recovery. In Asia, Korea shows signs of a decline in capital investment growth. At the same time, we expect the economies of Thailand and India to recover.
Facing this environment, the OMRON Group will launch our new medium-term business plan, VG2.0, in fiscal 2017. Our qualitative goal toward fiscal 2020 is to become a value generator for people and the Earth that is qualitatively and quantitatively superior. Our quantitative goals are to reach ¥1 trillion in net sales and ¥100 billion in operating income. The next basic policy will be known as ~Start up VG2.0~ A Firm First Step Toward Innovation. During the first year of our medium-term business plan, we plan to invest actively in our future to create a foundation for growth. Our fiscal 2017 plan calls for net sales of ¥810.0 billion (2.0% increase versus fiscal 2016), operating income of ¥68.0 billion (0.6% increase), and net income attributable to OMRON shareholders of ¥48.5 billion (5.5% increase). We plan to raise gross profit margin, an indicator of our earnings ability, to 40.6% (1.4-point increase year on year). Finally, our target for the important ROIC and ROE indicators is 10% or higher in each.
Industrial Automation Business (IAB)
In Japan, we anticipate firm demand for capital investment, particularly in the automobile and digital industries, to drive year-on-year growth in sales. Overseas, the digital industry should lead in continued firm demand for capital investment, combined with increasing demand for investment in automation, labor-saving, and information technology to drive sales higher year on year. As a result, the IAB forecasts net sales of ¥350.0 billion for fiscal 2017, a 5.8% increase year on year. With ongoing investment in growth, higher sales, and improved gross profit margin, we expect operating income to amount to ¥56.0 billion (7.7% increase).
Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC)
In Japan, the EMC expects demand for automobile-related industries and consumer and commercial product industries to be level with the previous year. Demand for amusement industry spending will likely remain weak, leading to a reduced revenue plan for fiscal 2017. Overseas, we expect demand for consumer and commercial product industries in the U.S. and Europe will remain firm, while the electricity-related business should grow in Asia. While demand in the automobile-related industries in Asia and China should be strong, we expect waning demand in other regions. As a result, the EMC forecasts net sales of ¥94.0 billion (0.1% increase year on year). We expect operating income to amount to ¥9.0 billion (4.5% decrease), mainly due a temporary increase in expenses related to productivity improvements.
 88 OMRON Corporation

 Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC)
In Japan, we expect to see significant declines in vehicles equipped with OMRON Group products. Overseas, we forecast decreases in vehicle models equipped with Omron Group products and slower demand in North America. However, firm demand in Korea and China, should result in higher sales overseas as a whole. The AEC forecasts net sales of ¥131.0 billion (0.8% year on year decrease), with operating income of ¥6.5 billion, 8.8% lower owing to investment in growth projects.
Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB)
The SSB segment projects lower sales in its train station solutions business due to reaching a low point in the cycle for upgraded station equipment. The traffic and road management system business will likely generate higher sales based on demand for traffic-related terminal upgrades and investment in expressways. Combining these factors, the SSB forecasts net sales of ¥63.5 billion (2.6% increase year on year) and operating income of ¥4.0 billion (8.5% increase).
* Comparisons to fiscal 2016 figures are calculated on revised business classifications for fiscal 2016 actuals (¥61.9 billion in net sales, ¥3.7 billion in operating income).
Healthcare Business (HCB)
In Japan, the increase in individuals suffering from lifestyle diseases associated with an aging society and greater interest in health lead us to anticipate growth in medical equipment sales. However, since we have transferred shares of our medical equipment subsidiary to another company, we project lower sales for fiscal 2017. Overseas, economic growth is spurring lifestyle changes and an increase in interest in health. The emerging
economies of the world, particularly in Asia, should see healthy demand for related products. Accordingly, we forecast higher overseas sales for fiscal 2017. As a result, the HCB forecasts net sales of ¥105.0 billion for fiscal 2017 (3.7% increase) and operating income of ¥9.5 billion (11.3% increase).
Other Businesses (Businesses under the Direct Control of Headquarters)
We forecast lower sales in our Backlights
Business due to business optimization. Despite
sluggish demand for the industrial sector of the
solar power-related market, we expect that
strong demand for storage batteries and related
products will generate year-on-year sales growth
in our Environmental Solutions Business for
fiscal 2017. We plan for higher sales in our
Electric Systems and Equipment Business,
mainly due to an expanded lineup of
uninterruptible power supply products. In our
Micro Devices Business, we forecast a
significant decline in fiscal 2017 sales, impacted
negatively by lower sales of products for
smartphone microphones. As a result, the Other
Businesses segment forecasts fiscal 2017 net
sales of ¥60.0 billion (12.4% decrease year on
year) and operating loss of ¥1.0 billion. This
operating loss represents a ¥900 million
improvement compared to fiscal 2016 operating
losses due to the impact of optimization in our
businesses.
* Comparisons to fiscal 2016 figures are calculated on revised business classifications for fiscal 2016 actuals (¥68.5 billion in net sales, ¥1.8 billion in operating loss).

From the Editor-in-Chief
 Fiscal 2017 marks the sixth year since OMRON has issued its annual report in the Integrated Report format.
In drafting the fiscal 2017 edition of the Integrated Report, we have focused on our new medium-term management plan, VG2.0. A single narrative ties this report together, from the CEO message to each special feature. We have done our best to communicate the specifics and strategies of VG2.0. Moreover, this year OMRON formulated a company- wide initiative (sustainability policy) for environmental, social, and governance, so-called ESG. We identified sustainability issues and goals, set non-financial targets, and disclosed this information in this Integrated Report for the first time ever. We also reported on our director and officer compensation scheme, which was revised this year. We believe this Integrated Report provides readers with a better understanding of the development behind OMRON governance.
Our Investor Relations Department and the
Sustainability Promotion Office, together with a great deal of cooperation both within and outside of the company, went through a painstaking process of trial and error to produce this report. As we strive to improve the Integrated Report, the entire production team looks forward to receiving frank comments and opinions about the report from you, the reader.

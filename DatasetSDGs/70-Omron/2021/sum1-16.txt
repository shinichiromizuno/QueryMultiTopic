Risk Management
Integrated Risk Management for Supporting Global Business Activities
OMRON started integrated risk
management in order to manage the
risks of the Group via a shared
framework in 2011, the same year
OMRON initiated VG2020. The reason
for this was that in order to rapidly
respond to the faster pace of change in
the operating environment and rising
levels of uncertainty, we needed to
become more attuned to risk, scenting
and addressing risks before they
became actualized.
We aim to develop effective risk
management whereby all employees
and management teams can work
together to solve issues arising from
environmental changes that cannot be
resolved at the working level. We work
to improve the quality of our initiatives
by following the plan-do-check-act
(PDCA) cycle on a global scale. We also
regard the accelerated business
environmental changes as
opportunities, and perceive determining how to take risks as an essential perspective. We are additionally addressing how to build mechanisms enabling efficient, effective, and prompt risk decisions to be made while still adhering to the OMRON Principles and relevant business rules.
Integrated Risk Management Structure
OMRON has established a PDCA cycle that is conducted throughout the year to analyze risks, respond to material risks, and engage in crisis management. To promote initiatives on a global scale with all employees, risk managers are appointed for each headquarters, division, regional headquarters, and group company across the world.

Risks Surrounding Management and Businesses, and Risk Analysis
As OMRON does business globally, we must respond to a variety of risks. Therefore, the OMRON Group breaks down all risks that may impact its management or financial condition into categories and determined their interrelationships. For major risks, we regularly (at least once a year) conduct comprehensive analyses of expected environmental changes, the appropriateness/sufficiency of Group measures, and actual risk cases that have occurred, and rank these risks accordingly. S-rank and A-rank risks, as defined below, are called significant Group risks. For these, we monitor the implementation status of countermeasures and situational changes.
S Rank: Risks of utmost importance to the operation of the Group, which may jeopardize its survival or bring severe social liability.
A Rank: Risks that impede the achievement of important Group goals
Addressing Material Group Risks
The following examples of significant Group risks represent those matters related to business and finance which may impact the Groupâ€™s operating results and financial condition (including stock price). Items which have undergone a particularly extensive change in management or business environment and which the OMRON Group is currently prioritizing are labeled with an asterisk in the table below. However, this is not an exhaustive list of all risks; the Group may be affected in the future by risks that are not currently foreseeable or considered significant.
Matters discussed here that are not historical fact reflect the judgment of OMRON Group management as of June 25, 2021 (the date of submission of the annual securities report).

The OMRON Principles
OMRON founder KazumaTateishi resonated with the public nature of business, saying, “A company shouldn’t be just about pursuing profits...it has an obligation to serve society.” In 1959, he publicly announced the OMRON’s Corporate Motto, to improve lives and contribute to a better society. In 1990, we transformed this motto into the OMRON Principles, evolving with the times.
  OMRON Principles
     Sustainability Policy
We believe a business should create value for society through its key practices. We are committed to sustainably increasing our long-term value
by putting Our Mission and Values into practice.
We uphold a long-term vision in our business practices to create solutions to society’s needs.
We operate as a truly global company through our fair and transparent management practices.
We cultivate strong relationships with all of our stakeholders through responsible engagement.
  1
We consider Sustainability Policy to reflect the same meaning and content as declared by our Management Philosophy based on the OMRON Principles. Namely, “We are committed to sustainably enhancing our long-term corporate value by putting the OMRON Principles into practice.”

SINIC* Theory:
Predicting the FutureThrough the Interrelationships
of Science,Technology, and Society
Our founder, KazumaTateishi, believed that solving social issues through business to create a better society required the ability to anticipate future social needs. He believed that a company needed a compass to help predict the future. As our compass, Mr.Tateishi formulated the SINIC predictive theory, which projects the future based on the cycle of interrelationships between Science,Technology, and Society. OMRON first announced this predictive theory to the world at the International Future Research World Congress in 1970. Since then, the SINIC Theory has been our compass for projecting into the future.
The basic philosophy behind the SINICTheory is that the interrelationships among science, technology, and society lead to social change. Let us use the Cybernation Society as an example. We can see how the rise of cybernetics, computer science, and other synthetic sciences in the 1940s became the seeds of electronic control technologies, programming, and other technology.These technologies gave rise to the PC and the internet, leading to the advent of the Cybernation Society. At the same time, the Cybernation Society demanded more data, along with more accurate and rapid data analysis.These demands forced us to produce CPUs and GPUs with faster processing power, make advancements in deep learning and other artificial intelligence technologies, and reach higher levels of sophistication in neuroscience and cognitive science.The evolution of these interrelationships serves as a driving force behind humanity’s desire to progress.

Yoshihito Yamada

It was in 1959 that OMRON founder KazumaTateishi established the OMRON Corporate Motto, saying, “business should create value for society through its key practices.” For the past 60 years, OMRON has taken on the challenge to lead the world in innovation driven by social needs to improve lives and contribute to a better society. In recent years, complex changes and rising uncertainties have made predicting the future a difficult proposition. In such a severe business environment, how can we confront social issues and generate values unique to OMRON?We spoke to president and CEOYoshihitoYamada about his vision and strategy.

 Fiscal 2018 Review and Fiscal 2019 Outlook
– Editor The first half of the OMRON VG2.0 medium-term management plan is now completed. What do you see when you look back on Fiscal 2018?
Yamada: In fiscal 2018, we were affected by a rapidly deteriorating business environment, which began in the second quarter. As a result, full-year net sales were level with fiscal 2017, which was a record high. Profits were lower year on year.
Our mainstay Industrial Automation Business (IAB) recorded historic high sales in Japan, Europe, the United States, Asia and China. Unfortunately, sales fell sharply in Korea due to a deterioration in market conditions for the digital industry, mainly in semiconductors.
Our Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC) and Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC) also experienced
sales declines due to the deterioration of the global business environment. On the other hand, Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB), Healthcare Business (HCB), and Environment Solution businesses under the direct control of headquarter remained strong.
We defined the first half of VG2.0 (fiscal 2017-2018) as an investment phase for future growth. In fiscal 2018, we focused on the IAB and HCB in an increasingly challenging business environment. Our intent here was to strengthen technology development, marketing capabilities, organizational reform, and human resources. As of the end of the year, we completed the investments necessary for medium- to long-term growth in these areas. The EMC has seen a steady implementation of structural reforms, including the consolidation of production bases.
In terms of shareholder returns, we provided an ¥84 per share dividend, our highest ever. This was an increase of ¥8 over the previous fiscal year, resulting in a total shareholder return of approximately 130 percent. We also conducted ¥25.7 billion in stock buybacks as another example of our management focus on shareholder value and capital efficiency.
– Please tell us about your outlook for fiscal 2019, which signals the second half of VG2.0. Our fiscal 2019 business plan calls for lower sales and profits based on an assumption of a continued tough operating environment. In light of the risk of further global macroeconomic deterioration, we have incorporated a negative ¥10 billion in sales and ¥5 billion in operating income into our plan to reflect the risk of earnings fluctuations.
However, we expect gross profit margin (GP margin), which is an indicator of our earning power, to exceed 0.8 percentage points over last year. We plan to find further improvements through the sales contributions of high-value-added IAB products and the results of EMC structural reforms. This high GP rate, which has been steadily improving over the years, is a great weapon in today’s challenging business environment. After all, GP margin is the source of investments that are essential for growth.

Therefore, in fiscal 2019, we will continue to improve this GP margin and continue to manage our business under multiple scenarios that can respond flexibly to environmental changes.
The challenging business environment is also a terrific opportunity to establish a competitive advantage others in our industry. In the short term, headwinds are intensifying due to the effects of U.S.-China trade friction. But medium- to long-term social issues that can be solved through OMRON technology and businesses are becoming more and more apparent. These include labor shortages caused by the declining birthrate and aging population and lifestyle-related diseases that are rapidly increasing in the world. In fiscal 2019, we will focus on our mainstay IAB and HCB businesses to solve these issues.
The IAB will meet rising needs for machines to automate the skills of craftspersons in solving the shortage of skilled workers. We will also meet the needs in higher-precision manufacturing for advanced, more compact, higher-quality electronic devices. OMRON’s unique manufacturing innovation concept, innovative-Automation, is designed to meet these needs and solve other problems. We will continue to evolve as OMRON engineers work with customers to leverage production site data, achieving growth through the i-BELT subscription service, which facilitates maintenance, upkeep, and the evolution of production lines.
The HCB grew steadily, pushed by a wind of increasing global health needs. In particular, we aim to provide personalized healthcare by offering innovative devices and services in three focus
areas that represent global social issues: cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and pain management.
In our mainstay cardiovascular disease field, quickly aging demographics in developed countries and the increase in lifestyle-related diseases associated with the expansion of the middle class in emerging countries have resulted in a rise in serious diseases caused by high blood pressure. These diseases include stroke and myocardial infarction. The OMRON vision for Zero Events is our stance to eradicate these diseases. To achieve this vision, we are developing new devices that enable measurement of biological information and diagnostic support services that utilize electrocardiogram monitoring.
We will also accelerate forward-looking investments, which include enhancements and quality improvements in our global IT infrastructure, so important to group management. We will also bolster our IAB production and development bases in Japan. It is precisely because of the challenging business environment that we see headwinds as an opportunity to generate buoyancy. By investing steadily in our future, we will acquire the power to grow dramatically when the market tailwinds blow again.
– You have announced the transfer of Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC) shares to Nidec Corporation (formal transfer scheduled for October 2019). What were your reasons for this decision?
Our decision to transfer the AEC was based on the return to the OMRON Principles that we contribute to a better society through our businesses. We had three reasons.
The first reason was for the sake of further AEC

growth. The automobile industry is entering a once-in-100-year period of great change, called CASE*1. The automotive parts business is now in the midst of a major shift to modularization and standardization. No industry player can get away from this fact. The key for survival among in-vehicle component manufacturers is to continue to provide strong modules. At OMRON, our strength is in control technologies built into electronic control units (ECU). However, it is difficult to construct strong modules with ECU alone. Combining ECU with the motor that is a particular strength of Nidec makes for a very competitive module. That’s why we chose Nidec for this transaction.
The second reason is to make the OMRON business portfolio stronger and more flexible. The scope of the AEC business is in excess of ¥130 billion, with earnings on par with the industry average. Within the OMRON business portfolio, however, our IAB and HCB have a competitive advantage not only in terms of profitability but also in terms of market competitiveness. By concentrating resources on these businesses, we will survive the changing times and create a structure that provides self-driven growth in any business environment.
The third reason is to implement a long-term growth strategy. We will focus our management
resources within more narrowly defined domains to accelerate competitive and growth strategies. We intend to use the cash obtained from this share transfer for future growth investments, including M&A activity and alliances, mainly in the IAB and HCB businesses.

– Have there been any changes in your business fields due to the transfer of the automotive business? In what fields do you expect to increase the value of your presence? Under VG2.0, we defined four domains of focus: factory automation (FA), healthcare, mobility, and energy management. We pursued growth strategies in each area, but we are now reorganizing our domains in response to the transfer of the automotive business.
Specifically, we will set up three new focus domains: FA, Healthcare, and Social Solutions. The third domain, Social Solutions, is a domain that aims to create new value in social infrastructure, mainly in social systems, such as roads and transportation, and energy management-related businesses.
Each of these focus domains include many core products and services that enjoy barriers to entry,

and long term. Companies are a legal entity with something regarded as a personality. However, different than human beings, companies have no defined life expectancy and are not allowed to die. Companies have a wide range of stakeholders and an assumption that the entity will be a going- concern in perpetuity. At the same time, companies are also in a very precarious situation. Regardless of the size of a company, it can be blink out of existence instantly if society does not allow it to exist.
Today, we are in the challenging VUCA*2 era that presents a hazy future. At the same time, society asks us to contribute to a sustainable world through as ESG and SDGs. For OMRON to be a company needed by society in these times, and continue to raise corporate value, it is essential that we continue to improve lives and contribute to a better society through our practice of management based on the OMRON Principles.

– So, how does OMRON practice the OMRON Principles for lasting development?
We must instill the OMRON Principles in every corner of our organization and every employee must continue to have an internal fire to improve lives and contribute to a better society. As individual beliefs expand this circle of resonance inside and outside the company, we will see incredible power to solve social issues.
Therefore, OMRON began a movement to share and recognize the efforts of employees who practice the OMRON Principles, striving to expand this circle of resonance both inside and outside the company. This is The OMRON Global Awards (TOGA), which we’ve been holding since 2012. The number of participants has increased year by year, up from 20,828 in the first year to 62,469 (6,957 projects) cumulatively as of fiscal 2018. With approximately 35,000 OMRON Group employees, many participants have entered multiple projects. Today, TOGA is an indispensable activity in management based on the OMRON Principles. One of the most important internal dialogues in engaging with management based on the OMRON Principles is our VOICE*3 engagement survey, conducted for all employees globally. In fiscal 2018, approximately 85 percent of our employees responded with and 8,500 responses received. I personally look over every response and we use this feedback to improve management issues.
By accelerating Diversity & Inclusion through human resources strategies such as TOGA and VOICE, we aim to be a company in which all
employees embrace the OMRON Principles and approach their work with excitement.
*3 VOICE: VG OMRON Interactive Communication with Employee
– OMRON has led the world in many
innovations. What has made this possible?
A medium- to long-term perspective is critical for
quickly identifying and confronting social issues.
This is why OMRON engages in management
through future-oriented backcasting. Since 1970,
our compass has been the SINIC Theory, a
predictive theory formulated by our founder. This
theory projects the future based on the cycle of
interrelationships between Science, Technology,
and Society. Today, we are in the process of the
Optimization Society. From the Cybernation
Mechanization Society to the current Optimization
Society, we will be advancing next to the
Autonomous Society, a society in which people to
express themselves while living in harmony with
others.
See diagram on P17
For OMRON to create this Autonomous Society and remain a venture-type company on our own, we must continue to create innovation driven by social needs. For this reason, we are engaged in a type of technology management that focuses on technological innovation, leveraging near-future design and clearly defining our strategic purpose. In 2018, we established the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ (IXI) and OMRON SINIC X Corporation

(OSX). IXI was founded on the concept of near- future design as a platform to create innovations through backcasting. OSX is engaged in near-future design research. By making OSX a separate company with a flexible employment and management system, leading engineers from the fields of AI and robotics in Japan and overseas are allowed to conduct their work alone, in partnership with others, on an ad-hoc project basis, etc. Benefited by a mechanism to remove internal and external barriers, top-level researchers work to create new innovations in an open environment. One such project is research into robots equipped with human finger sensations. By combining this technology with industrial robots deployed in FA sites, humans and robots may be able to co-exist not only on production floors, but also in all aspects of daily life.
In this way, IXI and OSX are taking on the challenges of answering social needs and creating business models through state-of-the-art technology human resources and open innovation. By strengthening our technology and human resources, we will continue to create innovation that leads the world.
Social Change Predicted by the SINIC Theory
– What does OMRON require to become a strong company engaged in self-driven growth? I define a strong company by three elements: growing capability, earning capacity, and responsiveness to change. With all three of the elements, a company can build a self-driven growth structure for itself. In this sense, although OMRON experienced lower profits last year due to environmental headwinds, we are in the process of establishing a self-driven growth structure that grows independently in any environment.
As I mentioned earlier, headwinds are also a terrific opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. This is why we continue to engage in forward-looking strategic management to overcome uncertainties in the future. We look beyond the immediate future and prepare for several different future scenarios. We intend to tack into these headwinds proactively, investing in structural reform and growth strategies for a stronger group-wide earnings capacity. By mastering knowledge management, which

The Optimization Society is a transition between Cybernation Mechanization Society and the Autonomous Society. It is a time of confrontation and conflict between old and new values as the focus changes from products and goods to more mindful endeavors.

 standardizes and develops the knowledge of our entire organization, we aim to create innovations driven by social needs using technology, human resources, and expertise as our advantage, aiming for a sustainable growth structure that balances both economic and social value.
– Last, what are the future prospects and challenges for OMRON?
We expect the current uncertain business environment to continue for some time to come. However, as I mentioned before, medium- to long- term social issues that can be solved through OMRON technology and businesses are becoming more apparent. These include labor shortages due to the declining birthrate and aging population and lifestyle-related diseases that are rapidly increasing in the world. It is time for us to demonstrate our true worth.
During the first half of VG2.0, we sufficiently
strengthened the resources needed for growth. For the second half of VG2.0, which begins this year, we will use the resources we have cultivated and the skills we have developed to create value unique to OMRON. It is precisely in these difficult times that we must always be moving forward. We will continue to be a company that sees change as an opportunity, taking on the challenge to improve lives and contribute to a better society and serving as an organization that continues to live up to the high expectations of people from all over the world. That is the vision for which OMRON strives.

CFO Interview
 ROIC Management: Powering the Growth Cycle with Discipline and Boldness
August 2019
Director, Senior Managing Executive Officer
CFO and Senior General Manager, Global Strategy HQ
Koji Nitto

“The OMRON mission is to improve lives and contribute to a better society by implementing the OMRON Principles. So says CFO Koji Nitto, who is responsible for “ROIC management,” the company’s system for accelerating management of the OMRON Principles. Building a “self-driven growth structure” is essential to solving social issues. Through ROIC management, we are implementing self-driven growth and incorporating the creation of innovation into management mechanisms. We spoke with CFO Nitto about building systems to increase earning ability and powering the growth cycle with a combination of discipline and boldness.

  The Role of the CFO Management based on the OMRON Principlest and Self-Driven Growth
 – Editorial Department (in bold below): Could you talk about management based on the principles that OMRON is striving for and about your role as CFO in putting these principles into practice?
Nitto (omitted below): What are OMRON’s goals and what is the purpose of its existence? We are always asking ourselves about the true meaning of the corporate motto given to us by our founder Kazuma Tateishi and of the OMRON Principles which have inherited the spirit behind that motto. The answer is that it is the duty of all the people working at OMRON to practice the OMRON Principles and to improve lives and contribute to a better society through our business. My role as CFO is evaluate investments and to redistribute resources with a sense of discipline.
– What are the essential elements needed to solve social issues as called for under the OMRON Principles?
It is essential for OMRON to establish a self-driven growth structure to solve social issues and achieve continuous growth. How can we build that structure? First, we must continue to create businesses that contribute to the betterment of society. Although we are currently buffeted by headwinds in the current business climate, it’s not stopping all economic activity or social initiatives. Medium- and long-term social issues that we can solve through our businesses are increasingly apparent. These issues include labor shortages due to low birth rates and aging demographics. If we can keep our focus on these trends and invest in businesses where there are barriers that our competitors cannot imitate or where there we have latent competitiveness, we will create value in spite of challenges, a veritable “growth engine” that can make meaningful contributions to society.
To create this new growth engine, OMRON is increasing its spending on development and has set up new organizations like the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ and OMRON SINIC X to serve as platforms for innovation. Through OMRON VENTURES CO., LTD., we are actively investing with venture firms around the world to stimulate open innovation.
Another element essential for self-driven growth is to continue to grow our businesses and improve profitability. We will not be able to achieve self-driven growth only by creating new businesses. Although we certainly need new businesses, it is just as important to increase the profitability of and grow all of OMRON’s businesses through ceaseless structural reform.
We will achieve self-driven growth by accelerating
these two elements. We can engage boldly with social issues and continue OMRON’s own unique cycle of growth.
– In the first half of VG2.0, the company continued its focus on investment for growth and the gross profit margin. Could you explain the reasons for that?
The first 2 years of VG2.0 we have aggressively made the necessary investments toward achieving self-driven growth. We focused on the growth engines of our industrial automation and healthcare businesses, extending the range of solutions to make up for where we were short by expanding technologies and products.
What we are continuing to focus on toward the achievement of self-driven growth is our gross profit (GP) margin. That’s because the gross profit margin represents pure profit attributable to the production of physical goods by subtracting from sales the cost of sales. Since the gross profit margin is the source of our investment resources, we will increase our ability to invest to the extent that the gross profit margin increases. In this way, we will set the growth cycle in motion by increasing our competitiveness through investing. It is vital that we continue to invest for growth, even in the midst of a tough business climate. That is why the gross profit margin is so important: it is the source of those resources.
It takes more than production to increase the gross profit margin: every division of the company, from sales and development, to headquarters, must act in a coordinated way to increase the gross profit margin. For example, it’s exceedingly hard to achieve a 3% cost reduction with production, but if the gross profit margin is 50% and sales gives a 1.5% discount, the entire 3% cost reduction that production had sweated blood to get to will be wiped out. Since gross profit margin is variable, we make sure everyone in the company understands the importance. As a result, the 36.8% gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 at the start of VG2020 increased to 41.2% by fiscal 2018.
If this 4.4 points increase is calculated backwards from net sales of ¥859.5 billion in fiscal 2018, it is apparent that we’ve picked up ¥37.8 billion in investment resources.

muscular OMRON. P37 ROIC Management
– In addition to raising the GP margin, what other unique measures is OMRON taking to contribute to sustainable corporate value growth? It takes monitoring of return on investment, evaluation, and maximization to make effective use of limited resources and to achieve self-driven growth. Businesses must have earnings capacity in addition to growth power. It is the combination of both of these factors that underlies ROIC management. ROIC is a crucial management indicator because it measures the return on invested capital and can be used to assess performance according to the type of business. However, approached as a management indicator, employees on the front line may not see the connection to their own work. That is why we have introduced the Down-Top ROIC Tree. The Down-Top ROIC Tree breaks down ROIC into the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the automation rate, the failure cost ratio, and the facilities turnover rate to find out which improvements would lead to greater efficiency in business processes and how these efficiencies would in turn lead to improved results. The Down-Top ROIC Tree is way to visualize this analysis. Each and every employee must take responsibility for boosting profits and sustaining growth because if our activities are not consistent with one another, we will not move in the
same direction toward the creation of value. Therefore, our aim is to connect actions through all levels of our organization, linking policies set by management to improvement actions performed by employees.
Also, to ensure that ROIC management is more deeply understood, we have introduced an interpreted formula called ROIC Management 2.0. By deploying ambassadors in each division, we are sharing advanced case studies throughout the company.
– OMRON also considers portfolio management to be important.
While the business environment is keep changing, not all businesses grow as planned. Disciplined management will be essential for OMRON to achieve self-driven growth. With that in mind, we must always look at the makeup of our business and rebuild our portfolio to focus our efforts on business that have significant profitability and growth potential. There are nearly 90 business units in OMRON. We are constantly assessing the economic value and market competitiveness of each of our businesses to make critical management judgments about whether to continue a business or to divest ourselves of it and whether to shift resources to new growth businesses. This kind of business assessment using portfolio management is essential for sustainable business management. Moreover, disciplined management is necessary in the pursuit of the OMRON Principles.
As public institutions that should create value, companies are made up of a wide range of stakeholders. In the case of institutional investors, there are many people who depend for their livelihood on pensions. Profits must be duly returned to these indirect stakeholders. In other words, businesses that cannot generate a minimum level of earnings do not

 make an adequate contribution to the betterment of society. To the extent that earnings are a measure of the value a company provides to the world, I believe companies must exercise highly disciplined investment management through clear rules defining individual activities in a given business field and how much income growth is generated.
OMRON has established ROIC of 10% as the bar that each of our businesses must clear. When a business’s ROIC falls below 6%, we start considering divestiture. Our expected cost of capital is around 6%. If we carry businesses that do not produce ROIC of at least 6%, we will not generate the capital we need for future growth. That would contradict the OMRON Principles of contributing to a better society.
As a result of various strategies, including Down-Top ROIC Tree and Portfolio Management, OMRON achieved fiscal2018 ROIC of 10.6%, even while we increased R&D expenses as well as SG&A expenditures in expectation of growth. This level of ROIC is significantly higher than the average 6.75% for all publicly-traded companies in Japan.
P37 ROIC Management
– Tell us about policies and strategies for the improvement of shareholder value.
Going forward, we will continue to accelerate our growth cycle by steadily implementing a growth strategy based on ROIC, and we will achieve further growth by allocating profits generated by high GP rates to growth investments. Our plans call for investing the profits generated by this growth cycle in accordance with appropriate cash management and profit distribution policies. In improving shareholder value, we will implement investment for growth, stable dividends, and opportunistic stock buybacks, in that order. The annual dividend for fiscal 2019 is calculated by applying the dividend on equity ratio (DOE) standard due to uncertainty about the business climate.
There has been a growing demand in recent years for companies to demonstrate sustainability in terms of ESG and SDGs. This means that these days, shareholders will select companies that use the assets entrusted to them by shareholders to build a better society while being able to provide solid returns. To respond to their expectations, OMRON will achieve business growth by accelerating ROIC management while solving social issues with OMRON’s unique technology and services as contribute to building a better world. We will achieve both of these goals.
– Finally, could you talk about sustainable improvements in corporate value with a view to post Value Generation (VG)?
This year, due to uncertain economic situation we expect the factory automation and other industries will suffer significant impact. We see these challenging conditions as an excellent opportunity for corporate reform. Accordingly, we intend to strengthen our corporate infrastructure through more consistent implementation of ROIC management.
We also believe that the key to sustainable improvement in corporate value lies in our ability to innovate. What this means is that during the last two years of VG 2.0 and beyond, we will forge ahead steadily with discipline and boldness to drive the innovation creation cycle, and we will make sure that this system is firmly built into the company’s management mechanism. We will set up a self-driven growth cycle that is unique to OMRON to enhance corporate value by solving social issues – . My mission as CFO is to continue this work.

ROIC Management
ROIC management consists of Down-Top ROICTree and Portfolio Management.
OMRON encompasses a number of business divisions with varied characteristics. We believe ROIC is an excellent measure for assessing business performance fairly for each business. Using operating income or operating income margin as an indicator doesn’t account for variances due to the nature or scope of a business. ROIC, on the other hand, measures return on invested capital, providing a fair assessment. Under VG2.0, we have defined four focus domains. ROIC is an indispensable tool as we continue to grow our unique business portfolio.
 ROIC Management
   Down-Top ROIC Tree
Down-Top ROIC Tree breaks ROIC into key performance indicators for each department, allowing us to improve ROIC at the most basic operating level. Using simple ROS or invested capital turnover as ROIC indicators are ineffective, since they do not relate directly to front-line operations. On-site managers would have trouble thinking of ways to improve ROIC using these indicators. However, we can break ROIC down into automation/head count reduction or facilities turnover as KPIs of manufacturing departments. With these indicators, managers can finally see how their goals tie directly to ROIC improvement initiatives. At OMRON, one of our greatest strengths is our unified approach to improving ROIC from the ground level up.

            To promote ROIC management more widely, we introduced ROIC Management 2.0 in 2015. ROIC Management 2.0 incorporates a qualitative interpretation of ROIC. The interpreted formula tells us to add needed management resources (N) and generate greater levels of value to our customers (V), while reducing loss-making management resources (L). Using this simple interpreted formula, our employees in charge of sales or development functions who may be unfamiliar with financial statement concepts are able to envision ROIC improvement measures in their day-to- day work.
Staff in charge of business unit accounting and finance act as ambassadors responsible for promoting ROIC Management 2.0. Ambassadors provide simple case studies of successful ROIC Management 2.0 initiatives to raise awareness of ROIC on the front lines of our businesses around the world.

OMRON is implementing management based on the OMRON Principles to create Social Needs for solving social issues. Management based on the OMRON Principles is supported byTechnology Management. OMRON has leveraged the power of technology to create a series of the world-first products and systems such as non-contact switches and automatic ticket gates. With the ever-increasing pace of technological innovations such as AI, IoT, and robotics, how does OMRON envision the future and what social issues will the company solve? We asked CTO Miyata, who has been given the job of accelerating OMRON innovation, about evolving technology management.

 Governance Financial Info Corporate Info
 Creating aTemplate for OMRON-style Innovation
– Editorial Department (following in bold): Regarding OMRON-style innovation, How do you define it and how are you trying to accelate?
Miyata (omitted below) : OMRON-style innovation relies on technology innovation to perform near- future design tailored to solving social issues. This is what OMRON’s technology management is all about.
Since coming on as CTO, I have worked to pick up the pace with which OMRON as an organization innovates by establishing and strengthening technology management to enhance our ability to create solutions to social needs. By developing and implementing a company-wide technology strategy we have sharpened our Sensing & Control + Think core technologies. Especially since the start of VG2.0 in 2017, we have created a template for OMRON-style innovation that meets the needs of the era to improve our technology management and speed up the creation of innovative technologies. Specifically, we have set up a professional organization to create backcasting innovation that begins from the standpoint of near- future design and extends to developing strategies
and business validation. We accumulate knowledge generated by this organization in-house.
– This organization consists of the Innovation Exploring Initiative HQ (IXI), which started full- scale operations in April 2018, and its subsidiary OMRON SINIC X Corporation (OSX). It’s been a year since this organization started up. What’s been the response so far?
IXI is an organization that has all the capabilities necessary to do backcasting innovation, and can go through the entire process in a single operation. The role of the OSX subsidiary is to do the near- future research that is the starting point for the process of creating innovation. OSX has brought in many top talents from outside in the fields of AI, IoT, robotics, and other leadingedge technologies. This company makes the best use of talented staff, while working with research groups inside and outside OMRON, engaging in open innovation and performing near-future design.
When IXI was set up, the focus was on making it an innovation platform for OMRON. OMRON has tried, but failed, several times in the past to establish a department that creates new businesses. When we looked back on why these attempts failed, we found the answer. That was because it was a “remote island.” In addition to being highly independent, there was a “show us what you’ve got” attitude from the standpoint of

our existing business units, and the business units were not able to provide compelling ideas or leadership. The challenge was how to change this situation.
To achieve this change, we have actively promoted IXI since its establishment both inside and outside of OMRON. As a result, IXI has brought in over 60 ideas over the past year from inside and outside of the company, and nearly 20 projects have been launched that promise to have a real impact. In addition, over 20 young strategic candidates from across the company have participated in IXI.
One of the projects launched by IXI is the
Cooperation agreement to solve problems in Japan’s regional cities with a view toward 2030 which was announced jointly in April 2019 by the city of Maizuru in Kyoto Prefecture and OMRON’s Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business. The impetus for this project came about when Mr.Yamaguchi who is deputy mayor of Maizuru became aware of the existence of OSX and indicated that he wanted to work with OMRON on regional development in Japan. The decision was made by IXI to start up the project immediately after discussions between the deputy mayor of Maizuru and the CEO of OSX, and a project team consisting of people from the city of Maizuru, IXI, and SSB was formed. The project team held discussions about what framework needs to be built to revitalize regional cities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000 people, what these cities should look like in 2030, and what sorts of technologies and business models are needed to achieve these goals. The project is currently at the stage where demonstration tests are being conducted toward the implementation of the near- future designs that have been created. This is an example of IXI’s innovation creation process, one which develops near-future in response to social issues, formulates strategies and business validation, and demonstrates the dependability of the system that makes this all possible.
There are a number of projects like this that are now under way. Management needs to be patient because it takes time to achieve great results. There really is a great deal of potential here. I’m really looking forward to seeing what develops.
P53 Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB)
– This means that the “template” for OMRON-style innovation is starting to work. On the other hand, the technology to create innovation is essential. What has been the response to the strengthening of core technologies?
It takes people to create and refine technologies. In the process of implementing our company-wide technology strategy, we have been paying particular attention to hiring and training technical people. One result of this is that we have been raising the number of technical presentations and the quality and quantity of our patent holdings. In FY2018, we increased both the number of technical presentations and number of patents held by a substantial factor of 1.4 over FY2014. In terms of the quality of our technology as well, the number of OMRON technical papers selected by leading scientific meetings has increased, while we have nearly doubled the ratio of patents offering promise of making significant contributions to our business. These are solid results. This shows how far we’ve raised the bar on our ability to implement into technologies into society from across OMRON.
We are also seeing the creation of near future technologies and concepts such as technology that integrates the learning models of artificial intelligence (AI) using distributed data, platforms that remotely control robots, and the image inspection technology that can replicate human senses and other unique near future technologies.
– I can see how you’ve managed to improve both the template and the technology. What are some of the tasks that lie ahead for OMRON? As we have improved our skills in technology management, new issues have emerged as we further accelerate our response to Innovation driven by social needs. That is, how do we create innovation with high social value that is accompanied by technological innovation. As we see in the case of the city of Maizuru, we have set up a process for creating innovation with high value to society that involves designing for the near

future with social issues as the starting point, and then implementing these designs in society. We are also training people who can engage in that process. However, for OMRON to continue as a venture that on its own creates an autonomous society, we need to create innovation that has high social value and technical innovation that can solve future social issues that no one can anticipate. In the project with the city of Maizuru, we are demonstrating social value and are studying ways to further enhance innovation through technology. To that end, in FY 2019, we will closely focus on creating new value to increase social value and on strengthening competitiveness with advanced technology to bring about technological innovation. Specifically, we will focus on strengthening human resources, structure, and on knowledge management.
It is urgent in particular that we train architect human resources that can build the technology and intellectual property strategies and business models that will be essential to run the innovation creation process at IXI. We also need people at the Technology & Intellectual Property Headquarters who can leverage AI, robotics, and other core technologies to fuel the process of technical innovation. These types of people are hard to find in the employment marketplace, so we have to train them and increase their numbers ourselves. That’s why IXI has created a new internal strategic human resources development organization. In FY 2018, we identified conceptual ability, communications ability, and the ability to carry tasks to completion as the three elements required of architect human resources. These are the abilities needed in the areas of technology strategy, intellectual property strategy, and creating business models. We also assessed the degree to which each of these abilities are needed. To expand our capabilities in these areas, we will be training strategic human resources candidates who are participating from throughout the company by having them engage in a variety of experiences in the innovation creation process that has been developed by IXI. Core technology human resources start from the definitions of capability requirements, making reference to IXI’s human resource development process. Meanwhile, the Technology & Intellectual Property Headquarters is
Advancing into the Future and Moving to Still- higher Levels of Innovation.
Social innovation (Social value is high)

continuing the training of human resources through the implementation of policies that facilitate the search for new technologies.
We’re also creating opportunities for people to gain experience in testing out intuitive ideas and giving shape to these ideas through systems designed to enhance both social and technical value. We are creating opportunities for team members to refine their ideas through the process of discussion and debate with people who have a different outlooks and a diversity of knowledge.
The expertise gained from success stories at IXI through the experience of running their processes along with the value creation expertise of the Technology & Intellectual Property Headquarters will be accumulated as organizational knowledge to ensure reproducibility and continuity. This organizational knowledge will be transformed into assets that can be deployed throughout OMRON. OMRON’s technology management has frameworks such as stances, strategies, processes, organizations, and systems as well as the human resources to put these in to action. Going forward, we will develop knowledge management, which is an all-out battle to bring together company-wide knowledge that are organically linked to frameworks and human resources to maximize results. We will also create the conditions in which we generate a series of responses to social needs in every OMRON organization.
You can expect more innovation driven by social needs from OMRON.

Common Issues on Production Floors
Production floors are entering a period of major transition. This includes changes of nee needs in manufactured items and methods, manufacturing locations, and manufacturing personnel. Changing needs in manufactured items and methods reflect urgent requirements to produce more advanced, more compact, high quality products associated with CASE*1, 5G, and other industry changes. Changing needs in manufacturing locations have been affected by trade friction between the United States and China. This trade frictions lead to accelerated local production and consumption, requiring standard product quality from production sites distributed around the world and faster ramp- up of production facilities. Changing needs in manufacturing personnel reflect rising personnel costs and an aging society. Every manufacturer struggles with a serious shortage of personnel on production floor and skilled technicians, in particular. These needs rapidly increase as time passes.
Meanwhile, the pace of advancement is accelerating for AI, IoT, robotics, and other technological innovations and changes in seeds. These rapid technological changes will prove to be a tailwind in resolving the changing needs of production floors.

 Further Evolution of the i-BELT Subscription Service
In 2017, OMRON launched i-BELT, a business model that offers innovative-Automation to customers. This is a subscription service in which OMRON engineers work together with customers at their production floors using data to provide service and maintenance, as well as to improve production lines. Working closely with customers on their production floors allows us to collect and analyze a range of data. This, in turn, allows us to identify issues and propose new solutions. Furthermore, the expertise in controls gathered from production floors leads to new businesses. By building closer, ongoing relationships with customers through i-BELT, we reproduce the craftsmanship required for tasks that include predictive maintenance for device abnormalities and the adjustment of cutting speed in fabrication equipment. These activities were once the sole domain of highly skilled workers.

The relay technologies became the basis to establish the Tateishi Electronics Company by our founder Kazuma Tateishi The relay technologies refined by our founder Kazuma Tateishi Inoue Electric Manufacturing Company became the basis upon which the Tateishi Electronics Company was later established. A relay is a part that receives an external electrical signal to turn an electrical circuit on and off. Relays are also used for switching. Relays that are incorporated in electronic devices receive an electrical signal, turning a switch on or off to transmit the signal to another device. For example, pressing a button on a remote sends a signal to a relay within the television, which turns the main power switch on. Relay has many types depends on the amount of electric current,and circuits, and application. This technology eventually led OMRON to the development of the world’s first contactless switch, the driver behind our rapid advancements in this age of machine automation.
In these days, our relay technologies are used in high-capacity DC relays for hybrid and electric vehicles and supporting the high demand. In the same way, the range of technologies underpinning the Electronic and Mechanical Components Business have developed in step with changes in society and are used for many familiar products in our daily life. For example, the face detection technology, (the OKAO Vision) is used in digital cameras and other devices to detect human faces automatically. Ultra-compact, advanced MEMS microphone chips are used in compact microphones for mobile devices.
Sensor technologies were initially utilized in automated production floors, and now those have been adapted to detect human movements. These detectors provide notice of guest arrivals and are used as environmental sensors in agricultural applications. In fact, sensors are useful in various scenes as part of the social infrastructure.

 An Evolution in Manufacturing for Self-Driving and Automotive Electrification
To raise our contribution to safety, security, and environmental friendliness, we focus on products vital to connected and electric-based driving based on the four industry changes called for under CASE (Connected, Autonomous, Shared/Service, Electric). We have two particular strengths here: Active safety for automated driving and power supply control for electrification.
We deploy advanced forward-recognition technologies in the field of advanced driving support and other areas of active safety to help make automated driving a reality. We incorporate on-board driver protection technologies that determine whether a driver is concentrating on driving, and we are developing products and services for advanced sensing inside and outside the vehicle. In this way, we create new value in driving support and safety.
Our power supply control products use DC/DC voltage converters capable of high-efficiency power conversion used in electric vehicles. This is one way in which we meet customer requirements for the new mobility society.
Our ultra-high-efficiency power units increase the performance of electric vehicles and environmentally friendly devices to convert DC voltage efficiently.
An Innovative Production Model Line for Eco-Friendly DC/DC Converters
DC/DC converters are an essential component for electric vehicles. Compared to other products manufactured at OAE( Omron Automotive Electronics), DC/DC converters are relatively large and heavy with a large number of components. These products are also very complex to assemble. Production line design was extremely challenging given the customer requirements for stable high quality.
  To overcome these challenges, we chose to pursue a new production model line concept rather than attempt full automation. This concept incorporated an optimal relationship between human and machine, a production line producing only quality products, and non-stop production. Our ongoing efforts to meet these challenges has led to co-creation in our production technologies, leading to innovative production model lines and greater appreciation by our customers.
Nothing great is ever achieved without taking on challenges. We had the courage to take the first step and to keep believing in our job, all the while maintaining a steady focus on the OMRON Principles and the needs of society. Our insistence on involving other parties was on key leading to the success of this large, global-scale project.

 New Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business Initiatives Looking Ahead to 2030
The Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB) is active in the four domains of transportation, energy, lifestyle services, and community. In the community domain, the SSB uses a storehouse of expertise to work with local governments, such as Maizuru City (Kyoto Prefecture), to launch initiatives for creating a smart society looking ahead to the year 2030. The genesis of this project was a suggestion from OMRON SINICX Corporation, an OMRON company facilitating open innovation.
Case Study: Initiatives with Maizuru City
Regional cities in Japan are seeing continuing declines in population. This means a shrinking revenue base for local governments, which makes providing satisfactory services to residents more difficult. To solve this problem requires regional cities become autonomous. By “autonomous,” we mean cities that make the most of their resources for their own betterment, that look for ways in which residents can enjoy physical and mental health, that offer help when needed, and that encourage residents achieve their own desires.
Our efforts in Maizuru City (Kyoto Prefecture) are leading toward a cooperative, fulfilled society that utilizes IT to help each other. We believe that projects forming connections between people, between people and communities, and between communities and communities create closer relationships in
which people look out for one another. In this case, we are developing a matching
  system in which those requiring help with various aspects of daily life can connect to those willing to provide help.
The key to success for this type of matching system is to tailor to the needs of the local community and environment, designing in trustworthiness guarantees and incentives. This is in contrast to general matching systems used in major metropolitan cities and overseas. The team formed by Maizuru and OMRON is current conducting local surveys and validation tests for the system. Many challenges exist in creating a new type of cooperative story that has no monetary objective. We believe that solving these problems one-by-one will help Japan’s regional cities achieve sustainable growth.

To prevent and relieve knee pain, the muscles that support the knee must remain strong. Walking is a very important preventive measure. However, the act of walking for people suffering from knee pain can be a challenge, both physically and mentally. Unable to put up with this pain, people often stop walking, which leads to a negative cycle of decreased muscle strength and even further aggravation in muscle pain. Knee TENS supports the knee during walking, while providing electrical stimulation to relieve knee pain.
This device makes walking easier, helping strengthen the muscles and creating a positive cycle which prevents and mitigates knee pain.
We want to improve the quality of life for as many people who suffer from knee pain as possible, stopping the negative circle of locomotive syndrome, the resulting difficulty in walking, and the need for nursing care.

Issues Confronting the Energy Management Market
   Global climate change resulting from rising CO2 emissions, the depletion of fossil fuels, frequent natural disasters, and soaring fuel costs, demonstrate the need for more use of clean energy in society. In corporate activities, we see a movement to rethink energy usage systems, including the effective use of renewable energy. Additionally, there is an urgent need to adapt to rapid changes in environmental laws and regulations and BCP*1. In response, we see global measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with COP21*2. Japan has set a goal to increase the ratio of renewable energy used from 15 percent in 2015, to between 22 and 24 percent by fiscal 2030. Japan also expects to double the ratio of solar power, from 3.3 percent to 7.0 percent.
More effect use and delivery of optimal control for power conditioners in solar power and energy storage systems will help spread renewable energy. This, in turn, will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which is required to bring about a sustainable society.

Accelerating the Growth of Our People and Our Organization, the Drivers of Innovative Creation
Employees are the most critical element to perform management based on the OMRON Principles. As employees supporting the growth of OMRON, we enjoy our work and commit to building an attractive company that accepts the challenge of creating social needs that solve social issues. The human resources strategy goal under VG2.0 is to create a strong company that fosters our people, provides an enjoyable work environment, and encourages high performance. By accelerating the growth of our people and our organization, drivers of innovation at OMRON, we raise our ability to create social needs. We have defined three key global initiatives to accomplish this goal:
Corresponding SDGs
    Key Global Initiatives
Foster leaders who will drive management and business
Hire, train, and make effective use of a diverse employee base Encourage self-motivated employees
These key global initiatives are tied closely to the OMRON Principles. In particular, we would like to foster leaders who drive management and business. These are people who look at society from a future-oriented perspective, who always think and act in pursuit of the true issues, who declare and pursue high goals, and who act with integrity at all times, no matter what the business environment. These are all examples of living values that reflect the OMRON Principles. OMRON engages in three unique processes to place our human resources strategy in position to raise the ability of all employees to practice the OMRON Principles. These processes strengthen the OMRON Principles by creating understanding and general awareness, encouraging empathy and resonance, and incorporating monitoring and improvement activities. The first process is to create an understanding and general awareness of the OMRON Principles internally. Here, management engages directly with employees through dialogues to further employee understanding and inspire employees to demonstrate leadership in practicing the OMRON Principles.
The second process is to share examples of employees putting the OMRON Principles into action to encourage empathy and resonance. A major part of this process is the OMRON Global Awards (TOGA), which we have held every year since fiscal 2012. We recognize the outstanding efforts of employees that lead directly to solving social issues, which inspires others to see ways to practice the OMRON Principles in their own sphere.

Linking Direct Input by Employees to Solving Social Issues
OMRON implemented the VOICE engagement survey in 2016 for management to listen directly to feedback from our global workforce. This is an initiative for OMRON management to ensure sustainable growth, measuring the attractiveness of OMRON as a workplace, understanding and identifying management issues, and taking action to solve those issues. Based on VOICE results, management engages in discussions and continues to conduct reforms to make OMRON a more attractive company in which to work.
Based on results from the previous year, OMRON adopted and further strengthened our global communications infrastructure during fiscal 2018. We also revised IT systems and engaged in other operations process innovations during the year. In response to the expectations of our highly motivated employees in Japan who are ready for new challenges, we worked to create an environment and mechanisms to provide for a diverse range of opportunities. As one example, we introduced a system for recruiting employees to existing openings in other departments. We also created an application system, providing employees with opportunities to advertise their talents and challenge themselves at new jobs. In addition to collecting and scoring data, OMRON solicits free-form comments from employees directly. Based on these comments, management identifies true needs and formulates next steps. OMRON will continue to use VOICE results as a basis to further improve management decision-making speed, to strengthen our communication as an organization, and to identify other important issues that spur management discussions and reforms.

~Aiming for Effective, Open Communications~
Statistics from OMRON’s fiscal 2017 VOICE results for diversity and mutual respect in the Asia Pacific region indicated that employees want more effective, open communications. The most common issue identified is that the efforts of management in the spirit of the OMRON Principles to incorporate diverse employee views and opinions is not being communicated to employees sufficiently. With employees working in nine countries throughout the Asia Pacific region, we came to believe that unconscious attitudes and behavior particular to each cultural background could negatively impact employee motivation and the workplace environment.
Therefore, OMRON implemented a training program emphasizing diversity
and acceptance of all employees. We held this training twice in Singapore
during fiscal 2018, attended by 43 senior managers. The training defined the
concepts of workplace diversity, unconscious attitudes and behaviors, and
micro behaviors (split-second behaviors demonstrating a person’s emotions). Training delved deeper into examples of these behaviors, helping attendees reflect on their own stereotypes and unconscious attitudes. Finally, attendees discussed how these stereotypes and attitudes could hinder respect for diversity in the workplace and have a negative impact on business.
The scope of these training activities has been expanded to include employees. Here, participants are learning how to build workplace environments that are accepting of diversity. In fiscal 2019, we will accelerate Diversity & Inclusion through activities over wide OMRON.

The OMRON Global Awards (TOGA)
The circle of resonance that originates fromTOGA now involves outside OMRON as well, and will certainly spur new “innovation driven by social needs.” In this article, we highlight theTOGA story that began in 2012 and several presentations from the 2018 edition of TOGA.
TOGA Begins as the Passion of One Employee
The inspiration for TOGA began in the vision of Irawan Santoso, president of PT.OMRON MANUFACTURING OF INDONESIA (OMI), as a means to practice the OMRON Principles in our Indonesian production centers. Santoso’s aspiration for the OMRON Principles ranged far beyond OMRON’s manufacturing plants to include nearby factories and the Indonesian government in a program to employ disabled individuals. At the 2012 event to celebrate OMRON’s founding, Santoso was recognized with the Special Challenge Award, citing his outstanding example of practicing the OMRON Principles. Said OMRON CEO Yoshihito Yamada, “I believe there are many more examples out there of employees putting the OMRON Principles into practice. We would like to uncover these current and future examples, sharing, supporting, and recognizing the efforts of OMRON employees.” From this idea, TOGA was born.

      OMI President
Irawan Santoso
After being named president of OMI in 2007, I had the opportunity to visit OMRON TAIYO Co., Ltd. (Oita Prefecture, Japan), the world’s first factory designed for the disabled. There, I saw disabled individuals working enthusiastically, maximizing their talents and expressing their individuality. These employees leveraged their respective strengths, complementing and compensating in areas where others may be weaker. Seeing the situation at OMRON TAIYO, I felt a strong desire to create the same type of workplace in Indonesia where all people could shine. After returning to Indonesia, we went about creating a rewarding workplace for both able-bodies and disabled individuals, going beyond our existing efforts already in place. After an extended period of effort, we created a program in 2010 to train and hire disabled persons. As a result, we doubled the hiring rate of the previous year, recruiting 30 individuals. I will continue to create rewarding environments for all people throughout the world.

Solving Social Issues Through Our Businesses
IoT-Based Waste Treatment Contributes to a Change in Environmental Awareness
Insufficient landfill for waste and environmental pollution arising from toxic substances in landfills are a serious issue in Australia. In response, the Australian central government set a goal to significantly reduce landfill waste by the year 2030.
Wanting to help solve this social issue that will impact not only our own
generation, but also that of our children, we included engineers from
Singapore and Japan to develop a smart dumpster for commercial use. This
smart dumpster uses a combination of IoT and Big Data technologies.
Commercial-use smart dumpsters are large receptacles for collecting trash
produced by businesses at shopping centers and other locations. These
dumpsters consist of two separate sections, one for general waste that goes
to landfills and one for recycling. To raise awareness of the environment
among businesses, general waste is assessed a fee based on volume, while
trash for recycling is free. These dumpsters offer benefits to collection
companies as well. Dumpsters are outfitted with mechanisms to provide
information about current status and collection timing via the internet. This
system means more efficient collection truck operations, less road damage
due to over-heavy collection trucks, and other optimized overall operating
costs. To date, more than 200 smart dumpsters have been installed, with
more installations every day. While this project was effort by the Industrial
Automation Business to expand our range of businesses, we feel a sense of pride in contributing to the central government’s goal of reducing landfill waste and in contributing to the creation of a more sustainable society. We will continue this initiative to provide a better society for our children.

  The Chinese market is experiencing rising demand for home-use medical
equipment, as well as an explosion in the popularity of online shopping. The
pressing need in response to these environmental changes is a platform for
customers to purchase what they want, any time they want. The key word
here is speed. As a manufacturer of OMRON home-use medical equipment,
we at OMRON DALIAN decided that if we could increase production speed,
we could deliver needed OMRON home-use medical equipment to all people
when required. To achieve this vision, we set a goal to reduce lead time for
parts supply to one-tenth of the current time required. Some voiced doubts at
first, but people began to believe in my vision as Team OMRON came
together to pursue this goal. We conducted a complete review of our parts
suppliers and delivery routes, conducting simulation upon simulation. In the
end, we consolidated parts to a single storage warehouse. We also revised
how we opened parts packaging and packaging materials, continuing to try
ideas never attempted before. Over three years since 2016, we finally
reduced parts supply lead time to one-tenth of our original time. This initiative
also resulted in lower inventory levels and logistics costs. Reduced delivery
frequency also means reduced CO2 emissions. These benefits have been a result of practicing the OMRON Principles. OMRON DALIAN will continue striving for all people to have ready access to the health equipment they want, contributing to healthy and comfortable lives.

Highlights of the TOGA Program
TOGA encourages employees to set their own goals to help them experience the connection between their work and the OMRON Principles. The aim of this initiative is to foster a culture of ongoing aspirations to put the OMRON Principles into practice. We share and publicly praise OMRON Principles practiced in everyday work and workplaces, expanding the circle of empathy and resonance in practicing the OMRON Principles.
The TOGA program is ongoing throughout the year. Thirteen teams that pass preliminary selections from our organizations around the world are invited to come to Kyoto to present their TOGA initiatives at the OMRON Global Meet. These teams bring back news of how other team initiatives were received to their local workplaces, sharing their experiences with their co-workers and expand the resonating circle throughout the world.
The TOGA Process
TOGA is designed based on the SECI* Model of knowledge management in which the tacit knowledge of an individual is drawn out to become shared knowledge throughout an organization. OMRON engages in a cycle of setting inspirational goals, taking action, and reviewing progress to share information and encourage buy-in throughout the entire year.
*SECI Model: A knowledge management mechanism produced by Hitotsubashi University professor Ikujiro Nonaka that focuses on knowledge creation activities. Through a conversion process of socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization, organizations can take the tacit knowledge of an individual and create shared knowledge throughout a group or organization. (Source: Globis University, Graduate School of Management MBA Glossary)
SevenYears of TOGA Evolution
In the seven years since its launch in fiscal 2012, TOGA has received entries a cumulative 31,000 entries from 275,000 people. This grassroots initiative to practice the OMRON Principles has taken root across the globe.
After OMRON revised the OMRON Principles in 2015, each company and division began conducting activities to clearly demonstrate the link between the principles and our business. As a result, TOGA projects have become more diversified, with more projects addressing innovation driven by social needs every year. The TOGA program itself has seen an evolution in the content of employee submissions. And the circle of resonance that originates from TOGA has expanded to include individuals even from outside OMRON.

Corresponding SDGs
Building an environment for a sustainable society is part of improving lives and contributing to a better society, as stated in the OMRON Principles. In support of this ideal, we pursue initiatives under our Green OMRON 2020 environmental vision. Green OMRON 2020 sets six environmental targets as goals for 2020. Of these goals, Reductions of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Appropriate Management and Reduction of the use of Hazardous Substances were two on which we focused in 2017 as important company-wide sustainability initiatives.
Initiatives to Achieve OMRON Carbon Zero, Aiming for Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Fiscal 2050
  In July 2018, OMRON set OMRON Carbon Zero as a new target aiming for zero greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal 2050. In line with this initiative and in response to climate change and global warming, we changed our greenhouse gas emissions indicator from net sales to CO2 emissions to total emissions. Using 2016 greenhouse gas emissions quantities as a baseline, we backcast from 2050 to develop targets for 2030 and 2020.

    At OMRON, 90% of our greenhouse gas emissions are from our electricity usage. Therefore, our efforts regarding electricity usage are a priority issue. To this end, our basic policy is to minimize the amount of electricity used within OMRON and use renewable energy for business activities that contribute to corporate growth and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
In fiscal 2018, we reviewed electricity procurement methods for approximately 40% of OMRON’s electricity consumption in Japan. We began procuring electricity from renewable sources in the Kansai area of Japan in December 2018 and in June 2019 for the Kanto area of Japan.
In the future, we will expand these initiatives to Asia and other regions, looking towards zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

  The OMRON Principles are the foundation of everything we do. OMRON Corporate motto is to improve lives and contribute to a better society. In terms of the environment, this means using our business activities to reduce environmental impact and increase our contribution to the environment, helping others live a secure and comfortable life in a true sustainable society. We believe our mission is to pass on a better society to future generations. In pursuit of this mission, we promote environmental activities as part of our day-to-day practice of the OMRON Principles.

Initiatives to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
OMRON’s environmental actions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are twofold. First, reduce the environmental impact through our business activities and second, contribute to the environment by providing society with valuable products and services. One example of reducing the environmental burden through our business activities is promoting energy-savings by visualizing energy consumption in our facilities. This includes air conditioning and lighting on factory product floors and providing optimum control of this equipment in line with production status. We are also installing solar power facilities in our buildings. Examples of reducing our environmental burden through our business is our power conditioners, used for solar power generation, and storage batteries. These products facilitate the efficient use of generated electricity (measured as environmental contribution). At the same time, our products provide energy systems and services for local production and consumption linked to regional revitalization.

Integrated Risk Management Supporting Global Business Activities
Corresponding SDGs
  At the same time we began executing VG2020, we also launched our existing integrated risk management program. Our risk management platform reflects the sentiment of top management that the faster pace of change in the operating environment and rising levels of uncertainty calls for preparation and rapid response to risk. Management felt the need for OMRON to become
more attuned to risk, addressing risks at the earliest stages.
OMRON must deal with a variety of risks as we continue to expand our businesses globally. In response, we have categorized the entire spectrum of risks that impact management performance and financial health. Having categorized these risks, we then chart their interrelationships.
We use this framework as a link between management and the local workplace, helping management work with local staff to engage in risk management that resolves issues that must be dealt with at levels above the local workplace. VG2.0 includes measures related to business risk management that supports innovative creation.
*Graphic representation of the business risks as shown on https://www.omron.co.jp/ir/keiei/risk.html
Integrated Risk Management Structure
OMRON has established PDCA activities that are conducted throughout the year to analyze risks, respond to critical risks, and engage in crisis management. For example, we summarize and share past examples of risk internally throughout the group. We formalize this shared framework into a document titled OMRON Group Rules Based on the OMRON Principles. This document clarifies the role of risk management in OMRON Group management.

Initiatives to Strengthen Compliance Through Instilling Ethics Rules
One example of living the values in the OMRON Principles is to exercise responsibility and good sense in obeying the law and the rules of society. In fiscal 2016, we began a global expansion of Corporate Ethics Month activities from Japan to encourage all employees to put this action into practice.
The OMRON Corporate Ethics Month serves as an opportunity to take a fresh look at whether our business initiatives are honest with society from a perspective of compliance with laws and rules, returning back to the origins of the OMRON Principles. We have designated October every year as our Corporate Ethics Month. During the month, we provide opportunities to instill ethics in our employees and conduct ethics training.
To expand these activities globally, we have asked staff responsible for risk management from every division across the world to serve as core members in discussing best methods for our activities to take root globally. As a result, we have decided to engage shared group initiatives based on the OMRON Principles. We will also add initiatives customized to the laws, customs, and other attributes in regions on the forefront of our businesses. In fiscal 2018, in addition to translating CEO Yoshihito Yamada’s message into 25 languages for distribution to all global employees, we also put independent rules for ethical conduct in place in each region. One example is our response to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which significantly strengthens personal information protection. Here, we have gone to great lengths to make this issue more familiar to our employees, providing information about the new rules as we tailor our response to meet the issues of the times.
By sponsoring these types of initiatives to raise awareness of ethics, we achieved a 77 percent positive response related to Practicing Ethics and Honesty in our fiscal 2018 VOICE engagement survey. The third-party entity conducting the survey for use indicated that this was a very healthy situation for a company. P61 Human Resources Management
In the Asia Pacific area, OMRON held an event to raise ethics awareness In EU area,instilling Corporate Ethics at OMRON Through Educational among all employees. The event encouraged employees to wear green, Posters, E-Learning Training

Whistleblowing System Available to Employees and Families
OMRON has established the OMRON Group Rules for Ethical Conduct, which provides for respect for human rights through our organization and employees, creating a workplace respectful of labor standards, prohibiting private actions that may harm the safety of OMRON products and services or the OMRON brand, and more. We have created a Whistleblowing System (internal reporting and consultation desk) for use in the event of violations or potential violations of rules, helping the company quickly identify and resolve such issues. Since establishing the system in Japan in 2003, we have expanded the system globally in formats tailored to each region. We have set up liaison desks both inside and outside the company. Our internal desk is staffed by local legal affairs departments, while our external desk is overseen by specialist organizations and attorneys. These desks are available not only to full-time OMRON employees, but also to contract employees, part-time employees, temporary staff, and families, including those at OMRON affiliate companies. Internal rules require strict confidentiality and prohibit retaliatory action. Further, we publicize this system through bulletin boards, internal training, and other means. In fiscal 2018, OMRON received 83 notifications and requests for advice.

 Responding to Natural Disasters
Responding to Natural Disasters
Corresponding SDGs
During fiscal 2018, major earthquakes in northern Osaka, Hokkaido, Indonesia, and Mexico, as well as heavy rain and large typhoons in western Japan, were natural disasters with the potential to threaten the continuity of OMRON businesses.
Since the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, OMRON has been working to fulfill our supply and business continuity social responsibilities. We have also strengthened our response to risks such as natural disasters, which we can only expect to increase.
Stronger Procurement BCP Via Supplier and Risk Management Systems
As a manufacturer, we believe in the importance of fulfilling our supply responsibilities and thereby raising our corporate value. As part of our efforts to minimize the impact of natural disasters on customers and our own business, we took the lessons learned from the Great East Japan Earthquake, and in 2012 implemented the OMRON Supplier and Risk Management System (SRM), a countermeasure against procurement risk. SRM is an application software installed on enterprise systems to manage the location and parts manufacturing information related to global suppliers.
During the Great East Japan Earthquake, many suppliers of semiconductors and electronic components in the Tohoku region suffered damages that had an extensive impact on our components procurement network. We spent more than one month in understanding and identifying parts and production information, leading to an extended period of uncertainty about production recovery.
We built SRM as a response to the lessons learned at that time. In the wake of the Kumamoto earthquakes in 2016, we created guidelines for procurement BCP operations, while continuing to refine both operations and systems. Today, we can use information obtained via SRM during a disaster to identify components produced by suppliers in the area and products made from said components. This information allows us to conduct simulations and assess the impact on our business within 24 hours.
The OMRON SRM and procurement BCP showed its effectiveness during the 2018 Mexico earthquake, the northern Osaka earthquake, and the heavy rains in western Japan. We identified the situation at our suppliers and managed components quickly, meeting our responsibilities for procurement and supply as a manufacturer.

  OMRON engages in Procurement BCP not because of the potential for disaster, but with the knowledge that disasters will happen. Based on this stance we engage in measures to collect information constantly and to mitigate risks. Information accuracy is important for making a prompt response to emergencies. With the cooperation of our suppliers, we use an interactive system to secure information in a timely manner. Even during disasters, OMRON contributes to a sustainable society by meeting our responsibilities to supply our customers.

BCPTraining for Stronger Disaster Management
Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, OMRON has focused on disaster-response measures, as well as related training and education in every global location. Our efforts here are to prevent or mitigate human and property damage through prompt, correct initial response in the event of a disaster. We believe that we can only respond to a disaster to the extent that we have prepared. Therefore, we conduct drills in each location around the world, assuming the type of disaster that may occur, aiming to improve employee awareness of disaster and disaster-response capabilities.
In addition to initial response training, evacuation
training, safety confirmation training, and other training
for all employees, OMRON has been engaged in
business continuity planning (BCP) training since 2012, mainly in Japan, which has a propensity for natural disasters such as earthquakes and typhoons. Our preparation proved itself in the Kumamoto earthquake of April 2016. While OMRON facilities in Kumamoto and Oita suffered damage, we incurred no major interruptions to production. OMRON RELAY & DEVICES Corporation, a production center for electronic components, quickly confirmed the safety of employees and production quality. In fact, OMRON RELAY & DEVICES was one of the earliest companies in Kumamoto to return to regular production. This outstanding performance was the result of regular disaster preparedness training, as well as BCP training conducted in 2014 in anticipation of earthquakes.
To incorporate the experience and expertise cultivated through these Japanese-based training programs throughout the entire OMRON Group, we began rolling out BCP training globally in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2018, we conducted training in 15 locations, mainly in Asia, China, and Japan, which represent the bulk of our production centers. In BCP training, senior management and crisis-management personnel at each site create scenarios based on the experience and perspective of OMRON in past disasters. Responses are formulated based on these projected scenarios. This type of training allows OMRON to improve our ability to predict situations, share awareness of disaster-preparedness among member companies, and minimize the impact of disasters on our business.
Disaster-response and BCP training raise employee awareness of prevention. At the same time, we focus on knowledge management to ensure training and experience from disasters become knowledge assets. Our ongoing efforts will lead directly to employee safety, to meeting our supply responsibility, and to ensuring OMRON business continuity.

  OMRON takes measures to prevent indirect risk, direct risk, and to prevent damages to our business and our employees. We also employ safety measures to protect against the event of risk and damage. I have a personal desire to support OMRON Group businesses by going out into the field to work with local workplaces to engage in day-to-day safety measures for the employees who work at OMRON. Through local experience and sharing what I learn with the rest of the OMRON Group, I help protect the safety of our employees and contribute to the further development of our business.

Message from the Chairman
 OMRON Continues to Improve Our Unique Governance Mechanisms from Viewpoint of Society, Striving for Sustainable Enhancement of Corporate Value
August 2019 Chairman
Fumio Tateishi
Management Based on the OMRON Principles and Corporate Governance
To improve lives and contribute to a better society. OMRON’s Corporate Motto, established in 1959, reflects two desires of our founder. The first is an aspiration to contribute to a better society through business. The second is a declaration that OMRON will be a leader in creating a better society. When we officially changed our name to OMRON in 1990, we created the OMRON Principles as a way to
carry on our Corporate Motto. Since that time, we have revised these principles three times to match our development as a company and the changing times, relying on the OMRON Principles as the bedrock of our management. The objective of corporate governance at OMRON is to ensure we practice the OMRON Principles and create rising levels of corporate value.

Corporate Governance Policies Unique to OMRON
OMRON strives for elevated transparency and fairness in management, emphasizing organic communications between supervisory and front- line execution functions to generate greater speed in our business. In other words, the role of OMRON corporate governance is to be a mechanism for innovation driven by social needs and sustainable corporate value growth.
OMRON balances the dynamic relationship between governance controls and management by clearly separating the supervisory and business execution roles in the company. The chairperson acts as the chair of the board of directors, while the CEO serves as the person ultimately responsible for business management. This system has evolved over 23 years since we established the Management Personnel Advisory Committee in 1996. And our Long-Term Vision, created in 1991, has been the foundation for making this possible. By maintaining a long-term vision, we have evolved corporate governance as a support for innovation driven by social needs and our ongoing aspirations for more innovation.
In 2017, we revised our director remuneration system, raising the ratios of medium- and long- term performance-linked compensation. We did this to further motivate our directors to practice the OMRON Principles and strive to raise corporate value over the medium and long term. We use the voluntary disclosure of this director remuneration policy to demonstrate our commitment to sustainable corporate value improvement to our stakeholders and encourage a better understanding of our management philosophy and initiatives.
In recognition of our commitment, OMRON received the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award in the first-ever Corporate Governance of the Year 2018. This award is sponsored by the Japan Association of Corporate Directors. In particular, OMRON was noted for our president selection and succession plan, operated under the CEO Selection Advisory Committee. The selection of a corporate president is the first order of business for corporate governance. Here, OMRON was singled out for high transparency in the selection process, the ongoing effectiveness of our CEO Selection Advisory Committee, and our
track record in selecting presidents. This recognition has become another motivation for future improvement.
Building Greater Corporate Value
We have entered our third year operating under the VG2.0 medium-term management plan. Looking at our external environment, we see continued uncertainty in the global situation stemming from U.S.-China trade friction. In these times, businesses must be even more capable of responding to environmental change. OMRON aspires to solve social issues, backcasting from the future, rather than focusing on the short term.
More specifically, in 2017 we established key sustainability issues which we address by solving social issues through our businesses and by answering the expectations of our stakeholders. Sustainable corporate value growth relies on an approach combining initiatives for key sustainability issues with our VG2.0 medium-term management plan. As the result of a board of director evaluation, the OMRON board of directors identified sustainability as a key management policy and continue to address sustainability in board discussions.
We began conducting board of director evaluations in 2015, performed by the Corporate Governance Committee, which consists of outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board. The results of these evaluations are used to determine policies for the operation of the board of directors and key topics for the next fiscal year. In so doing, we strive to raise sustainable corporate value through exercising oversight and lifting board effectiveness. In fiscal 2019, we will once again operate our board based on these policies to achieve VG2.0 and exercise our oversight function looking ahead to our next long-term vision, which will begin in fiscal 2021.
OMRON will continue to rely on the OMRON Principles, improving our unique corporate governance mechanisms from the viewpoint of society, striving for sustainable enhancement of corporate value.

Corporate Governance Framework
OMRON has elected to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board.
The OMRON Board of Directors is made up of eight members to ensure substantive discussion and deliberations. OMRON has separated the management oversight and business execution functions within the company, creating a system whereby the majority of Board Directors are not engaged directly in business operations. We have also adopted a policy setting the ratio of outside directors to at least one-third of the total number of directors on the board.
To increase objectivity on behalf of the Board of Directors, the titles and roles of chairman of the Board and President (CEO) have been separated. The Chairman serves as chair of the Board of Directors with no direct corporate representational authority.
OMRON has established several advisory committees to enhance the oversight functions of the Board of Directors. These committees include the Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection Advisory Committee, the Compensation Advisory Committee, and the Corporate Governance Committee. The Personnel Advisory Committee, the CEO Selection Advisory Committee, and the Compensation Advisory Committee are all chaired by outside directors with at least half of the committee members being outside directors. The CEO is not a member of any of these committees. The chair and members of the Corporate Governance Committee are outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board. This structure offers another layer of transparency and objectivity to the decision-making process.
In these policies, OMRON has created a hybrid governance framework that combining the best features of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board and a company with a Nomination Committee.
Outside directors and outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board attended the 13 meetings of the Board of Directors held during fiscal 2018 at a rate of 100%. Outside members had an attendance rate of 96.2% at the 13 meetings of the Audit & Supervisory Board.

Director Compensation
OMRON has set up the Compensation Advisory Committee for the purpose of bolstering the management oversight function of the Board of Directors by enhancing transparency and objectivity in determining compensation amounts for each director and executive officer.
In response to a consultation request from the chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates on and makes recommendations regarding the Compensation Policy for Directors. The Compensation Advisory Committee also deliberates on and determines the Compensation Policy for Executive Officers in response to a consultation request from the CEO. Reflecting the committee’s recommendations, the Board of Directors determines the Compensation Policy for Directors.
Based on the above-mentioned respective Compensation Policy, the Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates on compensation of Directors and Executive Officers. Director compensation is based on input from the Compensation Advisory Committee. The board of directors considers this input to determines director compensation within the scope approved by a resolution at the general meeting of shareholders. The amount of executive officer compensation is determined in accord with deliberations and reports from the Compensation Advisory Committee.
These amounts shall be within the maximum limit of the sum of compensation amounts for all directors, as set by a
resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders. The amounts of compensation for individual executive officers
shall be determined according to the recommendations of the Compensation Advisory Committee.

 Overview of Compensation Structure for Directors
(1) Compensation Composition Ratio
Compensation consists of a “base salary” (fixed compensation) and compensation according to Company performance, namely “short-term performance-linked compensation (bonuses)” and “medium-to-long-term, performance-linked compensation (Performance-linked and Share-based Incentive Plan).” The ratio of compensation consisting of performance-linked compensation compared to base salary has been determined for each role:
(2) Base Salary
A base salary is paid to Directors as fixed compensation. Base salaries are determined for each role by taking into account the salary levels of officers at other companies (benchmarked companies of the same industry and scope selected by the Compensation Advisory Committee), as surveyed by a specialized outside organization.
(3) Short-term Performance-linked Compensation (Bonuses)
Bonuses are paid to Directors excluding Directors (Independent) as short-term performance-linked compensation, which is linked to yearly performance indicators and the degree of achievement of performance targets. Director bonuses vary between 0% and 200% according to the achievement of operating income, net income, and ROIC targets defined in the annual operating plan.
(4) Medium-to-long-term, Performance-linked Compensation (Performance-linked and Sharebased Incentive Plan)
Stock compensation is paid as medium-to-long-term, performance-linked compensation to Directors excluding Directors (Independent). Stock compensation comprises the performance-linked component (60%), which is linked to the degree of achievement of the medium-term management plan, and the nonperformance- linked component (40%), which aims for retention and motivation to improve share prices over the medium- to long-term, and is paid under the condition of a certain term of service.
Stock compensation for performance-linked component varies between 0% and 200%, according to achievement of net sales, EPS, and ROE targets based on the medium-term management plan, as well as sustainability evaluation* based on a third-party organization.
As a rule, stock paid in stock-based compensation must be held by the individual during their term of service. In the event that an individual Director in question engages in serious misconduct during their term of service, and such misconduct harms the Company, the Compensation Advisory Committee will deliberate and make a recommendation. Based on this discussion and recommendation, the Board of Directors shall resolve to limit the payment of stock- based compensation.
* Sustainability evaluation
An evaluation based on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). The DJSI are a series of ESG Indices which include companies evaluated and selected based on long-term shareholder value perspective, reflecting economic, environmental, and social factors comprehensively.

Round Table Discussion
Especially in uncertain times, it is important to optimize the balance between corporate governance and dynamic execution.This is where the effectiveness of the Board of Directors comes into question. We started evaluating the effectiveness of our Board of Directors in fiscal 2015, in addition to the work we had been doing to strengthen our board’s oversight function to improve board effectiveness. We have taken this as an opportunity to change operations of the Board of Directors into something similar to a monitoring board* which focuses on discussions of medium- and long-term issues. In this feature, we invited OMRON’s outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members to participate in a round-table discussion to speak frankly about the characteristics of OMRON’s governance and future issues.
† Fumio Tateishi, Chairman of the Board of Directors served as facilitator for this round-table discussion.
* Monitoring board: A board of directors that oversees business operations, focusing on the election and dismissal of officers. This typically corresponds to
a board of directors for a company that has a Nominating Committee or the like.

 Tateishi: I’d like to ask you for your frank impressions of the OMRON Board of Directors.
Kobayashi: The most important characteristic is that the Board of Directors encourages a free and open discussion, no matter whether the person speaking is an inside or outside director or member of the Audit & Supervisory Board. The knowledge and expertise of our outside directors should reaffirm OMRON’s policies and philosophy. We hold more meaningful discussions, even if opinions conflict at times. OMRON executives consider the requests and proposals of outside directors. These executives use the PDCA cycle to take on the many challenges they face, and it is my impression that the quality of governance is high. I feel we have even more to learn to contribute to the evolutionary process.
Nishikawa: Does this mean the members of Board of Directors discussing matters from various points of view? Working with the directors who also serve in an executive capacity, I feel that governance has evolved steadily each year by taking a diversity of opinions seriously and making improvements
accordingly. We outside directors are not simply looking at organization from the top down. We are also drawing on knowledge and experience from our respective fields to enhance corporate value. I believe that all members of the board share this objective.
Kamigama: The great thing about OMRON Board of Directors is that it is instilling the OMRON Principles among the people at the working level of the company. The other day, I attended The OMRON Global Awards (TOGA) conference. I was impressed by the presentations that showed OMRON Principles are being put into practice by OMRON employees around the world. Underlying a shared basic belief that a business should create value for society through its key practices, OMRON’s mission under the OMRON Principles is “To improve lives and contribute to a better society.” This fundamental approach informs the work of all OMRON employees, making OMRON fundamentally different from companies that think solely of their own profit. Although there is a clear distinction between the management oversight and executive functions of the OMRON Board of

Directors, the objective is identical: to put the OMRON Principles into practice. I am honored and pleased to participate in this vision as an outside director. P63 Human Resources Management (TOGA)
Uchiyama: Since you’re talking about the characteristics of the OMRON Board of Directors, I’d like to talk about the mechanisms that ensure the correct functioning of the board. The person chairing the Board of Directors important in ensuring board governance. When an executive chairs a board, there is a tendency for them to steer the board toward a conclusion. As a non- executive chair, Mr. Tateishi acts as a facilitator to draw out the experience and knowledge of outside directors, rather than head directly toward a predetermined conclusion. Directors and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board corporate auditors have different positions under the Companies Act. However, board meetings are managed without dwelling on those differences. Even as members of the Audit & Supervisory Board, we are allowed to participate actively in discussions. I think that’s quite important.
Kunihiro: I really like OMRON. What I like is that
both the Board of Directors and the people on the front lines are serious about OMRON Principles- based management and social responsibility. Solving social issues was a priority at OMRON long before people talked about ESG and SDGs. The company has many years to enhance corporate value under a long-term vision, rather than focusing on the short term. OMRON has been unwavering in this commitment. This is OMRON’s greatest strength. P19 VG2.0 Medium-Term Management Plan
Tateishi: In fiscal l2015, we introduced a board of directors evaluation system as a measure to improve the Board of Directors.The results of the evaluations are analyzed and reflected in the policies of the Board of Directors in the following year. Could you please share your impressions of this system?
Kobayashi: Since beginning board of directors evaluations in fiscal 2015, we have persistently used the PDCA cycle to define policies for the board of directors. For example, the board of directors and executives are conscientious in following up and making improvements to areas that have been given low marks in evaluations. As a result, evaluation results have been steadily improving. We also clarify medium- and long-term issues, using a straight-forward PDCA cycle to achieve goals. I think we are moving in a good direction.
Kamigama: As Mr. Kobayashi says, the issues identified by the Board of Directors are immediately addressed, the issues get clarified and are taken up in discussions of the Board of Directors. We don’t see that kind of engagement at other companies, but I think it’s really important.
Nishikawa: I very much appreciate this Board of Directors evaluation system. I personally believe that this Board of Directors evaluation system is a very effective “tool for dialogue” between company executives and outside directors. The system makes it possible for honest opinions to be expressed directly and for one to expect a sincere response in return. What I am most concerned

about in making evaluations is the need to make honest, unbiased assessments about what exactly is necessary to improve the value of OMRON. Uchiyama: OMRON Board of Directors evaluation system works very well. An area for future improvement is perform evaluations after every meeting. Even now, management themes are assessed after each meeting of the Board of Directors. Other than that, these themes are evaluated only once a year in March. We tend to forget matters addressed in annual evaluations over time. Everything becomes more homogenized. I think it’s best to do evaluations immediately after each meeting of the Board of Directors and use the PDCA cycle without delay to improve effectiveness. Kunihiro: My personal theory is that we must wring everything we can from our outside directors. Rather than passively listening to the ideas of outside directors, it may be necessary to take a more aggressive approach in squeezing out every

last bit of the expertise and experience of outside directors. The criteria for evaluating the Board of Directors should not be a general yardstick. It should incorporate the OMRON uniqueness and detailed focus that we consider so important. I think in this upcoming era, it will be important to engage in and disclose our own unique measures.
P85 Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Tateishi:The active involvement of outside directors is the driving force behind the evolution of OMRON’s corporate governance. Last, I’d like to hear your thoughts about your own roles as outside directors and how you are engaging in those roles.
Nishikawa: The most important thing in corporate governance is to answer the question of whether decisions are being made logically. Management is a continuous decision-making process, and the road to decisions has many twists and turns.
Our role is to watch and carefully determine whether the process is logical and whether the information collected is appropriate. It is also important for us to provide new data and perspectives. As an outside director, my job is not
to interfere with day-to-day execution, but to be proactive in providing information and knowledge that I believe to be useful.
Kamigama: As an outside director, I focus on and oversee my area of expertise. There is no question that decision-making logic is vitally important. I ask lots of questions based on my own expertise. Once I’m satisfied with the answers, I push from behind for progress. I think that’s our role. It is important to optimize the balance between corporate governance and the dynamic execution.
Kunihiro: I am always conscious of the need to point out that there are two sides to everything. OMRON has many strengths, but sometimes these can be weaknesses. My task as an Audit & Supervisory Board member is to provide viewpoints that may differ from the typical way of thinking at OMRON. I search for viewpoints that are lacking at OMRON and attempt to shake things up. I encourage debate, pushing like Mr. Kamigama when I am convinced of the result. I go out of my way to be skeptical for the sake of the company. In addition to serving as a check, outside directors also ensure that OMRON has a firm foundation from which to take aggressive leaps into the future. Uchiyama: I know this may sound obvious, but I am always conscious of the fact that I was appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. In other words, I must never neglect to see things from the stakeholders’ point of view. Further, audits must always be based on facts. Even as outside members of the Audit & Supervisory Board act as a check on the company, I am aware that observing Board of Director meeting deliberations to the greatest extent possible allows us to see what is being discussed in person. In this way, we have a better understanding of the underlying background and facts. In addition, our audit report relies heavily on accounting auditors. That’s why I believe we must help create an environment where the accounting firm can do its job more easily. Kobayashi: OMRON works hard to practice OMRON Principles-based management. For OMRON to make even more aggressive leaps forward, perhaps being less afraid of failure, being

 more brash, and demonstrating a bit more edginess could be beneficial. This is why I like to throw rocks into the pond and stir up the waters. By asking the tough questions about OMRON’s everyday business, I provide back-up for the management team and employees, so they can leap ahead with more boldness. In this respect sense, I ask questions from the view of a general bystander about the status quo at OMRON. I hope this proves useful to OMRON executives.
Tateishi: Having outside directors and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board who are skeptical in this way and yet so strongly committed to the company is a tremendous confidence-booster for OMRON. OMRON must never stop the process of evolution, so we can meet the high expectations of our stakeholders. I have a strong and renewed sense of the truth of this concept.Thank you all for your time today.

The Corporate Governance Committee evaluated each theme in the policy for the operation of the Board of Directors as follows.
As for strategies regarding information systems and quality in medium-term management strategies selected as a theme for the first time in the fiscal year under review, consensus on the future direction was fostered after the Board of Directors understood the current situation and received useful suggestions from Directors (Independent) and Audit & Supervisory Board Members (Independent) based on their experience and insights. Regarding human resources strategies and technical strategies, which are ongoing themes from fiscal 2017, the Board of Directors held in-depth discussions through multifaceted question and answer sessions with the understanding that executive organization advances strategy-based initiatives and steadily facilitates their progress and penetration. Regarding initiatives to address material sustainability issues (materiality), an ongoing theme in the third year, the Board of Directors confirmed that such initiatives and engagement activities evolve together and the system to promote the initiatives is functioning properly.
The Corporate Governance Committee recognized that themes raised as the policy for the operation of the Board of Directors for fiscal 2018 were organically associated with the keywords “human resources” and “technology,” through discussions about such themes from the standpoint of enhancing medium- to long-term corporate value at the Board of Directors meetings.
In addition, Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members actively make comments at the Board of Directors meetings. In particular, Directors (Independent) and Audit & Supervisory Board Members (Independent) make comments and proposals based on their experience and insights. Executive organization takes the opinions and proposals of the Board of Directors seriously and leverages them to further strengthen strategies and initiatives.
< Overview of Discussions of Each Theme >

3. Policy for the Operation of the Board of Directors for Fiscal 2019
Based on the evaluation results of the Board’s effectiveness for fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors discussed and determined the policy for the operation of the Board of Directors for the fiscal 2019.
Fiscal 2019 is the third year of OMRON’s “VG2.0” medium-term management plan. In this fiscal year, the Board of Directors will fully put its oversight and supervision functions to use, in order to ensure the achievement of VG2.0 goals, while also looking ahead to the next long-term vision set to start in fiscal 2021.
< Key Initiatives Set in Operational Policies >
Confirmation of the direction for long-term strategies with the upcoming long-term vision in mind Continuous execution of strategies concerning information systems and quality
Implementation of measures to deal with changes anticipated to occur in the internal and external business environments in fiscal 2019 and 2020
The company will make efforts in enhancing the Board's effectiveness for sustained improvement in corporate value.
4. Policy for the Operation of the Board of Directors for Fiscal 2016 to 2019
Since the introduction of the effectiveness evaluations of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors has both determined the policy for the operation of the Board of Directors and exercised its oversight function focusing on operating policies and upon important topics defined therein. As a result of these initiatives, board operations now closely resemble those of a monitoring board, focused on deliberations of material medium- and long-term topics. Topics requiring continued monitoring have been classified as ongoing topics for the next fiscal year. In particular, sustainability initiatives have been categorized as three-year themes, subject to detailed discussions.
These discussions included the opinions of many outside directors. The Board of Directors considered these opinions and reflected these suggestions in initiatives.
OMRON continues to improve board effectiveness to ensure sustained enhancement of corporate value.

Fiscal 2018 in Review
Consolidated Earnings
Fiscal 2018 was our second year operating under the OMRON VG2.0 medium-term management plan, defined by the basic policy of Creating Change: Accelerate growth and transform profit structure through innovation. During the year, we increased investment towards corporate growth driven by the focus domains of the Industrial Automation Business and the Healthcare Business. We also worked to create innovation driven by social needs. In the second half of the fiscal year, revenues in the Industrial Automation Business, Electronic and Mechanical Components Business, and Automotive Electronic Components Business declined as a result of trade friction between the United States and China. However, the Healthcare Business and Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business achieved steady growth.
Consolidated Statements of Income
Net Sales
OMRON Group net sales for fiscal 2018 amounted to ¥859.5 billion, down 0.1% from the prior year. Demand for smartphones and semiconductor-related products slowed, while the global downturn in the manufacturing industry over the second half of the fiscal year led to

weaker performance in the Industrial Automation Business and the Electronic and Mechanical Components Business. However, growth in the Healthcare Business and the Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business compensated for weakness in other areas.
Gross Profit Margin, SG&A Expenses, and R&D Expenses
Gross profit margin for fiscal 2018 was 41.2%, down 0.4 points. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up ¥7.2 billion to ¥219.7 billion, mainly due to completion of the growth investment planned at the beginning of the fiscal year. Research and development expenses fell ¥1.3 billion year on year to ¥57.8 billion, mainly due to detailed selection in research and development projects.
Operating Income, Income before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Affiliates, and Net Income Attributable to OMRON Shareholders
OMRON Group operating income for the year was ¥76.6 billion (11.2% decrease), while our operating income margin was 8.9% (1.1-point decrease). Income before income taxes (excluding other income) amounted to ¥75.4 billion (9.5% decrease), while net income attributable to OMRON shareholders came in at ¥54.3 billion for the year (14.0% decrease).

slower demand for capital investment related to smartphones and semiconductors, as well as the global downturn in the manufacturing industry over the second half of the fiscal year. These results offset each other, leading to segment net sales of ¥391.8 billion, down 1.1% year on year. We did, however, complete growth-related investments in line with our original plan, building a foundation of technologies, products, infrastructure, and other assets upon which we will accelerate into the future. Specifically, we expanded the number of Automation Centers that carry out
application development in cooperation with customer manufacturing locations. We now have 35 centers in operation worldwide, 27 more locations than in 2016. At the same time, we made a 20% increase (compared to fiscal 2016) in the number of sales engineers who provide support for application installations at customer manufacturing locations. In our production centers, we enhanced our production capacity necessary for future growth. Continued investments in growth focused on the medium to long term, resulting in a significant 15% decline in operating income, down to ¥62.9 billion.

 Demand in the consumer and commercial products industry was strong, driven by a favorable business environment in the Americas and Europe, as we accurately identified customer needs. Buying sentiment slowed in automotive-related industries in China. At the same time, demand in the amusement industry continued to contract. As a result, segment net sales amounted to ¥99.7 billion, a 4.5% decrease year on year. Profits were affected negatively by lower net sales to external customers and OMRON Group businesses.
We continued with investment in improving productivity aimed at optimizing fixed manufacturing costs to accelerate automation in manufacturing processes, reduce costs, and deliver high-value products to our customers. These measures included investing in production locations and consolidating production lines. As a result of these measures, segment operating income decreased to ¥8.2 billion, 34.5% lower year on year.

Review of Financial Condition
Total assets at the end of fiscal 2018 amounted to ¥749.9 billion, an increase of ¥4.9 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year. This increase stems mainly from an increase over the previous fiscal year in property, plant, and equipment.
Total liabilities increased ¥6.0 billion to ¥243.6 billion. Current liabilities decreased ¥11.3 billion to ¥171.5 billion from the previous fiscal year, mainly due to decreases in notes and accounts payable–trade and accrued expenses. However, termination and retirement benefits increased ¥16.0 billion year on year to ¥58.3 billion.
Total net assets decreased ¥1.1 billion compared to the end of the prior fiscal year to ¥506.3 billion. This result was due to share buybacks and other factors in excess of net income attributable to OMRON shareholders for the fiscal year. Our shareholders’ equity ratio was 67.2 percent, down 0.7 points compared to 67.9 percent at the end of the prior fiscal year. Despite this result, the company has maintained a firm financial foundation capable of handling aggressive investments and changes in market conditions.
Capital Expenditures
The OMRON Group made ¥41.9 billion in total capital investments during fiscal 2018, representing a 7.7% increase compared to the prior fiscal year. While ensuring careful deliberation on investments, the Group conducted active capital investment targeting future growth.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year amounted to ¥71.2 billion (a decrease in cash provided of ¥2.4 billion compared to the prior fiscal year). This result was mainly due to the recording of net income and amortization and depreciation, which more than offset decreases in notes and accounts payable- trade and accrued expenses. Net cash used in investing activities was ¥35.0 billion, representing a decrease in net cash used of ¥20.9 billion compared to the prior fiscal year. This result was mainly due to capital expenditures for investments in production capacity increases and future growth. Free cash flows (cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities) amounted to ¥36.3 billion, an increase of ¥18.5 billion compared to the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities was ¥40.8 billion, which was an increase in net cash used of ¥7.7 billion compared to the prior fiscal year. This result was mainly due to dividends paid and stock buybacks. As a
result, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2019, amounted to ¥110.3 billion, a decrease of ¥2.8 billion compared to the end of the prior consolidated fiscal year.
Dividend Policy
Our policy for profit distribution is to aim for sustainable corporate value growth, and thus OMRON prioritizes investment necessary for future business expansion. These investments include research and development, capital investments, mergers and acquisitions, and other investments for future growth. Having secured internal reserves, the company makes decisions regarding ongoing profit distribution to shareholders in consideration of capital efficiency.
The company has established a guideline of approximately 30% in payout ratio and approximately 3% of DOE for profit distributions for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 covered by our medium-term management plan. Our full-year dividend for fiscal 2018 was ¥84 per share. As a result, our dividend payout ratio was 32.2%, a 6.6-point increase year on year. Our dividend on equity ratio was 3.5%, a 0.2-point increase compared to the prior fiscal year.

Outlook for Fiscal 2019
Consolidated Earnings
In fiscal 2019, the OMRON Group intends to secure a platform to soundly establish a self-driven growth structure in times of adversity. The subtitle for this policy is - Strengthen earning capacity, growing capability, and responsiveness to change -. The global economy in fiscal 2018 saw increased instability and uncertainties in the business environment. We expect continued challenges in the markets addressed by our Industrial Automation Business, Electronic and Mechanical Components Business, and Automotive Electronic Components Business. On the other hand, we see this headwind as an opportunity for the establishment of a self-driven growth structure in the OMRON Group.
First, we intend to increase our earning power. We plan to reach higher levels of profits for the OMRON Group through consistent improvements in gross profit margins and more efficient use of SG&A expenses. We will be selective in allocating the resources generated by these initiatives to create sustainable growth. We are also working to maximize the benefits gained from restructuring our production platform in the Electronic and Mechanical Components Business.
Second, we intend to take full advantage of the technologies, products, infrastructure, and other assets we developed through two years of VG2.0 activities to date (FY2017 to FY2018), moving forward in enhancing our growth power. The OMRON Industrial Automation Business focuses on utilization of the OMRON Group Automation Centers around the world and the training of sales engineers. This will allow us to be more effective in proposals by which we solve customer issues. Our Healthcare Business has spent the past two years in developing a global sales network for the growing online shopping markets in America, the major countries of Europe, China, Japan, and other regions. In fiscal 2019, we plan to strengthen the promotional sales policies within this sales network further to provide our products to as many consumers as possible around the world.
Last, The OMRON Group has a system to monitor market trends and changes in customers through our business units. By having headquarters collect and analyze changes in each business unit, we keep an eye on changes and focus the ability of the OMRON Group to respond to change.
Taking into account the risks of variability in the uncertain macro-economic climate, our fiscal 2019 plan calls for net sales of ¥830.0 billion (3.4% decrease versus fiscal 2018), operating income of ¥65.0 billion (15.2% decrease), and net income attributable to OMRON shareholders of ¥42.5 billion (21.8% decrease). We plan to raise gross profit margin, an indicator of our earnings ability, to 42.0% (0.8-point increase year on year), a significant improvement over
the previous fiscal year. We are also aiming for 8% or higher in the important ROIC and ROE indicators. This earnings plan includes fiscal year projections for the Automotive Electronics Components Business (AEC). We announced the signing of a stock transfer agreement for the AEC to the Nidec Corporation Group on April 16, 2019. To build long-term competitive advantage, the OMRON Group concentrates management resources in specific business domains. Our decision to divest the Automotive Electronic Components Business, which we have cultivated over nearly 40 years, reflects our future-oriented competitive and growth strategies. We plan to use the cash acquired from this sale for investments for further growth.
Industrial Automation Business (IAB)
We project continued firm demand for capital investment related to autonomous driving and eco- friendly cars in the automobile industry. We also expect ongoing investments related to labor savings and IoT in this sector, and will continue to propose optimal solutions to our customers in response to this demand. Meanwhile, we expect this environment will continue to be as uncertain as it is challenging. The digital industry in particular is likely to experience weakness in demand for capital investment. This uncertainty in the markets and the impact of foreign exchange lead us to forecast segment net sales of ¥378.0 billion for fiscal 2019, a 3.5% decrease compared to fiscal 2018. Improved gross profit margin, efficient use of fixed costs, and other efforts should result in OMRON Group operating income of ¥63.0 billion (0.2% increase).
Electronic and Mechanical Components Business (EMC)
Given the ongoing sluggish demand for consumer and commercial products due to uncertainties in the market environment, we expect to introduce new products and field new business inquiries in growth sectors. Sales to the automotive-related industries should be level compared to the prior fiscal year as the global market experiences gradual growth and China continues to experience weakness in the automotive and related industries. As a result of these factors and the impact of foreign exchange, we forecast net sales for fiscal 2019 to be ¥98.0 billion, a 1.7% decrease compared to fiscal 2018 results. As a result of ongoing investment for future growth and continuing measures to ensure productivity improvements, we forecast an increase in operating income to ¥8.5 billion (4.1% increase year on year) for fiscal 2019.
       100

    Financial Info
Automotive Electronic Components Business (AEC)
While we expect overall strength in automobile sales in Japan, the Americas, and Asia, we anticipate a slowdown in demand in the Chinese market as a result of trade friction with the United States. Further, we expect the impact of model changes in vehicles using OMRON products in Asia will likely result in decreased demand. Combined with the impact of foreign exchange, we forecast net sales for fiscal 2019 to be ¥124.0 billion (5.0% decrease from fiscal 2018 results). As a consequence of lower net sales, we anticipate a sharp decrease to ¥4.0 billion in operating income (down 36.7%).
Note: OMRON plans to transfer the Automotive Electronics Components Business (AEC) to the Nidec Corporation Group.
Social Systems, Solutions and Service Business (SSB)
We expect to see firm demand for upgrades and new safety features in our Public Transportation Business and our Traffic and Road Management Systems Business. At the same time, we project increased demand for payment settlement devices in response to rising needs for cashless payments. Accordingly, we forecast significantly higher net sales for fiscal 2019 at ¥83.0 billion (10.6% increase over fiscal 2018) and operating income of ¥6.5 billion (12.8% increase).
Healthcare Business (HCB)
We project strong ongoing demand for secondary prevention products related to lifestyle diseases stemming from increasingly aging societies and lifestyle changes globally. Additionally, by engaging in promotional activities in our sales network, particularly online shopping markets in America, the major countries of Europe, China, Japan, and other regions, we forecast net sales of ¥123.0 billion (up 6.5% from fiscal 2018) and operating income of ¥14.0 billion (7.4% increase), providing growth in both revenue and profit for fiscal 2019.
Other Businesses
We forecast higher demand in our Environmental Solutions Business, driven by growth in the market for home-use storage battery systems. At the same time, we will continue to optimize our Backlights Business. As a result, we forecast fiscal 2019 segment net sales to be ¥32.0 billion, a 23.3% decrease compared to fiscal 2018 results. As a result of lower sales in our Backlights Business, we project operating losses of ¥1.0 billion, compared to fiscal 2018 operating losses of ¥0.5 billion.

From the Publisher
Integrated Report 2019 marks the eighth integrated report published by the OMRON Group. I would like to express our appreciation for the reader and everyone involved in this year’s production and publication.
The theme of this year’s report is creating a better society by practicing the Omron Principles. Behind the selection of this theme is the increasing uncertainty surrounding both the global economy and the business environment over the last year. In creating this report, we considered that, it was important to return to the roots of our business principles this time in particular. In accordance with this policy, this report attempts to show different perspectives in our initiatives aimed at sustainable improvements to corporate value through the application of the OMRON Principles.
We have used feedback from our stakeholders about previous editions in striving to make a number of improvements to this report. We would like to introduce three representative improvements. The first was a round-table discussion attended by all outside officers. Here, we hope to offer a glimpse of the effectiveness of our board of directors beyond what is covered in existing disclosure materials alone. The second was participation in editorial planning by external specialists. By having journalists conduct interviews focused on messages from the CEO, CFO, CTO, and Chairman, we worked to create a message that would better respond to the
interests of our stakeholders. The third was abolishing the printing and distribution of this report as a physical booklet. This decision was taken in consideration of the changes in our stakeholders’ values and changes in media consumption. In addition, we also considered the lack of global resources in the current age. We have determined that concentrating distribution on digital media was the most effective and efficient way to distribute this report to you our many stakeholders around the world. We also have prepared a printed edition of this report to people for whom have difficulties accessing the online edition.
This report was largely compiled by the Global Investor Relations & Brand Communications HQ, prepared after repeated discussions with cooperating parties within and outside the company. We will continue to place great value on dialogue with everyone involved. We look forward to hearing your honest opinions in this regard.

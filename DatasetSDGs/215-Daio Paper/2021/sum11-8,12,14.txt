Toward the target of raising the ratio of hard-to-recycle recovered paper pulp in containerboard to 30% by FY2030, we are promoting the use of hard-to-recycle recovered paper, which used
to be incinerated due to high levels of contaminants that inhibit recycling (i.e. plastics such
as DVDs that come with magazines). Using our proprietary technology,
we automatically sort pulp fiber from plastics and utilize the former as
papermaking raw materials and the latter as fuel for waste boilers to generate power instead of fossil fuel. By using the waste, which used to be merely incinerated, as an energy source, we can reduce the use of fossil fuel, also contributing to reducing CO2 throughout the value chain. In addition, Iwaki Daio Paper is constructing a waste boiler that will use waste-derived fuel, which has been difficult to use so far (scheduled for operation in January 2023). The completion of the boiler will transform Iwaki Daio Paper into a mill that uses only in-house power generated from non-fossil fuels.
Since a high utilization rate of recovered paper will lead to solving marine pollution (as waste plastic is also used effectively as a fuel), we will continue to work toward accomplishing the target.

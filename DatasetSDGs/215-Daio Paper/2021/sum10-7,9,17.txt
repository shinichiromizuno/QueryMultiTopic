Toward the target of reducing CO2 emitted through production activities
by 46% compared to FY2013 by FY2030, we are working on fuel transition, energy saving, etc. As part of such measures, we began to operate a biogas generator at the Mishima Mill in October 2020. It has been designed to extract biogas (derived from biomass generated when organic matter is fermented) from methanol-containing wastewater from the kraft pulping process, and
to effectively use the biogas as a replacement for fossil fuel. Since this biogas contains methane, we use the extracted gas as it is in the lime calcination facility (kiln) in the mill, thereby replacing fossil fuel and reducing CO2 emissions (approximately 15,000 t per year) and drainage load. We will continue to implement various measures that will lead to lower CO2 emissions toward achieving carbon neutrality.

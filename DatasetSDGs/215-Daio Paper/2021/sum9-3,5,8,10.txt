To realize sustainable growth as a vibrant and sound corporate group, we need to enhance employeesâ€™
engagement and performance. To do so, we announced the Daio Paper Group Declaration of Health in
FY2014 and the Work Style Reform Declaration in FY2016. For health and productivity management, we place
our focus on ensuring an appropriate work-life balance, improving lifestyle habits, providing ample care for
mental health, and supporting early detection of disease and prompt cure. While ensuring that the PDCA cycle
runs smoothly, we implement a wide variety of measures. Specifically, we have introduced flexible working
systems, including a flextime system, a remote work system, and annual paid leave that can be taken by the
hour. In addition, we are encouraging employees to quit smoking by launching a quit-smoking challenge in FY2019 for those in managerial positions, including the top management. We have also initiated a health counseling service and started offering group long-term disability (GLTD) insurance for compensating loss of earnings. We will continue to make efforts to establish an environment where employees can fulfill their responsibilities without worry in this age of the 100-year life.

Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is produced by refining wood fiber (pulp), an environmentally-friendly material, to nanosized fibrils. We take advantage of its features when we develop applications for CNF. Setting application development targets to be achieved by 2030 in seven fields, we have already put CNF to practical use in two fields. The number of samples that we provide have increased considerably as the growing need to reduce CO2 emissions is raising the interest in weight reduction, plastic reduction, etc. through usage of and replacement with CNF. To respond to this trend, we are planning to operate a new CNF composite resin pilot plant in FY2021 and establish an integrated manufacturing process in order to improve our productivity drastically. In addition,
we have established a system of supplying products in the five formsâ€”not only aqueous dispersion, but also molded sheets, dry powder, highly-transparent aqueous dispersion, and resin pellets. By accelerating our process toward commercialization, we will realize a new business launch.

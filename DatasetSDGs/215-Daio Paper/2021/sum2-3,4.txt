We would like to contribute to solving social issues in developing
countries, such as infectious diseases due to insufficient hygiene, and
poverty due to unemployment because of lack of skills. In 2018, we
initiated the Heart Support Project and have provided employment
opportunities for female teachers, access to occupational training, and
support in other forms. This fiscal year again, we launched the project
Heart Support 2021 and plan to teach local citizens how to make cloth
sanitary pads to help them obtain a skill for earning income and also to
promote the use of sanitary pads to control infectious diseases. We will continue to implement the Heart Support Project to solve social issues. At the same time, we will work to increase our brand profile at home and establish a foundation for making inroads into the African market, thereby accelerating our global expansion.

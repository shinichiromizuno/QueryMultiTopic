In accordance with our strategy to deal with decline in demand for newsprint and paper, we have been proceeding with a shift from graphic paper to packaging paper. Last year, we rebuilt the N7 paper machine of the Mishima
Mill into a machine that produces containerboard, thereby preserving the local employment. At the same time, we have launched export of paper to China and other parts of Southeast Asia by taking advantage of our competitive production equipment, which can use pulp for any type of paper, and our location next to the sea.
As we have done for our domestic business, we are striving to establish a highly productive business model for the exports. To do so, while meeting local users’ needs in terms of quality, we have developed DAIO FSC Certified Japan Premium Kraft Linerboard (FSJPK). As a product unsusceptible to market fluctuations and designed for overseas markets, this linerboard is characterized by high burst strength, FSC certification, and a combination of recovered paper pulp and kraft pulp. In China and other parts of Southeast Asia, there is shortage of kraft pulp equipment. This linerboard uses in-house produced kraft pulp for high burst strength, and it also contains high strength recovered paper pulp of stable quality. Hence, it is gaining recognition in our users’ countries as an environmentally-friendly linerboard that can obtain forest certification. This product, highly acclaimed for its high burst strength, high strength, and stable quality, enabled us to expand our customer base and strengthen our profitability more than originally expected. While continuing to proceed with the strategic transformation of our business portfolio, we will develop products with consideration given to solving social issues through our business operations.

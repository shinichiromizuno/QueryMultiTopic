In some areas of Hirakata City, their neighborhood associations are becoming unable to collect recyclable paper due to their declining birthrate and aging population. In addition, many residents, including those living alone, sort recyclable paper not as recyclable garbage but as burnable garbage. Some research on the composition of burnable garbage has revealed that more than 10% of the
garbage is recyclable paper. To solve this problem, the city is now
taking the lead in collecting recyclable paper. If such recyclable paper
is collected rather than thrown away as burnable garbage, it will lead
to the reduction of waste and also reduction of the operating load of
the relevant incinerator. To ensure that the collected paper is recycled, the three entities of Hirakata City, Shinwa Syouji, and Daio Paper have signed an agreement on the use of the paper collected by the city. This agreement ensures a stable supply of recyclable paper from Hirakata City, an effective use of the resources, and solution of the problem resulting from the declining birthrate and aging population. While maintaining close cooperation with the city and the wholesaler of recyclable paper, we will continue to strive to achieve a sustainable cycle of recycling.

To ensure medium and long term development, we are continuing to foster next-generation leaders and global human resources. In particular, for employees who may in the future engage in our overseas businesses, which serve as the engine of our growth, we provide not only our conventional overseas training program, but also those indicated below to remove their hesitation about working abroad and increase their foreign language proficiency.
In addition, to develop self-directed human resources who “think, decide and act for themselves,” we have enabled employees to shape their career and develop their capabilities on a self-directed basis by, for example, giving them options to join
an external management training program, study for an MBA, and utilize Daio Career Challenge (internal open call for employees to select their own career). By making these efforts, we are striving to enhance employees’ engagement and motivation.

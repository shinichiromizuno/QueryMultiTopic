We have established the Daio Paper Group Sustainable Procurement Guidelines Based on the SDGs,
Life which set forth our commitments throughout our corporate group and supply chain not only to improve quality and technology, but also to ensure legal compliance in the fields of human rights, environmental
preservation, safety and health, etc., conduct fair and equitable transactions, ensure BCP, and contribute
to local communities. We have communicated the guidelines to our business partners and placed them Regeneration on our website. Moreover, to confirm that our procurement is in accordance with the guidelines, we
have conducted a questionnaire survey among our business partners. With the survey’s response rate
reaching 87%, 56% of the respondents are rated 3.5 or higher on a 5-point scale. To accomplish our
FY2030 targets—response rate: 100%; and percentage of business partners rated 3.5 or higher on a
5-point scale: 90% or higher—we are giving feedback to the respondents, while asking and supporting
low-rated respondents to make improvements. Furthermore, we are considering dividing the guidelines into 1) compliance, 2) request, and 3) recommendation to evaluate business partners with a special weight on compliance. We will continue to work to realize sustainable procurement throughout our supply chain, while striving to achieve harmonious growth and development.

For our future growth, it is essential for women to play even more active roles in all our business fields, including H&PC Life Business, which serves as the engine of our growth. We are actively assigning female employees to the H&PC Business, which has the widest variety of opportunities for them to play active roles, and fostering prospective female managers
on a well-planned basis through various programs, such as cross-industrial interaction programs, launched in 2014, and
practical management skill training programs, to be newly started. In addition, we are also making various efforts to reform the mindsets of all employees, such as using internal social media to disseminate messages directly from the president (from 2021) and organizing training programs on diversity for the senior and middle management (from 2020) and training programs on unconscious bias for all employees (from 2019). Furthermore, we are working to increase the paternity leave uptake to 100%, and are also encouraging employees to use the flextime system, remote work system, etc., building an internal network for parenting employees, and promoting a cross-sectional reform of our corporate culture under the lead of young employees. By pursuing
a work style reform with a focus on productivity and ensuring an appropriate work-life balance, we will
continue our reform toward establishing a corporate culture where all employees can take on challenges
and play active roles.

Located in Chile, South America, Forestal Anchile LTDA works in cooperation with local communities toward establishing infrastructure and realizing local development. Purranque City, Osorno Province, Region X, where we own forests, suffers from a water shortage every dry season. In 2016, we were requested by the city’s mayor

We will continue this training so that local residents can obtain the necessary skills and realize sustainable agricultural development.

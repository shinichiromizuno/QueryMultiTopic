Develop the human resources that underpin corporate growth 
We will improve working conditions to create workplaces where no work-related accidents or injuries occur and where employees can work safely and comfortably in a healthy mental and physical state. We will also develop globally competitive human resources to create a company that enables employees to grow together with the company while finding their work rewarding and taking pride in it. 
⇒ P24. Developing a corporate culture in which employees can observe their personal development and find their work rewarding 
 
Using ergonomics to create workplaces where workloads are low We have improved the workplace environment to reduce operations involving high physical workloads and making the workplace safe and comfortable for workers. Targeting mainly operations that re- quire the use of heavy tools or the handling of heavy items, we are implementing Kaizen initiatives to reduce workloads while employ- ing automation and Karakuri mechanisms to improve the production efficiency. The effects of Kaizen improvements are evaluated by ask- ing actual workers for feedback. 
Planned cases for improving casting gate removal in three years 
Developing comfortable working conditions 
To develop comfortable working conditions, we improved ambient temperatures by installing air-conditioners and other equipment that heats up or cools down, and reduced noise, including mainly the noise of hammering and air lines in the casting process. 
Case of improvement: Initiative to reduce noise 
We shortened the time air lines are used in the manufacturing process by employing a technique that applies a small amount of mold-release agent to lower noise levels. We will introduce this technique in many of our facilities. 
Eliminating work-related accidents and injuries 
Ahresty has established Ahresty Safety Awareness codes based on the principle of safety first and production activities are conducted following Safety Awareness. Adopting the safety slogan “Find potential hazards in your workplace! Think and act safely by observing the rules!” for the three years from fiscal 2019 to 2021, Ahresty as a whole aims to develop a safe and comfortable working environment through carrying out a variety of safety activities, including providing safety training programs, conducting safety patrols, improving equipment safety functions and providing basic education to prevent fires and accidents.

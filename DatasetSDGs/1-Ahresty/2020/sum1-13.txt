Improving MONOZUKURI capabilities based on the technology roadmap In view of the changes in the automotive market, we will focus our efforts on developing structural materials and parts for electric ve- hicles, in addition to conventional engine blocks, transmissions and other parts for vehicles with internal combustion engines, so as to cater to customer needs regarding the trend to reduce the weight of automobiles and tighter fuel economy regulations. To support this, we will enhance our technological capabilities in each of the man- ufacturing processes, including casting, processing, molding and alloying, based on the technology roadmap, thereby improving our MONOZUKURI capabilities and ensuring competitive advantages by solving technological issues.

Aiming to gain high customer evaluations 
Ahresty has been working on formulating Ahresty Standards, common rules for the Group, with the aim of bringing MONOZUKURI (manufacturing) of the same quality level to all of its operation sites worldwide. We believe that the key to this goal is to adhere to the basics of MONOZUKURI and improve the assurance level for the completion of each process. For new products, we will further strengthen ties with the design team to improve our production preparations, aiming to ensure stable quality and improve productivity in mass production. 
In fiscal 2019, we were able to reduce the number of complaints, non- conforming items, and process failures related to new products by more than 30% over the previous year. For mass production, we have been working to reduce variations in quality in manufacturing processes by examining the process quality control sheet and actual operations, thereby improving each process. Ahresty will make continuous efforts to constantly provide products of stable quality, so as to gain a higher level of trust from our customers. We believe that high evaluations by our customers will help each of the employees working at Ahresty to take pride in their manufacturing and develop an increased motivation for work.

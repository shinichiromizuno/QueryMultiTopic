Environmentally friendly material, aluminum
standardizing the revised method, we were able to improve produc- tivity. We will continue to promote initiatives to improve productiv- ity and reduce costs under the safety-first principle, with the aim of making our alloy plants unrivaled in MONOZUKURI.
Outlook for Fiscal 2020
As the COVID-19 pandemic has cooled markets around the world, in- cluding Japan, the aluminum market is suffering severely with low prices and small demand. However, we expect the market to turn for the better along with a recovery in economic activities and a rise in demand in all industries. In the automobile industry, in particular, with its strong demand for weight reduction, expectations are high for aluminum materials. We will therefore take this opportunity to ex- pand demand and promote production activities to better satisfy the needs of our customers. In fiscal 2020, based on the data on melting for each material obtained in fiscal 2019 in addition to the knowledge accumulated so far, we will further deepen our technological know- how to further improve productivity and increase earnings.

Aluminum is a valuable resource, which can be recycled and reused over and over again. At our Kumagaya plant, die casting products that have been produced in the die casting plant and finished their life on the market, come back to have their life renewed as new material. We have set specific environmental targets for our production activities to reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing processes.

Improving Corporate Governance
Ahresty is making efforts to improve its corporate governance, thereby boosting profitability of the entire Ahresty Group and improving its management and capital efficiency and increasing its corporate value.

Ahresty believes that the basic policies of corporate governance should be to clarify its management responsibilities and account- ability to all its shareholders and other stakeholders and to estab- lish a management system capable of making decisions promptly with a high level of transparency. Ahresty also focuses its efforts on improving its internal control and risk management systems, and establishing a management system capable of supervising the busi- ness activities of the entire Group.
Since it became a company with an audit and supervisory commit- tee in 2015, Ahresty has implemented various initiatives to enhance its corporate governance, including introducing a restricted stock compensation plan and evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors (questionnaire survey) in 2018, setting up the Nomination and Compensation Committee in 2019 to discuss the appointment/ dismissal of directors, their remunerations, and requirements for di- rector candidates, and replacing the chairperson of the Committee with an Independent Director in 2021. Our basic policy on return of profits to shareholders is to provide appropriate returns while bol- stering the financial structure and management base for business development in the medium and long terms. We were sorry that we did not pay an interim dividend for the first half of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was associated with rapid changes in our external circumstances. However, in response to the recov- ery in the second half, we were able to pay a year-end dividend of 5 yen per share. We will work to increase returns to shareholders through enhancing the company’s structure by improving productiv- ity and establishing lean production systems, creating cash flows by formulating business strategies to continue to grow our share of the electrification market, and proper management of cash flows by making efficient investments, etc.
Analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
At the Board of Directors meetings, active discussions are held on management strategies, corporate governance, capital investment and various other management issues and business execution, while opinions are exchanged with Independent Directors. In fiscal 2020, 14 meetings of the Board of Directors (excluding one meeting with a written resolution) were held. Ahresty evaluates the effectiveness of its Board of Directors to reinforce its supervising function and increase its effectiveness. The role of the Board of Directors is con- stantly discussed in view of changes in the business environment and expansion of our global business, and a questionnaire survey has been introduced to enable the directors themselves to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. In the survey conducted in January 2021, the evaluation improved from the previous survey (conducted in fiscal 2019). Among the items in the questionnaire were “training of newly appointed directors,” “updating manage- ment/business strategies,” “actively introducing external per- spectives” and “periodically reviewing the quality and quantity of information” in the “monitoring performance” category. Recognizing these issues, we will work to make improvements in them.

Executive remuneration under the restricted stock compensation plan
Ahresty introduced a restricted stock compensation plan in FY2018 to (i) provide executives with an incentive to continuously improve the corporate value of Ahresty, (ii) facilitate their sense of shared values with shareholders and (iii) establish greater linkage with medium- to long-term performance goals. The restricted stock com- pensation plan consists of performance-linked shares with transfer restrictions, which are subject to Ahresty achieving its medium- to long-term performance goals, and work-continuation-linked shares with transfer restrictions subject to continuous service as directors of Ahresty over a certain period of time. The performance-linked type has also been introduced for Executive Officers, to enhance the linkage between contribution to Group-wide performance and compensation. Under the restricted stock compensation plan, a cer- tain amount of the restricted stock is designed to reflect the degree to which the medium-term management plans are attained, per- formance results and other factors. Ahresty will strive to improve its performance results and promote further value sharing with its shareholders from the medium- to long-term perspectives.
Risk management
The basis of Ahresty’s risk management is to avoid risks that may seriously affect its business management and address any risks that arise, promptly and properly in a manner that will not undermine the safety, health or interests of any stakeholder so as to achieve a quick recovery while working to protect its management resources and minimize any damage from the risk, thereby ensuring continuity of its business management. Based on its Risk Management Reg- ulations established for risks associated with business activities, Ahresty identifies, analyzes and evaluates risks regularly in light of the environment and trends both inside and outside the Company, holds discussions on priority activities and their aims, and checks improvements to risk management systems and frameworks for the entire Group.
Identifying and responding to risks
Ahresty selected 11 risk items as its risk management items for fiscal 2020 and appointed departments to be responsible for each risk. These included “transactions and compliance,” “disasters,” and “products and services.” By clarifying the degree of impact and causes of each risk, Ahresty has been working to enhance preven- tion, initial response and measures for recovery.
FY2020 risk management items and initiatives to enhance responses (excerpts)
Formulated guidelines for responses to ty- phoons and heavy rain and implemented measures against disasters, such as the introduction of emergency communication devices.
Based on the belief that preventing harass- ment and maintaining a sound workplace environment is part of its social responsi- bility, Ahresty has established a code of conduct and action guidelines for preven- tion while providing internal training for all employees, to eliminate harassment in all workplaces.
Established internal rules, strengthened management of information devices, and limited access to information, thereby pre- venting leakage of information due to inter- nal fraud or external cyberattacks, etc.

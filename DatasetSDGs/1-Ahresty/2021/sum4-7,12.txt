Aluminum is a valuable resource, which can be recycled and reused over and over again. At our Kumagaya plant, die casting products that have been produced in the die casting plant and finished their life on the market, come back to have their life renewed as new material. We have set specific environmental targets for our production activities to reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing processes.

Enhancing earning strength by improving productivity and quality
We will promote productivity improvements and reduce manufacturing costs by implementing MONOZUKURI with Optimal Process Con- dition Control (OPCC).
We will also introduce streamlining and manpower savings in the production system, inventory reductions and other initiatives to improve our price competitiveness.

Improving productivity with OPCC
To implement MONOZUKURI processes under OPCC*, we are work- ing to improve productivity and reduce the defect rate. The process fields in which we will pursue OPCC in the three years of the 1921 Medium-Term Management Plan include design of materials and dies, process design, setting manufacturing conditions and mainte- nance and operation management of equipment/dies. In these pro- cesses, we will identify tasks for cycle time reduction, defect reduc- tion, improvement of utilization rate, maintenance management and other purposes, make them into priorities based on the past activity data, and start implementing measures expected to give greater re- sults, thereby improving the productivity and quality.
* Optimal Process Condition Control
[Activities for OPCC]
To enhance ties between departments and promote improvement activities across departments, cross-functional teams are formed at each production site. Activities that have proven effective are shared throughout the Group along with the maintenance and defect prevention measures, helping to improve productivity and quality.
Comprehensive streamlining of the production system and manpower savings
We are working to establish a system to produce good products efficiently, through comprehensive streamlining and manpower sav- ings. We will eliminate unnecessary processes and operations by introducing Kaizen, automating inspection processes, and through the use of “karakuri” mechanisms, thereby improving productivity and reducing manufacturing costs.
[Examples of reducing manpower in production processes]
•Reducing the number of operators in charge of casting machines by improving equipment and changing layouts
•Reducing the number of inspectors by introducing in-process quality assur- ance that incorporates inspections in the casting processes
•Introducing automatic inspection machines and promoting the use of “kara- kuri” mechanisms
•Automating material feeding for aluminum melting furnaces
[Examples of promoting leaner systems by shortening work
flows, etc.]
•Process improvement by reviewing the work flows for factory conveying sys- tems, etc.
•Cost reductions from incorporating outsourced operations in in-house processes •Reducing external rental warehouses by reducing inventory
•Integration of functions of non-production operations between plants

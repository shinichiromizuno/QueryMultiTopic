Ahresty Green Convention
Ahresty Green Convention is an assembly held under the Environ- mental Policy to report on improvements in a broad range of envi- ronment-related fields. Effective activities reported at the Conven- tion are introduced at other business sites and then disseminated throughout the Group, to help reduce the environmental impact and preserve the environment in local communities.
Cases of improvements reported at the 18th Ahresty Green Convention
Reduction of water consumption by replacing waste water treatment machines
Visualization of the amount of electricity and raising awareness of energy conservation
T6 heat treatment process Reduction of gas and electric power
Reduction of electricity consumed by holding furnaces
Reduction of energy consumption to match the produc- tion volume
Reduction of waste by promoting paperless drawings
Reduction of unit energy consumption
Reduction of waste materials
Reduction of the electric power consumed for melting in No.1 furnace
Towards “Carbon-Neutral”
A solar power generation system (4,997 m2 / 1380 panels / rated output 420 kW) introduced at Ahresty Pretech Tokai No.1 Plant has been in operation since March 2021. Ahresty will continue to pro- mote environment-friendly initiatives in manufacturing, including energy conversion.
Results of initiatives (plants in Japan)
  CO2 emissions*
The figures show the consump- tion of fuel and electric power after conversion to CO2 emis- sions. The line graph shows the CO2 emissions calculated using the conversion factors published by the electric power companies.
* At the six main plants in Japan
Unit CO2 emissions*
The basic CO2 emissions unit is calculated by dividing the CO2 emissions by the production weight, indicating the amount of CO2 emitted in producing 1 t.
* At the six main plants in Japan To evaluate the effects of CO2 emissions reduction activities, CO2 conversion factors are calculated based on past fixed value.
Discharged materials
Discharged materials shows all the materials discharged from business offices, in- cluding all valuable materials and waste, except steel and aluminum.
Water consumption
Water consumption shows the amount of clean water and groundwater consumed. Reduction in the use of water resources has been included in our targets since fiscal 2011.
Percentage of employees with an Ahresty eco License
Ahresty has established the Ahresty eco License, a unique internal examination system designed to improve its em- ployees’ awareness of the environment.

     Environmental Targets and Results for plants in Japan in fiscal 2020
To reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing processes, we have set specific en- vironmental targets for our production activities. In fiscal 2020, although we introduced various improvement activities, production volumes significantly decreased mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the total amount in each management item decreased, but the per-unit figures worsened.
* Target achievement level: 1 (not achieved) < 5 (achieved)
Eliminate non-conforming external leaks and complaints.
Set targets for each site.
* Continue monitoring and improving the
recycling rate.
Set targets for each site.
* For overseas business sites, set a target
reduction of at least 1.0% over FY2019. * Continue monitoring and improving the energy consumption rate calculated by positively evaluating actions to reduce
the peak electricity demand.
Set targets for each site.
* For overseas business sites, set a target reduction of at least 1.0% over FY2019.
Set a target for the number of times each business site should organize social contri- bution activities related to the environment.
* Social contribution activities related to the environment refers to community clean-ups and preservation of Satoyama, socio-ecological production landscapes.
Introduce greening that improves the landscape at each site, in line with the Ahresty greening guidelines.

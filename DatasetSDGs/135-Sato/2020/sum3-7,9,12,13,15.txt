Environmental responsibility
     Climate change resulting from global warming poses a serious threat to social stability. We consider environmental protection indispensable to sustaining our business activities, and have revised our environmental policy in FY 2020 to reflect a greater level of commitment to our environmental responsibility. Under the new policy, we will double our efforts toward global environmental conservation.    Greenhouse gas emissions
Reducing CO2 emissions is essential to tackling global warming and making our society sustainable. We understand that we are responsible for the environment, and work to monitor the carbon footprint of our business activities and promote tangible initiatives to
Medium- to long-term targets and progress
We saw a year-on-year increase in CO2 emissions from our business activities in FY 2019, mainly attributable to an increase in energy usage to produce a significantly larger number of RFID tags at Kitakami Operations, our main manufacturing facility in Japan. Given that this facility consumes roughly one-third of the total power used across all our business sites in Japan, we are working on the following measures to tangibly reduce its CO2 emissions.
1 Install solar panels for self-sufficiency We have installed solar panels at the office building
of Kitakami Operations. Set to begin operation in September 2020, this system is expected to generate about 220,000 kWh of electricity per year.
stop global warming. Referring to the medium-term target specified for Japan in the Paris Agreement*1, we have set the following goals in reducing the environmental impact of our business activities.
*1 International agreement to combat climate change, adopted at COP21 in December 2015.
2 Switch to renewable energy
We are looking into using renewable energy sources to
meet those electricity needs of Kitakami Operations that cannot be provided for by its in-house generators.
Our measures for renewable energy are conceived
Efficient use of resources
When customers change out their printers, we collect the old ones at no cost to disassemble them, recovering and sorting the components by material type for reuse through recyclers. In FY 2019, we recycled 91 percent more printers than we did the previous year.
Harmony with nature
One of our core businesses is consumables, which uses wood pulp to produce its main product line of labels. This is why we work to protect nature on a global scale in order to preserve biodiversity and restore the environment.
In March 2014, SATO started participating in the Forest of Companies project that the Tokyo Development Foundation for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries promotes as part of its Pollenless Forestation*3 campaign. We sponsor pockets of forestland in the Tokyo cities
of Ome (since 2014) and Akiruno (since 2019) which we have named “Forests of Ceaseless Creativity,” and engage in activities aimed at protecting the forest ecosystem and keeping its water sources clean, for example, by reducing runoff/sediment deposit.
At our last event in Akiruno, 29 senior management and employees gathered to plant 190 cedar, 80 cypress, and 135 broadleaf seedlings. We will continue to enhance environmental awareness in our employees
by proactively carrying out business activities that help conserve the environment and volunteering in such forestation programs.
SATO was certified as a contributor to the Tokyo
forestation program in October 2016 and May 2020.
*3 A campaign to plant cross-breed cedar and cypress trees after cutting down normal cedar/cypress trees to reduce the amount of dispersed pollen to about 1 percent, and at the same time, help regenerate forests, stabilize wood supply and revitalize the forestry industry.
with the help of the Japan Climate Leaders’ Partnership (JCLP)*2, a network we joined in FY 2018 as a supporting
member.
*2 A group of Japanese companies sharing the common understanding that the industrial sector should take actions to realize a sustainable, decarbonized society with a sense of urgency.
As a member of the Japan Portable Rechargeable Battery Recycling Center (JBRC), we also do our part in collecting small rechargeable batteries disassembled from printers, recycling 11 percent more batteries in FY 2019 compared with a year ago.

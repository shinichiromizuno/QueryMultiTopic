WHAT IS KAMPO?
 We aim to contribute to creating a healthcare environment in which all patients can receive treatment that includes Kampo medicine when appropriate in any healthcare institution or medical department in Japan. To this end, Tsumura’s medical representatives (MRs) provide medical practitioners with the latest scientific evidence and other information on its Kampo formulations. In addition to supplying evidence to physicians, MRs plan and hold Kampo medicine seminars for physicians and support education on Kampo medicine at medical schools and universities. MRs thereby work to cultivate understanding with regard to the concept of Kampo medicine itself.
As our basic strategy for expanding the Kampo product market, we have identified three important domains in which to focus our activities: geriatric health, cancer (supportive care), and women’s health. On an ongoing basis, we provide infor- mation in these domains on basic and clinical evidence, treatment guidelines referencing Kampo medicine, and how to use different formulations based on Kampo medicine.
Looking ahead, we will continue efforts to promote under- standing of Kampo medicine and Kampo formulations among medical practitioners while effectively utilizing the latest scien- tific evidence in a bid to expand the Kampo product market.

 Our Progress
Establishment of Scientific Evidence
Since fiscal 2005, Tsumura has been concentrating its resources on the establishment of scientific evidence for its Kampo formulations in its research activities. This policy was deployed to recognize the fact that, if Kampo formulations are to become a trusted treatment option in the Japan of today, it will be necessary for these formulations to be understood through the framework of Western medicine.
As a product of these efforts, theses on such scientific evidence published in domestic and overseas academic journals have been contributing to a noted change in the perception of medical practitioners with regard to Kampo formulations and Kampo medicine as a whole.
Marketing Activities Utilizing Scientific Evidence
Since fiscal 2005, Tsumura has been working on the establishment of scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of Kampo formulations, namely, the five “drug fostering” program formulations,*1 which have been demonstrating special efficacy for certain diseases in fields where medical treatment needs are high and that are difficult to treat with Western drugs. In addition, we defined five “growing” formu- lations*2 in fiscal 2017. Since then, we have been advancing research with the goal of having these formulations listed in medical treatment guidelines.
Through the ongoing supply of such basic and clinical evidence as well as information on how to use different formu- lations based on Kampo medicine, we have been successful in expanding the Kampo product market. However, the growth of the five “drug fostering” program formulations has started to taper in recent years. Nevertheless, we aim to reignite the growth of these formulations through sales strategies focused on new scientific evidence pertaining to Rikkunshito that was announced in fiscal 2018.

 Enhancement of Evidence Collections
Tsumura is in the process of enhancing its complete evidence collections for the “drug fostering” program formulations and
the “growing” formulations. These collections encompass clinical evidence-based medicine; action mechanisms; adverse drug reaction frequency surveys; information on absorption,

Our Progress
Progress of Development of TU-100 (Daikenchuto) in the United States
We have organized a system to link the technologies and know-how that we have developed through our Kampo and crude drug businesses as well as our latest basic and clinical research data in Japan through our “drug fostering” program with product development in the United States. We are now working toward acquiring product approval and launching TU-100 as a prescription pharmaceutical in the United States.
Until now, we have reported the results of adverse drug reaction frequency surveys in Japan to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in response to its inquiries on the safety of plant products. We have also reached a certain level of agreement with the FDA in regard to the scientific quality evaluation method to be used for plant-based medicines made using multiple crude drugs. Meanwhile, the Phase IIa clinical studies for irritable bowel syndrome, postoperative ileus (POI), and Crohn’s disease were completed prior to the end of fiscal 2018.
Through these efforts, we have found that POI is a disorder
for which significant unmet medical needs* still remain and
that the unique characteristics of the U.S. medical industry
are creating substantial demand for means of shortening
hospitalization periods and avoiding complications. In addi-
tion, TU-100 has indicated significant potential for treating
POI. Accordingly, Tsumura has chosen to narrow the scope of
its efforts to develop TU-100 for the U.S. market in fiscal 2019
and beyond to target POI. We will coordinate with medical
specialists in the United States as well as with our advisory
team comprising statistical analysis specialists in order to
draft strategies and clinical study plans as we move forward.
* Unmet medical needs refer to needs associated with conditions for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment.
Information Provision Activities
for Medical Practitioners
Since fiscal 1998, Tsumura has been engaged in activities aimed at making Kampo medicine more widespread. As part of these activities, we have provided the latest scientific evidence to increase trust in Kampo medicines while also holding various seminars for medical practitioners. Examples of these seminars include introductory Kampo medicine seminars and step-up seminars that take a systematic approach toward learning about Kampo medicine as well as training sessions and lectures for specific fields.
In recent years, team-based medical approaches, which entail wide-ranging coordination among dentists, pharmacists, nurses, etc., are becoming increasingly more important. Accordingly, we continue to conduct information provision activities such as our Kampo luncheon seminars for academic associations for team medical staff and our Kampo medicine seminars for medical staff for catering to the rising demand.
    COLUMN Spread of Kampo Medicine in the Education Field
In 1997, only 24 medical colleges and university medical departments in Japan offered courses on Kampo medicine. However, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology included Kampo medicine in the model core curriculum for medical education in 2001, causing education on this subject to spread, which resulted in all medical education institutions in Japan providing Kampo medicine courses in 2004. Today, almost all universities require medical students to take eight Kampo medicine courses in order to graduate. Moreover, the term “Wakan-yaku (Kampo product)” was included in the model core curriculum for dentistry and nursing science education in 2017. Including the existing references in curricula for medical and pharmaceutics studies, the term now appears in four model core curricula. We thus anticipate that, in the future, Kampo medicine education will be promoted.

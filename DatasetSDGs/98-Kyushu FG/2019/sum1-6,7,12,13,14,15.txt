 Tackling environmental issues through social contribution activities (Eco-friendly bank branches, groundwater conservation activities, etc.)
Three pillars of groundwater conservation activities
Higo Bank is working on groundwater conservation activities with “forests,”“rice paddies,” and “grasslands” as the three pillars.

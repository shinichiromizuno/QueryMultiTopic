Develop people and enhance engagement
When looking ahead to the Kyushu Financial Group (KFG) in ten years, strengthening of human resource infrastructure by developing human resources is essential for the realization of a Community Value Co-Cre- ation Group. The Group’s 3rd Medium-Term Management Plan (New Medium-Term Plan) has been positioned as a stage of “reformation” that is imbued with the meaning of facing the challenges presented by the new era of the New Normal without being constrained by past meth- ods, and is also a powerful proposal made by young employees. It is set against the backdrop of significant changes in the environment sur- rounding regional banks, the sense of crisis arising from this, and the passionate desire to create a promising future with our own hands. Our personnel department must think how this wish can be achieved. In this context, “Develop people and enhance engagement” was estab- lished as a personnel strategy in the New Medium-Term Plan. Engage- ment refers to connections or ties, and I have understood this to be “placing importance on ties between employees and KFG, among em- ployees and, put more broadly, between employees and customers, creating relationships of mutual trust.” In addition, companies with strong engagement with employees tend to be open and have high productivity. It is vital that we use this engagement as a springboard to nurture people to forge a path in the new era. Until now, I think it has been possible to work with a passive approach. We are significantly transitioning from an era in which it was important to provide what customers want to an era in which it is necessary for each individual employee to independently think about what to do to provide more value to customers than they want, and act accordingly. Furthermore, it is necessary to accelerate the realization of value co-creation by nurtur- ing highly specialized human resources not only in the area of finance. Many employees including young employees have already received training aimed at nurturing specialized personnel in areas such as DX and the creation of new businesses, and the new system is steadily be- ing established.
Creating an organization in which all employees find day-to-day work to be fulfilling
If asked whether we have truly placed importance on connections with employees in the past, I cannot confidently say that we have. This is the reason “Develop people and enhance engagement” has been set forth in the Medium-Term Plan, and the personnel department will proceed with reforms with responsibility and resolve to ensure we fulfill our promise to employees set forth in the New Medium-Term Plan. I also bear this responsibility as the person in charge of the personnel depart- ment. The question is how to enable employees to feel fulfillment and satisfaction in their day-to-day work, and the foundation for this is plac- ing importance on connections with employees. Psychological safety is emphasized in organizational management. This refers to an atmo- sphere in which opinions can be voiced between anyone in the organi- zation with peace of mind. A workplace where employees can work wearing casual clothes creates a sense of security for them. Previously, I think we have tended to bottle up our own opinions due to gauging the feelings of others. However, these conditions are not conducive to discussion, causing a vicious cycle in which people become stressed due to being unable to say what they want to say, resulting in a con- stant reduction of productivity of the organization. Also, creative new ideas cannot be expected if constrained to a fixed approach. It would be impossible to deal with the new era with such an approach. We will conduct an engagement survey of all employees soon, and quickly consider measures to take. We also plan to “reform” the day-to-day work styles of all employees in the Group, and significantly change the job fulfillment and satisfaction of employees by creating a workplace envi- ronment in which they can say whatever they want with peace of mind. Looking ahead, we will implement a personnel strategy emphasizing speed to enable employees to feel “KFG has changed so much.” I am confident that this will create even deeper ties with the customers and local communities beyond them, and enable the community value co-creation.Kyushu Financial Group Personnel Strategy

Enhancing Respect for Diversity and Job Satisfaction
(1) Resolution of issues aimed at enhancing engagement
We will periodically implement Group human resource engagement surveys aimed at resolving issues through en- hanced engagement. We will reflect the results in initiatives enabling employees to face challenges such as human resource development and the assignment of the appropriate personnel to appropriate posts, with the Group working as one to resolve issues related to human resources.

Aiming for a personnel system enabling workers to feel fulfillment and happiness
KFG has begun recruiting activities in areas such as DX and new business development from the perspective of “developing human resources to achieve value co-creation” with the aim of acquiring highly specialized personnel. Alongside this, the Company has established levels of contribution and required expertise for each job grade, cre- ating a job-based personnel system. I think this will contribute to the community value co-creation by enabling human resources facing the challenge of creating various businesses not only in finance but also in non-financial areas to feel fulfillment and happiness in their jobs. I am also facing new challenges associated with my transfer from the legal and compliance department, and aim to produce results leading to the “reformation” of KFG.
▶Intra-group transfer system
▶Group-wide career support (Group challenge system)
Engagement survey
Environment enabling people to refine themselves and embrace challenges
Issues related to personnel
▶“Concurrent job/ side job” system
▶Enhancement of Group-wide online learning support
(2) Support for the new development, challenges, and assignment of the Group’s human resources
We have established a “Group challenge system” and an “intra-Group transfer system” enabling employees to face chal- lenges in their preferred departments in order to match the aptitude and preferences of individuals with the human resource needs of Group companies, expanding the flow and vitalization of the Group’s human resources.
Furthermore, we actively provide education opportunities while utilizing online environments enabling learning anywhere at any time to develop human resources capable of working in new areas (such as DX promotion and new business creation).

■ Comment from a participant of Next-Generation Leader Development Training through the creation of new business
Since last year, I have been taking a graduate school course specializing in new business with 15 members selected from KFG and the two banks.
It is mainly conducted online due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, but we have been striving to create new business proposals for the future of the Group. Initially, I was concerned about balancing work, raising children, my family, and next-generation leader development training, but thanks to the on- line tools, I have been able to proceed with the creation of ideas while holding meetings with remote members as needed.
We will contribute to the expansion of the Group’s business in new areas. Sana Manzen, Internal Control Office, Compliance and Risk Management Division, Kagoshima Bank
(2) Enhancement of office environments leading to further improvements in productivity
In autumn of 2021, the KFG headquarters building will be completed for the purpose of exhibiting further combined strength of the Group and contributing to local revitalization and community building. Free addresses will be used in offices, and a creative, healthy, and comfortable office environment will be provided by enabling more flexible work styles than in the past such as enabling online meetings to be held with various sites from anywhere at any time.

 What the Kyushu Financial Group Aims to Achieve
Digital Transformation Initiatives Aimed at Digital Society
The social environment is changing drastically due to the dramatic advance of digital technology. These changes are expected to accelerate further with shifting lifestyles driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, further declining birthrates and an aging population, and the entry into society of the digital-native Generation Z. In order to respond swiftly to changes in the environment, the Group has established “promoting DX toward a digital society” as a basic digital strategy. Under this strategy, we will take strong action toward digital transformation from the dual aspects of improving productivity through internal process reforms and of providing new experiences and services for our customers and communities, including reforming our cus- tomer touchpoints.
Initiatives for the Regional Shift to Digital
Local areas face issues like population decline, declining birthrates, and aging population. Along with the economic impact from the spread of COVID-19, the future outlook is uncertain.
Amid these environmental changes, we are focusing our efforts on ICT consulting for our customers who do business in the region, including support for implementing telecommuting, and support for implementing RPA in Group collaboration with think-tanks. In ad- dition, we have introduced the Big Advance management support

Building a Regional Digital Platform
The Group is working to strengthen the func- tions of its non-face-to-face services, such as our traditionally popular ATMs, as well as ap- plying digital technologies for our sales branches, which are important touchpoints with our customers. We are also taking ac- tion to develop smartphone apps which are expected to become even more important, evolve the functions of our omnichannel contact center, and enhance the functional- ity of our electronic payments, which in- crease convenience for our customers.
Our regional digital platform creates links via digital technologies between channels and between each channel and regional customers. It accumulates and utilizes data to enhance the level of our services.
Implementing Digital Technology in Customer Touchpoints
We are working toward the adoption of digital technologies in trans- actions at physical branches, including the use of branch tablets to cut out paper and physical stamps and seals from these transactions, reducing the customer’s burden in filling out documents and miti- gating our environmental burden.
By having the customer use tablets to directly enter content re- quired for the various forms needed for deposit transactions and no- tifications, we reduce the hassle of form entry, stamping, and signing.
This also leads to significant reduction in bank employee opera- tions related to these various procedures, leading to more efficient sales branch clerical operations. We will strive to strengthen our customer touchpoints

Initiatives for Non-Face-to-Face Services
Self-service banking has come into even greater demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Day after day,
beginning with today
both you and I have a chance to begin our lives anew.
Whether our lot today be profit or loss, be spiritually ready for loss.
As a planter would,
let us sow the seeds of joy to every person we meet each day.
For everyone, for you and me,
may we lead our lives in this world to the fullest, realizing our maximum spiritual and material potential.

He joined the Konko Church after being cured, sustained by the great love of his foster mother. He joined Ittoen in 1938. In 1944 he established Kentoku Company. From that time on, Suzuki pursued the principle of Prayerful Management, his aim being to unite moral and economic goals in both his own and his company’s business practices. He founded Duskin in 1963. Suzuki then established a groundbreaking distribution channel while expanding the cleaning tools rental business nationwide through a franchise system.

The markets for the Care Services Businesses and the Senior Care Businesses are expanding alongside demographic and lifestyle shifts in the country.

 Dust Control Business P.34–
An overwhelming share in the dust control market
Duskin’s Dust Control Business is backed by outstanding name recognition, a strong customer base, and franchise operations. The company is strengthening its competitiveness by providing high-quality products and communitybased services.
   Strengths
• A customer base of about 4.7 million households and 1.20 million business establishments
• A product delivery system and community-based franchise network that supports the customer base
Weaknesses
• Strong reliance on conventional products such as mops leads to delays in the development of highly functional products.
• Reduced price competitiveness due to the spread of lower prices for cleaning and sanitation products
Opportunities
• The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing awareness of the need for more rigorous cleaning and sanitation.
• As a result of revisions to the Food Sanitation Act, sanitary control in the food processing, distribution, and restaurant industries must meet HACCP standards.
• The rise of the sharing economy has resulted in values shifting from an emphasis on owning to an emphasis on sharing.
Threats
• Less people staying at home and less opportunities to meet with customers due to changes in laws and regulations
• Decline of small businesses and the rise of national chains covering wide areas and needing to respond to headquarter directives
  Care Service Businesses, Senior Care Businesses P.36–
Accelerating growth through synergies with the Dust Control Business
The market is expanding due to changes in demographics and lifestyles. Although there are concerns over intensifying competition owing to the emergence of new entrants from other industries, we anticipate that our customer base for dust control products will increase opportunities to cross-sell cleaning, technical or senior care services to existing customers.
   Strengths
• Developing businesses that yield synergistic effects through cross-selling to the customer base of the Dust Control Business
• Safety and reliability of our proven brands
Weaknesses
• Capabilities to respond to diversifying customer needs
• Service staff shortages at franchise offices
Opportunities
• Work-style reforms and the increase in the number of working families bolstering demand for cleaning and helper services
• Low birthrates and the aging of society contributing to an increased need for outsourced elderly care services
• Expansion in assisted-living market due to the growing need for home-based care and preventative care
Threats
• Increased competition due to the emergence of smaller companies and new entries from other industries
• Supply and demand imbalances due to seasonal fluctuations
• Shifts in demand due to revisions in the long-term public nursing care insurance system

  Value Creation
Duskin’s Value Creation Process (Commentary)
Human Capital
Duskin believes in establishing workplaces where employees respect each other, and are respected, regardless of gender, age, nationality, career, lifestyles, or any other factors, thus empowering all employees to exert their talents to the fullest of their potential.
We are dedicated to educating and nurturing human resources at the three educational facilities of the Seishinkan Guesthouse, Duskin School and Mister Donut College, and in FY2019 significantly increased annual average hours of training per person to 18.4 hours.
Social Capital
We focus on training and education of franchisee personnel, as our goal is to help customers live in comfort and with peace of mind through our products and services. These services are delivered by our franchisees via our nationwide franchise network, comprising over 7,000 units and offices as well as 45 laundry plants and distribution centers. As many of the owners run their businesses in the communities and markets where they and their staff members were born and raised, they know and understand the specific needs and attributes of each local market.
To be the leading service providers in their local areas, Duskin service staff members must acquire the skill sets needed for supplying quality service. They also play a major role in making their offices and units places to Sow the Seeds of Joy throughout their communities.
Financial Capital
A solid financial foundation and sufficient cash flow have been attained by operating the businesses in ways that continue to generate sound profit. Total assets during FY 2019 stood at 185.1 billion yen and free cash flow amounted to 11.9 billion yen. This stable cash flow serves as a source for cultivating new business opportunities as well as a financial reserve for our business activities in times of crisis, such as natural disasters. Ultimately, these financial resources support and assist Duskin in our endeavors to create value for stakeholders. Going forward, we will maintain this sound financial structure and continue generating cash flow that fuels investments for growth and profit returns.

kind products and services are capital of indispensable importance. Manufacturing plants in Japan consist of three sites for Direct Selling Group, and two sites for Food Group. For the contracted manufacturing plants that process products and raw materials, the Quality Assurance & Risk Management team conducts periodic inspections, and constantly strives to make improvements and enhancements to quality. In addition, our specialists for food processing plants conduct extensive quality inspections, covering facility management, process management, sanitary management and production management. This wide range of items on our checklist forms the basis of our evaluations, and leads to guidance for improvements.
Intellectual Capital
At Duskin, we place value on earning the trust and faith of customers, and treat the “researching the science of clean” as a mission critical to performing our role as a member of society. Based on our core technology cultivated through the development of dust control products, we offer an array of products that possess multiple functions, and aim to contribute to the field of cleanliness and health. As of the end of FY2019, we held 137 patents in Japan, and three outside of Japan. We hold patents in our core technology that is the source of our competitive capabilities, such as product forming technology, knowhow and other ideas. In the previous fiscal year we invested 560 million yen as R&D costs.
Natural Capital
Duskin has commercialized and grown an eco-friendly recycling-oriented business based on the rental of cleaning and sanitation products. We proactively take on initiatives to preserve the environment in a number of business fields, including food processing.
We always carefully consider the impacts on society and environment at every stage of our business flows — from raw material procurement, to product manufacturing, processing, delivery, consumption and use of products by our customers, used-products collection, recycling — and focus on developing safe and reliable products and services that help to reduce our burden on the environment. During FY 2019, our Dust Control Business recycled 97% of dust control products, used 2,193,000 GJ of energy and consumed 2,217,000 m3 of water. Moreover, our businesses pay close attention to recycling products and materials so as to extract as much value as possible from these limited resources.
Materiality
 Materiality Process
We have targeted social issues listed in the SDGs and other global standards, such as the labor shortage and Japan’s aging society, from the perspective of how we can contribute to them by addressing those issues through our value chain and business model. These are reviewed and evaluated by the project team, and each issue is classified into one of three categories: 1. Priority issues to proactively address; 2. Issues needing stronger action; and 3. Issues to continue addressing as before. In deliberations of the CSR Committee, we identified “Priority issues to proactively address” as critical for Creating Shared Value, CSV.

To meet the growing demand, Dusking has been steadily increasing the number of franchisees that provide services for seniors. To further evolve into a provider of Daily Life Fine-Tuning Services, we have strengthened collaboration across business lines including the dust control rental, cleaning and technical services.
Duskin is comprised of Direct Selling Group and Food Group, two separate business portfolios. While Direct Selling Group recorded lower sales, sales were higher in Food Group in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. As a result, consolidated sales increased 403 million yen, or 0.3%, from the previous fiscal year, to 159,102 million yen in the fiscal year under review.
Note 1: Business segment sales do not include intersegment sales.
Note 2: A reportable segment was changed on April 1, 2010. On April 1, 2018, Clean & Care Group was renamed Direct Selling Group.
With robust needs in the outsourcing of house cleaning and other cleaning services, Duskin is strengthening its system of service provision to customers. Focusing on franchise recruitment with a newly introduced franchise package with lower initial cost, Duskin is steadily increasing new franchisees.

Duskin conducts a program called Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classrooms, a series of on-site lessons for elementary schools. The goals are to provide a better understanding of the importance and significance of cleaning as well as the proper use of cleaning equipment, and to raise motivation toward cleaning. Taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19, classrooms scheduled from late February 2020 have been suspended.

  Profit attributable to owners of parent for the fiscal year under review, the source of profit to be returned to shareholders, decreased by 393 million yen (6.6%) to 5,591 million yen. This was due to lower ordinary profits driven by a fall in the share of profit of entities accounted for using the equity method, and came despite an improvement in extraordinary income resulting from an increase in the gain of sales of investment securities and reduced impairment losses.
Note: From the fiscal year ended March 2016, Duskin started using Revised Accounting Standard for Business Combinations (ASBJ Statement No. 21, September 13, 2013) and net income is reported as profit attributable to owners of parent.
The balance of free cash flow is also important to securing working capital when developing a business through franchising. Free cash flow, which is the sum of cash flows from operating activities and investing activities, totaled 11,987 million yen in the fiscal year ended March 2020, a 10,936 million yen increase from the previous fiscal year. This largely reflected a pause in the purchase of shares of affiliates undertaken during the previous fiscal year.
Food Group has been working on reducing food waste. In the Kanto and Tokai areas, unsold donuts are transformed in processing plants into animal feed. In the fiscal year ended March 2020, the group expanded the scope of recycling to the Kinki area and has started recycling donuts into biogas.

Effective from the fiscal year ended March 2020, Duskin revised its dividend policy. Our basic policy is to strengthen the return of profit to shareholders and to distribute profit in line with our performance while maintaining the proper balance between these distributions and the need to maintain financial soundness. A consolidated payout ratio of 50% is the guideline for the dividend for each fiscal year while maintaining the stability and consistency of dividend payments.
Note: The dividend for the fiscal year ended March 2014 includes a 20 yen 50th anniversary commemorative dividend, and the dividend for the fiscal year ended March 2019 includes a 10 yen 55th anniversary commemorative dividend.

Duskin considers reducing working hours as one of its highest priorities. After setting annual working hours per employee at no more than 1,850, data related to long working hours is reported periodically to the Board of Directors. Duskin has been implementing many initiatives, including encouraging employees to take 60% or more of paid annual leaves. A No Overtime Work Day at least once every month, turning off the lights at six p.m. at the Duskin Head Office building, and the Leave the Office Early Day Campaign*.

  Strategy and Action
To Our Stakeholders
With high aspirations under the motto “Let Us Sow the Seeds of Joy,”
we move forward to meet the expectations of society and our customers, believing that maintaining the status quo
is a step backwards.
Business Environment and Performance
   We are facing an unprecedented crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic since the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As COVID-19 has spread across the country and many routes of infection are unknown, the coronavirus emergency has forced consumers to make major changes in their work routines and lifestyles. While implementing telecommuting, teleworking, and staggered work hours, Duskin is responding, with a sense of urgency, to the need for work and lifestyle reforms as well as for cultural and mindset changes and improvements in the working environment.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, sales by Direct Selling Group of dust control products for residential use fell compared with the previous fiscal year due to the consumption tax hike and other factors. Sales of dust control products for commercial use increased year on year due to growing demand for sanitation-related products, such as detergents, disinfectants and mats with antibacterial action. In Care Service Businesses, custom-
Duskin’s Value Creation
As we operate through a network of franchised businesses, our main source of revenue comes from franchise systems. Our franchisees and the headquarters share in each other’s fortune and future. The franchise headquarters’ existence is determined entirely by the franchisees. Our relationship is like the two wheels of a cart.
er-level sales increased in all businesses, resulting in higher sales than in the previous fiscal year.
In Food Group, the mainstay Mister Donut Business Group closed underperforming locations and the total number of shops in operation decreased. The number of customers declined significantly, because of the effects of shopping mall closures when a state of emergency was declared. However, due to newly released products having been highly rated throughout the period and increasing demand for takeout at roadside locations, sales per shop in operation increased significantly, and sales exceeded those of the previous fiscal year.
As we cannot predict at this stage when the pandemic will end, it is difficult to forecast COVID-19’s impact on the current fiscal year’s business results. As that impact could be considerable, we will monitor the situation closely in the months ahead.
To get our franchise network through this unprecedented crisis, ensuring the health and safety of employees including part-time and temporary workers and keeping them in employment is of the utmost importance. As part of our franchise support, we have provided COVID-19 relief money to franchisees and their employees.

For shareholders, we will maintain stable cash dividends for each term with the aim of a consolidated payout ratio of 50%.
Since Duskin’s founding, we have positioned the philosophy of Economy and Morals in Unity at the core of management. Morals prompt compassion and kindness to people and a heart for appreciation. Even in changing
times, the attitude we present to society should remain constant. Economy, on the other hand, represents our financial pursuits for business growth as a company. Products, services, and business model should change with the times. We have been pursuing Unity of “what must be kept unchanged” and “what must be changed” since the time of our founding.

 Strategy and Action
To Our Stakeholders
Founder Seiichi Suzuki debuted Home Duskin, a rental dust cloth that removes dust without water to help reduce the burden of wet cleaning. From that time on, we have developed businesses that fit the needs of the times under the slogan “Let Us Sow the Seeds of Joy.” We aim to be of help to society to enhance our customers’ lives with our products and services.
Duskin’s greatest strengths are: providing solutions with our value-added products and services; many items actively marketed through our face-to-face interaction; and
providing excellent customer experience with time for relaxation in the pleasant ambience at our shops and restaurants. These are supported by all our franchisees and our corporate employees who embrace our management philosophy and form the Duskin franchise network with shared goals and vision for the future. This is the bond that unites us and distinguishes us from all others. As team members of the Duskin franchise network, we are committed to creating new value, and reflecting the voice of customers. This is our CSV management.
can order and pay in advance without waiting in line at a cash register.
The increase in number of working women also presents another challenge in our traditional rental system that provides product delivery and replacement by visiting homes during the day. We have launched a new system of return by post service where our sales representatives drop off new mops in customer mailbox and customers return used mops by mail. Another activity is to recommend a shift from cash payments to credit card payments. Customer data-sharing system between franchisees and Duskin has improved to be used in our business activities.
While utilizing the most up-to-date technology to enhance customer convenience, we place greater importance on personal touch and gracious hospitality to interact with customers and provide great customer services that meet their diversifying needs and expectations.
Direct Selling Group will further strengthen customer contact points in the residential market to further evolve into a comprehensive service provider. Nationwide, there
Corporate Governance
Since June 2020, two of our three Outside Directors have been women. We have ensured diversification on the Board of Directors by appointing women to three of the six outside director positions, including one woman who is an outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member.
In April 2020, a career Duskin woman was appointed as an operating officer. We will see more appointments of women in the future to better represent our customers and organization. Most of our customers for residential products and services are women. The managers at our franchise offices are mostly women. Most of the customers who frequent Mister Donut, and the staff members who work there, are women.
Under the Operating Officer System started in April 2018, the supervisory function was separated from business execution function. As a result, the oversight function has been strengthened. Along with the succession plan launched in FY2019, a development program for the next-generation executive candidates was also initiated.
are about 60,000 sales representatives who regularly visit customers’ homes. In particular, nowadays, when there has been a significant increase in the number of home deliveries via online sales, there are companies and products that will create synergies with our distribution network.
In the commercial market, we place priority on enhancing our service capabilities by increasing the number of Hygiene Masters, our comprehensive sanitary management experts.
In the competitive sector of Care Service Businesses, our challenge is to meet a significant demand in metropolitan markets. To address this situation, we focus on placing experts on the frontline in the growing business segment of professional cleaning and technical services. Leveraging our strengths of customer relations, we are committed to retaining and expanding our customer base.
Mister Donut, the core business of Food Group, marks its 50th anniversary. We have taken action to attract more customers, including MISDO Meets and MISDO GOHAN campaigns and renovating and opening more shops.
The program is designed to evaluate candidates from different perspectives. The candidates are assigned to different projects. They will be assessed according to their skills and leadership in different business areas. Good division managers may not always be suitable as operating officers or as directors. It is important to make sure that the evaluation is not made solely at the CEO’s discretion but from the perspectives of management philosophy and along with evaluations by their subordinates’. A new assessment system is in place to make 360-degree evaluations—from subordinates, co-workers and superiors. We visit workplaces where the managers have received a low evaluation from their subordinates to gather first-hand information.
For the nomination of directors in the past three years, we selected the candidates for each of the following fiscal years based on the opinions of the Director Evaluation Committee, which is composed of outside directors. As outside directors have given us critical advice, the transparency of the process is increasing.
Long-Term Strategy
We aim to unite all Duskin businesses so as to serve our customers in the most effective and courteous manner.
We are implementing the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 as the second phase of our nine-year long-term strategy, ONE DUSKIN.

   In recent years, labor shortage has been creating a major challenge in our business operation. Our shops, offices and plants must improve productivity with enhanced mechanization and automation. On the other hand, in direct selling, which places an emphasis on face-to-face communication with our customers, there is a concern of a delay in introducing artificial intelligence and digitalization
if we place focus only on dialogue. In an effort to address the concern, we will further utilize our membership website DDuet to facilitate communication with those customers not present at home or not covered by our direct selling channel. Another initiative is the introduction by Food Group of mobile ordering for enhanced customer convenience. With the new ordering system, customers

 Strategy and Action
To Our Stakeholders
What It Takes to Be a Good Leader
The required abilities and skills vary depending on the business sectors and responsibilities of the department. People in sales are expected to possess interpersonal skills; financial knowledge is required for those working in accounting department. The most important quality for leaders is fairness.
Good leaders are willing to act on their own initiative and be fair in judgment and decision-making. Some people support only those opinions that are the same as their own but not the dissenting opinions. Listening directly to the voices of team members, franchisees and customers provides opportunities to nurture leadership qualities.
A good example is illustrated in our relationship with MOS FOOD SERVICES Inc. Under our capital and business alliance, the franchise operations managers of Mister Donut and MOS BURGER build a relationship to grow and
inspire each other while recognizing each other’s differences. When Mister Donut Area Managers visit franchised shops for franchise support and guidance, they are accompanied by MOS BURGER managers—and vice versa. CEOs may have opportunities to talk with each other, but employees have less chance for interaction. Creating more opportunities for employees to learn from each other will help them grow.
New ideas or high productivity cannot be achieved by solely working in their office. This is especially true for Area Managers or salespeople. They cannot feel and understand how the places and stores that used to have many inbound foreign tourists have changed until they actually get out of the office. Through these experiences, I believe they can broaden their horizons and enhance their perspectives.
Looking to the Future
Duskin’s strength lies in our franchise network deeply rooted in the local communities. Because most of the franchise owners and staff members were born and raised in their communities, they are familiar with their markets. With this strength, we identify the areas where leadership can take advantage of artificial intelligence and other technologies to better serve our customers.
Another initiative is to respond to customer voices, such as “I want to use Duskin products right away.” “I want to have Duskin deliver a product soon.” In response to such requests, we will combine the strength of our direct selling system with the convenience of e-commerce. On behalf of franchisees, the headquarters send out products ordered online to customers. Sales representatives at local franchised units visit customers to follow up on these orders, and this includes the provision of after-sales services. As such, demand for follow-up service is on the rise; we plan to expand this service in all regions other than Tokyo.
In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of new franchisees in the Care Service Businesses segment. Dust control franchisees are consolidating because
My Vision
My interpretation of “Maintaining the status quo is a step backwards.” is to keep my aspirations and motivation high. It takes an endless effort to move forward.
During the journey, you may make a mistake or experience a failure. To our employees, I say, “there is no such thing as a failure.” Employees haven’t failed. They’ve just found many ways that won’t work. In a way, each realization was a success because they have moved forward to explore new opportunities, which ultimately leads to a success.
Duskin’s rental of cleaning and sanitation-related products, professional cleaning and helper services, and Mister Donut are the three successful Duskin brands that resonate with customers. Underlying the success are the failures over approximately 100 new businesses. I would
of succession issues. Many of our franchises have been in business for more than 50 years and their owners are the third generation. Franchisees with no successor have an option to transfer their business to neighboring franchisees or Duskin affiliated companies. In the case of business transfer between franchisees, the headquarters act as an intermediary to ensure that such transactions proceed in accordance with corporate rules and regulations. When transferred to the headquarters, one of our affiliated companies nationwide will take over the business. This allows us to serve our customers seamlessly.
The founding owners of franchisees joined Duskin because they were inspired by listening directly to our Founder’s philosophy. Many of our franchises are managed by third generation owners or on their third owners. In my case, I am the sixth president. We haven’t had the opportunity to listen to our Founder directly and our generation understands the wishes of our Founder only through his videos or writings. In my effort to build a trusting relationship with franchisees, I have visited about 2,500 franchisees throughout Japan over seven years since my appointment, just as the Founder did.
say our score is “three wins and ninety-seven losses,” but I am convinced that the losses have led to the development of our employees.
Our annual motto for fiscal 2020 is “Delivering on our commitments to customers, proactive in every action and transaction, we Sow the Seeds of Joy.” While committed to our customers and society, Duskin will act in a positive manner to meet their expectations.
In deepest appreciation of your continued support for this year and those to come, we look forward to our future together.

    Long-Term Strategy ONE DUSKIN Phase
     Aiming to be regarded as the world’s most attentive service provider by our customers in every community
To swiftly resolve the issues of people, products and services, and system, existing businesses that had been individually developed were consolidated into the following two:
• Clean Group (Dust Control Business, Care Service Businesses, and others)
• Food Group (Mister Donut Business and others)
Priority Issues
(1) Business operations led by regional offices
(2) Product and service development and planning,
business operations and enhancement of
training by women
(3) Expand customer contact points
(4) Raise efficiency, and strengthen the corporate
structure
Initiatives taken
• Established an organizational framework of
region-driven operations by delegating authority to regional offices which work closest to our customers. This structure enables regional offices to swiftly implement plans tailored to local characteristics.
• Increased the number of female Area Managers at regional offices, who supervise franchisees. Appointed more women in the product development and advertising sections.
• Clean Group conducted cleaning demonstrations on the street and at post offices, tested online order placement and product delivery by courier service. Mister Donut introduced Baked Donuts, a new product category.
• Reallocated human resources to regional offices. Reviewed operating procedures and streamlined them to improve efficiency.
There were contingencies unexpected at the time of planning, including the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011 and the associated nuclear power plant disaster as well as major changes in the situation overseas. In addition, as prices for raw materials, such as crude oil and grain, rose more than expected, we did not wait for the end of the Medium-Term Management Policy to re-extract the issues and instead proceeded to develop suitable measures and responses.
• Mister Donut entered Malaysia, and the Dust Control Business expanded to South Korea.
• Sales of cleaning and technical services increased, since opportunity loss was minimized by strengthening the structure to respond to the demand concentrated in short periods, such as air conditioner cleaning and year-end cleaning.
Introduced Baked Donuts and promoted sales of summertime donuts and donuts unique to certain local areas. However, sales were lower than in the previous year due to the impact of a drop in consumer spending.
• Sales in the residential market were at the same level as in the previous year due to the introduction of the LaLa floor mop. Sales in the commercial market, however, dipped lower than the previous year’s due to companies’ strong drive to reduce cost.
From product development to sales channels, reform and improve systems so that all our customers feel that “Duskin is empathetic, familiar and easy to access”
All services were reviewed to ensure our operations are seen from the customers’ perspective through joint efforts of the head office, which focused on service and product development, and regional offices, which concentrate on responding to customers in each regional market.
Priority Issues
(1) Operational system reform: Change to a customer-oriented product and service delivery system that meets the needs of the times
(2) Corporate structure change: Review phases from production to logistics in order to reduce costs (3) Improve on the status quo through original and
imaginative approaches: Anticipate customer requests in each region and formulate measures to satisfy them.
(4) New growth: Expand Dust Control Business and Mister Donut Business overseas
Initiatives taken
• Built a new system for delivering rental mops to
customers, such as by courier and mail
• Further promoted the delegation of authority for
business operations to regional offices which work closest to our customers, and built a system that enabled formulation of policies tailored to local characteristics
• Made two manufacturers into subsidiaries to improve profitability through in-house production
• Started operation of the DDuet membership website as a pathway to deliver information directly to our customers
Found customer needs and consumer behavior to be more diversifying than expected. New systems were completed but not recognized well enough among customers to be utilized.
Continued to introduce new products and services as part of our efforts to strengthen product and technological development. Challenges remained for the group as a whole to achieve growth.
• Succeeded in reducing costs by implementing various cost-reduction measures, such as production and distribution system reforms
• Enabled swift policy implementation by building a policy planning system tailored to regional characteristics
• Plans and measures were developed in line with regional characteristics, but they were not well implemented through the existing sales channels. Further diversification of customer contacts was required.
• Dust Control and Mister Donut increased the number of locations overseas, but did not enter any new overseas markets.
Formulated Phase I, the “Commitment & Action” plan, to build the foundation for achieving the nine-year long-term strategy of ONE DUSKIN
Efforts focused on recovering business performance and getting the group back onto a growth track
Basic policies
(1) Business model development: Develop a business platform through which Duskin and its franchisees can share and make the most of customer information
(2) New growth: Focus on developing new businesses, and expand Clean & Care Business and Mister Donut overseas
(3) Structural reform: Review the cost structures of production & logistics, distribution, procurement and information systems, focus on improving the profit structure
(4) Enhancement of corporate governance: In addition to the idea of fair and highly transparent management, strengthen corporate governance as part of the growth strategy
The first three-year phase made a foothold on achieving the ONE DUSKIN strategy.
New Businesses
• Rebranded the Home Instead Business into the Duskin
Life Care Business to strengthen services for the seniors
market
• Started Home Repair Business as a new technical service
Overseas Development
• Made Malaysia’s largest donut chain, Big Apple, a subsidiary
Growth of Existing Businesses

model and sanitary management service structures
• Mister Donut accelerated renovations to new-type shops
and introduced light meal items for breakfast and lunch.
訪 販 グループ
Implemented reforms to help customers to use new systems, products and services
Mister Donut found customer needs and consumer behavior to be more diverse than expected. Sales per shop in operation increased, but total sales were lower due to the decrease in the number of shops.
Clean & Care Group
• Expanded the DDuet membership from 70,000 (as at the
end of March 2015) to 580,000 (as at the end of March 2018) with a focus on enhanced benefits communicated to residential customers
• Trained Hygiene Masters with specialized skills and knowledge, and strengthened the sanitation management service structure
Structural Reform
• Profitability improved due to cost reductions in
procurement, production and logistics
• Clean & Care Group trained sales representatives to function like concierges for residential customers and strengthened sanitary management services with Hygiene Masters. Leveraging these service structures, Clean & Care Group need to drive sales efforts to build a foundation for growth in the next phase.
• Mister Donut recorded higher sales per shop in operation, but total sales were lower. This was due to the decreased number of shops as new shop openings were delayed. Mister Donut needs to accelerate its initiatives to rebuild the brand.

Review of Financial Results
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (FY2019), profit attributable to owners of the parent decreased due to factors specific to this fiscal year, including IT system upgrades to respond to the October consumption tax hike. ROE was down 0.2 percentage points from the previous year. Free cash flow was 11.9 billion yen, and we repurchased 7.7 billion yen of company stock as a measure to lift shareholder returns. As a result, the total return ratio was 189.3%, exceeding 100% for two consecutive years.
We have maintained a sound financial position, as total assets were 185.1 billion yen with an equity ratio 76.6% as of March 31, 2020.
Maintaining a Solid Financial Base
We are maintaining a solid financial base—one built up by placing a high priority on financial soundness. Our business operates through a franchise network, and as a franchisor we are responsible for maintaining the network if a natural disaster strikes. As such, we have funds to provide restoration and operational support to the affected franchisees. Furthermore, Duskin is preparing to transfer the business of franchisees who face the problem of having no successor. Sufficient cash and deposits have also been secured as M&A funds necessary to acquire new businesses.
In preparation for further unforeseen circumstances, we possess sufficient capacity for procurement from financial institutions and will continue working to maintain financial soundness.

       Duskin considers the return of profits to shareholders as an important management priority. We have set out our basic dividend policy of distributing a portion of the profit based on our performance. At the same time, we are ensuring an appropriate balance between these distributions and the need for investments in sustainable growth and higher corporate value while maintaining a financial bulwark against potential risks. Under this policy, we will continue to consistently pay stable cash dividends with a target consolidated payout ratio of 50%. We will also examine the possibility of a share repurchase in terms of the total return ratio.
In the fiscal year under review, the total shareholder return (TSR), including dividends was 9.9%, and the TSR for the past 10 years has been as follows. We will continue to implement growth strategies and appropriate financial capital policies to achieve a TSR that exceeds the cost of shareholders’ equity.

  Basic Policy
Duskin is focusing on improving the capacity of each business to generate cash flow by lifting capital efficiency and maintaining a solid financial base. Our core financial strategy is use generated cash to sustain development and balance the allocation of profits among shareholders, other stakeholders, and investments prioritized for future growth.
Uncertainties are increasing in the business environment due to the impact of the novel coronavirus. Under such circumstances, we will assess business performance and evaluate investments with a focus on both cash flow and profit-loss management.
Improving Capital Efficiency
We believe that generating profits and cash flows that exceed the cost of capital will improve shareholder value. To assess annual capital efficiency and return on investment (ROI), the Board of Directors discusses the direction forward for all businesses based on their portfolio analysis. Another initiative for boosting capital efficiency is the launch of the Investment Assessment Committee, an authority that reviews new investment projects, to create PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycles for investment. We aim to achieve higher profitability with an increase in ROE to 5% at an early stage by establishing a new business foundation through investments in growth and greater efficiency through streamlining business processes and cutting costs.

 Concerning Cross-Shareholdings
The policy for cross-shareholdings is to hold a suitable number of shares only when there is a legitimate reason for owning these shares. Investments in stocks for which there is no legitimate reason for ownership are reduced or eliminated.
The number of strategically held stocks was 34 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, but decreased to 21 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (reduction of 13 stocks over five years).

Kazushi Sumimoto
Director & COO
General Manager, Strategy Management, Direct Selling Group
In April 2020, Direct Selling Group, with the aim of accelerating our initiatives to provide Daily Life Fine-Tuning Services, established three divisions: Planning & Development, which cultivates expertise in each business’s area of specialty; Operations, which implements activities to suit regional needs and characteristics; and Strategy Management, which plans strategies to help customers fine-tune the rhythm of their daily lives. The group strives to explore new growth areas closely related to everyday life, beyond our traditional business domain, to create value unmatched by any other company. Duskin’s head office and franchisees are working together to further expand the range of services that are in tune with each customer’s daily rhythm.
In 2020, people’s lifestyles and values have completely transformed, as the COVID-19 pandemic and its accompanying state of emergency introduced unprecedented challenges. People’s awareness of hygiene in their environment and the need for more rigorous sanitation management has risen higher than ever before, and this level of interest is unlikely to subside anytime soon. At Duskin, with an understanding of these changes in the social environment and needs of the times, we are committed to research and development that furthers our expertise in sanitation-related products and services.
Direct Selling Group continues to identify people’s real needs and provide solutions through our products, services, and information.

shops is on the decline, and companies are always looking for new ways to reduce costs. On the other hand, the Care Service Businesses market is expected to expand because the number of working couples is growing and the need for outsourced cleaning and housework is rising in the wake of work-style reforms. Meanwhile, Japan’s aging society is amplifying the Senior Care Businesses market. Furthermore, in the Dust Control and Care Service Businesses, we will be cultivating new business and providing sanitary management products and services in response to the heightened awareness of hygiene stemming from the novel coronavirus crisis.
Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
The ONE DUSKIN strategy was formulated with the goal to unite all Duskin’s businesses to effectively serve our customers through the products and services we offer. Based on this strategy, we are undertaking initiatives to enrich each business’s expertise in their area of specialty as well as strengthen our systems, structures, and product development functions. When developing products, services, and systems, we also include designing service menus that make it possible to provide products and services beyond existing systems and structures. The overall aim is for Direct Selling Group to serve customers at every stage of life through specialist businesses for certain needs.

In the Care Service Businesses, which have recently seen a sharp rise in demand, we provide five services: ServiceMaster for professional house cleaning; Merry Maids for home cleaning and helper services; Terminix for pest control and prevention; Total Green for plant and flower maintenance; and Home Repair for fixing scratches and dents. To address growing needs in Japan’s aging society, we operate Health Rent rental and sales of nursing and assistive devices, and Life Care support services for seniors. Other businesses in Direct Selling Group are: Health & Beauty, which sells cosmetics and health food; Rent-All, which rents out household items and equipment for various events; and Uniform Service, which plans, sells, and leases out uniforms. These businesses are operated mainly through our franchise network. We rent and sell our branded products to franchisees and provide them with business system know-how and expertise, and the Company receives payments for rental and sales of products and royalties from franchisees in return.
Risks and Opportunities
As a pioneer in Direct Selling Business, Duskin possesses a high profile as well as an abundant know-how and brands. The Dust Control Business has a dominant share in both the residential and commercial markets, although both markets are shrinking. In the residential market, fewer people stay at home during the daytime due to more women working outside the home, and disposable cleaning products are becoming popular. In the commercial market, the number of offices and

Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
To transform into a provider of Daily Life Fine-Tuning Services, Direct Selling Group is boosting collaboration among the Dust Control, the Care Service, and the Senior Care Businesses. Our focus is also on maintaining and expanding the customer base and improving convenience for customers at the Dust Control Business, and strengthening the service structure at the Care Service and the Senior Care Businesses. Our strength has been service visits and face-to-face sales of products and services to meet customers in person and listen to their requests. However, as our customers’ lifestyles and work styles have diversified with the development of the Internet and work-style reforms, it has become difficult to closely connect with all customers and satisfy their everyday needs just by home visits and face-to-face sales proposals.
To improve convenience and the service experience for our customers, we are also expanding non-face-to-face contact with them. Included in these initiatives are presentation videos posted on our website. These videos help customers to grasp the details of products and services and learn how to use them even if they do not have the opportunity to meet our sales representatives. We also promote free enrollment to our membership website DDuet, from which customers can place orders. We are also shifting payment by customers from traditional cash to credit card payment. Another drive toward non-face-to-face services is the return of dust control products by post. That is, rental products are delivered to customers’ mailboxes, and they return used products by mail. This way, customers do not need to be home to receive rental items from our sales representatives. These ideas to strengthen non-face-to-face contact have had some positive effects during the two years of the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018.
In FY2019, we launched new ways to support people’s lives. Highlights included opening the Duskin Laboratory, a collaboration space connecting Duskin and people outside the Company to create new value, and starting testing of the Duskin Wash laundry service.
Business Services
Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
Business Services are evolving from the conventional sales approach by individual product or service divisions to a business-partner type sales approach. The business-partner type approach provides comprehensive sanitary management know-how to the customer’s entire facility, in response to the growing interest and demand from restaurants and food-processing plants. As such, we have focused on developing Hygiene Masters, specialists in sanitary management in professional kitchens. As at the end of March 2020, there were 1,668 Hygiene Masters nationwide. This has strengthened the collaboration among the Dust Control Business (residential and commercial mats and mops, air purifiers, hand sanitizers, sanitary management products), Service Master (air-conditioner cleaning and professional cleaning using specialized equipment), Terminix (pest control and comprehensive hygiene management), and Uniform Service (sales and leasing, regular cleaning services, and management of uniforms). This reinforced cooperation has resulted in better services. With the impact of COVID 19 raising the need for sanitary management, our Hygiene Masters are expected to play a more active role for our commercial customers.

Our Hygiene Masters’ Proposal to identify, improve and maintain sanitary environment at customers’ facilities
To identify: Example of service – Wipe-and-inspect service
The wipe-and-inspect service involves checking for microorganisms that stick to equipment, utensils, and workers’ fingers. By identifying areas where cleaning is inadequate, customers can manage their microbial environment more reliably than before.
To improve: Example of service – Pest control service
We exterminate and prevent pests in restaurants and offices by environmentally friendly methods, not relying only on chemicals.
We provide professional regular management services to ensure a clean environment for customers.
To maintain: Example of service – Uniform service
We provide clean uniforms, which are the basis of sanitation management, combined with full support using the rental status sheet, uniform labels and tags.
Example of product: Regular rental of air purifiers and disinfection products
   Duskin Wash Initiatives
Duskin Wash test unit opened to establish a market for the laundry service
On October 1, 2019, we opened a test site for the Duskin Wash laundry service in Suita City, Osaka Prefecture, as a new business to help customers reduce the time and labor spent on laundry in daily life and reduce their housework burden.
The laundry service includes washing, drying, folding of water washable laundry, and then returning it to customers. Coin-operated laundry machines are also set up on the premises. Membership at a flat rate is available. Duskin Wash is cultivating demand from child-rearing families, singles living alone, and seniors.

A robust nationwide production and sales framework
To secure a recycling-oriented business model on a nationwide scale requires putting into place a framework of plants and to purchase materials for rental products, not to mention the time and costs associated with building an organization of sales representatives that will cover the entire country. Few can compete against this.
A robust customer base
Our strongpoint is having a broad customer base that we can approach for face-to-face sales.
Our customer base in the residential market is particularly solid.

Care Service Businesses
Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
The Care Service Businesses have high market growth potential, and our business in this sector also continues to thrive. We aim to maximize the customer base by expanding our business through aggressive investment and proactive proposals to customers (homes and business sites). To that end, we are concentrating not only on keeping pace with the speed of the market’s growth but also on cross-sectional businesses to realize comprehensive services that are in tune with each customer’s daily rhythm for the residential market and comprehensive hygiene management know-how for facilities for commercial customers. We are also strengthening our service system to meet this growing demand.
Initiatives on Franchise Development and Recruitment for Care Service
Traditionally, we have mainly targeted our existing franchise owners to join the Care Service Businesses. In the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018, however, the target has expanded to companies and individuals outside the Duskin franchise system. To encourage individuals to join the Care Service franchise, we have made some revisions to the franchise package. Another move has been to exhibit at franchise expositions. Under the capital and business alliance agreement with NAC, our largest franchisee in the Dust Control Business, new office openings have accelerated. As a result, the number of Care Service Businesses sites is steadily increasing (refer to the graph on page 17).
Development of a New Urban Office Package
Since customers generally do not visit our Care Service Businesses offices, we have traditionally located Care Service offices in the suburbs, where rents are low. Staff members drive from the office to the customers’ homes or offices in urban areas with company cars, but this has been creating problems with travel and staff recruitment. As a test case to address these problems, we opened a new office in a prime location, in line with the Urban New Office Package. In this test, staff travel to customers’ homes or offices by electric bicycle, or by taxi using a ride-hailing or ride-sharing app. We will continue with further testing in the rapidly changing metropolitan market.
Acceptance of Non-Japanese Nationals as Housekeeping Service Workers in the National Strategic Special Zones Project
Three years have passed since we entered the Acceptance of Non-Japanese Nationals as Housekeeping Service Workers project in the National Strategic Special Zones in Tokyo, Osaka and Kanagawa. As of the end of March 2020, 47 people from the Philippines have been employed as housekeeping service crews. They work in company-owned offices mainly in Tokyo, where demand for home cleaning and helper services is expanding. This is helping to mitigate the staff shortage.
Duskin Staff Bank Addresses the Staff Shortage at Care Service Businesses Offices
As a measure to solve the staff shortage, we have opened Duskin Staff Bank, Duskin’s recruitment website, to augment recruiting by franchisees themselves. We encourage franchisees to use this website to find new staff. This website is unique because it is designed exclusively to hire cleaning service workers—something exceptionally rare in the job-search industry. Result-based fees for advertising are charged to franchisees only after 30 days of an applicant’s successful employment. This service has been welcomed by franchisees with high turnover rate, and as most operators in the cleaning industry face the same challenge, it is helping to reduce the shortage of cleaning staff.
Senior Care Businesses
Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
Rentals and sales of nursing-care and assistive devices by the Health Rent Business continue to grow steadily. We will work more closely with franchisees with a goal to be an assistive device counselor who meet the needs of each user and gain more trust of Care Managers, a source of user referrals.
In addition to its basic policy of expanding our ability to provide services to more customers, the Life Care Business (support services for seniors) is working harder than ever before on marketing activities to spread brand recognition of Duskin Life Care. The business is also improving our technology and upgrading knowledge to meet the diverse needs of customers and their families.
Health Rent Provides Assistive Devices and Other Support for the Well-Being of Seniors
The Health Rent Business rents out and
sells nursing-care and assistive devices
to support seniors from a nationwide
network of 160 offices from Hokkaido to
Okinawa (as of the end of March 2020).
We visit users of our products every
three months, and during these visits we
check to ensure the products or devices
best suit their current condition. These
periodic visits with users enable us to provide them with safe and reliable products and share information with the Care Managers, who refer users to us. Satisfying the expectations of both users and Care Managers is a top priority.
In Collaboration with Wako City, Saitama, Wako Iki-iki Life Service Plaza Launched the Regional Collaborative Project to Promote Life-long Activity, Supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
Since April 2019, Wako Iki-iki Life Service Plaza has recruited seniors aged 65 and over as members of the Wako Public Lab, and more than 500 people have registered. The Plaza hosts activities and events on behalf of local companies, including Duskin, for product testing or monitoring, questionnaire-based surveys, group interviews, and other activities to collect feedback and opinions from seniors participating in these activities. These initiatives also help to motivate seniors to participate in society. Wako City has rated the project highly, and these initiatives will continue under it over the next three years.

Segment Overview
 Food Group
 To celebrate Mister Donut’s 50th anniversary, we are endeavoring to surge ahead like never before.
Tetsuya Wada
Director & COO Food Group
Since January 27, 1970, the day Duskin decided to introduce the Mister Donut business to Japan, we have aimed to provide places where people can get together and enjoy a variety of delicious foods including donuts, pies, muffins, and dim sum. And thanks to everyone, this year marked the 50th anniversary in business.
To make sure Mister Donut continues to be a place everyone loves to visit, we have created a brand slogan: “Something good’s gonna happen. Mister Donut.” Our goal is to provide shops that every customer can drop into at any time of day. As a trigger to visit, we are actively pushing the MISDO Meets initiative, which was jointly developed by Gion Tsujiri and Toshi Yoroizuka, and promoting seasonal products during the current period as well. In terms of shop development, we will begin testing labor-saving measures in Tokyo and Osaka shops with the aim of reducing the labor force by about 50% to improve shop efficiency.
With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of Food Group businesses dropped in the first quarter ending on March 31, 2021 due to shortened business hours and temporary closure of the shops. The management environment in each food business is severe because it is uncertain when the epidemic will be eradicated. While sales from eating in shops have fallen substantially, Mister Donut has increased the number of purchased items per customer and the number of customers who take out because takeout demand has risen. To respond to such changes in the market, we will initiate unprecedented schemes that reach beyond existing ways of thinking.
In FY2020, we will redouble our efforts to surpass our past performance with the theme of “Excel above and beyond.” We are committed to delivering satisfying results to celebrate Mister Donut’s years in Japan.
Results of FY2019
Food Group’s flagship business, Mister Donut, reduced the number of shops in operation as it continued to close underperforming shops. The total customer-level sales from all shops increased during the fourth quarter over the previous year despite the ongoing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly because new products were highly accepted, which augmented the average sales of shops in operation.
The Mister Donut business continued to focus on the MISDO Meets initiative. Products jointly developed with companies and brands using leading techniques and high-quality materials including Kyoto green tea specialty brand Gion Tsujiri, well-known patisserie Mon Cher, and the world’s top pastry chef PIERRE HERME, gained popularity and contributed to increased sales.
Also, the dough used for long-term basic products such as Old Fashion, Chocolate, Pon De Ring, and French Cruller were refined to further improve taste. Moreover, the Tapioca Drink, which was introduced as a drink and dessert menu item to drive demand during the slower summer period, stayed strong from April through to the end of the year. Three other initiatives proved very popular and contributed significantly to increased sales: MISDO Pokemon Donut, a holiday season collaboration with Pocket Monsters; MISDO de Party Chu Collection, which was rolled out with popular characters; and MISDO Lucky Bags 2020.
Although sales from Katsu & Katsu, a restaurant chain specializing in pork cutlets, maintained the same sales level as the previous year, other businesses in Food Group including Bakery Factory, a suburban bakery chain; The Chiffon & Spoon, which specializes in chiffon cakes; and Pie Face, a chain of pie specialty shops, experienced lower sales due to the consumption tax hike, reduced numbers of shops, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
The Mister Donut business has marked its 50th anniversary since opening in Japan, and over this time we have created a new food culture with new product concepts including oven-baked items and dim sum. We are determined to continue our endeavors in innovative ways to deliver Mister Donut products and services that more and more customers will love. As part of our efforts, we sell value-added products to increase the frequency of customer visits. We also have used reusable pottery and glass tableware since 1974, and introduced paid plastic shopping bags on April 1, 2020. Furthermore, we have started contributing our products to the food bank. Mister Donut is also accelerating new shop development and remodeling while establishing new business formats that respond to customer needs. Our goals for future engagement focus not on motivating customers to visit shops, but on bringing Mister Donut closer to customers.
Results of FY2019
Duskin Kyoeki Co., Ltd. (a leasing and insurance agency) and Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd. (which provides management services for medical institutions), both domestic consolidated subsidiaries, recorded higher sales.
Among the overseas consolidated subsidiaries, sales increased at Duskin Shanghai Co., Ltd., which operates a dust control business in Shanghai, China. Sales by the Big Apple Worldwide Holdings Sdn. Bhd., which operates donut businesses primarily in Malaysia, were lower due to a decline in sales at existing shops. As a result, the total sales of consolidated subsidiaries outside Japan were lower.
Customer-level sales outside Japan in direct-selling businesses exceeded those of the previous year in all countries and regions, specifically Taiwan, China (Shanghai), and South Korea. Whereas the Mister Donut business in Taiwan maintained the previous year’s performance, sales in China (Shanghai) and Thailand declined, whereas sales in the Philippines and Indonesia increased steadily. However, Big Apple recorded lower sales than in the previous year.
Updates on the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
Despite the intense competition Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd. has faced in the medical institution cleaning market, we expect demand to grow. In preparing to better respond to this increased demand, we will focus on securing a workforce and improving service quality to achieve higher profitability.
As a part of new business development, we have launched a frozen bento service for hospital breakfasts. This new service has reduced the burden on hospital employees because there is no need to wash dishes or arrange the food. Moreover the variety of tasty choices has improved patient satisfaction. We will continue to provide this service as a way to boost sales into the future.
We saw the growth in dust control business overseas and with cleaning and technical services in Taiwan. In addition, new customers in the commercial market for dust control are increasing steadily in Shanghai, China. Considering that the Mister Donut business in Indonesia is expanding the rollout of donut showcases in convenience stores, we need to continue our focus on localized business development in each market.

Although the future of the current situation is unclear, we recognize that thorough cost management and cash flow management are essential while prioritizing and implementing the necessary measures. Responding to work-style reform is also a pressing issue, and we believe that it is an urgent task to raise employee awareness and improve the working environment.

Research & Development
50 years ago, Duskin revolutionized the world of cleaning with the release of a chemically treated dust cloth that enabled dusting without water.
Our enduring mission is to continue researching the science of clean.
Duskin Research & Development Policy
Taking a consumer-first approach to research and development in the cleaning and sanitation sectors, we are committed to acting on the following five pledges to provide the community with healthy and comfortable lifestyles.
1. We determine priorities for research and development by identifying social trends and needs in residential markets and analyzing customer issues and concerns.
2. We conduct research and technological development in terms of novelty, inventiveness and originality.
3. We develop products that can ensure safety and security for society, people and nature.
4. We create products with resource-saving raw materials that contribute to environmental conservation.
5. We continuously improve products after launch to provide customers with optimal functionality that satisfies their expectations.
Policy for Research & Development Initiative
We pursue the integration of our original technologies with other leading ones from around the world. In aiming to serve as a hub for connecting such technologies to customer needs, Duskin will continue to develop innovative products and services with our refined technologies and expertise. About the Research & Development Center
Our living environment has been undergoing great changes, reflected in the increase of single-person households. As for corporations, they are facing a change in work patterns arising from the labor shortage and reforms to work practices—changes that have made it difficult for them to maintain sanitation in their workplace environments. Furthermore, shifts in lifestyles and social environments have been affecting the human body, triggering an increase in disorders such as allergies.
Moreover, we witnessed the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) during the third quarter of FY2019. Taking these societal changes into account, we are promptly responding to diversified needs and requirements for more rigorous and frequent cleaning and disinfection at homes and workplaces.
Looking at the current environment and beyond, our Research & Development Center is committed to delivering experiences that enhance the comfort and health of our customers, while securing their safety. We will continue to devote ourselves to research and development that helps our business to further evolve into a provider of Daily Life Fine-Tuning Services.
Allergy Segment Research
Duskin has aimed to create clean environments through cleaning ever since our founding. Along with pursuing efficient means of reducing dust volumes, we have also advanced research into dust itself. In our research, we focus on the fact that some forms of dust can cause allergies, and have begun engaging in allergy countermeasure research under the themes of Dust and Healthy Life as well as Cleaning and Healthy Life.
Advancing DAP through Joint Research with Allergy Specialists
We are advancing the Duskin Allergy Control Plan (DAP) research project under the theme of Allergens as Part of Daily Life.

Action on Climate Change
Basic Policy
The effects of extreme weather and climate change are intensifying and becoming more serious, and global solutions are required to mitigate climate change. Duskin is committed to contributing to solutions to help build a sustainable society through our environmental management initiatives and measures to achieve a low-carbon society.
Governance
We established the CSR Committee, which consist of the Outside Directors, the Operating Officers, and the Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members. This committee, serving as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, studies and deliberates the basic policies and key issues associated with climate change. We also established the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee, which determines environmental policies and guidelines for the entire company, and the Environmental Liaison Committee, which manages the progress of environmental policies, as sub-organizations under the CSR Committee. This structure helps the Board of Directors to identify and monitor actual risks and opportunities, and to enhance climate change-related governance.
Strategy
Duskin positions the risks and opportunities associated with climate change as critical management issues. In order to advance information disclosure based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we classify and study climate-related risks as risk associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy and risk associated with the physical impacts of climate change, in line with the TCFD classifications.
Contribution to SDGs
Duskin focuses on reducing greenhouse gases, with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions at least 26% compared with FY2013 by 2030 as laid out in our long-term environmental vision.

Risk Management
We conducted a provisional climate change risk assessment, using a qualitative approach to evaluate financial implications that could significantly affect our businesses. Through carefully reviewing the results, we have identified the key drivers that could have a major impact on our business continuity.

   To fulfill our responsibilities as a Japanese company, Duskin is implementing energy-saving activities throughout the entire franchise chain. In terms of Scope 3, we are working to reduce CO2 emissions with a target that is equal to or greater than the target stated by the government. At the same time, in terms of energy consumption within Scope 1 and Scope 2, we set and manage standard consumption rates (target values) every fiscal year based on the actual performance of each shops, offices and plants in steadily working to reduce the CO2 emissions that are a cause of global warming.
Future Initiatives: Scenario analysis
Duskin is reviewing these key drivers based on at least two scenarios for physical impacts and socioeconomic transition risks arising from climate change in the world from 2030 to 2050. We will quantitatively assess the potential financial impact on our businesses and develop the measures to address them.
Adopted Scenarios
• IPCC RCP 8.5 Scenario: Global average temperature rise of at least 4°C from pre-industrial levels • IPCC SR 1.5 Scenario: Global average temperature rise kept below 1.5°C

Based on our Environmental Philosophy, established in 1998, Duskin has defined our Environmental Policy as “striving to achieve the joint objective of engaging in sound business activities and environmental conservation to provide products and services that are safe, reliable, and environmentally friendly throughout each phase of their lifespan, from production to after-use.”
We engage in business activities that reduce negative impacts on the environment whenever possible as part of designing, development and selection of products and services; plant operation; distribution, sales and promotional activities; and offices, facilities and equipment.

Duskin's Direct Selling Group and Production & Logistics Group are putting environmental management initiatives into action in line with ISO 14001. Its approach is based on the concept Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA).

Based on our EMS, we conduct ongoing inspections every year and renewal inspections every three years. During FY2019, Duskin Group complied with environmental regulations.

Initial environmental training sessions are conducted as part of an educational program for our new employees. By raising environmental awareness, we strive to develop employees who work to conserve the environment throughout all their business activities.

One of the Operating Officers serves as the Chief Environmental Officer under the Environmental Management Structure, who holds the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee. The committee studies the focused areas of CSR related to the environment and makes proposals to the CSR Committee. It also studies revision drafts for regulations and rules related to the environment and makes proposals to the Board of Directors.

Endeavors for a Recycling-Oriented Society
Duskin established a system for renting cleaning tools in Japan. As reflected in this rental system, Duskin operates its business based on the idea of repeated use, shared use, reduction of waste and disposal. To contribute to the creation of a recycling-oriented society, we will make effective use of limited resources while at the same time engaging in the 4Rs (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) throughout the entire product life cycle.
Mister Donut: Reducing food loss, electricity consumption and chlorofluorocarbon emissions
Because we are making use of Earth’s resources, we have continuously engaged in endeavors to save them. This year in particular, which marks our 50th anniversary, Mister Donut will further evolve our approach to environmental conservation.
• Free plastic bags service terminated as of April 1, 2020.
• Recycling unsold donuts at certain shops into animal feed; turning methane produced after decomposing and fermenting the donuts, into biogas for use as electric energy
• Used frying oil recycled 100% into fuel for boilers at our laundry plants where mops and mats are washed and reprocessed
• A portion of raw materials provided to food banks
• Reusable ceramic and glass tableware provided since 1974 for customers dining in-store
Excluding certain shops
• Emissions reduced by monitoring and managing air conditioners and freezers that use chlorofluorocarbons through thoroughgoing periodic inspections
• Original equipment performance maintained through systematic cleaning and maintenance at each shop. Energy management implemented and reduced the consumption of electric power
Direct Selling Group: Reuse of mop and mat products
All used items are collected from customers, and 97% of the collected items are processed in the laundry plants and reused. The remaining 3% unusable items are utilized as fuels. All products are repeatedly used until their usable life ends. Dust and dirt on mops and mats are also recycled into materials for cement.

Material Balance
Input and output of resources in business activities (FY2019)
Material Balance refers to the input of energy and resources used in business activities, and the output of substances produced through the activities. Duskin focuses on grasping the overall environmental loads in the lifecycle of our rental products as well as in other business activities.
Supply Chain
     
Conservation and Effective Use of Water Resources
Water shortage is aggregating on a global scale. It also presents the risk of negative impacts on the business continuity, so reducing water use and reusing water is important. Although Japan is not yet faced with chronic water shortage, we see this is not unrelated with Duskin Group.
At Duskin, a Founder’s quote of “Return what we borrow from nature to its original state” has been passed down since our founding, and serves as our basic philosophy for conserving water resources.
Water Use Reduction Initiatives
Duskin plants use large amounts of water in the laundry process for mops and mats. Therefore, we apply standards for the volume of water used during the laundry process as a reference value for our plants and strive to manage and reduce water intake volumes.


Duskin focuses on mutual understanding and trust-based relationships in our business practices with suppliers both domestic and overseas, based on the principle of good faith, honesty, fairness, and equal opportunity, as well as transparent transactions to comply with the social code and statutory regulations.

For the contracted plants manufacturing our products and raw materials, our Quality Assurance & Risk Management team conducts several types of inspections, including comprehensive qualification for new contractors, inspection of their production operation and periodic inspections of all contractors, as part of our efforts for continuous improvement. Our inspection specialists for food processing plants conduct extensive quality inspections, including facility management, process management, sanitary management and production management. All plants are evaluated and ranked by the results of inspections and other evaluation items. Periodic inspections are conducted regularly (one to three years) depending on the plants’ rankings. During FY2019, we conducted first-time inspections at 14 plants (including two overseas plants) and periodic inspections at 38 plants.

With the higher frequency of heavy rains, typhoons, and other extremely severe disasters in recent years, building a strong supply chain with disaster resilience has become ever more important. In preparation for the risk of temporary product supply disruptions due to damage to a Duskin product manufacturer from natural disasters, we have developed a contingency plan for the mainstay products in our dust control business, which would incur a particularly large impact.

 Sustainable Procurement
Negative impacts on the environment arising from the use of palm oil refined from oil palm fruit has been a growing concern, because the development of oil palm plantations destroys tropical rainforests. When Duskin uses these kinds of raw materials, we establish a procurement network with the partnered suppliers to ensure fair and legitimate business practices.
In addition to three international standards – namely ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems, ISO 22000 Food Safety Management Systems, and ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems, all our partner plants have obtained HACCP certification.
Apart from these initiatives, the plants also focus on hygiene and sanitation control through different initiatives on a monthly basis, such as the 5S activities: Sort,
Set-in-order, Shine, Sanitation, and Sustain discipline, as well as safety and sanitation training programs.
Furthermore, Duskin has established voluntarily imposed standards for waste-water treatment that are stricter than those set by governments. The plants collect and retain data from voluntary inspections to monitor water quality as part of their endeavors to preserve the natural environment.


To win customers’ trust, we strive to establish and ensure a complete quality control system. We pursue safe, reliable and environmentally friendly products and services grounded in our quality policy.
Duskin Quality Policy
Duskin offers various products and services from cleaning, sanitation products to food service. In our effort to ensure the quality of the products and services, we created our Quality Policy in 2009. Based on this policy, we define our quality standards and develop environmentally responsible products and services.

Quality Assurance Framework
To ensure that all our products and services are safe and reliable, we have established a quality assurance framework that covers all products from development to after launch. Our Quality Assurance & Risk Management team has two important functions: to supervise the quality control by each business line and monitor the safety and reliability of products and services; and to conduct inspections on products and services and evaluate them from the viewpoint of customers. The team also organizes the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee, consisting of Outside Directors and managers of major divisions. They hold the Committee meetings twice a year to deliberate on the guidelines of quality control and assurance, and the environment.
During the development phase, prior to launch, the safety and reliability of products and services are objectively reviewed at the development meetings. For the development of food products and services and their specification changes, internal rules require that we ensure their safety at a meeting of the Food Safety Council. Following a launch, we conduct quality checks on products in distribution.

 Initiatives for Reflecting the Voice of Our Customers
Duskin listens to the voices of customers and builds business models that flexibly respond to the shifts in lifestyles and social situations, and provides products and services that meet evolving customer needs.
Call Center Operation
The Duskin Contact Center and Mister Donut Customer Center listen to customer opinions and requests about our products and services. When receiving calls, our staff attend to each caller thankfully because we know it’s a valuable opportunity to learn their opinions and answer questions, and always strive to give a clear response to each inquiry. As we make it a rule to keep call waiting times as short as possible, staffing levels are adjusted flexibly based on statistical prediction by day and time of the week. Content of the conversations between operators and customers is promptly transferred to the person in charge of each business division to review what is needed, leading to better products and services.

Duskin products for people who are often absent from home
We frequently hear from people who are often away from home during the day that they would like to use our products. Since our foundation, we have firmly maintained the system of visiting our customers and delivering products in person. We believe we can deliver products from the heart this way and get a chance to know how customers like the products when we collect them.
  As the number of women working outside the home continues to
escalate, a new form of rental service is needed in response to
lifestyle changes. Return by Post Service is our solution, which has been launched nationwide. Our sales representatives deliver products to a customer’s mailbox, and customers
use the postal service to return used mops. This means even people who are often out during the day can use our rental service with ease.
Fan Meetings
To hear the voices of customers in person, we hold meetings such as MISDO Fan Meetings and Duskin Fan Meetings for Direct Selling Group customers. They are great opportunities for our President to give a presentation on current efforts and initiatives, and for head office and regional office staff, franchise owners and their staff to gather valuable customer feedback and requests. Based on such invaluable information, Duskin will continue providing products and services that meet customer needs and reflect their voice.

Our activities are based on our founder’s philosophy: Let Us Sow the Seeds of Joy. This philosophy forms the core of our objectives: to serve people in their daily lives, to be of help to those who encounter us, and to grow ourselves. We always pay attention to safety and reliability at every stage of research, development, and maintenance so that our customers can use our products and services with peace in mind.

The reason why Duskin mops do not release captured dust is this: our uniquely developed mop heads are treated with adsorbent. They maintain their adsorbing effect during the regular four-week rental period, and contain antibacterial and antifungal agents to help prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi. To ensure that the treatment has no adverse effect on the human body, we have an independent third-party institute carry out safety tests on cases where the adsorbent could enter the mouth or eyes, or adhere to the skin.
Cleaning and Technical Services
When delivering services (cleaning, home helper, pest control, and regular plant and flower maintenance services), we ensure that all tools, equipment, and chemicals used by our individual staff members are safe and secure.
And to continually raise service quality, we also hold training sessions and contests for our service crews to maintain and improve their skills.

As we place food safety above all else, we have set up an extensive quality standard that encompasses all stages of food development and provision right up to the point at which our customers finally taste it. We believe doing so can ensure safety, security, and our customers’ peace of mind.
Food Safety and Reliability
Food Safety Council
Whenever we develop foods or modify their specifications, we hold a meeting of the Food Safety Council, which comprises product development departments, quality assurance departments and third-party bodies including food safety administrators, to ensure food safety. This ensures that safety is maintained in accordance with laws and ordinances, as well as company standards in all procedures and phases from verification of raw materials used, places of origin, legal compliance of additives, allergy notes, appropriateness of foreign-body removal processes, administration of residual agricultural chemicals and antibiotics, preservation test results of products and raw materials, administration of consigned manufacturing plants and distributors or warehouse operators, to handling of foods at sales locations.

Diversity and Inclusion
Empowering Women in the Workplace
To enhance our corporate value and vitality through leveraging diverse human resources, it is essential to create workplaces where women can develop and demonstrate their talents to their fullest potential. Since many of Duskin’s customers are women, women’s perspectives are essential for creating and providing products and services, and for our business growth.
Against this backdrop, Duskin developed a second action plan extending from FY2019 to FY2021 in accordance with the Act of Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. Under the plan, we have launched initiatives to support women's career development and nurture an inclusive corporate culture and work environment. Duskin has also set a numerical goal of increasing the percentage of women in managerial positions to at least 10%.

With the increase in two-income families and one-person households, there is a rapidly growing need for house cleaning and helper services. The demand for these services is expected to expand further with increasing need for daily assistance for seniors in our super-aging society.

Duskin started hiring non-Japanese employees from April 2017 after receiving approval from the Kanagawa, Osaka and Tokyo governments as a specified organization for the Project to Accept Foreigners Conducting Housekeeping Services in National Strategic Special Zones. As at end of FY2019, a total of 47 Philippine citizens were hired at 12 locations in three prefectures. These employees provide services at customers’ homes after undergoing training.

We believe it is also a social responsibility of corporations to provide employment opportunities to people with disabilities. These employment opportunities should be individually matched to the capabilities of the recruits. To provide more job opportunities at higher retention rates, we are carrying out initiatives to examine the types of jobs suitable for the different range of skills and interests of people with disabilities and to establish a structure to assist them. We continue to actively promote employment of people with disabilities, and aim to reach a ratio of employees with disabilities of 3% or more at Duskin (non-consolidated). We will play our part to create a society where everyone can live with a sense of active participation, reward, and purpose.

As a corporation and a member of local communities, we aim to be of more assistance to the communities of our customers. Duskin’s various initiatives contribute to our local communities in line with our philosophy of Sowing the Seeds of Joy.

School Education Support Activities
In recognition of Duskin’s efforts in supporting children’s education, the company received a 2019 Award of Excellence, sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, for its endeavors as an enterprise that promotes experience-based learning activities.
Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classroom on-site lessons
In 2012, we started the Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classrooms, which are on-site lessons for elementary school students. In these lessons, we help children develop their potential to learn the importance of cleaning and how to use cleaning equipment through hands-on training.
Improving Students’ Cleaning Abilities seminar for teachers
Duskin conducts seminars for schoolteachers who have asked for ways to improve their students’ abilities during cleaning times at school. Collaborating with the teachers, we have developed programs showing how cleaning routines at school can be improved and how to instruct children on cleaning.
Cleaning Activities for Local Communities
Clean Up My Town
Under its environmental slogan Sowing the Seeds of Ecological Responsibility for the Future, Duskin conducts a nationwide activity to pick up trash at local sites. Initiated in 2006, the campaign has attracted a total of 330,000 participants (as of March 31, 2020) and continues to collect trash.

Our Prevention of Special Fraud Mats assist in protecting people from special types of fraud, which are a recurring nationwide problem. In cooperation with prefectural police, we enlighten and raise the public’s awareness by proposing that our Prevention of Special Fraud Mats be placed at financial institutions. A total of more than 10,000 custom-made mats have been placed in front of automated teller machines at financial institutions and convenience stores in 45 of the prefectures and administrative divisions in Japan.
   
Basic Policy
Duskin believes that motivated and enthusiastic employees who are stimulated in their daily work are a prerequisite for our business to grow. With this idea in mind, we have programs and structures in place, including a system for promotion to permanent status that expands career opportunities for highly skilled and motivated people, and a re-employment system for mandatory retirees. We are creating an environment where employees take full advantage of their talent and experience. This policy is defined in the Duskin Code of Conduct.

Hataraki-san (employees)
All employees are referred to as Hataraki-san, which means the people who make things easy for others around them. The Hataraki-san concept incorporates the philosophy of Duskin’s Prayerful Management. Employees doing their best for others without thought of personal convenience are appreciated by others, and find a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfilment in life.

Work-Life Balance
To continue to Sow the Seeds of Joy for people and communities, Duskin believes balance between work and home life is important for the health of our employees. Accordingly, we have put various measures in place to reduce long work hours and create comfortable workplaces, aiming to keep the total work time per employee at below 1,850 hours annually.

In addition, Duskin has maintained Kurumin certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare since 2016,
demonstrating our commitment as an enterprise that supports our employees’ childcare.
System for promotion to permanent status
Duskin has a system for qualified non-career employees to change their paths to permanent career positions. Starting in FY2016, a new "area-specific specialist" course with limited transfers or changes within certain geographic areas was added to the permanent career category, expanding opportunities to obtain permanent career positions. In FY2018, aiming to leverage our human resources even more effectively, we improved the system that enables area-specific specialists to make course changes to the “area-specific career track” or “career track” within the permanent career category.
Re-employment system for mandatory retirees
Due to Japan’s declining birthrate and a rise in the aging population, the government is implementing initiatives to encourage senior citizens to participate in the labor market. Included in the initiatives is the hiring of people up to 70 years old to address labor shortages and increase the sustainability of the social security system. Duskin has a program in place that re-employs employees after the mandatory retirement age of 60. As a general rule, those employees are asked to continue duties in the department where they worked at the time they retired. This system leverages their experience, and enables them to both demonstrate their abilities and share their knowledge.
In FY2019, we rehired 69 employees who reached mandatory retirement age. Accompanying revisions to the Duskin pension plan in FY2019, we increased the base salary for rehired employees to increase their motivation and create an environment that encourages staff retention.

Personnel Training
Education and Training Programs
Duskin offers various types of education and training to develop personnel to fully understand the philosophy of Prayerful Management and reflect it in their daily business practices. We conduct level-specific training for employees, including new hires, to teach the knowledge and skills required to effectively perform their duties; we also focus on training Area Managers, who support our franchise owners and energize the franchise network. In addition, we encourage employees to develop themselves through attaining publicly recognized qualifications and taking correspondence courses.
With the aim of improving the abilities of managers of each franchise business brand and their Area Managers, we are working to expand expertise and perspectives on franchise business management by providing opportunities to attend training programs sponsored by the Japan Franchise Association. In FY2019, a total of 11,553 individuals participated in various training programs in an effort to strengthen their knowledge and skills.

Commitment to our Management Philosophy, Prayerful Management
In 2016, Duskin established the Institute of Prayerful Management to incorporate our management philosophy into our everyday work activities and responsibilities. We focus on study sessions by lecturers from the institute as well as mini-lessons by Business Development Managers across the nation during regular meetings. The institute also publishes newsletters to share information and supports self-education via e-learning.
Supporting Franchise Personnel Training
Duskin School
Duskin School is a training center —mainly for Direct Selling Group— that provides comprehensive training which ranges from management philosophy to operational knowhow for franchise owners, managers and staff nationwide. Duskin School provides opportunities to acquire knowledge and skills through its highly experienced instructors, extensive training curriculum, and fully equipped facilities. In FY2019, 349 individuals participated in business-division-specific training courses, amounting to annual training time of 19,025 hours.

Mister Donut College was established out of our founder’s faith; as Seiichi Suzuki said, “Our people are intangible assets we must nurture with our hands.” Based on this faith and guidance, the facility was founded even before we started franchising the business. To develop first-class business people in the food industry, we have put together a unique training system in a manual. In addition to donut production and customer service, the trainees learn about the philosophy of Mister Donut and the best attitude for serving our customers. In FY2019, 950 individuals took this training course, amounting to annual training time of 15,928 hours.
Health-Focused Management
Certified as Health and Productivity Management Organization 2020
Duskin was certified as Health and Productivity Management Organization 2020 in February 2020 for the fourth consecutive year. Duskin is raising health awareness among employees by pursuing health-focused management through the Duskin Declaration of Health-Focused Management. Looking ahead, we will continue to maintain and improve the well-being of employees and their families in cooperation with the health insurance society and the labor union.

Initiatives to Strengthen Corporate Governance
We are working to strengthen corporate governance, as we believe it to be one of the most important issues for management. In 2017 we created a Directors Evaluation Committee and introduced an Operating Officer System. With the aim of ensuring the independence of the Directors Evaluation Committee and maintaining its effectiveness, we mandated that only independent directors be members and made the committee an advisory body to the Board of Directors.
Taking into account amendments to laws and changing society, we will continue to work toward further improvements in corporate governance.

 Strengthening Management
Corporate Governance
Basic Policy
Upholding Founder Seiichi Suzuki’s philosophy of Prayerful Management, we are committed to each of our business operations to Sow the Seeds of Joy for people and communities. Our interpretation of corporate governance is for all of our employees to incorporate his earnest wish, as reflected in the philosophy, in our everyday activities.
Duskin positions the strengthening of corporate governance as one of its highest priorities to build a stronger relationship with stakeholders, increase corporate value over the mediumto long-term, and achieve sustainable growth. Duskin is further bolstering its structure, organization and systems to ensure transparent and sound management. Duskin also places compliance at the center of all our corporate activities to continuously improve our corporate value.
Corporate Governance Structure
Duskin is a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board system. In addition to the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board, we have introduced the Operating Officer System to ensure expeditious decision making and business execution. At the Board of Directors, Directors monitor and supervise other Directors’ performance. The Audit & Supervisory Board consists of independent outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members capable of objectively conducting audits and internal full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members, who are well acquainted with our business operations and have skills needed to gather information. Under this system, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, internal and outside, perform accurate audits. We consider this structure highly effective as it supports customer-oriented management while ensuring sound and efficient business operations. This system also enables us to swiftly and precisely respond to changes in the business environment.
Board of Directors
Chaired by Teruji Yamamura, President & CEO
Directors are selected by taking into account the diversity of the board as a whole in terms of abilities, experience, gender and other characteristics. This is for the purpose of enabling the Board to make accurate management decisions in a wide range of business fields while maintaining the soundness, efficiency and effectiveness of the management. The number of Directors is limited to 12. This enables the Board of Directors to focus on making important management decisions and monitoring the execution of business to swiftly and precisely respond to changes in our business environment.

Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council
Chaired by Tomoya Yoshizumi, Outside Director
Duskin has an Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council, which is an advisory council for the Board of Directors. Its purpose is to provide beneficial views for ensuring effective corporate governance, while enabling Outside Directors to gather information without affecting their independence. This makes it possible to monitor and supervise Duskin’s management from a transparent, fair and objective viewpoint.
Directors Evaluation Committee Chaired by Tomoya Yoshizumi, Outside Director
The Directors Evaluation Committee was established as an advisory body for the President & CEO to consider Director and Operating Officer candidates and their remuneration, which requires the approval of the Board of Directors. In April 2019, this committee was changed to an advisory body for the Board of Directors to improve the effectiveness of the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. The committee now consists of only independent directors, resulting in greater transparency and objectivity.

Directors’ Remuneration
Duskin positions Directors’ remuneration as an important issue for our corporate governance. To raise Directors’ motivation to achieve mediumand long-term sustainable growth and enhance corporate value, Duskin established the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. With this system, their contributions and capabilities are determined and reflected in their remuneration.
The methods used in calculating Director remuneration and actual remuneration in FY2019 are as follows.
Process and calculation methods of Director remuneration and actual remuneration
Successor Development Plan
Duskin formulated its succession plan in FY2019 to foster next-generation management and successors to our chief executives. We have created an educational program to train those with the appropriate qualities, as well as a selection process for executive officers and candidates for director positions. We launched these operations in FY2020 and regularly share information and report to the Board of Directors on the progress. The President & CEO conducts monthly individual meetings with all Operating Officers. Quantitative assessments of their performances and improvements are made every six months in line with the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System, with the opportunity used to provide further guidance as well as to review their capabilities and performance with them.
Policy Related to Acquisition and Holding of Cross-Shareholdings
The policy for cross-shareholdings is to hold a suitable number of shares only when there is a legitimate reason for owning these shares. Investments in stocks for which there is no legitimate reason for ownership are reduced or eliminated. Every year, the Duskin Board of Directors determines if the ownership of each cross-shareholding is proper or not. Decisions are based on the need for each cross-shareholding regarding business activities, such as business alliances, maintaining and strengthening business relationships, Duskin’s cost of capital, share price movements and other factors.
Constructive Dialogue with Investors, Analysts and Shareholders
Duskin conducts a variety of investor relations (IR) and shareholder relations (SR) activities for the purposes of earning trust in the company’s management, receiving a proper evaluation of the company, and achieving sustained business growth and mediumto long-term growth in corporate value. Our senior management and Directors protectively respond to the requests of individual or institutional investors to meet with them.
Information, evaluation and opinions gained through IR and SR activities are reported at meetings of the Board of Directors twice each year. In addition, reports as deemed necessary are made by the IR Section to an Operating Officer in charge, then from the Operating Officer to the Board of Directors to reflect this information in the management.
We strive to improve our IR tools, including our website, that are useful for individual investors and shareholders in making investment decisions. Duskin discloses the financial results, business strategies, ESG information, news and other topics of interest.

Corporate Governance
Interview with Outside Directors
Two Outside Directors shared their views on their roles in corporate governance, future direction, and improvement of the corporate value.
What are your views on our business and the future?
     Tomoya Yoshizumi Outside Director
Joined Ajinomoto Co., Inc. in 1978. Named a Member of the Board in 2007. Served in leadership positions, including President of Amino Acids Company, and General Manager, North America Division, Bioscience & Finechemicals Business Division, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. and President of Ajinomoto U.S.A. (currently called Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America, Inc.). An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2017.
Nobuko Sekiguchi Outside Director
After working at a foreign affiliated company and as a management consultant, Ms. Sekiguchi joined Capcom Co., Ltd. in 2005, where she was appointed as a Corporate Officer. While there, she was engaged in leadership roles including Head of Corporate Planning & Human Resources Division. An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2019.
Yoshizumi:
Sekiguchi:
Yoshizumi:
Sekiguchi:
Yoshizumi:
We are now at an important stage in our return to growth, as I see initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. In addition to viewing growth from the perspective of sales and operating profit, we are evaluating the overall business from different viewpoints—including an investment hurdle rate that takes the cost of capital into account. If we could channel limited managerial resources through selection and concentration, considering the cost of capital, we could gain a clearer view of the track to renewed growth.
In a way, Duskin’s philosophy, Sowing the Seeds of Joy, is one of our greatest management resources. I believe this is our strength, and that we, including our franchisees, should take advantage of this strength in our daily business practices. While valuing interpersonal contact, we will need to consider how to transform our business model as digitization progresses. Not many business models create value for both franchisees and customers, so if we could develop people who take a more flexible approach to creating business plans to match business trends, we could nurture the next generation of core businesses for our company to keep growing. To make it happen, we need to put a human resource strategy in place based on individual skill sets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all companies are being urged to address its impact on their business. However, Direct Selling Group is not seeing a sharp drop in demand. I believe this is because our sales channels remain strong thanks to our long, trusted relationship with our customers. Direct Selling Group should further leverage its strengths to meet customers’ expectations. We need to be developing and providing products and services in a timely manner, which will help our customers to stay healthy and fine-tune the rhythm of their daily activities.
It is true that COVID-19 has once again emphasized the importance of face-to-face contact. Meeting people in person will be increasingly important in this rapidly aging society and in this respect, Duskin already has an advantage. At the same time, as the pandemic is accelerating the shift to digitalization, Duskin should speed up the initiatives to expand our online presence.
In Food Group, Mister Donut improved their donuts and other items. Another effort involved enhancing meal items under the concept of “Something good’s gonna happen.” and providing moments of joy for all our visitors. Despite these efforts, eat-in demand has dropped dramatically due to COVID-19. However, if we respond to changes in eating habits such as take-out and delivery, we should be able to recover swiftly with the help of improved products and promotion strategies. We expect to see the business undergoing major changes over the next few years.
What are the essential elements of Duskin’s corporate governance?
   From what aspects are you looking at Duskin’s management?
Yoshizumi: Duskin places great value on corporate governance. The information I need is always available, which enables me to fulfill my duty as an Outside Director. Duskin is a public company, develops its businesses, and grows with franchisees through the franchise system. Unlike non-franchise businesses, our franchisees are included among stakeholders in addition to shareholders, customers and employees. Because our focus tends to be on the franchisees, I make comments and extend advice from the shareholders’ perspective at the Board of Directors’ meetings.
Sekiguchi: It has been a year since I was appointed as an Outside Director of Duskin. My responsibilities in previous positions covered growth strategy in corporate planning and human resources divisions. I offer comments and advice from the viewpoint of not only risk control—which functions as a brake—but also business growth and improvement of corporate governance—which serve as accelerators. As we are provided with opportunities to walk through the agenda and reference materials in advance, we can put forward constructive opinions during the meetings.
Yoshizumi: In many cases, it is Outside Directors who pose questions and provide opinions at the meetings. Internal Directors should be called on to speak more not only on business of their areas of responsibility, but also on companywide matters from different perspectives. I understand it is not easy because I have had the same experience as an internal director in previous posts, but doing so should lift the effectiveness of our Board of Directors’ meetings.
Sekiguchi: Many proposals made to the Board of Directors meetings are about our individual business lines. The meetings should be a forum for discussing how to best allocate management resources for the entire company, not simply a forum for approving such proposals from different business divisions.
Yoshizumi:
Sekiguchi:
Yoshizumi:
Duskin already has a corporate governance system in place; the next challenge involves how we live the culture and philosophy shaped by our corporate governance system. As shareholders are taking on a greater risk of receiving no returns, we often discuss the agenda from their perspective. By strengthening the functions of corporate governance, we will be able to grow into a more profitable company with a better work environment.
We have a governance system in place, and our corporate culture encourages discussions. But the culture tends to be homogeneous, partly due to fewer mid-career hires. What we need is a mechanism for diversity to include multifaceted viewpoints. While listening to the opinions of our shareholders, we need to proactively communicate our strengths to them. This should also lead to a better corporate image.
Directors have few opportunities to meet the shareholders, but it is important to increase opportunities for the President and other board members to interact with shareholders, institutional investors, and customers. These experiences would help them to see, think, and speak with broader perspectives not confined to those of the business domains under their responsibility. In my experience, communication with shareholders has always generated positive results. And it will continue to do so.
   Looking ahead
   68 CORPORATE REPORT 2020
CORPORATE REPORT 2020 69
Yoshizumi:
Sekiguchi:
As Ms. Sekiguchi mentioned, we need to review and reform our human resources system, redesigning it in a way that links evaluation and reward to outcome. In other words, under the new system, those employees who are highly motivated with pride and purpose should be evaluated and rewarded according to their outcome. I believe such employee engagement and mindset would only strengthen Duskin.
Duskin’s business needs a female perspective. I believe I can contribute by providing advice so that more women, both internal and external, will be involved in management.

Risk Management
Risk Countermeasures
Duskin has formulated Basic Rules on Risk Management that stipulate how risk is to be managed in the Duskin Corporate Group. In accordance with these rules, there is a risk management department and supervisors. At our subsidiaries, we name risk management supervisors for each company in accordance with its size, types of business activities, and other characteristics. We conduct risk management in a consolidated, comprehensive manner.
Duskin has a Risk Management Committee, as an advisory council for the Board of Directors. The committee was held twice in FY2019. It discussed and reported on Duskin’s risk management annual plans, the causes of the risks that have occurred and the measures to be taken to counter them, the response to natural disasters and the business continuity plan (BCP). In the event of an incident that may have a major impact on Duskin Group, a response office is established.
Companywide Risk Management System
Each department identifies the risks that are specific to its responsibilities and analyzes their significance. Then, response measures for each presumed risk factor are formulated according to Risk Prevention Manual.
Every year, risk management departments and the secretariat office review and evaluate countermeasures and their effectiveness. With the feedback of these reviews and evaluations, all departments examine and enhance their countermeasures. Each department identifies new possible risks based on the information on revisions of laws and regulations and any crisis that occurred at Duskin. Each department formulates and implements its own risk management programs.
Risks and Measures
Compliance
Basic Policy & Framework
At Duskin, “compliance” means we are committed to “complying with what is expected to meet others’ wishes.” Accordingly, we formulated the Duskin Code of Conduct that reflects the numerous opinions we received during discussions with all operating officers and employees (including part-timers).
Following the Code of Conduct is synonymous with practicing our philosophy of Prayerful Management in our business activities. Sowing the Seeds of Joy within people’s heart, we are committed to being a responsible company to gain more trust from consumers and society, as expressed in the Code of Conduct.

      Annual Training Sessions
As part of its efforts to ensure that its members are aware of and enforce the Duskin Code of Conduct, Duskin Group holds compliance training sessions every year for all Directors and employees. We invite outside lecturers to conduct seminars every fiscal year, and we hold case study training sessions on racial and LGBT harassment to help employees make ethical judgments.
Whistleblowing
Operating Internal Hotlines
In line with the intent of the Whistleblower Protection Act of Japan, Duskin operates Compliance Hotlines that make it possible to report occurrences directly to our Legal and Compliance Department and to an external law firm. By having mechanisms in place that keep an eye out for legal infractions, unethical conduct including bribery and corruption, and internal impropriety, we seek to foster a sound and highly transparent corporate climate. We allow anonymous reporting, protect the privacy of whistleblowers, and ensure there are no negative consequences of submitting a report. In addition, independent arbitration is held regarding complaints about human rights infringements. FY2019 hotline users: internal 16, external 3

 Day of Resolve May 31 is the Duskin Group’s Day of Resolve. On May 31, 2002, Duskin was issued an order of partial business suspension by the Osaka Prefecture Government due to a violation of the Food Sanitation Act.
Every year on May 31, lectures by outside experts are conducted to help all Duskin employees reflect on the Large Meat Dumpling incident*. All employees write messages pledging compliance to consumers and society.
Employees who do not know about the incident are encouraged to listen to senior employees. By recalling the incident, Duskin reminds all employees of the importance of compliance with regulations. This is our responsibility to society. We pledge our resolve and reaffirm the determination to do right by building upon our solid compliance structure.
*Large Meat Dumpling incident: An unauthorized food additive in Japan was used for the Large Meat Dumplings sold at Mister Donut. While Duskin discovered this problem at the early stage of the incident, the use of this food additive was not disclosed to the public until inquiries were made by the media. This resulted in severe social criticism.

Financial Overview
1. Analysis of Business Results
Business Results Overview
During the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2020 (FY2019), the Japanese economy continued to recover moderately with the support of the continuing improvement of employment and personal income, although consumer confidence was impacted by the consumption tax hike implemented in October. However, there is growing uncertainty about the global economy because of increasing U.S.-China trade friction. In the fourth quarter, COVID-19 had a negative effect on corporate earnings. As a result, the risk of an economic downturn increased and the outlook is uncertain.
Duskin implemented many initiatives during FY2019, which was the second year of Medium-Term Management Policy 2018. With the goal of providing a Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service, Direct Selling Group is concentrating on measures to strengthen cooperation among the dust control product rental business, Care Service Businesses (professional cleaning and technical services), services for seniors and other business units.
Direct Selling Group started new initiatives to become a source of comprehensive services that are in tune with every family’s daily rhythm, including the launch of a new business, the Duskin Wash (laundry service). In Care Service Businesses, the number of franchisees has steadily increased as a result of franchise recruitment activities in order to meet growing demand. Food Group continued to rebuild the Mister Donut
brand by implementing a product strategy that is encouraging
more customers to visit a Mister Donut shop and by opening
and renovating shops.

Because of a decrease in net non-operating income, consolidated ordinary profit was down 2,082 million yen (20.8%) from the previous year to 7,929 million yen. NAC Co., Ltd., which became an equity method affiliate in September 2018, is our largest franchisee. The Company's main business is the housing sales business. NAC usually posts most of its profit in the second half and has a loss in the first half. Duskin started including this company's earnings in the consolidated statement of income in the second half of the previous fiscal year. As a result, NAC’s first-half loss was included for the first time in FY2019. Due to the decline in NAC’s earnings, share of profit of entities accounted for using the equity method decreased, resulting in a downturn of non-operating income.
Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent (extraordinary income and losses)
Despite an improvement in extraordinary income due to a gain on sales of investment securities resulting from the partial sale of investment securities and to a decrease in impairment losses, profit attributable to owners of the parent decreased by 393 million yen (6.6%) from the previous fiscal year to 5,591 million yen.

Glossary
    Megumu Murakami
Senior Manager
Center for the Strategy of Emergence
The Japan Research Institute, Limited
Profile
Graduated from Faculty of Law, Kyoto University. Joined the Japan Research Institute in 2003 after a career in banking. Ms. Murakami became a member of the Center for the Strategy of Emergence in 2010, taking on the responsibilities of researching corporations and their use of ESG factors and SDGs.
I have reviewed the Duskin Corporate Report 2020 with an understanding that Duskin intends to provide financial and non-financial information, including its long-term value creation perspective, management strategy, business results, and ESG information, in an integrated manner for institutional investors as its main readers.
This report covers several perspectives. In my third-party opinion, I would like to focus on how the management philosophy—Sowing the Seeds of Joy–is adopted in daily business practices and how well it is demonstrated to readers.
First, the perspective of long-term value creation is illustrated in Duskin’s Value Creation Model, with the six capitals as inputs for the value creation process on pages 8 and 9. The six capitals at Duskin are described in detail on page 10. Duskin’s unique qualities are well structured and streamlined in a framework familiar to investors who read and evaluate many other companies’ reports.
Duskin’s greatest strength is its management philosophy, and franchisees can join the network only after they agree to abide by this philosophy. Another strength is that the headquarters and franchisees share common goals. This report clearly conveys these strengths.
For future improvements, the value creation model should be structured more comprehensively, with the outcome illustrating which stakeholders benefited from which fruit borne from the seeds of joy.
In particular, I expect that Duskin will consider quantifying the relationship between customer value and social value to the extent possible.
Second, corporate governance is a business foundation indispensable for Duskin to continue Sowing the Seeds of Joy. From the interview with Outside Directors on pages 68 to 69, I understand that it is well structured, which encourages open discussion. The interview also touches on the role of outside directors and discussions at the Board of Directors meetings. This helps readers to deepen their understanding of Duskin.
Third, Duskin has listed social issues–both current and those expected to arise in the near future–in Risks and Opportunities on pages 14 and 15, how Duskin is addressing these issues, and where it would plant the seeds of joy. The company is anticipating risks and at the same time foreseeing various opportunities. I expect to see Sowing the Seeds of Joy fuel growth potential in the future.
In the year 2020, the entire world has experienced the risk of an unknown and unceasing pandemic caused by COVID-19. From 2021 onward, I imagine there will also be changes in the approach to risks and opportunities, as well as CSV initiatives. Based on Duskin’s management philosophy, goal sharing, and the relationship of trust it has fostered with its stakeholders, I expect that Duskin will continue to Sow the Seeds of Joy in a new environment.
I hope this report encourages in-depth discussions with stakeholders on Sowing the Seeds.

This is a training facility established in 1971 right after the first Mister Donut shop opened, on the site of one of Duskin’s first buildings. This facility is fully equipped and staffed for trainees to acquire their licenses.
Mister Donut Founding Day
January 27, 1970, was the day when our founder Seiichi Suzuki decided to start the Mister Donut business. Accordingly, Mister Donut declared January 27 to be Mister Donut Founding Day. Each year on this day, shop crews voluntarily clean their communities. Our shops across the nation donate a part of the sales to The Duskin AINOWA Foundation to help people with disabilities achieve independent living and total participation in society.

Prayerful Management
This is Duskin’s Management Philosophy. To live this philosophy, we pray that each one of us takes “Each day as a chance to begin our life anew to Sow the Seeds of Joy to people around us while making us spiritually ready for possible losses.” This philosophy declares that Duskin places the greatest importance on humanity in this world driven by economic pragmatism where human needs tend to be less focused on.

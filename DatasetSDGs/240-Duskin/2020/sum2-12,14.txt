Endeavors for a Recycling-Oriented Society
Duskin established a system for renting cleaning tools in Japan. As reflected in this rental system, Duskin operates its business based on the idea of repeated use, shared use, reduction of waste and disposal. To contribute to the creation of a recycling-oriented society, we will make effective use of limited resources while at the same time engaging in the 4Rs (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) throughout the entire product life cycle.

Direct Selling Group: Reuse of mop and mat products
All used items are collected from customers, and 97% of the collected items are processed in the laundry plants and reused. The remaining 3% unusable items are utilized as fuels. All products are repeatedly used until their usable life ends. Dust and dirt on mops and mats are also recycled into materials for cement.

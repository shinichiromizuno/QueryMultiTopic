Conservation and Effective Use of Water Resources
Water shortage is aggregating on a global scale. It also presents the risk of negative impacts on the business continuity, so reducing water use and reusing water is important. Although Japan is not yet faced with chronic water shortage, we see this is not unrelated with Duskin Group.
At Duskin, a Founder’s quote of “Return what we borrow from nature to its original state” has been passed down since our founding, and serves as our basic philosophy for conserving water resources.
Water Use Reduction Initiatives
Duskin plants use large amounts of water in the laundry process for mops and mats. Therefore, we apply standards for the volume of water used during the laundry process as a reference value for our plants and strive to manage and reduce water intake volumes.

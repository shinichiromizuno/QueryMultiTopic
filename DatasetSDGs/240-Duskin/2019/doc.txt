The Core of Duskin
Management Philosophy
Day after day, beginning with today both you and I have a chance
to begin our lives anew.
Whether our lot today be profit or loss, be spiritually ready for loss.
As a planter would, let us sow the seeds of joy to every person we meet each day.
For everyone, for you and me,
may we lead our lives in this world to the fullest, realizing our maximun spiritual and material potential.
 Our founder’s philosophy lives on.
Attentive care for our customers is our utmost focus, based on our founder’s philosophy which lives on to today. His principles in life are reflected in our management philosophy called Prayerful Management. All of our employees incorporate his philosophy, of sharing joy and doing our best, in our everyday activities.
Duskin Founder
Seiichi Suzuki
Seiichi Suzuki was born in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture in 1911. He joined Ittoen in 1938. In 1944 he established Kentoku Company. From that time on, Suzuki pursued the principle of Prayerful Management, his aim being to unite moral and economic goals in both his own and his company’s business practices. He led the Duskin Group as it paved a new path to a multi-franchise business enterprise. Seiichi Suzuki died in 1980 at the age of 68.
   Sow the Seeds of Joy within people and communities.
Franchise system to Sow the Seeds of Joy
                        Profit is the reward of joyous transactions.
Duskin’s founder, Seiichi Suzuki believed “Profit is the reward of joyous transactions,” and energetically continued his businesses, wishing that everyone who took part in Duskin’s activities, would become happy. Home Duskin, a modern treated cloth, started a new way of dusting without water. Introducing this method was a big step to realize our founder’s wish. People called it the magic dust cloth – and
it brought cleaning innovation to homes in Japan.
Franchise to fulfill the philosophy
Seiichi Suzuki adopted the franchise system to spread dust control business so that everyone who agreed with Duskin’s philosophy, Sowing the Seeds of Joy, could use this business as an opportunity for their success. Our headquarters and franchisees are united in a strong relationship. Together, we follow the same philosophy. By Sowing the Seeds of Joy, we grow the businesses, sharing in each other’s fortune and future.
Franchising is a way of life.
At Duskin, we believe the franchising system enriches us spiritually and materially, as we support each other and continue to grow together. “Franchising is a way of life” means that franchising brings not only success in business but also success in life.

Yamamura President & CEO
With the philosophy of Economy
and Morals in Unity at the core,
we create social value through our business and pursue sustainable growth.
FY2018 was the first year of Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 and the second phase of ONE DUSKIN long-term strategy. In the fiscal year, we steadily implemented a variety of initiatives following the basic policies of new growth, business model development and the strengthening of the corporate structure.
In FY2019, the second year of the policy, we are committed to creating social value and achieving sustainable growth through our quality service that continues to meet changing social needs.
Our philosophy for business management and practice
What must be kept unchanged and what should be changed with these changing times?
Since my appointment as President, my personal mission has been to fully inherit and embrace our management philosophy and share it with future generations at Duskin.
I have asked myself why Founder Seiichi Suzuki established Duskin. I have come to realize that he wanted to Sow the Seeds of Joy for people and communities, so he put this philosophy into practice, into cleaning and donut businesses. Sowing the Seeds of Joy is the very essence of Duskin and is the driving force for Duskin Group. This is why I believe our management philosophy must be kept unchanged and shared with future generations.
It does not mean that we should maintain the status quo in our business operations, however. Customer needs are constantly changing in this dynamic environment, and, under these circumstances, my role is to understand these changes and chart the course of our business.
Our products, services and organization structure have also changed to respond to a diverse marketplace with aging populations, in an ever-connected world through increasing use of the internet. In FY2018, Clean & Care Group was renamed Direct Selling Group to reinforce closer cooperation across business lines under the singular unified concept of our Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service. This service helps customers keep their lives organized and fine-tunes the rhythm of their daily activities, both at home and in the workplace.
We will continue to uphold our management philosophy, respond to changing customer needs and deliver quality products and services to Sow the Seeds of Joy for people and communities.

  President’s Message
Business Strategy by Segment ESG Activities
Financial Information
  Home Duskin, a chemically treated dust cloth, represents our Founder’s strong desire and commitment to best serve society by addressing social issues and concerns with innovation. The idea of Creating Shared Value has been the cornerstone of Duskin’s business activities since its founding.
CSV management
Economy and Morals in Unity at the heart of our business since its founding
Recent years have seen an increasing focus on the practice of Creating Shared Value (CSV), which is about creating social value and business value through economic activities. The idea of CSV is to achieve both a sustainable society and business growth. In Japan, ESG (environmental, social and governance) investment in 2018 increased to two trillion dollars, 4.6 times the amount it was in 2016. Governments, municipalities and companies are actively implementing initiatives toward achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are common goals and targets for nations and groups to achieve by 2030.
The practice of CSV matches our core principle, the philosophy of Economy and Morals in Unity, and serves as a guideline for driving our business forward. This is best illustrated with the example of our first product, Home Duskin*1. Introduced by our Founder Seiichi Suzuki, it was called the “magic dust cloth” because it could remove dust without water, reducing the burden of wet cleaning. Another example was the
The basis of our business management
establishment of a new, innovative distribution channel for renting items through a franchise system so that many more customers could benefit from our products. Suzuki’s passion to serve society by responding to their needs with innovation predated, yet is completely consistent with the current practice of CSV.
All our franchisees and our corporate employees embrace our management philosophy and form the Duskin franchise network with shared goals and visions for the future. This is the bond that unites us and distinguishes us from all others.
As a team of headquarters staff and franchisees, we are committed to CSV management, reflecting the voice of customers as we create new value.
Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
FY2018 results
During FY 2018, our first year of Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 and the second phase of ONE DUSKIN long-term strategy, we implemented key first year initiatives as planned, following the basic policies of new growth, business model development and the strengthening of the corporate structure. Our achievements include improving our structure and organization to grow our businesses and building a strong management foundation for sustainable growth.
Our consolidated operating profit increased to 7,954 million yen, up 5.2% from the previous year, and profit attributable to owners of parent also increased to 5,984 million yen, a 12.4% increase from one year earlier, although consolidated sales were 158,699 million yen, down 1.4% from the previous year.
Long-term strategy
   We aim to unite all Duskin businesses so as to serve our customers in the most effective and courteous manner.
   A one and only franchise system where franchisor and franchisees share our management philosophy
To be a unique group of companies that contribute to creating communities where people are connected, safe, and live happily.
To become the most reliable service provider, proactively anticipating customers’ needs and providing innovative solutions.
To commit to an all-out, system-wide effort to provide the best services for our customers.
The most trusted franchise business in the community
All business units and services join to respond to the needs of our customers.

Economy and Morals in Unity
“Morals or philosophical beliefs that reflect our hearts’ most sincere desire to help and engage with society.” “Economy” means the financial pursuits for business growth as a company. “Economy and Morals in Unity means that we make sustainable growth possible by serving society, proactively responding to its needs and expectations.”
This philosophy has been and will be the basis of Duskin Group’s business management.

   *2 Care Service Businesses Providing house cleaning and other cleaning and technical services
*3 Health Rent Business Rental and sales of home healthcare items
1. New growth
Establishing a capital and business alliance with NAC Co., Ltd., a franchisee of Duskin
As part of our future growth initiatives, Duskin underwrote a third-party allocation of new shares and entered into a capital and business alliance with NAC Co., Ltd., the largest franchisee of Direct Selling Group.
In alliance with NAC and other franchisees, we will continue to reinforce Care Service*2 and Health Rent*3 businesses by adding more of these locations where we are yet to have a presence, in order to prepare for their expected growth in the future.
2. Business model development
Driving franchise recruitment at Care Service Businesses
Dust control business, the core category of the Direct Selling Group, posted lower sales as sales struggled in the residential market. Sales of Care Service Businesses (professional cleaning and technical services) were higher than one year earlier because ServiceMaster (professional cleaning) and Merry Maids (home cleaning and helper services) performed well. With a rapidly aging population in Japan, there is a strong demand for these services. To improve our service capabilities to meet the demand, we actively recruited franchisees at franchise expos and other events and opened 134 new franchise units in FY2018.
Direct Selling Group will continue to expand our service offerings that make homes and workplaces more comfortable and clean, leveraging our strength to directly interact with customers and respond to their needs. With the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and the 2025 Osaka Expo in planning stages, there is a growing demand for sanitation management from restaurants and other establishments. Capitalizing on the opportunities to satisfy these new requirements, we will put more focus on the development of Hygiene Masters, sanitation management specialists who provide comprehensive solutions for commercial sites.
Positive results due to product development,
and shop openings and renovations at Food Group
At Mister Donut, the core business within Food Group, we developed attractive menu items with a focus on MISDO Meets and MISDO GOHAN, as part of our efforts to create

a shop where customers of all ages can casually drop in throughout the day. Our key initiatives have started to have positive effects. Monthly sales per shop in operation were higher than one year earlier, although total Mister Donut sales were lower due to closure of underperforming locations and temporary closures for renovations.
The closures and renovations of underperforming or out-of-date shops were nearly completed by the end of March 2019. We will actively renovate other existing shops and accelerate new openings so that customers can continue to enjoy a welcoming ambience to experience pleasant times at Mister Donut.
3. Strengthening the corporate structure
Introducing the Operating Officer System to improve board effectiveness and ensure management transparency
To enhance corporate governance, Duskin introduced the Operating Officer System in April 2018. The system allowed board members to improve their abilities to make efficient and informed decisions and provide oversight functions, and empowers them to expedite business execution through the delegation of authority to Operating Officers.
We also reduced the number of Directors to enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. As a result, the ratio of Outside Directors on all boards rose to one-third, which is, in turn, leading to greater management transparency.
Financial policy and profit return to shareholders
Setting a basic dividend policy to maintain stable payments with a consolidated payout ratio of 50%
One of our responsibilities is to make the best use of shareholder funds and to return a profit. Equally important in a franchise business is a fair profit distribution between franchisor and franchisees for mutual prosperity and benefit. Balancing these two responsibilities while pursuing capital efficiency is how we are creating long-term corporate value. We have set out our basic dividend policy of distributing the profit to shareholders based on our performance while maintaining the proper balance between investments to achieve sustainable growth and higher corporate value and financial security against potential risks.
In FY2018, we paid an interim dividend of 20 yen per share, a commemorative dividend of 10 yen per share (celebrating Duskin’s 55th anniversary), and a year-end dividend of 20 yen per share, for a total full-year dividend of 50 yen per share. In FY2019, we adopted a new policy to maintain the stability and consistency of dividend payments with a target consolidated payout ratio of 50% for each fiscal year.
To meet the expectations of shareholders over the long term, we continue to improve capital efficiency and shareholder returns. At the same time, we will execute a flexible capital policy that can accommodate changes in the business environment.

     Message for stakeholders
Building on our strengths to Sow the Seeds of Joy
Since spring 2019, we have been delivering a message, “We place great importance on the human touch in an AI-driven world.” in our corporate advertising. This phrase illustrates a core strength and continued focus.
Today, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation (RPA) are in use in every area of society. In this technology-driven world where interpersonal contact is diminishing, we are placing greater importance on the human touch. Along with this effort, however, we are also taking advantage of machine intelligence where operational efficiency and accuracy of routine tasks can be achieved by utilizing RPA and production automation. This enables us to create more opportunities for our employees to focus on the human side of businesses, understanding our customers and improving service delivery.
While reinforcing closer cooperation across business lines to meet the diversifying needs and expectations of customers, we are putting all our effort to build on our strengths— personal touch and gracious hospitality that are uniquely ours—to Sow the Seeds of Joy for people and society.
In deepest appreciation of your continued support for this year and those to come, we are enthusiastic about our future together.

Duskin supports each franchisee in developing their own staff experience and expertise. Most of the franchise owners and staff members were born and raised in the communities where they run their businesses now: They fully understand the specific needs and attributes of each local market. These franchise owners and staff members have proven abilities to provide quality services and have been striving to be the best service provider in their community.

Most trusted people who know the community
     In order to ensure that all our products and services are safe and reliable, Duskin’s quality assurance framework works from development to after launch. Our Quality Assurance & Risk Management team has two important functions: to supervise the quality control conducted by each business line and monitor the safety and reliability of products and services; and to conduct inspections on products and services and evaluate them from the viewpoint of customers. The team also organizes the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee, consisting of Outside Directors and managers of major divisions. They hold the Committee meetings twice a year to deliberate the guidelines of quality control and assurance and the environment.
During the development phase, prior to launch, the safety and reliability of products and services are objectively reviewed at the development meetings. For the development of food products and services and their specification changes, internal rules require that we ensure their safety at a meeting of the Safety Council. Following a launch, we maintain our established levels of quality by conducting regular and spot quality checks on products in distribution.
Duskin’s founder Seiichi Suzuki established Mister Donut Japan Training Center (now called Mister Donut College), and was one of the first trainers to teach at the center.
Duskin School, founded in 2010, is a comprehensive training place where trainees can learn subjects ranging from management philosophy to operational know-how.
In the training room of Duskin School, trainees can learn techniques and skills in practical programs using mock-up facilities including home and commercial kitchens and bathrooms.

training programs, enables our staff members to deliver
the same high-quality service across 761 locations*1 in 47

Creating an environment for women and non-Japanese nationals
to work with peace of mind
Merry Maids is known for its services to help women balance housework, child rearing and work conforming to their life styles. With this privileged understanding of our customers, we include women and their expertise as homemakers and parents for career opportunities in our businesses. These efforts are helping to provide more opportunities and jobs for women.
Duskin, as a specified business organization, hired 28*3 workers from the Philippines for the projects to accept non-Japanese nationals in National Strategic Special Zones of Tokyo, Kanagawa and Osaka. Based on this experience at our company-owned locations, we plan to expand this program and support our franchisees to obtain approval as a specified organization to hire non-Japanese nationals for their future operations.
We continue to develop this business model for the benefit of our customers, employees and the Duskin Family.

   Sustainable Development of Society
Offering peace of mind to working women and responding to the needs of an aging society
 Merry Maids provides comfort in everyday life with its home cleaning and helper services
Duskin, a pioneer in cleaning and helper service industry, launched Merry Maids business in 1989. By helping our customers with cleaning and daily household chores, we want them to enjoy more time to relax. With the concept “you should have time to live your life the way you want to, without the burden of worrying about a clean house,” we deliver Merry Maids services through our franchise network.
With the increasing number of working women, many feel overwhelmed trying to balance the responsibilities of work and home. At the same time the number of senior households is also increasing. As they age, many seniors find their household chores more physically challenging than before. With this social change in mind, we have been providing our services tailored to the needs of our customers, offering such services as Home Cleaning Service, Housekeeping/Helper Service and Storage Organizing Service. In 2018, customer-level sales exceeded 11 billion yen.

More women in managerial positions
Duskin has set a goal to increase the percentage of women in managerial positions to 8% by the end of FY2020, and is therefore encouraging women’s participation in operational decision-making processes and managerial positions. As of March 31, 2019, women make up 7.2% of our managerial positions, a 0.8 point increase from the previous year.
These results have led to a recognition from external organizations, such as an award our employees received for two consecutive years since 2017, the Osaka Sakuyahime Award, recognizing women leaders by the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The 2017 award recipient, Chisa Kajihara, is leading our Merry Maids business as Division Manager. The 2018 award recipient, Reiko Fujiwara, is Manager of the Institute of Cleaning Education. Together with our franchisees, she is leading the teams to convey the importance of cleaning through school education support activities. Both of them were recognized for excelling in their business field, helping to develop the next generation of leaders and contributing to local communities.
Skill improvement and career advancement for people with disabilities
Duskin is undertaking proactive programs to create more opportunities for people with disabilities. At Duskin Product Nishi Kanto Co., Ltd., our group company, students from special needs schools receive hands-on training each year. Taking time to identify their aptitude, we provide one-on-one training and help them learn the job through practice and repetition of the required tasks. Many of them have become tenured workers. We assist their career advancement by helping them to take on responsibilities for different tasks through multi-skill development based on their capabilities and personality. Employees with disabilities are also entrusted with jobs that require commitments and responsibilities.

Creating a more fulfilling workplace that recognizes the importance of diversity
 Introducing safe and eco-friendly cars
The use of vehicles, notably for light cargo, is essential to deliver our products and services in our business operations. As new functions such as brake control for collision avoidance assist (autonomous braking) and idling reduction were introduced into commercial fleet vehicles about two years ago, Duskin is now encouraging our franchisees to include these same functions into their highly safe, low-emission vehicles. By the end of March 2019, among the 10,386 lease vehicles used by our franchisees, 1,542 vehicles were changed to certified low-emission vehicles.
At our head office, we are increasing the number of hybrid vehicles and other types of eco-friendly vehicles.
By the end of March 2019, 98.6% of vehicles used at our head office had been changed to hybrid or electric vehicles that conform to the latest gas emission standard.
Eco-driving programs and education
CO2 emission can be reduced if all drivers pay special attention to eco-driving, including idle reduction, avoiding sudden starts and stops and preventing excess speed. As part of our production and logistics improvement efforts, a vehicle operation management system, logicompass, is installed into all vehicles that are used to collect used mops and mats and to deliver cleaned products. Using records kept by this system, drivers are recognized annually for their eco-driving.
We continue our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by improving efficiency of transport in our delivery routes as well as through our regional training and education programs.

        (FY) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Operating profit was affected by the decrease in sales and
higher personnel expenses but benefited from a decrease in the cost of sales for rental products, lower promotional expenses and a decline in retirement benefit expenses associated with a change in the Duskin pension plan. As a result, operating profit was 7,954 million yen, a 396 million yen (5.2%) increase.

(FY) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 An expense was recorded to prepare for the liquidation of
Mister Donut Shanghai Co., Ltd. in China and extraordinary losses increased partly because of a higher non-current asset impairment loss. Despite these items, profit attributable to owners of parent was 5,984 million yen, a 659 million yen (12.4%) increase.
Note: In FY2015, Duskin started using Revised Accounting Standard for Business Combinations (ASBJ Statement No. 21, September 13, 2013) and net income is reported as profit attributable to owners of parent.
(FY) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Our basic policy is to distribute profits to shareholders based on
our performance while maintaining the proper balance between these distributions and the need to maintain financial soundness. A consolidated payout ratio of 50% is the guideline for the dividend for each fiscal year while maintaining the stability and consistency of dividend payments.
Note: The dividend for FY2013 includes a 20 yen 50th anniversary commemorative dividend, and the dividend for FY2018 includes a 10 yen 55th anniversary commemorative dividend.
(FY) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Duskin plans to increase the return on equity (ROE) by
executing the strategies and capital policies in the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018. To improve capital efficiency and return earnings to shareholders, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of treasury shares for 6.5 billion yen in February 2019.

        Life Care completed its rebranding in April 2018 and is accelerating the initiatives to recruit franchisees. Health Rent reported sales growth of 7.2% and increased the number of units even though the maximum rental price of healthcare items was regulated under the Long-Term Care Insurance System that was revised in October 2018.
Food Group has been working on reducing food waste. In the Kanto and Tokai areas, unsold donuts are transformed in processing plants into animal feed. In FY2019, recycling donuts into biogas is planned to start in the Kansai area.
Since many customers are women, Duskin is dedicated to supplying products and services that are attractive, convenient and comfortable from the perspective of women. Duskin is continuing to conduct many activities to support women in their career development and create an inclusive corporate culture and work environment.

At Food Group, all shops and restaurants manage energy consumption by controlling air-conditioner settings and avoiding the simultaneous use of electrical equipment. Production & Logistics facilities use energy efficiently in business operations by using energy-saving equipment and operating machinery more efficiently.
Duskin considers reducing working hours as one of its highest priorities. Data related to long working hours is reported periodically to the Board of Directors. Duskin has been implementing many initiatives, which includes taking 60% of annual paid leave, No Overtime Work Day at least once every month, turning off the lights at six p.m. at the Duskin Head Office building, and the Leave the Office Early Day Campaign.

Under the concept of Daily Life Fine-Tuning, Duskin helps our customers create living and working environments where rhythm meets harmony.
Business Mix
This business segment provides products related to cleaning and cleanliness, with its mainstay of dust control businesses renting items such as mops, air purifiers and mats. We offer our diverse range of products and services to both residential and commercial customers.
In response to the increasing demand in recent years for professional cleaning and technical services, Duskin has established five specialist brands: ServiceMaster, for professional house cleaning; Merry Maids, for home cleaning and helper services; Terminix, for pest control and prevention; Total Green, for plant and flower maintenance; and Home Repair, for fixing scratches and dents. To address growing needs arising in Japan’s aging society, we operate a pair of niche businesses: Health Rent, a business for rental and sales of home healthcare equipment; and Life Care, our support service for seniors. Other enterprises in the Duskin stable are: Health & Beauty, a business selling cosmetics and health food; Rent-All, for rental of special event items and daily-use goods; and Uniform Service, for uniform lease, sales and cleaning.
All these businesses operate mainly through our franchise networks. We rent and sell products to franchisees as well as provide them with business system know-how and expertise in return for royalty payments.
FY2018 Business Results and FY2019 Outlook
Sales by Direct Selling Group for FY2018 (ended in March 2019) totaled 111,476 million yen, a 0.4% decrease from
the previous year due to a decline in the sales of dust control products, the core category of this segment. Although cost of sales improved, operating profit was 13,406 million yen, a 5.6% drop compared to a year before. The reasons for this result include a reduced gross profit due to lower sales and higher labor costs arising from allocation of human resources to the hygiene management business segment in response to growing needs, and increased expenses for improving functionality at Contact Center to strengthen customer relationships.
During FY2019, we set a goal to grow sales by increasing the number of DDuet users. DDuet is our membership website and primary contact point with those customers we do not meet on a face-to-face basis. Other efforts involve preventing cancellations and expanding the sales activities of “Hygiene Masters,” an expert sanitary management consultancy that serves as a primary contact for sanitary advice.
In pursuit of top-line growth, we have been concentrating on franchise development for Care Service Businesses. Meanwhile, Health Rent focuses on developing and educating advisers who serve customers not just with assisted living and healthcare equipment, but also with all Duskin’s services and products.
With these initiatives, the segment sales are expected to be 114,900 million yen, a 3.1% increase over the previous year. Operating profit will be 12,500 million yen, down 6.8% compared to the last year because we anticipate an increase in distribution costs and costs related to the consumption tax hike.
                                                                                                                       Sales* and customer-level sales

 Dust Control Business (Domestic Market)
Duskin’s comprehensive range of services using tablets. Through these efforts, and following the development of a new manual to use during customer visits, we gained 378,000 new trials, 2.3 times more than the previous year. In addition, our Call Center was transformed into Contact Center, where operators now propose add-on services or products based on customers’ inquiries. This improvement is both uncovering potential needs and stimulating demand.
As part of our continuing strategy to expand the business domain from traditional cleaning services to sanitary management for properties and people, we strengthened the product line-up and introduced a team of sanitary management experts called “Hygiene Masters.” In FY2018, 640 people completed the training to bring the total to 1,406 of Hygiene Masters. Now our franchisees can, following a detailed inspection, propose services based on the sanitary condition of a customer’s property. This initiative is a clear point of difference from our competitors.
Future plans
Future plans include establishing a system to manage and share customer information among 2,000 Duskin offices and businesses nationwide. In terms of the residential market, our endeavors to be a company that serves people throughout their lifetime will involve accommodating the diverse needs of all age groups. As for the commercial market, we will study different requirement preferences and trends to satisfy highly segmented customer needs.
May 2019 saw the opening of Duskin Laboratory, a place to realize the business’s transformation into a fine-tuning service for daily life. We want to make the laboratory the place to merge the ideas and voices of consumers, business partners (companies and organizations) and employees with the knowledge and experience of experts, and to create Daily Life Fine-Tuning experiences beyond the boundaries of companies and organizations. The laboratory also plays an important role in gaining Daily Life Fine-Tuning experiences by offering both space and opportunities to discover consumers’ needs and develop products and services that fulfill them.
           Dust Control business is a resource recycling business developed through Duskin’s franchise network.
We rent reusable cleaning tools such as mats and mops. Establishing a sound franchise network nationwide requires a large investment in laundry equipment and distribution networks, as well as in rental products and materials. Moreover, creating a nationwide framework for sales representatives is expensive in terms of time and money. In light of these factors, few competitors have built a network and brand value that rival Duskin’s. Our strength is high market penetration combined with a robust nationwide face-to-face customer base (4.7 million households and 1.2 million commercial establishments).
State of the Market
The major challenge is fewer contact opportunities both in the residential and commercial markets. The reasons for the tightening residential market include a declining number of people staying at home and stricter regulations under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions relating to direct-selling businesses. For the commercial market, the primary reason is that final decisions to close a service contract are not made at the store or office level but at the corporate or landlord level, as many of the businesses are chain stores or located in shopping malls*1.
On the other hand, there is growing attention toward sanitation across different industries and business sectors. Take the nursing care sector, for example. Interest and awareness are rising when it comes to preventing users and employees from infectious diseases. Furthermore, in

Basic policy
Our efforts to strengthen the cross-business network among our 16 brands under Direct Selling Group center on accelerating the One Duskin Store plan. This will also aid in transforming Duskin from a cleaning service provider to a lifestyle partner that helps people fine-tune the rhythm of their daily lives. Every Duskin office—including franchised ones—serves as a contact point for listening to inquiries and proposing solutions that draw on the services and products offered by all the brands under the Direct Selling Group.
Another element of this policy is encouraging each customer to register with DDuet, our membership website, as a Premium member to enjoy products and services that are both convenient and high in added value. Complementing the work we do on site is the importance we place on our loyal customers. Indeed, we encourage them to take advantage of the products and services from Duskin’s different business lines according to their family structure and age groups.

                                               response to revision of the Food Sanitation Act, hygiene control in the food processing, distribution and restaurant industries must meet HACCP*2 standards. As a result, we expect an increase in demand for hygiene management services as approximately 3.5 million commercial establishments need to comply with the revised law.

and sanitary control services in accordance with HACCP), Terminix is strengthening mutual cooperation with Hygiene Masters, with the aim of being Comprehensive Sanitary Management experts through adding the credibility gained over the years as pest-control experts.
At Total Green, sales for the one-time pruning service increased significantly, mainly due to the web advertisement.
Among Home Repair service options, services to change kitchen sink traps and install hooks for suspending laundry poles became the most popular. These stimulated sales activities at franchised offices. Home Repair also accelerated the opening of new offices in the open territories. As a result, the number of franchised units now totals 59, an increase of 25 offices over the previous year.
Future plans
At ServiceMaster, we will expand the scope of services and further enhance service quality. Marking its 30th anniversary year, Merry Maids will launch a new initiative to secure service crews to better respond to growing demand for home cleaning and helper services. Terminix will continue to offer a comprehensive suite of services in the arena of sanitary management in order to accommodate customers’ needs. In celebrating its 20th anniversary, Total Green will establish a system to convert one-time-service customers to regular clients. Home Repair will expand its scope of service beyond “repair” to fulfill a broader range of customer requests.
In April 2019 we launched a new section, Organizational Development, under the Care Service Business segment. Its roles include recruiting service staff for all Duskin Care Service brands to stimulate new franchise development. It also helps Duskin Care Service brands to better respond to increasing needs and demand for the services and help our customers lead richer and happier lives.
              Duskin Care Service Businesses are operated under the franchise business model. We sell cleaning agents and equipment to our franchisees, and support them with management guidance, business systems, know-how, products, and equipment.
The five businesses that meet a diverse range of needs are, namely: ServiceMaster—professional cleaning; Terminix—pest control and prevention services; Merry Maids—convenient home cleaning and helper services; Total Green—maintaining plants and flowers; and Home Repair—fixing scratches and dents.
State of the Market
The demand for sanitary management and helper services offered under our Care Service Businesses is increasing in major cities. Although the competition is intensifying, demand is outpacing supply. The common challenges in the cleaning service sector are securing human resources and establishing a structure to provide high-quality services. While the price-based competition is increasing, so too is the demand for high value-added services. We are thus expected to sustain the brand value and improve profitability by responding to and accommodating these growing needs.
The demand for air-conditioner cleaning, one of the leading services of ServiceMaster, tends to fluctuate by season. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve both business

Basic policy
In our efforts to be the service provider of choice and the number-one franchise chain, Direct Selling Group is embarking on the next stage to achieve its transformation into a Daily Life Tuning service provider. We also set a goal for our five brands under the Care Service Business segment to fine-tune customers’ lifestyles and living environments with our more valuable and convenient services. Establishing an information network between the headquarters and franchisees will help in attaining this aim. Another initiative is to focus our resources on recruiting new franchisees and developing our human talent in order to build a system and structure that will enable Duskin to meet 100% of the growing need for services in this segment.
Achievements in FY2018
Duskin participated in the Franchise Show to recruit new franchisees and expand our franchise network. The new initial fee was introduced to encourage the existing franchisees to open a second office and beyond. As a result, we opened a total of 134 new offices under the five Care Service brands.
One particular area of growth at ServiceMaster has been Custodial Service, where a manager is stationed in a hotel or other facility to manage and control its cleanliness. In anticipation of the increase in demand stemming from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and the 2025 Osaka-Kansai Expo, we have set up a section dedicated to promoting this Custodial Service.

Voice of a ServiceMaster franchisee
I worked for Duskin as a part-timer during high school. That was my first encounter with Duskin. I clearly remember being elated when the customer thanked me with the words of appreciation, “Thank you for making the house so clean!”
At the age of 26, I joined the Duskin ServiceMaster franchise network. Duskin brand awareness, its know-how for opening a business, and the support were all very helpful and reassuring; the area manager assisted me in building both business and marketing plans.

 Senior Care Business
Updates on Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
Basic policy
At Health Rent, we have set a goal to increase our market share in providing rental services under the long-term care insurance scheme and to develop products and services for those seniors aged 75 and over.
For instance, we will create new sales channels such as online and mail-order catalogs to expand the company’s reach in marketing specialty products and services, including controlled medical devices and handrail installation.
At Life Care, we also aim to cultivate business by developing new sales channels beyond our existing medical and welfare networks, and develop services to assist people with dementia. Included in the new initiatives are measures to expand our market presence through expos and development of a new franchise package to increase the number of offices. We will also focus on recruiting new Care Staff to provide quality services to more customers.
Achievements in FY2018
At Health Rent, we visit our customers and users every three months to check on their condition as well as that of the rented equipment, and to gauge their satisfaction with our products and services. The information we obtained during the visits was shared with Care Managers to build trusting relationships with them. The fruits of these efforts were adding a monthly average of 3,400 new customers and total customer-level sales of 9,901 million yen for FY2018, a 7.3% gain over the previous year.
Life Care, on the other hand, focused on recruiting franchisees through web advertisements, direct mail campaigns and expos. We were able to achieve favorable sales results for the company-owned offices. Unfortunately, however, a shortage of Care Staff caused a drop in the number of new
service contracts concluded at franchised offices compared to the year before. Consequently, customer-level sales totaled 2,137 million yen, down 3.6% from the previous year.
Future plans
Health Rent continues to visit customers once every three months to provide safe and reliable products and share information with Care Managers, so as to meet expectations of both customers and Care Managers. Through these initiatives, we will provide not only healthcare equipment but also a wide range of products and services only Duskin can offer. We
also plan to develop home care equipment consultants, who will be able to meet customers’ needs from material and social perspectives.
One of the major challenges for Life Care is the difficulty of expanding the customer base through networking with Care Managers alone, as our services are not covered by the nursing care insurance scheme. To solve this problem, we will focus on collaborations with relevant businesses, medical agencies and drug stores to raise our brand awareness.
Another initiative is to create a new service package where we provide peace of mind through companionship and personal security services. We expect an increase in demand for the
service, as Life Care
has contributed to
reducing the large
number of workers
who need to leave
their job to care for a
family member.
                         Keiichi Emura Division Manager Health Rent
Health Rent sells and rents over 3,100 items nationwide through a network of 150 stores. Our customers can buy or rent most of the items using long-term care insurance, but the items are also for sale or rental to those customers not using insurance.
Life Care serves seniors who wish to stay independent and safe in their own homes. Approximately 2,000 Care Staff at 95 offices throughout Japan provide flexible services to meet the needs of our customers and their families as our service is outside the government long-term care insurance, we are not restrained by
the insurance regulations.

Furthermore, the number of working people who leave their jobs because they need to provide nursing care to family members has risen to 100,000 annually. However, many of them are still not able to support their family members only with the service provided under nursing care insurance. Under these circumstances, the private sector is expected to step in and expand their services to cater for the wide range of needs of elderly people and their family caregivers. We anticipate that there will be a significant increase in the number of them who are willing and able
In 2018, the population of people aged 75 and over exceeded those aged between 65 and 74. In 2025, all baby boomers will have turned 75 or more. At this point, the elderly population in Japan will reach its peak.
In line with this demographic trend and the fact that more elderly people wish to stay in familiar environments, the demand for home care and use of home healthcare equipment will continue to grow. Illustrating this trend, the home healthcare equipment industry has expanded from 1,165.2 billion yen in FY2010 to 1,460.2 billion yen in FY2016.

Duskin operates a contact center for seniors in Wako City, Saitama.
In partnership with Wako City, Saitama, Duskin operates Wako Iki-iki Life Service Plaza, a contact center for seniors.
Through hosting all kinds of events, the Plaza serves as a new local base where seniors are encouraged to develop their own networks, which help them to lead active and more fulfilling lives. Wako Public Lab plans and hosts workshops on various themes for seniors to participate in at the Plaza, helping to reveal their needs and encouraging them to join activities.
Based on the experiences and knowledge gained through these events, we will develop new services to improve the quality of life for senior citizens.

Mister Donut Business
Mister Donut operates under a franchise business model. We sell raw materials and provide shop operating know-how and donut-making skills in return for royalty payments. As one of Japan’s leading donut chains, Mister Donut’s strengths are its high brand recognition, market share and ability to develop new products.
Another strength is our wide customer base that covers all ages. Since 2014, we have been holding Mister Donut Fan Meetings on a prefecture-by- prefecture basis, and the number of participants in the past five years has exceeded 3,000.
State of the Market
In the sweet snack market, general merchandisers such as convenience stores and mass retailers increased their sales through a broader product range. Furthermore, cake and confectionery brand chains are escalating their presence in the Japanese market, raising competition with their similar products. At the same time, labor, raw-material and distribution costs are also rising.
Traditionally, we have opened shops in large-scale shopping malls, but recent years have seen a decrease in new shop openings in these commercial establishments. Instead, the key to further growth is developing shops in new locations including in and around railway stations and station buildings.
Against the backdrop of the fall 2019 consumption tax hike, we expect a drop in consumer spending and eating

At Mister Donut, the core category of this segment, we will create a space where customers of all ages can casually drop by throughout the day for a pleasant experience, under the slogan “Something good’s gonna happen. Mister Donut.”
In collaboration with companies and brands known for their leading techniques and high-quality materials, we are developing new products under the MISDO Meets initiative. For instance, we launched MISDO GOHAN light meal items to enjoy at different times of the day, including breakfast and lunch. Another new product category for health-conscious customers is Double Rings for Your Health.
Initiatives in shop and location development include designing different shop types to meet the needs of customers, as well as relocating existing shops and opening new ones.

FY2018 Business Results and FY2019 Outlook
A series of natural disasters in the first half of the year negatively impacted the business. Shortened business hours, temporary store closures, and closures of underperforming Mister Donut locations, a core category of the group, reduced the total number of shops in operation, which led to a decline in customer-level sales in FY2018 (ended in March 2019). Favorable performance at the existing Pie Face stores, a specialty pie brand, and the increased number of Katsu & Katsu locations contributed to a rise in customer-level sales.
As a result, Food Group sales totaled 35,426 million yen, a 5.8% decrease from the previous year due to lower royalty fees as well as reduced sales of raw materials to franchisees. Operating profit decreased 10.2% from a year earlier to 320 million yen.
Although we expect sales to rise at Katsu & Katsu, which became a separate company in April 2019, sales at Mister Donut are expected to fall on the back of fewer shops in operation in FY2019. For these reasons, we forecast a drop of both sales and operating profit, 35,300 million yen, and 300 million yen respectively.

                Achievements in FY2018
The MISDO Meets project rolled out new items every quarter, helping to motivate customers to visit shops more frequently. “Let’s meet Pokémons at Mister Donut,” a collaborative project with The Pokémon Company targeted children and garnered great support from parents and their children as an experience they can enjoy together. We also enhanced the MISDO GOHAN menu items, which include seasonal pies, pastas and noodles, as well as MISDO Lunch Sets, which are set menus that feature a meal item along with a donut. These initiatives contributed to an increase of sales per operating shop for two consecutive years.
Shop and location development, however, fell short of the target. The actual number of new shops opened in FY2018 was eight, whereas the goal was 50. Difficulties in finding premium locations to generate the targeted sales, and in forecasting sales to achieve the break-even point with the current price range, were the primary reasons for the failure to reach the goal. Furthermore, although the number of renovated shops increased by 20 locations over the previous year, we did not achieve the targeted number of 125; the actual figure was 74.
Challenges and future initiatives
We will continue to focus our efforts on developing new items under the MISDO Meets and MISDO GOHAN projects. Another endeavor in the area of product development is to refine recipes that improve the regular items.
In terms of shop development challenges, we will undertake a review to adjust the current strategy. For instance, efforts will focus on carefully selecting locations for particular shop types, such as a take-out-only units. At the same time, the group will also adopt an Area Marketing Shop Development strategy, where satellite shops will open in the neighborhood of existing shops to generate higher profits. Another goal is to open 31 new locations and to renovate 125 shops by March 31, 2020 by reducing the investment needed for shop development.
A new business-development package will be launched for those markets where Mister Donut has not yet penetrated. Specifically, we plan to open a company-managed model shop during FY2019 to accelerate development of the Mister Donut franchise network after March 2021.

During FY2018, sales of Duskin Kyoeki Co., Ltd., a lease and insurance company, remained the same as in the previous year, while Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd., our medical facility management service, increased its revenue as the number of facilities and customers grew.
As for overseas markets, we focused on developing the existing business brands. In Direct Selling Group, customer-level sales in Taiwan, Shanghai and South Korea exceeded those of the previous year. Duskin Hong Kong Co., Ltd. grew its paper towel business, and Duskin
Shanghai Co., Ltd. posted favorable sales results for its dust control items.
Although customer-level sales for Mister Donut in Taiwan and Shanghai, and Big Apple (a Malaysia-based donut brand), were lower than a year earlier, customer-level sales for Mister Donut in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia exceeded the previous year’s results. A strong yen at the end of the business year also contributed to a sales increase in overseas markets.
Overall, the result was 14,858 million yen in sales, a 3.1% increase from the previous year. Operating profit was 387 million yen, 11.4% up from the previous year, mainly due to a higher profit at Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd. and reduced losses at overseas businesses. Mister Donut in Shanghai, China was closed in March 2019 due to falling profitability arising from higher labor costs and rising rent.
In FY2019 we will continue to focus our resources on developing businesses tailored to Asian markets, and expect to generate sales of 15 billion yen, a 1% rise from a year earlier. Operating profit is forecast to be 300 million yen, a 22.6% decrease over the previous year.

The quarterly roll-out of the new items under this category has gained popularity.
We believe this strategy has been a success in drawing the attention of many customers.

Interview with an Outside Director
“We will enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors to maximize returns through solid analysis of current operations
and risk management.”
Tomoya Yoshizumi Outside Director
Joined Ajinomoto Co., Inc. in 1978.
Named a Member of the Board in 2007. Served in leadership positions, including President of Amino Acids Company,
General Manager, North America Division, Bioscience & Finechemicals Business Division and President of Ajinomoto U.S.A.
(currently called Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America, Inc.).
An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2017.
Q1
Q2
What do you think your role is as an Outside Director?
   Outside Directors at Duskin have different backgrounds. As for myself, I have experiences in developing strategic plans for a whole group of companies and supervision of business operations outside Japan. Leveraging this expertise, I will support the Board to make good management decisions, which I believe is my most important mission.
I also raised the topic and led a discussion at the Board meetings on the capital policy for improvement of the Return on Equity and Price Book-value Ratio.
In the future, I expect to take more opportunities to give advice and make recommendations for overseas business development based on my experiences in global businesses.
 Two years have passed since I assumed the position of Outside Director in June 2017. I believe the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has been improved compared to what it was in my first year. The Operating Officer System, which was introduced from April 2018, has greatly contributed to this improvement. In my first year, detailed reports on the status of business operations were made at the meetings of the Board of Directors. There were many times that I felt the items on the agenda needed to be better organized. With the introduction of the Operating Officer System, the function of the Board of Directors was made clearer by delegating the business execution to the Operating Officers. This led to a better organized agenda at the Board meetings, and expedited decision-making processes for both Directors and Operating Officers.
Due to the reduction of the number of internal Directors, Outside Directors now comprise one-third of all Directors. This facilitated more active discussions, helping us, Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members to express our opinions more freely. As a result, management
decisions, from a company-wide perspective, are now made more effectively. We hold regular meetings of the Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council (with three Outside Directors and three Audit & Supervisory Board Members) as an advisory body for the Board of Directors. The discussion report and recommendations from this Council are shared and reviewed within the business divisions. Responding to our recommendations, the business divisions developed their measures and have come to present them to the Board of Directors. This is a good example of the improved effectiveness of our Board of Directors.
If I would make a request, I would ask for more diversity among our Board of Directors. Our current Board has two female outside directors, but there are no women among the internal Directors. I look forward to having female directors on board. Also, the majority of the internal Directors are from the business divisions. To maintain diverse viewpoints, I think it is beneficial for us to have directors from other areas, such as finance, human resources, or compliance departments.
Q4
What do you think is necessary to improve effectiveness of the Board of Directors?
Q3 How do you evaluate Duskin’s support system for Outside Directors?
  What is your evaluation of Duskin’s Board of Directors?
Duskin supports us well by giving us all the information we need to fulfill our duties as Outside Directors. We are also given opportunities to talk directly with franchise owners at the events and meetings. In these past two years, my understanding of Duskin’s management philosophy, policies and businesses has been significantly deepened. Because of my background in the manufacturing industry (Ajinomoto Co., Inc.), I did not have sufficient knowledge and understanding of some aspects of franchising. Duskin has another stakeholder, franchisees, who are united in our philosophy of Prayerful Management. I have come to understand that the profit distribution at Duskin should be considered with our franchisees included as stakeholders to improve shareholders value. This needs a different
approach from that of general manufacturers.
As to the meeting materials, I would appreciate more digitization of documents. Electronic documents facilitate and expedite the process of the preparation for the meetings. We can check such documents at home or elsewhere and pose questions well in advance to the related business divisions or departments. This can help the divisions or departments to prepare the required explanations and information in time.
I hope the use of less paper, more electronic documents and tablet devices will be accelerated to further improve efficiency and save resources.
   47 CORPORATE REPORT 2019
CORPORATE REPORT 2019 48
The effectiveness of Duskin’s Board of Directors has been steadily improving. However, I believe we should aim for a higher level of effectiveness. The role of the Board of Directors is to identify potential risks from the current business operations, to develop response measures and to maximize the returns. Business divisions and other departments are responsible for the optimum operations in their own areas. However, such optimization tends to be partial or divisional as their focus stays within the scope of division/department’s operations. It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to achieve total optimization for all of our activities from a company-wide perspective.
The Board of Directors is required to consider our current portfolio and to make swift and steady decisions by selecting
the key issues and concentrating the effort required, in order to decide the effective asset allocations to achieve long-term strategic goals. Then, the Board should delegate the execution to business divisions. I believe effective portfolio management, one that drives the execution of the growth strategy is the key to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Following this process and approach will also contribute to the development of the next generation of leaders.
As an Outside Director, I will continue to actively participate in the analysis of our current operations and discussions for our future development. In so doing, I hope to contribute to further improve the effectiveness of our Board of Directors.

Corporate Governance
Basic policy
Duskin positions the strengthening of corporate governance as one of its highest priorities in order to meet the expectations of stakeholders, increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term, and achieve continuous growth of business operations. Alongside establishing a management framework that allows us to accommodate changes in our business environment with swiftness and precision, Duskin is building a structure, an organization and systems to ensure transparent and sound management.
Duskin also places compliance at the center of all our corporate activities in order to continuously improve our corporate value.
Corporate governance structure
Duskin is a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board. At the Board of Directors, Directors monitor and supervise other Directors’ performance. The Audit & Supervisory Board consists of Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members capable of objectively conducting audits and internal full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members, who are well acquainted with our business operations and have skills needed to gather information. Under this system, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, internal and outside, perform accurate audits. We consider this structure highly effective as it supports customer-oriented management while ensuring sound and efficient business operations. This system also enables us to swiftly and precisely respond to changes in the business environment.
In addition, Duskin started using the Operating Officer System in FY2018. Delegating authority to the Operating Officers strengthens the supervisory and advisory functions of the Board of Directors.
Board of Directors
Directors are selected by taking into account the diversity of the board as a whole in terms of abilities, experience, gender and other characteristics. This is for the purpose of enabling the Board to make accurate management decisions in a wide range of business fields while maintaining the soundness, efficiency and effectiveness of the management. The number of Directors is limited to 12.
We select internal Directors from individuals who meet the requirements of becoming Directors, in light of our management philosophy, Duskin’s guiding principles and medium- to long-term growth strategies. Outside Directors are appointed from among business executives and experts who are independent and free of any real vested interest in Duskin, after taking into account the diversity of their views, knowledge and management experience.
To enable the Board of Directors to focus on making important management decisions and monitoring business operations in order to swiftly and precisely respond to changes in our business environment, the Board of Directors consists of six internal Directors with extensive knowledge about the group’s businesses and three independent Outside Directors.

These individuals are responsible for auditing important decision making processes and the status of business execution of Duskin Group, while supervising the performance of the Directors.
Audit & Supervisory Board Members attend the Board of the Directors meetings and other key meetings, where they share their professional opinions with the Directors. Meetings of the Audit & Supervisory Board are held monthly to discuss decisions on audit policies and progress involving audits.

Outside Directors and Audit
& Supervisory Board Members Council
Duskin has an Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council, which is an advisory council for the Board of Directors.

   Election policies for the Board of Directors
Duskin selects candidates for election as Directors from among individuals who fulfill the basic conditions of having the character, knowledge and ethical views for serving as a Director and who have no health issues that would interfere with performing the duties of a Director.
For internal Director candidates, the Representative Director requests for recommendations from the current Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Then individuals who can execute medium- to long-term strategies of the Duskin Group and have a positive effect on the organization’s vitality are chosen as candidates. The Board of Directors makes final selections after thorough discussions, with advice from the Directors Evaluation Committee (chaired by an Outside Director, the majority is comprised of independent Directors).
For Outside Director candidates, Duskin selects individuals who can maintain independence and have no special financial relationship with the Duskin Group. These individuals must also have a business career and professional knowledge needed for enabling the Board of Directors to perform its supervisory and advisory functions. These individuals must also be able to provide useful advice from many perspectives in order to maintain the transparency and soundness of management and the fairness of procedures. The Board of Directors makes final selections.
Under the provisions of Article 427, Paragraph 1 of the Companies Act, Duskin has contracts with Outside Directors that limit their liability as provided in Article 423, Paragraph 1 of this act. The maximum liability under the contracts is the amount as provided in laws and ordinances.
■ Reasons for selections of Outside Directors Name Reasons for selection/election
Extensive experience and insight in corporate management as a Director and Senior Managing Corporate Officer at Wacoal Corporation. Considerable business experience in the fields of human resource planning, international operations and other fields
Extensive experience and insight in corporate management as a Member of the Board and Corporate Vice President at Ajinomoto Co., Inc., including strategic production planning, the Medium-Term Management Plan and implementing M&A strategies for the Ajinomoto Group, supervising business operations in North America as General Manager, North America Division and President of AJINOMOTO NORTH AMERICA, INC.
Extensive experience and insight in corporate management as Managing Corporate Officer, including personnel system reforms and corporate planning such as formulation of its Medium-Term Plan, the annual budget management, organizational restructuring, and M&A transactions.
Note: All three are independent directors.
Standards for independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
To ensure the independence of an Outside Director or Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, Duskin selects a member in accordance with our own selection criteria* as well as the independence standards of the Enforcement Rules for Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
When selecting the candidates, Duskin confirms that they comply with all items of the criteria. Then, the Board of Directors makes the final decision.
* Our criteria for independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are in our Annual Securities Report (Japanese version only).
Directors’ remuneration
Duskin positions Directors’ remuneration as an important issue for our corporate governance. To raise Directors’ motivation to achieve medium- and long-term sustainable growth and enhance corporate value, Duskin established the Directors Evaluation and Nomination system. With this system, their contributions and capabilities are determined and reflected in their remuneration.
The remuneration of our Directors other than Outside Directors consists of basic compensation (fixed compensation), a performance-based bonus (short-term incentive) and share based-remuneration-type stock options (medium- to-long-term incentive). The determination of remuneration by the Board of Directors includes the use of officer remuneration survey data provided by an external research organization as well as comparisons of Duskin’s current remuneration system and level of remuneration with those of companies of a similar size and companies in similar business sectors and with similar operations. The Board of
Directors makes the final decisions, taking into consideration the advice of the Directors Evaluation Committee, after thorough discussions. The base compensation is determined in accordance with the responsibilities and rank of each Director. Based on the amount of profit attributable to owners of parent, an upper limit of the funds for the bonuses of all Directors is determined, with the amount distributed to each Director in accordance with the degree of contribution as determined by the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. Share based-remuneration-type stock options replace part of the basic remuneration. Individuals can receive up to 50 million yen of stock options every year.
The compensation of Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists of basic compensation and a performance-based bonus. A certain amount is set as base compensation and bonuses for Outside Directors, after taking into account their backgrounds and other matters. Total compensation for all Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined within the amount resolved at the general shareholders' meeting. Remuneration for each member is determined based on discussions by Audit & Supervisory Board Members.
Training for Directors
At Duskin, newly elected Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members can attend seminars to receive information about their legal duties and responsibilities.
When selecting Outside Directors, the President & CEO explains Duskin’s management philosophy and confirms their agreement. Then, Duskin’s business strategy and business operations are explained. To help them deepen their knowledge of Duskin, opportunities to visit major business sites, training facilities and plants are provided.
Successor development plan
Duskin provides opportunities for successor candidates with the potential to become senior executives to gain experience at leadership positions of business divisions, regional offices and subsidiaries in order to acquire knowledge about management decisions. The President & CEO conducts monthly individual meetings with all Operating Officers. Quantitative assessments of their performances are made every six months in line with the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. The President & CEO also reviews their capabilities and performance with them.
Policy related to acquisition and holding of cross-shareholdings
The policy for cross-shareholdings is to hold a suitable number of shares only when there is a legitimate reason for owning these shares. Investments in stocks for which there is no legitimate reason for ownership are reduced or eliminated.
Every year, the Duskin Board of Directors determines if the ownership of each cross-shareholding is proper or not. Decisions are based on the need for each cross-shareholding regarding business activities, such as business alliances, maintaining and strengthening business relationships, Duskin’s cost of capital, share price movements and other factors.
Constructive dialogue with investors, analysts and shareholders
Duskin conducts a variety of investor relations (IR) and shareholder relations (SR) activities for the purposes of earning trust in the company’s management, receiving a proper evaluation of the company, and achieving sustained business growth and medium- to long-term growth of business operations and corporate value. When requests for individual meetings are received from our shareholders, individual investors or institutional investors, our senior management and Directors respond to the extent believed to be reasonably necessary in relation to the purpose of each request.
Information, evaluation and opinions gained through IR and SR activities are reported at meetings of the Board of Directors twice each year. In addition, reports as deemed necessary are made by the IR Section to an Operating Officer in charge, then from the Operating Officer to the Board of Directors to reflect this information in
the management.
We strive to improve our website and other IR information that is useful for individual investors and shareholders to make investment decisions. Duskin discloses the financial results, business strategies, ESG information, news and other topics of interest.
In FY2019, Duskin held company briefings targeting individual investors ten times with 1,090 participants. We also had a booth at the Nikkei IR Investment Fair and TSE IR Festa with 2,500 visitors. Duskin holds financial results briefings for analysts and institutional investors twice every year, and visits institutional investors and analysts quarterly to have active dialogue with them.

Risk Management
Risk Management Committee
Duskin has formulated Basic Rules on Risk Management that stipulate how risk is to be managed in the Duskin corporate group. In accordance with these rules, there is a risk management department and supervisors. At our subsidiaries, we name a risk management supervisor at each company in accordance with its size, types of business activities, and other characteristics. We conduct risk management in a consolidated, comprehensive manner.
Duskin has a Risk Management Committee, as an advisory council for the Board of Directors. The committee was held twice in fiscal 2018. It discussed and reported on Duskin’s risk management annual plans, the causes of the risks that have occurred, and the measures to be taken to counter them, and results of auditing and business continuity plan (BCP).
■Risk factors and measures
In the event of an incident that may have a major impact on the Duskin Group, a response office is established.
Risk assessments
Each department identifies the risks that are specific to its responsibilities and analyzes their significance. Then, response measures for each presumed risk factor are formulated according to Risk Prevention Manual.
Every year, risk management departments and the secretariat office review and evaluate countermeasures and their effectiveness. With the feedback of these reviews and evaluations, all departments examine and enhance their countermeasures. Each department identifies new possible risks based on the information on revisions of laws and regulations and any crisis that occurred at Duskin. Each department formulates and implements its own risk management programs.
Measures
Sufficient communication to obtain consent for cooperation and sharing expenses from franchisees for development and introduction of new products and services, new shop openings and renovation of existing shops
Improve programs to provide guidance and training while further building relationships with franchisees.

Compliance
Compliance Committee
Duskin has established Compliance Committee Rules for the purposes of maintaining a compliance framework for the Duskin Group and ensuring that compliance is an integral part of business operations. The Compliance Committee serves as an advisory body to the Board of Directors. The members of this committee are Directors, Operating Officers, Audit & Supervisory Board Members, labor union representative and attorneys who are selected by resolutions of the Board of Directors. The committee is chaired by a Director and Operating Officer who is selected by the committee members. At regularly scheduled meetings, committee members discuss ideas for improvements regarding various issues from the standpoint of compliance. In addition, the committee’s ideas and proposals are reflected in systems, rules and other aspects of compliance.
During FY2018, the committee held four meetings to discuss compliance structures, regulations, annual plans, training programs and internal reporting systems, and made reports.
Compliance training
Annual training sessions
As part of its efforts to ensure that its members are aware of and enforce the Duskin Code of Conduct, Duskin Group holds compliance training sessions every year for all of its Directors and employees.
FY2018 training sessions were highlighted by a lecture by an attorney at law, Mr. Shohei Furukawa, OH-EBASHI LPC & PARTNERS. A case study training session on racial harassment was also conducted.
Day of Resolve
May 31 is the Duskin Group’s Day of Resolve. On May 31, 2002, Duskin was issued an order of partial business suspension by the Osaka Prefecture Government due to a violation of the Food Sanitation Act.
Every year on May 31, lectures by outside experts are conducted to help all Duskin employees reflect on the Large Meat Dumpling incident*. All employees write messages pledging compliance to consumers and society.
Employees who do not know about the incident are encouraged to listen to senior employees. By recalling the incident, Duskin reminds all employees of the importance of compliance with regulations. This is our responsibility to society. We pledge our resolve and reaffirm the determination to do right by building upon our solid compliance structure.
*Large Meat Dumpling incident: An unauthorized food additive in Japan was used for the Large Meat Dumplings sold at Mister Donut. While Duskin discovered this problem at the early stage of the incident, the use of this food additive was not disclosed to the public until inquiries were made by the media. This resulted in severe social criticism.
Insider information management
Duskin has formulated Rules on Insider Information Management and the Detailed Rules on Insider Information. All information regarding Duskin’s businesses, operations and performance is gathered and controlled at the IR Section, which is responsible for the handling of information. We disclose our information based on the belief that the timely and appropriate disclosure of corporate information to investors is the basis of a sound securities market. We are committed to ensuring the fairness and soundness of the securities market.
The IR Section organizes training and educational programs for Directors and employees of Duskin and its affiliated companies to help them deepen their understanding of the importance of information management and the prevention of insider trading, in accordance with the Rules on Insider Information Management.
Whistleblowing
In line with the intent of the Whistleblower Protection Act of Japan, Duskin operates Compliance Hotlines that make it possible to report occurrences directly to our Legal and Compliance Department and to an external law firm. By having mechanisms in place that keep an eye out for legal infractions, unethical conduct including bribery and corruption, and internal impropriety, we seek to foster a sound and highly transparent corporate climate.
We allow anonymous reporting, protect the privacy of whistleblowers, and ensure there are no negative consequences of submitting a report.

   Expansion in the Care Service Businesses and services for seniors
The demands for outsourcing household chores and home cleaning are growing in response to societal changes. Working couples have been increasing along with the advancement of women’s roles in society; the number of singles has also been rising due to aging and late marriage. These demands reflect people’s needs for extra support in the home, and particularly for seniors, help with tasks requiring physical strength and safety considerations. Our Care Service Businesses* have been responding to these social issues and needs. In FY2018, its promotional effort to recruit new franchisees resulted in an increase of 82 locations to achieve a total of 2,607 in all five businesses compared to the previous year.
In the senior service sector, Health Rent and Life Care provide assisted-living and health care products, and support for seniors’ independent living to help seniors lead a comfortable life. Life Care provides services that are not covered by long-term care insurance to assist seniors in living and to reduce the burden of family caregivers. In FY2018, the number of Life Care locations slightly dropped from the previous year due to the impact of rebranding, while Health Rent increased by five locations to 150.

Prevention of secondhand smoke
At Food Group, Mister Donut has been working on the initiative to make shops non-smoking all day or at certain times of a day, or to limit smoking to a designated section in a shop.
Under the revised Health Promotion Law that will take effect in April 2020, further preventative measures against secondhand smoke will be required. In response, Mister Donut decided to change all the shops with an isolated smoking section or a smoking section with an air purifier into completely non-smoking shops or shops with a smoking booth where neither eating nor drinking is allowed. Mister Donut is planning to complete the change by March 2020.
Mister Donut continues to focus on providing a safe and comfortable shop environment so that customers with children can drop in at ease and employees can work in good health.
Manufacturing and renting custom-made mats to prevent special frauds
Our Prevention of Special Frauds Mats help people be protected from special frauds, a nationwide problem. Cooperating with prefectural police, we enlighten and
raise the public’s awareness by proposing that our Prevention of Special Frauds Mats be placed at financial institutions. This activity has been expanding throughout Japan, and as of March 2019, a total of 13,000 custom-made mats were placed in front of automated teller machines at financial institutions and convenience stores in 40 prefectures.
Our customers have voiced their enthusiastic appreciation for this program, and in particular our efforts to achieve the goal of zero victims by printing the prefectural police names and numbers on the mats. Our CSR activity in prevention of crimes with these mats was recognized and awarded in October 2016 as an Anticrime CSR Fulfilling Enterprise by the National Crime Protection CSR Promotion Committee.
Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classroom
In 2012, the Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classrooms started with the hope to help develop children’s potential through supporting school education activities. These classrooms are on-site lessons targeted at elementary school children. In a 45-minute lesson, we help children learn what dust and dirt are, explain why cleaning is necessary and teach them how to use cleaning tools such as dust cloths and brooms so that the children can apply the knowledge to cleaning at school and home. This program was held at 2,704 schools nationwide for a total of 236,155 children educated as of March 2019.
Since 2008, the seminars have been held for schoolteachers who have asked for ways to improve their students’ abilities during cleaning times at school. Collaborating with the teachers, we have developed programs showing how cleaning routines at school can be improved and how to instruct children on cleaning. The seminars were held at 275 school boards for a total of 7,036 teachers as of March 2019.
Supply chain continuity planning
      ServiceMaster Professional cleaning service
If a supplier in the supply chain is affected by a natural disaster and suspends product supply, it can cause customers considerable inconvenience, especially in our dust control business. To prevent this, Duskin has developed a supply chain continuity plan for the key dust control products.
■ Continuity planning policy
1. Purchase goods from several suppliers
2. Check if direct suppliers are implementing their continuity plans
3. Identify in advance similar products and alternatives that can serve as substitutes in an emergency
4. Secure an emergency stock
Inspections of contracted food processing plants
For the contracted food processing plants to process raw materials or products, our Quality Assurance & Risk Management team conducts several types of inspections, including comprehensive qualification for new contractors, inspection of their production operation and periodic inspections of all contractors. Our inspection specialists for food processing plants conduct extensive quality inspections, with more than 400 items on our checklist for facility management, process management, sanitary management and production management. All plants are evaluated and ranked by the results of inspections and other evaluation items. Periodic inspections are conducted regularly (one to three years) depending on the plants’ rankings.
In FY2018, 10 new contractor plants including two overseas plants were inspected, and a regular inspection was performed at 30 plants.

CORPORATE REPORT 2019 58

Since our founding in 1963, Duskin has delivered rental products including mops, mats and other cleaning tools on a periodic basis. All used items are collected from customers, and 97% of the collected items are washed in the laundry plants and reused.

The remaining 3% unusable items are utilized as fuels. All products are repeatedly used until their usable life ends. Dust and dirt on mops and mats are also recycled into materials for cement.

Mister Donut strives to provide a variety of donuts for customers to choose, even just before store closing time. Mister Donut therefore makes continued efforts to recycle any unsold donuts.
In the Kanto and Tokai areas, unsold donuts are reprocessed in processing plants into animal feed. In FY2019, Mister Donut plans to start recycling donuts into biogas in the Kansai area.
Mister Donut reviews production schedules and executes tight controls by using a checklist to reduce donut disposal.

Duskin focuses on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions across the supply chain to achieve the long-term environmental goal of a 26% decrease from FY2013 by 2030.

At Food Group, all shops and restaurants manage energy consumption through controlling air conditioner temperature and avoiding simultaneous use of equipment. Production & Logistics facilities make efficient use of energy in our business operations by introducing energy-saving equipment and improving the efficiency of machinery operation. These activities contribute to reducing CO2 emissions that are one of the causes of global warming.

Duskin believes in establishing workplaces where employees respect each other, and are respected, regardless of gender, age, nationality, career, lifestyles, or any other factor, thus empowering all employees to exert their talents to the fullest of their potential. By doing this, we are prepared to respond to the changing business environment and to diversifying customer needs, which in turn, enables us to increase our value and competitive advantage.
This policy is defined in the Duskin Code of Conduct. Duskin has also set goals to achieve on the ratios of female employees in managerial positions and of employees with disabilities by defining our KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The goal of the ratio of employees with disabilities is higher than the legally required employment rate of people with disabilities (2.2%).

Financial Overview
1.Analysis of business results
Both Direct Selling Group and Food Group posted lower sales. Despite lower sales, operating profit, ordinary profit and profit attributable to owners of parent increased due to a decrease in operating expenses along with a decline in the cost of sales.
Sales
Sales of Direct Selling Group decreased because of a decline in sales of dust control products, the group’s main category of sales. The professional cleaning and technical service businesses continued to perform well. The Health Rent business (rental of assisted-living and health care products), which was upgraded to a business division, posted a big increase in sales. At Food Group, Mister Donut recorded lower sales due to closures of underperforming locations. The sales were also affected by shorter operating hours and temporary closures caused by natural disasters in the first half of FY2018. The termination of the Café Du Monde business at the end of FY2017 also contributed to the sales decline. As a result, total sales of Food Group decreased substantially. In Other Businesses, sales increased because consolidated subsidiary Duskin Healthcare, which provides medical facility management services, recorded higher sales.
As a result, consolidated sales were 158,699 million yen, a 2,332 million yen (1.4%) decrease from the previous year.
Operating profit (cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses)
Cost of sales decreased 1,670 million yen (1.9%) to 86,138 million yen because of an improvement in the ratio of expenses at both Direct Selling Group and Food Group. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 64,606 million yen, a 1,058 million yen (1.6%) decrease from the previous year. The main reasons were a decrease in retirement benefit expenses resulting from a change in the Duskin pension plan and lower promotional expenses because corporate advertising to raise brand awareness and increase sales was less than in FY2017.

Non-current assets amounted to 130,275 million yen, a 1,829 million yen increase from the end of the previous fiscal year.

Liabilities
Liabilities totaled 44,339 million yen at the end of the fiscal year, a 3,932 million yen decrease compared to the end of the previous fiscal year.

Ordinary profit (non-operating income and expenses)
In August 2018, Duskin underwrote a third-party allocation of new shares and established a capital and business alliance with NAC Co., Ltd., the largest franchisee of Duskin.

Profit attributable to owners of parent (extraordinary income and losses)

Impairment loss of non-current assets increased 185 million yen. Gain on sale of securities increased 41 million yen and losses on sales of securities increased 118 million yen.

Megumu
Murakami
Senior Manager
Center for the Strategy of Emergence
The Japan Research Institute, Limited
Profile
Graduated from Faculty of Law, Kyoto University. Joined the Japan Research Institute in 2003 after a career in banking. Ms. Murakami became a member of the Center for the Strategy of Emergence in 2010, taking on the responsibilities of researching corporations and their use of ESG factors and SDGs.
I have reviewed Duskin Corporate Report 2019 with an understanding that Duskin intends to report its financial and non-financial information including business activities and long-term strategies in an integrated manner for institutional investors as its main readers.
When reading Duskin’s corporate information, many readers will be attracted to the expression of Sowing the Seeds of Joy in its management philosophy. Then, the readers will be interested in how the management philosophy is connected in making the business profitable. Pages 19 and 20 illustrate that the three non-financial factors: sustainable franchise system, framework to ensure safety and reliability, and most trusted people in the community, are the source of Duskin’s value creation. Each factor is concisely explained, which I find easy to understand. Among explanations of these pages, especially notable is the thick arrow between Duskin and franchisees indicated with “agreeing with our management philosophy” and the initiatives for human development, including the one by the Founder.
If financial and non-financial values created by these activities were highlighted, following these explanations, this could be a more integrated report.
I also find that special attention is paid to the readability of this report and making it easy to understand for the investors who are also reading various other companies’ reports. The sections reporting the corporate governance included the interview with an Outside Director, information on 10 important meetings such as the Board of Directors’ and Budget Meetings with the number of meetings, their members, and functions. This helps readers to deepen their understanding of Duskin.
From the perspective of an “integrated” report, there is room for improvement in the statement on Duskin’s activities in Asia. I recommend that Duskin describe in greater details their efforts for environmental management and labor-related issues in their business operations in Asian countries to respond to the expectations of readers who want a more complete picture of Duskin.
From the perspective of long-term strategy, the policies in five focused CSV areas on page 23 show how Duskin is strengthening the three non-financial factors, which are the source of value creation. The policies on this page describe initiatives, looking towards the future environment and social and local changes. However, the levels of initiatives and KPIs are not consistent, which could end up giving the impression that these are only superficially organized. It is advisable to clearly state how each goal within the initiatives relates to the company-wide goals as it helps readers better understand the initiatives. It would also help Duskin to develop plans for next year and future initiatives.
I hope this substantial report will be a good source of information for Duskin’s stakeholders to deepen their understanding of Duskin and build good relationships with you.

In response to this third-party opinion
We would like to express our sincere appreciation to Ms. Murakami for providing valuable opinions and comments on our report on Duskin Group’s activities.
For the Duskin Corporate Report 2019, we focused our efforts on helping readers better understand the whole picture of Duskin’s long-term value creation, growth strategies, ESG and SDGs initiatives. Our CSV initiatives to solve social issues through our business activities are stated in our three focused areas, sustainable development of society, eco-friendliness and human resource development.
We appreciate the favorable evaluation of our policies and initiatives. With this encouragement, we will continue to further enhance our activities in our franchise network. With regard to her recommendations for areas for future improvement, we appreciate her precisely pointing out our challenges and will work on enhancing the contents with more specific initiatives and indicators to report in a more integrated manner.
We will continue our efforts to respond to the expectations and trust of our stakeholders by implementing initiatives that will lead to the further improvement of our corporate value and the realization of a sustainable society.

Creating an environment for women and non-Japanese nationals
to work with peace of mind
Merry Maids is known for its services to help women balance housework, child rearing and work conforming to their life styles. With this privileged understanding of our customers, we include women and their expertise as homemakers and parents for career opportunities in our businesses. These efforts are helping to provide more opportunities and jobs for women.
Duskin, as a specified business organization, hired 28*3 workers from the Philippines for the projects to accept non-Japanese nationals in National Strategic Special Zones of Tokyo, Kanagawa and Osaka. Based on this experience at our company-owned locations, we plan to expand this program and support our franchisees to obtain approval as a specified organization to hire non-Japanese nationals for their future operations.
We continue to develop this business model for the benefit of our customers, employees and the Duskin Family.

   Sustainable Development of Society
Offering peace of mind to working women and responding to the needs of an aging society
 Merry Maids provides comfort in everyday life with its home cleaning and helper services
Duskin, a pioneer in cleaning and helper service industry, launched Merry Maids business in 1989. By helping our customers with cleaning and daily household chores, we want them to enjoy more time to relax. With the concept “you should have time to live your life the way you want to, without the burden of worrying about a clean house,” we deliver Merry Maids services through our franchise network.
With the increasing number of working women, many feel overwhelmed trying to balance the responsibilities of work and home. At the same time the number of senior households is also increasing. As they age, many seniors find their household chores more physically challenging than before. With this social change in mind, we have been providing our services tailored to the needs of our customers, offering such services as Home Cleaning Service, Housekeeping/Helper Service and Storage Organizing Service. In 2018, customer-level sales exceeded 11 billion yen.

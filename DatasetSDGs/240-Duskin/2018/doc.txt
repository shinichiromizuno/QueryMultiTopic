 The Core of Duskin
 Our founder’s philosophy lives on.
Attentive care for our customers is our utmost focus, based on our founder’s philosophy which lives on to today. His principles in life are reflected in our management philosophy called Prayerful Management. All of our employees incorporate his philosophy, of sharing joy and doing our best, in our everyday activities.
Day after day, beginning with today both you and I have a chance
to begin our lives anew.
Whether our lot today be profit or loss, be spiritually ready for loss.
As a planter would, let us sow the seeds of joy to every person we meet each day.
For everyone, for you and me,
may we lead our lives in this world to the fullest, realizing our maximum spiritual and material potential.
Duskin Founder
Seiichi Suzuki
Seiichi Suzuki was born in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture in 1911. He joined Ittoen in 1938. In 1944 he established Kentoku Company. From that time on, Suzuki pursued the principle of Prayerful Management, his aim being to unite moral and economic goals in both his own and his company’s business practices. He led the Duskin Group as it paved
a new path to a multi-franchise business enterprise. Seiichi Suzuki died in 1980 at the age of 68.
Sow the Seeds of Joy within people and communities.
Franchise system to Sow the Seeds of Joy
Management Philosophy
                           Profit is the reward of joyous transactions.
Duskin’s founder, Seiichi Suzuki believed “Profit is the reward of joyous transactions,” and energetically continued his businesses, wishing that everyone who took part in Duskin’s activities, would become happy. Home Duskin,
a modern treated cloth, started a new way of dusting without water. Introducing this method was a big step to realize our founder’s wish. People called it the magic
dust cloth – and it brought cleaning
innovation to homes in Japan.
Franchise to fulfill the philosophy
Seiichi Suzuki adopted the franchise system to spread dust control business so that everyone who agreed with Duskin’s philosophy, Sowing the Seeds of Joy, could use this business as an opportunity for their success. Our headquarters and franchisees are united in a strong relationship. Together,
we follow the same philosophy. By Sowing the Seeds of Joy, we grow the businesses, sharing in each other’s fortune
and future.
Franchising is a way of life.
At Duskin, we believe the franchising system enriches us spiritually and materially, as we support each other and continue to grow together.
“Franchising is a way of life” means that franchising brings not only success in business but also success in life.

New franchise packages introduced to meet increasing demand for four cleaning and technical services
The demand for outsourced services has been growing in recent years. In an effort to promote franchise recruitment and meet the expanding market needs of both customers and service areas, franchise fees have been reduced for cleaning and technical services: ServiceMaster (professional cleaning), Terminix (pest control and comprehensive sanitary management), Merry Maids (home cleaning and
helper services) and Total Green (plant and flower maintenance).
Human resource development
Fourteen non-Japanese nationals hired for special project for National Strategic Special Zones
Duskin was approved by Kanagawa, Osaka and Tokyo as
a specified business organization for the Project to Accept Foreigners Conducting Housekeeping Services in National Strategic Special Zones. Duskin hired 14 non-Japanese workers as service staff for our Merry Maids cleaning service. Duskin is committed to providing
opportunities for women:
For those entering the
workforce from overseas,
and for professional
women whose lives are
made easier by hiring
our expert cleaning
services.

Value Creation Strategies and Business Activities
ESG Financial Section
    Teruji Yamamura President & CEO
With a goal toward sustainable growth, Phase II of our long-term strategy, ONE DUSKIN has started.
Duskin Group is currently undertaking the initiatives for its long-term strategy, ONE DUSKIN, which spans nine years from FY2015 to FY2023. The goal of this strategy is to unite all Duskin businesses so as to serve our customers in the most effective and courteous manner.
During the Medium-Term Management Policy 2015, the first three-year phase of our long-term strategy, ONE DUSKIN, we built our foundation to move ahead from sales recovery toward growth. Now, in the second phase, the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018, we are working toward the goals building on the business models developed in the first phase. Leveraging the strength of our network of franchisees, deeply rooted in the local communities, we respond to our customers’ needs with outstanding services. With these efforts, we will achieve recovery in our business performance, and not only meet but exceed society’s expectations. We will reinforce our corporate organization through structure reform, and achieve sustainable growth.
FY2017 Results
Established business models and increased profit in three consecutive years
In FY2017, the final year of the Medium-Term Management Policy 2015, we accelerated initiatives to recover sales and build a revitalized growth track.
Clean & Care Group (renamed Direct Selling Group on April 1, 2018) focused on its initiatives to reinforce customer contacts and meet the changing needs at homes and in work places. The group promoted easy and effective cleaning tools and methods intended for the increasing number of working couples and senior households. The group also concentrated on improving our service structure to meet the increasing needs for professional cleaning and technical services.
At Food Group, Mister Donut launched MISDO GOHAN, light meal items responding to diversifying customers’ needs, and MISDO Meets, collaborative product development with companies and pastry chefs with leading techniques and high-quality ingredients. Food Group also concentrated its efforts on developing other food businesses.
As a result of these efforts, Clean & Care Group recorded higher sales. Food Group’s sales, however, were negatively impacted because closures of underperforming locations reduced the number of shops. Consolidated sales totaled 161,031 million yen, an 849 million yen (0.5%) decrease from the previous year. While sales were lower, the cost of sales at Clean & Care Group
also decreased as did depreciation and expenses for retirement benefits. As a result, operating profit was 7,557 million yen, a 1,488 million yen (24.5%) increase from one year earlier. Ordinary profit was 8,978 million yen, a 1,423 million yen (18.8%) increase from the previous year. Profit attributable to owners of parent was 5,324 million yen, a 1,006 million yen (23.3%) increase from one year earlier.
Duskin views profit returns to shareholders as one of our priorities. Our basic policy is to continue to pay stable dividends. In FY2017, Duskin paid an interim dividend of 20 yen per share and a year-end dividend of 20 yen per share for a total of 40 yen.
Medium-Term Management Policy 2015
Phase I plans steadily implemented to meet the ONE DUSKIN long-term strategy
The three-year period of Medium-Term Management Policy 2015 was defined as the first phase to achieve the goals of our ONE DUSKIN long-term strategy. In this phase, our efforts were focused on four basic policies: business model development, structure reform, new growth and enhanced corporate governance.
Business model development: Clean & Care Group developed an online network to share residential customer information among franchise offices and the head office. This online network system is now in use at all franchise offices. The group also developed its membership website, DDuet, to directly deliver

promotional information to customers. The DDuet membership reached 590,000. For commercial customers, the group enhanced its service structure to provide sanitary management service by training Hygiene Masters specializing in sanitary management.
At Food Group, Mister Donut developed new types of shops adapting shop design in response to different locations, and introduced new product categories, including light meal menu items. As a result of these improvements, sales per shop in operation increased even though the total sales were lower due to smaller number of shops than in the previous year. Mister Donut established the direction for rebuilding its brand.
Structure reform: Both Clean & Care Group and Food Group reviewed their cost structure for procurement, production, logistics and information systems. Through these initiatives, both groups achieved higher profitability, reducing their cost ratio by 3.9 points compared with FY2014.
New growth: Duskin acquired Big Apple Worldwide Holdings Sdn. Bhd., the largest donut chain in Malaysia and made it a subsidiary. This acquisition will enable us to enter into markets where Mister Donut is yet to have its presence. As another initiative, we launched Life Care business with a goal to provide our original services for the senior market.
Enhanced corporate governance: Duskin has increased our number of Outside Directors, created Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council and established
the new Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. These initiatives were implemented to create corporate structure that enables us to achieve sustainable growth.
New Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
To advance deployment of business models established in Phase I
FY2018 is the first year of Phase II of ONE DUSKIN long-term strategy. Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 has three basic pillars: development of existing businesses; new growth; and enhancement of corporate structure. Both Direct Selling Group and Food Group will work on nationwide deployment of business models established in Phase I with a goal to achieve performance recovery. Duskin will reinforce its corporate organization through structure reform and improve our corporate governance to achieve sustainable growth.
Expansion of current businesses
Direct Selling Group evolves its businesses to Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service
With the organizational change to Direct Selling Group, we are reinforcing closer cooperation across business lines. These include rentals of cleaning tools, professional cleaning, home help services, senior care, rentals of assisted living equipment, cosmetics and health food sales, uniform rental and maintenance, and event support services. This new organizational structure is intended to meet increasingly diversifying needs of customers. With the advancement of the internet, and an increasingly aging
population, people’s lifestyles and workstyles are changing. Leveraging our strength of direct selling, home visiting and onsite services to directly interact with customers and learn their needs, we are evolving our businesses to a singular and unified Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service. This enhanced offering helps people to stay in tune and on time. We fine-tune the rhythm of their daily lives and help keep them organized, giving customers more time for joy.
At Food Group, Mister Donut will strengthen its value under its brand slogan, “Something good’s gonna happen. Mister Donut.” Mister Donut continues its shop renovations so that customers of all ages can enjoy our relaxing ambience throughout the day, and will accelerate the initiative to open and relocate shops in line to bring in more customers.
Food Group is examining the potential of our existing businesses with the goal of establishing the next core businesses in this group.
gSee page 29: Results and Outlook
New growth
New business alliance and overseas business development in the Asian market
We will develop new businesses through business alliances and M&A where we expect improving profitability and can take advantage of existing businesses within Direct Selling Group. We also explore business development through alliances with venture companies, educational institutions and the public sector.
In the growing Asian markets where we operate our donut shops and dust control businesses, we are tailoring our franchise business package to meet the needs of each region.
Strengthening corporate structure
Structure reform and enhancing management transparency
Duskin introduced the Operating Officer System with the goal of further enhancing the Board of Directors’ decision-making and oversight functions, and expediting business execution through delegation of authority. Our new Operating Officer System also enables us to nurture next generation of our top management team. With an aim to enhance management transparency, the number of Directors of the Board will be reduced and the number of Outside Directors will be increased by one third the Board members.
Another program targeted at staff and talent development provides employees with more options for career path satisfaction, adapting to individual work styles at each stage of life. For greater diversity of our workforce, we are prioritizing the promotion of more women managers, and the hiring of non-Japanese nationals, people with disabilities and retirees. We will further enhance operational efficiency through utilization of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and RPA (Robotic Process Automation), which will reduce administrative expenses. By taking these actions, we will upgrade our corporate functions and reallocate human resources to the growing businesses.

 FY2018 Outlook
More customers, higher sales and income by implementing our key initiatives
In FY2018, which is the first year of Medium-Term Management Policy, we will steadily implement key initiatives for future growth.
Direct Selling Group will further expand our professional cleaning and technical services, Rent-All and Health Rent, which have achieved steady growth. Dust control business, the core category of this group, continues its efforts to reinforce customer contacts through its membership website DDuet and through the Duskin Contact Center. For residential customers, we will train sales representatives to function like “daily-life concierges” and staff members to attentively serve customers. For commercial customers, we continue to focus on training sanitary management specialists, Hygiene Masters. By strengthening the sanitary management service structure, we will serve our clients’ business partners in the field of facility management.
At Food Group, Mister Donut will accelerate its initiative for new shop openings and shop renovation. Having launched MISDO GOHAN with light meal menu items for different times of the day, and innovative new value added products developed with MISDO Meets projects, Mister Donut aims to achieve higher sales per shop.
With these initiatives, Duskin expects consolidated sales of 163,000 million yen, a 1.2% increase from the previous year.

Our focus will be placed on not just providing quality products and services, but on delivering outstanding customer experiences that meet individual needs and enhance customer lifestyles. Our goal is to continuously provide benefits for our customers and their families through all the stages of their lives, not just one time or one stage of life.
Market trends suggest that the demand for the services that Duskin provides for residential and commercial customers will grow steadily. We will undertake aggressive promotional initiatives to increase the DDuet users, our membership
website. Our primary focus group in the residential market will be the younger generation as they are familiar with and used to e-commerce where there are fewer need and requests/ opportunities for face-to-face meetings.
In this age of the 100-year life, it is predicted that the amount spent by senior households will account for half of all household spending in 2030. Our goal is to assist seniors fine-tuning their rhythm of daily life and enjoy their days with our products and services. For commercial customers, we are developing sanitary management professionals called Hygiene Masters. These experts provide know-how to maintain clean working environments. We provide useful services including sanitary management to address a variety of customers’ concerns, and focus on comprehensively supporting them in business operations.
In our efforts to steadily grow our existing businesses through these initiatives, we provide comprehensive solutions by identifying customers’ concerns and anticipating customers’ requests. By doing so, we ensure that Duskin’s cleaning service will evolve into a core aspect of the Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service.
Direct Selling Group
Developing new business areas and attentively serving our customers
Kiyokazu Yamashiro
Operating Officer
General Manager, Care Service Business Group
The demand for cleaning and technical services has continuously been rising due to an increasingly aging population, declining birthrate and more women working outside the home. Duskin’s cleaning and technical services have also been growing steadily to keep up with demand. In the future, however, it is anticipated that competition will become intense in this area. We have therefore determined to develop high value-added services, and thus differentiate our services from our competition, in order to continue to attract our customers.
However far AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the IoT (Internet of Things) have evolved, we believe that the key to our cleaning and technical services is to meet customers’ diverse needs at different stages of their lives or businesses. Just providing “outsourcing services” is not enough. Year by year, customers’ consumption behavior has been diversifying, and their lifestyles have also been changing. We will focus more on proactively offering information that customers need and serving them attentively through closer cooperation between each of our cleaning and technical service businesses. We aim to keep our services flexible to adapt to changes in customers’ needs and provide our Daily Life Fine-Tuning Services to help people stay organized and relaxed with the fine-tuned rhythm of their daily activities.
Our policy to explore new business areas is driven by our desire to help customers spend relaxed time in a comfortable space. We are directing our attention to “space” in a house, not to “things” such as air conditioners and range hoods, and planning to develop services in the areas of air odor elimination, sterilization and disinfection. We will press forward to our ultimate goal: to help customers keep their entire living space comfortable.

Embracing challenges and changes to get on a growth track
Tetsuya Wada
Operating Officer
General Manager, Mister Donut Business Group
At Mister Donut, we are accelerating our shop development plan in urban areas and on major roads where Mister Donut does not yet have a strong presence. Since a standard Mister Donut shop needs a certain size area with its kitchen equipment occupying half of the floor plan, it is challenging to open shops in high rent districts. Our strategy to meet this challenge is to open more kitchen-less shops in these areas. Donuts are made at the neighboring shops or facilities and efficiently delivered to these shops to maintain the same quality as in the existing locations. This enables us to lower initial investment of shop openings, improve productivity and thus increase the number of shops. We are also expediting relocation and renovation of existing shops.
We are addressing the urgent issue of labor shortage by designing systems for self-checkouts and cashless checkouts. Some of the systems are already under development and, when fully ready, will be installed in our shops. In human resource development, we are improving efficiency of our training programs while maintaining our fundamental philosophy that trained people are at the core of our products and services. In menu development, we will continue to develop high value-added products including MISDO Meets items and MISDO GOHAN meal items to meet diverse needs.
Our founder Seiichi Suzuki put it “Maintaining the status quo is ultimately retrogressive.” Keeping this in mind, we are embracing new challenges, and making changes without hesitation, to get on a growth track.

Direct Selling Group
Clean & Care Group was renamed Direct Selling Group on April 1, 2018.
 Business Performance
FY2017 results
Sales of dust control products, the core category of this segment, remained at the same level as in the previous year but Rent-All, which rents household items and equipment for various events, and other businesses performed well. As a result, sales of Clean & Care Group increased 663 million yen (0.6%) to 111,941 million yen.
Gross profit increased due to higher sales. Cost of sales decreased due to lower investments in Style Cleaner, and expenses for retirement benefits also declined. As a result, operating profit was 14,201 million yen, a 529 million yen (3.9%) increase from the previous year.
Among dust control products for residential use, Cleaning Basic Three, consisting of the LaLa floor mop, the Shushu handy mop and the Style Cleaner, posted higher sales. The Robot Cleaner SiRo, which was rolled out nationwide in April 2017, also contributed to sales. However, sales of other mop products decreased. Kitchen Sponge promotions to acquire new customers resulted in sales growth. Sales of down quilts and other bedroom products launched in November helped increase overall sales. Sales of range hood filters and other products decreased. As a result, total sales of residential dust control products were lower than one year earlier.
Among mat products, the core items of dust control products for commercial use, our Inside highly functional custom-made indoor mats and thin dust control and water absorption mats continued to perform well. Other mat products posted lower sales. As a result, total sales of mat products were at the same level as in the previous year. Sales of restroom-related products and water purifier units decreased. Clear Kukan air purifiers contributed to sales. Due to the addition of a new contract with a large convenience store chain, total sales of dust control products for the commercial market were higher than one year earlier.

  Among other businesses of Clean & Care Group, Rent-All recorded higher sales because services for indoor events such as exhibitions, sports events performed well. At Health Rent, the rental of assisted-living and health care products also recorded favorable results. Uniform-related services, cosmetic- related businesses and Life Care business (rebranded from Home Instead on April 1, 2018), which provides senior care and support services, performed well.
FY2018 outlook
Professional cleaning and technical services, Rent-All, and Health Rent have performed well. Direct Selling Group expects higher sales from these businesses. Dust control business, the core category of this group, is continuing its efforts to reinforce customer contacts through its membership website DDuet and Duskin Contact Center. The group expects that these efforts to attract more customers will result in higher sales.
The group expects sales of 113.3 billion yen, an increase of 1.2% from a year earlier. Operating profit is expected to increase 1.4% from one year earlier to 14.4 billion yen.
Medium-Term Management Policy
Business environment and challenges
Direct Selling Group expects the market size of dust control business, the core business of this segment, to decline. The major reasons include the decreasing number of women staying at home because of the advance of women’s role in society, the growing popularity of disposable products in the residential market, the decreasing number of commercial establishments and cost reduction initiatives at companies in the commercial market. However, Care Service, which provides professional cleaning and technical services, anticipates market expansion in both the residential and commercial markets due to growing outsourcing needs.
Basic policy
Lifestyles and workstyles are changing in Japan due to progress involving the internet and to the country’s aging population. By leveraging the strengths of direct selling and home visiting/ onsite services to interact with customers to learn their needs, Direct Selling Group will evolve its businesses into a Daily Life Fine-Tuning Service. These services will help customers to stay organized and fine-tune the rhythm of their daily activities at home and in workplaces.
To achieve this goal, Direct Selling Group was established to operate rentals of dust control products, professional cleaning and technical services, senior care services, rentals of assisted living equipment, cosmetics and health food sales, uniform rental and maintenance, and event support services. With this new group, we aim to reinforce closer cooperation across all business lines. The new group will accelerate the development of products and services to meet the needs of seniors and the child-rearing generation. For commercial customers, the group focuses on enhanced service capabilities to better meet the sanitary management needs. We plan to use these initiatives in order to enhance customer convenience and operational efficiency.
Key initiatives
For residential customers, the group is working on improving its service structure and the capabilities of sales representatives who visit customers at their homes. We train our sales representatives to utilize our mobile devices so that they can always proactively provide solutions tailored to each customer’s needs. Our Call Center has been transformed into a Contact Center. Contact Center serves our customers by identifying
       Business summary
their needs and creating solutions as well as supports our sales representatives.
We will continue our efforts to reinforce our customer contacts through our membership website, DDuet. We plan to expand its membership from the current 590,000 users.
The market for professional cleaning and technical services has been growing. To meet the growing needs for these services, we are recruiting franchisees by introducing a new franchise package. We plan to continue to strengthen our service structure by developing a web quote and payment system, and chemicals and equipment for higher work efficiency.
For commercial customers, we will work for our customers as their business partner to provide sanitary management solutions and help them fine-tune their daily life activities. Responding to the revision of the Food Sanitation Act and other related laws, our Hygiene Master specialists help customers implement their general sanitary management programs and provide facility management know-how including professional kitchen sanitation. In addition to these services, Direct Selling Group will provide comprehensive solutions, including a uniform service and event support services, to support customers’ business operations.

Business Performance
FY2017 results
Sales of Food Group totaled 37,624 million yen, a 2,538 million yen (6.3%) decrease from the previous year. This is due to lower Mister Donut customer-level sales and royalty fees resulting from the closure of underperforming shops as well as sales of raw materials to franchisees.
Gross profit decreased due to lower sales. Expenses for depreciation, distribution and retirement benefits were lower. As a result, operating profit was 356 million yen, a 1,040 million yen increase from the previous year.
At Mister Donut, “MISDO meets” products were co-developed with companies with leading techniques and high-quality materials.
With the theme MISDO GOHAN, Mister Donut also released light meal items to meet customers’ diversifying needs and lifestyles. By offering light meal selections for customers of all ages to enjoy at different times of the day, including breakfast and lunch, the brand now stands for more than a place to enjoy a snack between meals. The light meal items generally performed well. Due to these initiatives, sales per shop in operation were higher than one year earlier.
Among other food service businesses, Katsu & Katsu, a pork cutlet specialty restaurant, continued to perform well. Hachiya Dairy Products, a consolidated subsidiary, posted higher sales. Bakery Factory, a large suburban bakery shop, The Chiffon & Spoon, a specialty chiffon cake shop, and Pie Face, a specialty pie store, recorded lower sales.
FY2018 outlook
At Mister Donut, the core business of Food Group, sales per shop in operation have begun to pick up because of “MISDO meets” and MISDO GOHAN. In FY2018, through these initiatives, Mister Donut expects an increase in sales per shop in operation. Mister Donut also anticipates that shop renovations and openings will drive sales growth. However, closures of underperforming locations are expected to result in a decrease in the total number of shops in operation. As a result, full-year sales at Food Group are predicted to be 38,000 million yen, a 1.0% increase from a year earlier. Operating profit is forecast to increase 12.2% to 400 million yen.
Medium-Term Management Policy
Business environment and challenges
Food Group is seeking to reestablish the Mister Donut brand under the brand slogan “Something good’s gonna happen. Mister Donut” and develop a second pillar of this group.
Key initiatives
Mister Donut business
In accordance with the policy established in the first phase of the long-term strategy ONE DUSKIN, Mister Donut will continue shop renovations to provide a comfortable ambience and open and relocate shops in line with customer traffic flow. To motivate customers to visit shops more frequently, Mister Donut continues to develop “MISDO meets” products jointly with companies with leading techniques and high-quality ingredients. Mister Donut is also working to increase customer convenience and achieve higher shop sales by enhancing MISDO GOHAN menu items to enjoy at different times of the day, including breakfast and lunch.
We are also focused on the development of new donuts that can generate steady sales and on the improvement of existing products to enhance brand value. Our goal is to create a space where customers of all ages can casually drop by throughout the day for a pleasant experience.

The market size expanded arising from social environment changes and growing demands for outsourcing house cleaning.
In recent years, the social environment has been changing. Included in the changes is an increase in the number of working couples along with a corresponding increased need for assistance with household chores. There are many factors responsible for these changes including the advancement of women’s roles in society, an increased number of singles due to aging and late marriage, contributing to a decrease in the number of total workers. These various factors have raised awareness for the need for work style reform, both at home and in the workplace.
A variety of professional cleaning services including those targeting air conditioners, range hood, kitchen and bathroom have been introduced using various media including the internet. This promotional effort has helped potential customers understand the benefits of using the services; effective use of time, consideration of physical strength, and safety. The promotions resulted in an increased response and affirmation of the need for the services.
Under the circumstances of a changing social environment and increased needs for outsourcing services, the demand and market for professional services has increased and is predicted to grow and continue into the future.

  Focus on expansion of the franchise network for five professional cleaning and technical service businesses responding to ever growing social needs
Looking ahead towards the future needs of society for professional and technical services, Duskin started to offer the ServiceMaster business in 1971.
Duskin currently offers five different business lines: ServiceMaster, a professional cleaning service; Terminix, pest control and prevention services; Merry Maids, convenient home cleaning and helper services; Total Green, maintaining plants and flowers, and Home Repair, fixing scratches and dents.
In order to respond to ever changing needs of our customers, we have expanded the service menus. Merry Maids has introduced vacant house cleaning service, while ServiceMaster is now adding grave and tomb cleaning. With our advanced technologies and skills, training and educational programs strengthened by our track record and know-how, we continue to focus on customer satisfaction.
Simultaneously, we are expanding our franchise network in order to build the solid service structure needed to support the expected increasing demand for home cleaning and helper services.
The new franchise package including the intern program for franchise recruitment
In February 2018, the franchise package was renewed with
the reduced franchisee fee of 650,000 yen to attract potential franchisees to join the Duskin businesses. The franchise fee and purchase of the opening kit which includes the training fee, the initial kit, racks/shelves and signage are required as start-up capital.
ServiceMaster, a professional cleaning service, is currently offering both business and residential services. As a premium addition to these services, ServiceMaster Home Package, the new service exclusively for home owners, was rolled out. Not only has the franchise fee been reduced but also potential franchisees will get an opportunity to experience the home service business, which also gives them time to consider going into the business services arena.
Among other new features of the new franchise package is an intern opportunity at Duskin’s Branch Office. This allows

 Exacerbated by the population reduction, the securing and education of quality staff is of utmost importance.
Due to the drop of birthrate and an increase in the aging population, the available work force continues to decline. In addition to the need to secure labor to address the manpower shortage, its impact on the Japanese economy and business growth is a major concern, particularly for the sales and service industries.
Resolving this problem is an urgent matter for companies to not only sustain, but expand their business. At Duskin, we have these same challenges: securing and developing personnel to provide the direct selling, home visiting and onsite services, service crew to perform professional and technical services, and the sales staff to serve customers at our food establishments. As such, together with our franchisees, we are undertaking significant initiatives for personnel development.
The various competitions and award programs are held to improve service quality and to develop people.
These programs have been organized by the various Duskin business groups and departments with goals of improvement of service quality at the franchisee level and of developing all level
of staff. At Direct Selling Group, the Clean Care Award is given to recognize a corporate customer who has recorded high annual sales growth. Another effort is the Kaizen & Technical Contest. In this program, there are competing presentations on process improvement case studies as well as demonstrations showcasing high levels of service skills and knowledge.
At Mister Donut, the Mister Donut Friendship Festival is held every year. All employees including part-timers participate to compete production and customer service skills. In addition to competing skills and techniques, these events are energizing occasions for the participants as they can learn and be inspired by high level skills and know-how from other participants. At the end of these events, each participant feels even more connected to one another and motivated to continue building their team spirit.
Duskin School, a training facility for franchisees to develop their employees and personnel
Duskin School and Mister Donut College, Duskin’s unique training facilities, are our training and educational foundation for franchisees to develop their people.
They are comprehensive training places where franchise owners, managers, and staff can learn subjects ranging from management philosophy to operational know-how from highly experienced instructors using a wide-reaching training
curriculum.
For instance, the trainees can learn the technique and skills in practical programs using mock-up facilities including home and commercial kitchens, bathrooms, and different hard floor materials. The trainees can also receive lectures at the main conference room which can accommodate up to 150 people. Furthermore, the Regional Training Centers are established in eleven locations across Japan. Ongoing training programs are offered including ones tailored to the specific needs and attributes of each local market to enhance the efficiency and acquisition of professional knowledge and techniques.
In 2017, a total of 1,045 trainees completed the sessions. The number of training hour totaled 20,561.
Mister Donut College was established out of the founder, Seiichi Suzuki and his faith.
Mister Donut College is a unique training facility for the development of first-class business people in the food industry. In addition to donut production and customer service, the trainees learn about the philosophy of Mister Donut and the best attitude for serving our customers. Mister Donut College was established out of the founder’s faith; “Human resources, i.e. intangibles are assets we must develop with our hands,” Seiichi Suzuki said. Based on this faith and guidance, the facility was founded even before starting franchising the business.
While the focus of the program is practical-intensive learning, it also includes food and hygiene, product quality control, and store maintenance and management. The program is updated as needed in response to the times. The trainers visit each region to hold sessions on customer satisfaction, and offer a curriculum to improve interpersonal communication skills required for management, and to develop independently motivated personnel who are inspired to make our customers happy. Only those who satisfy established standards after the practical intense training, may operate their own shops as a Shop Manager.
In 2017, a total of 2,383 people completed the training programs. The total hours of training reached 29,336 hours.
Duskin continues to focus our efforts to develop a system and program for our people who serve our customers to work at Duskin for many years with eagerness and satisfaction.

Mister Donut has also launched a new product category for health conscious customers called Double Rings for Your Health. In this category, we have added the Fluffy Baked Donut. It is a gently sweet, fluffy baked donut made with rice flour and free of specified allergenic ingredients (labeling mandatory required: flour, milk, egg, buckwheat, peanut, shrimp and crab)*. * Apples are used as a specified allergenic ingredient (labeling recommended).

Consumers are more health- and safety-conscious about food
A consumer survey conducted by Japan Finance Corporation in July 2017 reports that the largest percentage of consumers chose health as the driving preference for food for 14 consecutive years. Health, economy and convenience are the major three driving preferences. However, the ratings for economy and convenience are on the decline. More respondents than ever before expected health and safety would be on the rise. This clearly shows that consumers will place more importance on health and safety factors when choosing their food.
With this backdrop, Mister Donut is undertaking initiatives focusing on safety, reliability and health as a business theme.
Strict selection for raw materials and thorough quality control
Duskin places the highest priority on food safety. To ensure safety for customers, we have established a rigorous quality control framework. For the development of new food products and in consideration of the resulting specification changes, a meeting is held to ensure safety by our Food Safety Council, which consists of representatives from food safety management, product development and quality assurance departments. For each and every item, raw materials such as flour are carefully

selected for safety and reliability.
Mister Donut has taken the lead in tackling the trans-fatty acids issue. Studies say high intakes of trans-fatty acids elevate low density lipoprotein (bad) cholesterol levels, and decrease high density lipoprotein (good) cholesterol levels, which increases the risk of coronary heart disease.
Mister Donut has been utilizing oil with a significantly reduced amount of trans-fatty acids at all of its stores since December 2007.
Customers can check the nutritional information about our food products (equivalent amount of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates and salt) in store and on the Mister Donut official website. The information is updated along with the new product release and product updates.
Since November 2016, calorie information has been made available at the shops in addition to the official website. Price

In December 2016, Mister Donut started sales of decaf coffee, using green coffee beans with caffeine reduced by 97%. People who are sensitive to caffeine, and those concerned about caffeine intake, including pregnant women can enjoy this coffee. Our decaf coffee, blending three different kinds of coffee beans, offers good taste of full-bodied coffee. In March 2018, café au lait, iced coffee and iced café au lait were introduced in this decaf coffee line.
Also in March 2018, Mister Donut released a lower-fat donut, called Tea Mannan Stick, which contains 140 kilocalories per piece. While keeping tastiness, Mister Donut reduced the fat content in the dough as much as possible. By using glucomannan and other ingredients, which maintain high water content, Mister Donut made this dough mix reduce oil absorption. Mister Donut continues to respond to the growing needs for health, safety and reliability. Mister Donut is developing products and shops to please health-conscious customers, including Double Rings for Your Health product series.

At Duskin Group, the philosophy of Economy and Morals in Unity is the basis of our business management. This means that we will proactively meet society’s expectations and achieve sustainable growth while serving our society. To that end, Duskin considers it important to identify our materialities, key ESG issues we need to tackle through dialogues with stakeholders, as well as to focus on ESG activities from
diverse perspectives, based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and international guidelines*.
In this process, we will sustainably enhance the corporate value
of the entire group by performing PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
cycles for identified ESG activities.

Efforts and progress
  At Food Group, all shops and restaurants manage energy consumption through controlling air-conditioner temperature and avoiding simultaneous use of equipment. Production & Logistics facilities reduce energy loss by introducing energy-saving equipment and improving efficiency of machinery operation.
We are seeking to reinforce our product management structure by expanding the scope of audits and increasing the number of items to be audited at our plants. This is because defects of new products are more likely to occur before the production line stabilizes.
We are working to support women’s career development and to offer them greater opportunities. At Duskin there are many women at senior staff level. We provide them with opportunities to acquire necessary skills and raise their awareness about becoming managers during career development training.
One example of women excelling at Duskin is Manager of Merry Maids Division, who received a second Osaka Sakuyahime Award. The award is presented to leaders who have been playing active roles in business and cultural activities.
To develop human resources, we have invested in Prayerful Management study sessions, career development programs and e-learning courses.
A volunteer cleaning activity was held at World Heritage Koyasan Kongobuji Temple. With the support of the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan, we continue cleaning activities at world heritage sites.
We now have over 500 School Cleaning Masters at our franchises. To improve the lesson quality and skills of the masters and increase their motivation, Duskin has held new renewal training for a better training curriculum. A book was even published recently about our school cleaning activities.
Every Director and Audit & Supervisory Board Member receives a self-evaluation questionnaire once a year. A third party expert collects the answers from the questionnaire. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council* analyzes and evaluates the Board of Directors’ activities from many standpoints and makes recommendations to the Board. In FY2017, the Board of Directors examined their recommendations and the initiatives
to undertake during FY2018 to improve effectiveness of the Board.
* The council consists of three Outside Directors and three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, who are designated as Independent Directors.

Outside Director’s Message
“My role is to make proposals to help business growth and to create value from a consumer’s point of view.”
Junko Katada Outside Director
Profile:
From 1997, as a member of Osaka Izumi Consumers’ Co-Operative Union, Junko Katada engaged in various activities including product studies, promotion and environmental protection projects, and life planning lectures. Appointed as an Auditor, Osaka Izumi Consumers’ Co-Operative Union in 2007. (Resigned in June 2015.)
An Outside Director for Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2015.
Q
How do you evaluate Duskin’s support system for Outside Directors?
  Q
The most important role as an Outside Director is to judge
business management from an outsider’s point of view and make proposals for improvement. In order for us to help business grow in this ever-changing market environment, we must understand circumstances from diverse standpoints and flexibly adapt to situations. Duskin has assigned several Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members with various backgrounds and expertise to gain such diverse perspectives.
I served as an Auditor for Osaka Izumi Consumers’ Cooperative Union for about eight years and audited operations and activities of the organization from a member’s point of view. Based on this experience I have come to think that it is of utmost importance for an outside director to understand things from a consumer’s point of view. Both Duskin and co-operative unions have points of direct contacts with customers as they both visit customers from door to door and have brick-and-mortar stores. I make it a rule to check if our products and services meet consumers’ actual needs when I evaluate businesses.
What do you think your role is as an Outside Director? What is required to carry out your responsibilities?
Q
When I assumed a position as an Outside Director three years
ago, what impressed me most was the company’s philosophy of management and its wonderful motto, “Let us Sow the Seeds of Joy.” This motto is actively practiced by the entire group of Duskin companies, including its franchisees, and it is put into action in various important ways.
I think the motto and the philosophy are an amazing feature of the Duskin group of companies. The presence of this management philosophy is powerful; it is the basis of Duskin’s management policies. When compared with this solid management philosophy, the process of developing business strategies, which directly result from this philosophy, seems to be less solid. We may take it for granted that the strength of the management philosophy could naturally and easily be applied to develop into the expansion of businesses. However, a concept and a strategy, both based on the same philosophy, are actually
In recent years, consumers have greatly changed their views on corporations. At annual round-table conferences with consumer organizations, I often feel that more and more consumers think of benefits not only for themselves but also for society in general. They wonder what values corporations create for the greater good. More interests and attention are paid to women’s success and promotion or environmental conservation as well as food safety and security. Corporations need to be aware of such social demands and take a proactive approach to respond to such needs. Duskin’s products and services provide a solution to problems each customer has; however, we must continue to redefine our businesses while taking into consideration the influences the corporation as a whole has on the society and the social values it communicates. When we plan a new business or take on a new endeavor, we must consider usefulness and advantages to the society in general in addition to benefits for individual consumers.
on different levels. We must be aware of this difference when we develop and execute within the organization.
To grow as a corporation, it is very important for us to come up with and carry out strategies that keep pace with changes in the market environment. This year, the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 has been announced. To successfully implement this policy, it is important to share clearly defined strategies for the entire Duskin Group across our business divisions. Sharing such strategies enables each division to translate their own strategies into action. It is also crucial for all of us to stay determined to achieve our strategic goals. United in our motto to Sow the Seeds of Joy, each division needs to build momentum towards achieving our goals. I believe such momentum in unity will lead us to ONE DUSKIN and to sustainable growth in the future.
Duskin supports us well by giving us enough knowledge and information. We have to know what’s happening on the front line in order to review management from consumers’ points of view. Such knowledge is crucial for a thorough management evaluation from consumers’ standpoint as Duskin is engaged in a broad range of businesses which are deeply integrated into consumers’ daily lives. When I was appointed as an Outside Director three years ago, I did not quite understand many of the business lines. I have since gained a lot of knowledge in these years as I have visited various plants and offices and taken part in informative lectures. I understand the business structures of Duskin much more now.
We receive reference materials for board meetings in advance. Such materials and points for discussion are classified by subjects. Particularly important subjects are explained beforehand and reference materials are attached to those matters that need clarification or answers to questions. It is also possible to request clarification individually and separately from the board materials distribution.
From time to time Duskin holds Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council meetings*, which are
board of directors’ advisory panels. These meetings are excellent examples of the support systems that Duskin provides so that members can exercise their supervisory responsibility over management from a fair and objective standpoint; we express and exchange constructive opinions to achieve effective corporate governance. Reference materials for board meetings, as mentioned earlier, are now improved in their preparation and use of data as a direct result of the requests discussed at the Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council.
Monthly Board Meetings are held in a relaxed atmosphere, so we can express our opinions freely. Adequate information is provided in advance, which leads to meaningful discussions, and the chairperson always asks for our opinions and feedback. Introduction of the Operating Officer System in April this year separated operational function from decision making and oversight functions. With this new system, we can expect to expedite decision making processes. As an Outside Director observing Duskin’s businesses from a consumer’s standpoint, I feel that I have the support to pursue my goal to contribute to creating positive corporate social values.
* A total of six meetings were held in 2017.
Please give your advice for Duskin Group to sustainably improve its corporate value.

Corporate Governance
While meeting the expectations of various stakeholders, Duskin is working to enhance corporate value over the medium- and long-terms and achieve sustainable growth. To that end, we view the strengthening of corporate governance as one of our utmost management priorities. Alongside establishing a management framework that allows us to accommodate changes in our business environment with swiftness and precision, Duskin is building a structure, organization and systems to ensure transparent and sound management. We also place compliance in the center of all our corporate activities as we work to continuously improve our corporate value.
We have a solid foundation based on our management philosophy Prayerful Management advocated by Duskin’s founder Seiichi Suzuki. Prayerful Management, reflecting his philosophy and principles in life nurtured through his personal experiences, was established as a guideline for managing a company founded on his ideals. Duskin Group has inherited our founder’s earnest wish as translated into the business philosophy. We believe Duskin’s corporate governance must be implemented through the actions of all employees based on a thorough understanding of and adherence to our management philosophy.
Measures to strengthen corporate governance
(FY)
Board of Directors
Chaired by a Representative Director, who ranks first in the predetermined order of precedence, the Board of Directors meets at least once every month. This body supervises the execution of our business operations and makes decisions on important matters regarding the management of Duskin Group. Directors are selected by taking into account the diversity of the board as a whole in terms of abilities, experience, gender and other characteristics. This is for the purpose of enabling the board to make accurate management decisions in a wide range of business fields while maintaining the soundness, efficiency and effectiveness of the management. The number of Directors is limited to 12.
We select internal Directors from individuals who meet the requirements of becoming Directors, in light of our management philosophy, Duskin’s guiding principles and medium-to- long-term growth strategies. Several Outside Directors are appointed from among business executives and experts who are independent and free of any real vested interest in Duskin, after taking into account the diversity of their views, knowledge and management experience.
Directors focus on making management decisions swiftly and precisely to respond to changes in our business environment. The Board of Directors consists of six internal Directors with extensive knowledge about the group’s businesses and three independent Outside Directors. The term of office of the Directors is one year to make it possible for them to accommodate changes in the business environment with swiftness and precision and to clarify managerial roles and responsibilities.

 ■ Results concerning the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
The Board of the Directors of Duskin confirmed that both internal and Outside Directors participated in thorough discussions and that decisions were based on these discussions. The board therefore concluded that it is sufficiently effective and that the Directors are making efforts to further improve effectiveness. Duskin uses the Operating Officer System to ensure that the number and composition of Directors are appropriate for the purpose of facilitating more active discussions of company-wide management issues. The Directors Evaluation and Nomination System was also established to enhance transparency and objectivity of procedures for the appointment or removal of Directors. We also started to allot to Directors share-based-remuneration-type stock options as sound incentives for growth in corporate value. The Board of Directors resolved to execute organizational reforms for a better staff organization.
The board also confirmed that Directors made efforts to address issues and challenges in the previous years and achieved certain results in the following areas: the number of the Board of Directors meetings held, the number and quality of the agenda for discussions, the method of sharing information with Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and investor relations and shareholder relations activities.
Audit & Supervisory Board
The Audit & Supervisory Board has a total of five members including three independent Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members (one woman) as of June 21, 2018. These individuals are responsible for auditing important decision- making processes and the status of business execution of Duskin Group, while supervising the performance of the Directors.
Audit & Supervisory Board Members attend the Board of the Directors meetings and other key meetings, where they share their professional opinions with the Directors. Meetings of the Audit & Supervisory Board are held monthly to discuss decisions on audit policies and progress involving audits.
As Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, we appoint specialists including certified public accountants and attorneys- at-law to ensure effective monitoring of legal, financial and accounting aspects of our business operations. The majority of the members are independent, non-Operating Officers of Duskin.
Roles and composition of other meeting bodies
CSR Committee
To fulfill our corporate social responsibilities (CSR), we have a CSR Committee, which is an advisory council for the Board of Directors. The purpose of the committee is to identify key CSR priorities to be addressed and the scope of our CSR activities in order to implement CSR management across Duskin Group. The committee members are Directors with special titles, Operating Officers responsible for focused areas of CSR activities, and Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The committee met twice in FY2017 to discuss and review annual CSR activities and future initiatives, ESG issues, and medium- to long-term goals.
Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council
Duskin has an Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council, which is an advisory council for the Board of Directors. Its purpose is to provide beneficial views for ensuring effective corporate governance, while enabling Outside Directors to gather information without affecting their independence. This makes it possible to monitor and supervise Duskin’s management from a transparent, fair and objective viewpoint. During FY2017, the council held six meetings and made recommendations for our medium-to-long-term growth of corporate value.
Operating Officers’ Board
For the President & CEO to conduct business operations based on the basic management policy established at the Board of Directors meetings, Duskin has an Operating Officers’ Board,
a deliberative body to examine important business matters. The Operating Officers’ Board meets once or more every month. During the meetings, information is shared with other Operating Officers.
Business Strategy Meeting
The Business Strategy Meeting is held biannually for all Directors and division managers to discuss company-wide business strategies, business portfolios and the allocation of Duskin Group resources from a medium-to-long-term perspective. The results of the discussions are shared with all Directors. We are mobilizing all of our capabilities to implement the Medium-Term Management Policy in order to achieve our long-term strategic goals.
Budget Meeting
The Budget Meeting is held once each month to monitor budget progress for each business division and identify the discrepancies between forecasts and actual results as well as to discuss measures to be taken.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
Duskin analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of the entire Board of Directors annually in order to achieve sustainable growth and stronger corporate value over the medium- and long-terms.
Evaluation process
Reasons for appointment of Outside Directors
Independent Outside Directors must not be a related party of Duskin Group and must be able to maintain their independence. They must also have business experience and expertise needed to perform supervisory and advisory functions for the Board of Directors. In addition, independent Outside Directors must be capable of providing beneficial advice from many perspectives to ensure management transparency and soundness and procedural fairness. Candidates are selected by a resolution of the Board of Directors after taking into account the opinions of Audit & Supervisory Board Members and the Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council.
Under the provisions of Article 427, Paragraph 1 of the Companies Act, Duskin has contracts with Outside Directors that limit their liability as provided in Article 423, Paragraph 1 of this act. The maximum liability under the contracts is the amount as provided in laws and ordinances.
Reasons for appointment of Outside Directors
Standards for independence of Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
To ensure the independence of an Outside Director or Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member, Duskin selects a member in accordance with our own selection criteria as well as the independence standards of the Enforcement Rules for Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
When selecting the candidates, Duskin confirms that they comply with all items of the criteria. The Board of Directors then holds discussions while considering the opinions and advice of Audit & Supervisory Board Members and the Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Council before selecting the candidates.
Note: Our criteria for independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members are in our Annual Securities Report (Japanese version only).
Policy on Directors’ remuneration
To revise the Director Remuneration System as part of our management reforms, we started a share-based-remuneration-type stock options program for Directors in June 2017. Its purpose is to raise their motivation to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value over the medium- and long-terms by sharing risks and benefits of fluctuations in stock prices with shareholders.
The compensation of our Directors other than Outside Directors consists of basic compensation (fixed compensation), a performance-based bonus (short-term incentive) and share- based-remuneration-type stock options (medium-to-long-term incentive). The compensation of Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists of basic compensation and a performance-based bonus.
Directors’ compensation
The total amount of compensation for all Directors is determined within the amount resolved at the general shareholders’ meeting. Effective April 2017, remuneration for each Director other than

Successor development plan
The succession plan for our CEO has been carefully examined after considering advice from the Directors Evaluation Committee. Duskin provides opportunities for successor candidates with a potential of managing Duskin’s businesses to acquire knowledge and experience that allow them to make management decisions from the standpoint of customers.
Since starting the Operating Officer System, we have provided Operating Officers with opportunities to acquire overall knowledge about the company’s management and are thus developing next-generation executives.
Internal control system
Duskin Group places the pursuit of the Economy and Morals in Unity at the heart of our business management. We have formulated the following Code of Conduct Statement to serve as a compass for the realization of our management philosophy as well as Duskin Code of Conduct to define concrete standards of conduct for our business operations.
Constructive dialogue with shareholders
Basic policy
Duskin actively engages in Investor Relations (IR) and Stakeholder Relations (SR) activities with the objectives of gaining trust and appropriate evaluations of our management and achieving sustainable growth and improvement of corporate value over the medium- and long-term. When a request for an individual meeting or dialogue is made by any of our shareholders, individual investors or institutional investors, our senior management and Directors will respond to such request, to the extent reasonable.
We strive for disclosure of management information which is deemed useful for investment decisions by shareholders and investors in a timely, appropriate and fair manner. We are also committed to creating an environment that facilitates dialogues with shareholders and investors, thereby gaining trust in capital markets.
System for IR and SR activities
At Duskin, an Operating Officer in charge of IR and SR is appointed, and the Chief of IR Section, Corporate Planning Department is in charge of IR administration. Under their supervision, the IR Section conducts IR and SR activities. The IR Section Chief, besides attending important internal meetings of Duskin, views internal approval documents as needed and collects necessary information by closely cooperating with the relevant departments. Requests for meetings with our senior management and Directors will be handled based on reasonable judgments made by the IR Section Chief in accordance with the basic policy.
Information, evaluation and opinions gained through IR and SR activities are reported at meetings of the Board of Directors twice each year. In addition, reports as deemed necessary are made by the IR Section to an Operating Officer in charge, then from the Operating Officer to the Board of Directors to reflect this information in the management.
Dialogues with institutional investors and analysts (including shareholders)
Duskin holds financial results briefings twice every year (at the end of second quarter and the fiscal year end) for institutional investors and analysts. The President & CEO explains our financial data, the outline and progress of our Medium-Term Management Policy and other matters in an easy-to-understand manner using graphics and charts. Individual meetings with institutional investors and analysts are held as requested.
Dialogues with individual investors (including shareholders)
Duskin holds company briefings targeting individual investors in cooperation with securities firms’ branch offices around Japan and IR support companies. In principle, the IR Section Chief explains Duskin’s ongoing businesses and business models, current situation and other matters in an easy-to-understand manner using graphics and charts.
Duskin participates in various IR-related events, taking opportunities to have direct dialogues with individual investors and shareholders. The IR Section members give briefings on the company information while collecting the opinions of individual investors and shareholders through questionnaires and by other means.
In addition, fan meetings and other events are held to help individual investors and analysts deepen their understanding of our business strategies. We have established a system to ensure that their opinions and requests are reflected in our business management.
We strive to improve our website with content that is useful for individual investors and shareholders to make investment decisions. Included in the website are summaries of financial results, business highlights, management strategies and materials presented at IR briefings, our business environment, initiatives for safety and compliance, corporate news and topics.
In FY2017, Duskin held company briefings targeting individual investors eleven times with 1,100 participants. We also had a booth at the Nikkei IR Investment Fair and TSE IR Festa with 2,300 visitors. Mister Donut held Fan Meetings twelve times with 700 participants.

Risk Management
The Duskin corporate group has a proactive approach to risk management by assessing all possible risks that the group may encounter in order to avoid these problems or minimize losses and damage if a problem occurs.
Compliance
At Duskin, “compliance” means we are committed to “complying with what is expected to meet others’ wishes.” Everyone at Duskin Group upholds the Duskin Code of Conduct in all daily business activities to consistently respond to what is expected of all Duskin staff members by society and consumers.
Risk management structure
Duskin has formulated Basic Rules on Risk Management that stipulate how risk is to be managed in the Duskin corporate group. In accordance with these rules, there is a risk management department and a supervisor of the department.
At our subsidiaries, we name a risk management supervisor at each company in accordance with its size, types of business activities, and other characteristics. We conduct risk management in a consolidated, comprehensive manner.
To preside over the operation and administration of risk management, a secretariat office is established under the Risk Management section of the Quality Assurance and Risk Management Department. When a problem occurs, risk management departments work in concert with this secretariat office to implement countermeasures.
Risk Management Committee
Duskin has a Risk Management Committee, as an advisory council for the Board of Directors. Its purpose is to establish risk management policies by assessing any possible risks that Duskin Group may encounter in order to avoid these problems or minimize losses and damage if a problem occurs.
The committee held three meetings in FY2017 to discuss its risk management annual plan, causes and measures for risk factors, measures for natural disaster preparedness, and corporate group risk management programs, and the committee submitted reports. The Risk Management Committee also reviewed actions to take if the head office is affected by a disaster.
Risk assessments
Each department identifies the risks that are specific to its responsibilities and analyzes their significance. Then, response measures for each presumed risk factor are formulated.
Every year, risk management departments and the secretariat office review and evaluate countermeasures and their effectiveness. With the feedback of these reviews and evaluations, all departments examine and enhances their countermeasures. Each department identifies new possible risks based on the information on revisions of laws and regulations, case studies at other companies, and any crisis that occurred at Duskin. Each department formulates and implements its own risk management programs.
Crisis situation framework
When damage results from a crisis or natural disaster or an earthquake with an intensity of at least 5-plus occurs, the risk management supervisors for each function at Duskin Group gather information and submit a report to the secretariat office. Information about damage caused by other natural disasters is gathered immediately after the occurrence.
If there is a significant natural disaster, the President & CEO decides whether or not to establish a response office, and, if an office is established, names a general manager. For risk factors that will significantly impact the Duskin corporate group, the chairperson of the Risk Management Committee decides whether or not to establish a response office, and, if an office is established, names a general manager.
Compliance Committee
Duskin Group has a Compliance Committee for the purpose of establishing, disseminating and implementing a compliance framework. This committee is led by the Operating Officer in charge of our legal and compliance functions, and also includes other Operating Officers, our Outside Directors, attorneys-at-law, our Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and the Chairman of our Labor Union Committee. The Compliance Committee reviews key compliance-based issues as well as annual plans and education and training plans that apply to compliance. The committee, as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, also conducts activities related to compliance at Duskin. During FY2017, the committee held four meetings to discuss compliance structures, regulations, annual plans, training programs and internal reporting systems, and made reports.
Commitment to compliance
Position-specific training
As part of its efforts to ensure that its members are aware of and enforce the Duskin Code of Conduct, Duskin Group holds compliance training sessions every year for all of its Directors and employees.
FY2017 training sessions were highlighted by a lecture by a well-known attorney at law, Mr. Shigeru Nakajima, Nakajima Transactional Law Office. A case study training session was also conducted with the goal of helping our employees develop their ethical judgment skills.
Day of Resolve
May 31 is the Duskin Group’s Day of Resolve. On May 31, 2002, Duskin was issued an order of partial business suspension by the Osaka Prefecture Government due to a violation of the Food Sanitation Act. Every year on May 31, lectures by outside experts are conducted to help all Duskin employees reflect on the Large Meat Dumpling incident*. All employees write messages pledging compliance to consumers and society. Employees who do not know about the incident are encouraged to listen to senior employees. By recalling the incident, Duskin reminds all employees of the importance of compliance with regulations. This is our responsibility to society. We pledge our resolve and reaffirm the determination to do right by building upon our solid compliance structure.
* Large Meat Dumpling incident: An unauthorized food additive in Japan was used for the Large Meat Dumplings sold at Mister Donut. While Duskin discovered this problem at the early stage of the incident, the use of this food additive was not disclosed to the public until inquiries were made by the media. This resulted in severe social criticism.
Insider information management
Duskin has formulated Rules on Insider Information Management and the Detailed Rules on Insider Information. All important information is gathered and controlled at the IR Section, which is responsible for the handling of information. We disclose our information based on the belief that the timely and appropriate disclosure of corporate information to investors is the basis of a sound securities market. We are committed to ensuring the fairness and soundness of the securities market. The IR Section organizes training and educational programs for Directors and employees of Duskin and its affiliated companies to help them deepen their understanding of the importance of information management and the prevention of insider trading, in accordance with the Rules on Insider Information Management.
Whistleblowing
In line with the intent of the Whistleblower Protection Act of Japan, Duskin operates Compliance Hotlines that make it possible to report occurrences directly to our Legal and Compliance Department and to an external law firm. By having mechanisms in place that keep an eye out for legal infractions, unethical conduct including bribery and corruption, and internal impropriety, we seek to foster a sound and highly transparent corporate climate.
We allow anonymous reporting, protect the privacy of whistleblowers, and ensure there are no negative consequences of submitting a report. Complaints related to human rights violations are processed by independent arbitrators.
FY2017 hotline users: internal 22, external 9
         On-site response office was established immediately after Kumamoto earthquakes in 2016
Information security
Duskin engages in measures to prevent information-centered accidents such as illegal access, loss, destruction, tampering and leakage. These measures include classifying the management level of information employees come into contact with in the course of business into multiple stages, and establishing limits on storage methods and access privileges.
With regard to the handling of personal information, we set forth a Personal Information Protection Policy and make efforts to ensure that all of our employees are aware of this policy and enforce it. We have established a management framework with a supervisor at each department responsible for personal information protection. The framework is compliant with the requirements of personal information protection management systems, and we strictly administer rules on the management of this information.

Duskin established medium-term environmental targets for three years from FY2018 to FY2020. These medium-term environmental targets, focusing on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, are set to achieve the goals of our long-term environmental vision for 2030. Under the Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 in 2015, each party has nationally determined contributions (NDC) to reduce emissions. Japan’s NDC goal is a 26% reduction of the 2013 level by 2030. Duskin Group has established our reduction goal as high as, or higher than the national goal to fulfill our responsibility. GHG Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions) make up the majority of Duskin emissions. From FY2018 onward, Duskin is working on accounting and reporting the Scope 3 emissions with a goal to reduce CO2 emissions across our supply chain.

Mister Donut reviews production schedules and executes controls by using a disposal checklist to curtail the maximum desired number of donuts to be discarded.
As of March 31, 2018, at 424 shops (approx. 39% of the whole system) in Kanto and Tokai areas, unsold donuts are reprocessed in processing plants into animal feed as part of our recycling efforts.
In FY2018, Food Group plans to recycle food waste in Kinki area.

Duskin’s rental system gives us an advantage by effectively managing the environmental impact in all processes involved in product lifecycle. We encourage eco-conscious business operations throughout all phases of the product lifecycle, from product development to reuse, recycling and disposal after use.


In order to ensure that all our products and services are safe and reliable, Duskin’s quality assurance framework works from development to after launch. Our Product Inspection department acts as an outside independent group to conduct assessments, inspections and to monitor the quality of all products. The Quality Assurance Control department is responsible for checking the safety of products and raw materials, the development of a quality assurance system and management of its operations.
During the development phase, the safety and reliability of products and services are objectively reviewed, prior to launch, at the development meetings. For the development of new food products and services and their specification changes, internal rules require we ensure safety at a meeting of the Safety Council.
Following a launch, we maintain our established levels of quality by conducting regular and spot quality checks on products in distribution.

For the food processing plants our Food Group contracts for processing raw materials or products, the Quality Assurance & Risk Management team conducts inspections of new contractors before transactions, inspection of their production operation and periodic inspections of all contractors.
Our inspection specialists for food processing plants conduct comprehensive quality inspections with more than 400 items on our checklist for facility management, process management, sanitary management and production management. All plants are evaluated and ranked by the results of inspections, product specifications and characteristics, evaluation of aging equipment/facilities and complaints. Periodic inspections are conducted regularly (one to three years) depending on the plants’ rankings.


Palm oil is extracted from the fruit of the oil palm. There have been worldwide concerns about the oil palm plantation which could lead to destruction of rain forests. Duskin works with our partner suppliers to ensure responsible procurement of such materials.
In November 2017, Duskin, along with our trading company and manufacturer, inspected a palm plantation and oil mill and conducted a regular auditing at oil manufacturing plants in Johor, Malaysia.

Human resource development
Duskin organizes a variety of educational and training opportunities in order to develop understanding of our management philosophy, Prayerful Management, which guides all the employees. To enable each of our employees to effectively fulfill their designated role with enhanced knowledge and skills, Duskin offers rank-specific training for new and existing employees. We also focus on the development of Area Managers who support and lead franchisees. Furthermore, we place value on individual self-development and encourage employees to acquire official certifications and take additional coursework outside the company.
In FY2017, a total of 15,431 employees participated in education and training programs to enhance their knowledge and skills.
Diversity
Duskin believes in establishing workplaces where employees respect each other, and are respected, regardless of gender, age, nationality, career, lifestyles, or any other factor so that all employees are able to exert their talents to the fullest of their potential. In this environment, we are prepared to respond to the changing business environment and to diversifying customer needs, which also enables us to increase our value and competitive advantage.
In regards to gender diversity, our goal is to make sure women are in at least 8.0% of our managerial positions.

Work-life balance
Duskin has been implementing a variety of measures to decrease long working hours and promote work-life balance.
Initiatives
● Report on the actual situation of overtime work at the Board of Directors
● Reduce long working hours in each department
● Conduct No Overtime Work Day at least once a month

Duskin was approved by Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Osaka as a specified business organization for the Project to Accept Foreigners Conducting Housekeeping Services in National Strategic Special Zones and started to hire non-Japanese women for service positions.
Those employees started serving customers after completing our service attitudes and skills training programs. We are committed to providing opportunities for women: for those entering the workforce from overseas, and for professional women whose lives are made easier by hiring our expert cleaning services.

Clean Up My Town is a Duskin-sponsored nationwide initiative to pick up trash at local event sites, following our environmental commitment statement, Sowing the Seeds of Ecological Responsibility for the Future. This cleaning campaign, initiated in 2006, has attracted a total of 290,000 participants.
In 2017, a volunteer cleaning activity at a World Heritage site began. Children who joined in the cleaning enjoyed the opportunity to learn the significance of maintaining cleanliness at a World Heritage site.

Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness on-site classroom
Our Sow the Seeds of Cleanliness Classroom, started in 2012, is an on-site lesson targeted at elementary school children. In a 45-minute lesson, we help children learn what dust and dirt are, discuss why cleaning is necessary, and demonstrate the correct use of dust cloths, brooms and other cleaning tools. This program was held at 1,988 schools nationwide for a total of 176,624 children educated as of March 2018.
For our next step, we will develop a new classroom program of school cleaning procedure and convey the importance of cleaning to children in local communities.

The Duskin AINOWA Foundation
The Duskin AINOWA Foundation was founded in 1981, the year the United Nations designated as the International Year of the Disabled. Currently, the Foundation has approximately 189,000 members. At the shops and restaurants of our Food Group, Duskin AINOWA membership leaflets and donation boxes are placed by the cashier to encourage greater participation in our activities.
The Foundation has been conducting two major programs. One is a program that enables people with disabilities to study abroad. This program provides opportunities for leaders who wish to develop skills to contribute more to their local communities. For 37 years since its founding, a total of 504 trainees have studied abroad.

Business and financial conditions
Duskin Group consists of Duskin, its 34 subsidiaries and three affiliated companies. Clean & Care Group (renamed Direct Selling Group on April 1, 2018) is engaged mainly in the rental of dust control products, and Food Group’s main business is Mister Donut. Along with these activities, we also operate related businesses mainly through franchise networks.
Business overview
In the final year of Medium-Term Management Policy 2015 that is the first phase of the long-term strategy ONE DUSKIN, Duskin focused on achieving a recovery in sales to return Duskin Group to a growth track.
Clean & Care Group focused on reinforcing customer contacts and on providing products for simple and efficient cleaning as customer needs grow along with the increasing number of working couples and senior households. The group also continued its efforts to enhance cleaning and technical services for which customer demand is increasing considerably. Food Group was committed to reestablishing the Mister Donut brand with the slogan “Something good’s gonna happen. Mister Donut” and to developing other food businesses. Duskin introduced a share-based-remuneration system for Directors as an incentive to enhance corporate value and started using the Operating Officer System in FY2018 to strengthen corporate governance.
Analysis of business results
Clean & Care Group posted higher sales but Food Group sales continued to decline. Despite lower sales, consolidated operating profit, consolidated ordinary profit and profit attributable to
owners of parent increased. The main reasons were a decrease in the cost of sales due to lower investments in Style Cleaner (an electrically powered dust cleaner placed on the floor) and lower expenses for depreciation and retirement benefits.
1. Sales
Although sales of dust control products, the core category of this segment, remained the same as in the previous year, Clean & Care Group recorded higher sales. This is because other businesses including Rent-All, which rents household items and equipment for various events, continued to perform well. In Food Group, sales of Mister Donut decreased because of the smaller number of locations due to closures of underperforming shops. Don Co., Ltd., a consolidated subsidiary operating a seafood donburi chain, was sold to Fujio Food System Co., Ltd., with all shares transferred in the previous fiscal year. As a result, Food Group posted lower sales. Sales of other businesses were higher than one year earlier. This is because Big Apple Worldwide Holdings Sdn. Bhd., the largest donut chain in Malaysia, which Duskin acquired and made a subsidiary during FY2016, contributed to sales.
As a result, consolidated sales were 161,031 million yen, an 849 million yen (0.5%) decrease from the previous year.
2. Operating profit (cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses)
Cost of sales was 87,808 million yen, a 1,395 million yen (1.6%) decrease from the previous year. This is mainly attributable to lower investments in Style Cleaner and the improved cost ratio at Food Group. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 65,664 million yen, a 941 million yen (1.4%) decrease from the previous year. This is mainly attributable to lower expenses for depreciation and retirement benefits. Promotional expenses increased because Duskin placed newspaper advertisements in 51 newspapers in March to raise brand awareness and increase sales.
As a result, consolidated operating profit was 7,557 million yen, a 1,488 million yen (24.5%) increase from the previous year.
3. Ordinary profit (non-operating income and expenses)
There were no significant increases or decreases from the previous year in non-operating income. The main changes were a 63 million yen decrease in interest income, a 67 million yen decrease in cancellation penalty and a 60 million yen decrease in commission for purchase of treasury shares. As a result, consolidated ordinary profit was 8,978 million yen, a 1,423 million yen (18.8%) increase from the previous year.
4. Profit attributable to owners of parent (extraordinary income and losses)
Special loss increased by 120 million yen. This is mainly attributable to a decrease in gain on sales of securities while impairment loss and loss on disaster decreased. Profit before income taxes totaled 7,913 million yen, a 1,303 million yen (19.7%) increase, resulting in an increase in tax expenses. As a result, profit attributable to owners of parent was 5,324 million yen, a 1,006 million yen (23.3%) increase from the previous year.
Analysis of financial position
Current assets
As of March 31, 2018, current assets amounted to 69,434 million yen, a 7,413 million yen increase compared to the end of the previous fiscal year. This is mainly attributable to a 2,353 million yen decrease in cash and deposits, an 8,443 million yen increase in short-term marketable securities, and an 819 million yen increase in other resulting from an increase in accounts receivable-other.

  Accomplishments Acknowledged by Society
Third-Party Opinion
 Duskin continues efforts to address various issues from the perspectives of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. These efforts have been recognized and awarded by Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) rating agencies and external organizations.
I have reviewed Duskin Corporate Report 2018 with an understanding that Duskin intends to report its financial information such as Duskin’s management strategies and business performance, and non-financial information such as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues in a simplified and integrated manner. I focused on how ESG initiatives contribute to creating corporate value as Duskin works towards the goal of Medium-Term Management Policy 2018. During this year, Duskin reorganized its Direct Selling Group. I believe this is intended to build a new customer-oriented business model. Undoubtedly, the key for success is securing, developing and revitalizing franchisees and staff members who provide direct selling and technical services. From this view point, it was meaningful that this issue focused on the non-financial topics of sustainable franchise model and human resource development. At the same time, I would have liked to learn more about the strength of Duskin’s franchise package and how Duskin strategizes staffing based on its experience of hiring non-Japanese nationals.
As to the food businesses, where Duskin is undertaking various new initiatives, it is noteworthy that Duskin frankly included “enhanced product appeal/variety at convenience and sweet snack stores” and “emerging coffee store chains” as threats in its SWOT analysis. This report states that material selection and quality control are strictly maintained for health-oriented and safety-focused product development. In this sense, there is room left for measures for supply chain and container and package issues.
I have also recognized anew that Duskin’s food businesses have more locations outside Japan than inside Japan, yet, I found information on overseas business activities limited. I would expect significant enhancement of information disclosure on overseas businesses in the next issue. Above all other pages in this issue, the Outside Director’s Message (pages 55 and 56) drew my special attention. In Japan, focus is often placed only on the ratio of outside directors and gender balance. Expertise required for outside directors and their roles in the board of directors have been more actively discussed in other developed countries. Duskin has an Outside Director with expertise to fulfill the role of monitoring the businesses from the perspective of customers and consumers. This Director assumed her position three years ago. I was impressed with Duskin’s proactive approach. I hope Duskin will continue to nurture its corporate culture with high sensitivity to all shareholders’ and stakeholders’ interests, and achieve the goals of structural reform and overseas business expansion.

With this encouragement, we will continue to further enhance our initiatives in these fields.
With regards to the strength of Duskin’s franchise package, staffing strategy, measures for supply chain and overseas business activities, we sincerely appreciate his precisely pointing out our challenges. In accordance with his recommendations, we will work on specific measures and information disclosure. Through steadily implementing initiatives set by the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018, the second phase of our long-term strategy, we will improve our corporate value and contribute to the development of a sustainable society.

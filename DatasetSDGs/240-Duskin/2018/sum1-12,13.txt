CO2 reduction
Duskin established medium-term environmental targets for three years from FY2018 to FY2020. These medium-term environmental targets, focusing on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, are set to achieve the goals of our long-term environmental vision for 2030. Under the Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 in 2015, each party has nationally determined contributions (NDC) to reduce emissions. Japan’s NDC goal is a 26% reduction of the 2013 level by 2030. Duskin Group has established our reduction goal as high as, or higher than the national goal to fulfill our responsibility. GHG Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions) make up the majority of Duskin emissions. From FY2018 onward, Duskin is working on accounting and reporting the Scope 3 emissions with a goal to reduce CO2 emissions across our supply chain.

Mister Donut reviews production schedules and executes controls by using a disposal checklist to curtail the maximum desired number of donuts to be discarded.
As of March 31, 2018, at 424 shops (approx. 39% of the whole system) in Kanto and Tokai areas, unsold donuts are reprocessed in processing plants into animal feed as part of our recycling efforts.
In FY2018, Food Group plans to recycle food waste in Kinki area.

Duskin’s rental system gives us an advantage by effectively managing the environmental impact in all processes involved in product lifecycle.

Seiichi Suzuki was born in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture in 1911. He suffered from pleurisy after starting work. He joined the Konko Church after being cured, sustained by the great love of his foster mother. He joined Ittoen in 1938. In 1944 he established Kentoku Company. From that time onward, Suzuki followed his principle of Prayerful Management, his purpose being to integrate moral and business goals in both his own and his company’s business practices. He founded Duskin in 1963. Suzuki then established a groundbreaking distribution channel while expanding the cleaning tools rental business nationwide through a franchise system. He started diversified business development including Mister Donut in 1971. He led the Duskin Group as it paved the way to a multi-franchise business enterprise. Seiichi Suzuki passed away in 1980 at the age of 68.

Duskin strives to unify business and morals.
Praying for happiness is the starting point of all of our corporate activity.
We love our fellow human beings and work to bring out the best in them.
Through our work, we help people develop.
We continuously train and encourage our employees to take the responsibility to ask the simple question:
“May I help you?” with sincerity.
Our goal is to be the best in the world.
Duskin sows the seeds of joy.
Profit is a barometer of how happy our customers are.
Our founder’s philosophy lives on.
Based on our founder’s philosophy, which lives on to this day, attentive care for our customers is our ultimate focus. His life principles are reflected in our management philosophy called Prayerful Management. All of our employees incorporate his philosophy of sharing joy and doing our best in all that we do in everyday life.
About Ittoen Chitoku training
Duskin’s management, which unifies business and morals, arose out of founder Seiichi Suzuki’s encounter with Ittoen, a self-discipline training community in Kyoto, and his experiences there. Duskin’s new employees as well as franchise owners and Division Managers are required to participate in training sessions (two nights, three days) designed to educate them in Prayerful Management through their own hands-on experience.
 Profit is the reward of joyous transactions
Duskin’s founder, Seiichi Suzuki believed that profit is the reward of joyous transactions, working energetically to that end. He wished that everyone who took part in Duskin’s work would be happy. Home Duskin, a modern, specially treated cloth, marked the beginning of a new way of dusting without water. Introducing this method was a big step toward realizing our founder’s wishes. People called it the magic dust cloth — and it brought innovative cleaning techniques to homes across Japan.
Franchising to achieve our business philosophy
Duskin launched its franchising system with the hope that it would provide opportunities to make dust control into a successful business for people aligned with our philosophy of Prayerful Management. We think of franchising as a system for franchisor and franchisees to share in each other’s fortunes and realize growth.

Franchise system to sow the seeds of joy
    Duskin has a unique franchise network in which the franchisor and franchisees share the same interests and are united by the same management philosophy of Prayerful Management. At Duskin, we believe the franchising system enriches us spiritually and materially, as we support each other and continue to grow together. The franchisor and franchisees also share the goal of achieving a society where customers can lead a happy and peaceful life. This has been and will be Duskin’s greatest strength.

Profit attributable to owners of parent for the fiscal year under review decreased 2,769 million yen, or 49.5%, from the previous fiscal year to 2,821 million yen. In addition to the decrease in operating profit, this was attributable to a decrease in the gain on sales of investment securities as well as to the distribution of 1,658 million yen in COVID-19 relief money to franchisees seriously affected by the impact of the pandemic so that they could maintain their employment.
Note: From the fiscal year ended March 2016, Duskin started using Revised Accounting
Standard for Business Combinations (ASBJ Statement No. 21, September 13, 2013) and net income is reported as profit attributable to owners of parent.

Gross profit decreased due to a decline in sales in the Direct Selling Group, as well as factors such as 1,137 million yen paid to replace the showcases at Mister Donut cafeteria-style shops and expenses for advertising measures implemented in the fourth quarter to increase the recognition of Duskin as a company Creating Healthy Environments.

In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, despite the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw significantly greater demand for our package service for cleaning and disinfection and the residential air conditioner cleaning service because people were more aware of personal hygiene and stayed home longer. This has helped us steadily increase new franchisees. We will continue to work hard to recruit more franchisees, expecting that demand for outsourced housework and cleaning services will steadily grow.

With our focus on continuously generating stable cash dividends while securing the internal capital resources required for sound business management, we have decided that the full-year dividend for fiscal 2021 should be 40 yen per share.
Note: The dividend for the fiscal year ended March 2014 includes a 20 yen 50th anniversary commemorative dividend, and the dividend for the fiscal year ended March 2019 includes a 10 yen 55th anniversary commemorative dividend.

 Number Rate
Since many customers are women, Duskin is aware of the importance of supplying products and services that are attractive, convenient and comfortable from the perspective of women. The rate of female employees in managerial positions has been rising steadily and reached 9.0% in FY2021. Duskin will remain committed to empowering women.
2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Duskin considers reducing working hours as one of its highest priorities.
After setting annual working hours per employee at no more than 1,800, data related to long working hours is reported periodically to the Board of Directors. Duskin has been implementing many initiatives, including encouraging employees to take 60% or more of paid annual leave, a No Overtime Work Day at least once every month and continued implementation of telework. A staggered work hour system is also in place to allow employees to work more flexibly.

Direct Selling Group Food Group Other Businesses
The franchise system is a source of value creation for Duskin. Customer-level
sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, declined 18.0 billion yen from the previous fiscal year primarily because Direct Selling Group businesses were strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Food Group reported an increase in customer-level sales for the entire fiscal year. Although the figures markedly decreased for Mister Donut in the first half of FY2020 as the government declared a state of emergency, the performance in the second half was higher than that of the same period a year ago.
Note 1: Customer-level sales are presented as a reference and represent the total of sales at company-owned and subsidiary locations and the estimated sales at franchised locations.
Note 2: Sales of overseas affiliated companies which are included in Other Businesses are sales from January to December in the previous year.

Overview
Duskin’s Value Creation Process (Commentary)
Overview
Materiality
We assess the SDGs and other social issues in the context of Duskin Group’s value chain and business model, and review our assessments to reflect social changes.
Process to Identify Materiality
First, we have categorized and analyzed external conditions in the four areas of politics, economy, society and technology. Then, we have identified risks and opportunities from the perspectives of different stakeholders, namely, customers, franchisees, local communities, suppliers, employees, the global environment, and shareholders.
Actions to address the identified risks and opportunities have been defined as material issues for Duskin. We have established specific activities and key performance indicators (KPIs) for them with value creation and the SDGs taken into account.
    Human Capital
Duskin believes in establishing workplaces where employees respect each other, and are respected, regardless of gender, age, nationality, career, lifestyles, or any other factors, thus empowering all employees to exert their talents to the fullest of their potential. In this environment, we are prepared to respond to the changing business environment and to diversifying customer needs, which also enables us to increase our value and competitive advantage.
We are dedicated to educating and nurturing human resources at the three educational facilities of the Seishinkan Guesthouse, Duskin School and Mister Donut College.
Social Capital
We focus on training and education of franchisee personnel, as our goal is to help customers live in comfort and with peace of mind through our products and services. These services are delivered by our franchisees via our nationwide franchise network, comprising 7,353 sales offices as well as 45 production and logistic facilities. As many of the owners run their businesses in the communities and markets where they and their staff members were born and raised, they know and understand the specific needs and attributes of each local market.
To be the best service provider in their community, Duskin service staff members must acquire the skill sets needed for supplying quality service. They also play a major role in making their offices as places to sow the seeds of joy throughout their community.
Financial Capital
A solid financial foundation and sufficient cash flow have been attained by operating the businesses in ways that continue to generate sound profit. During FY2020, net assets stood at 145.8 billion yen and free cash flow amounted to 5.0 billion yen.
This stable cash flow serves as a source for cultivating new business opportunities as well as a financial reserve for our business activities in times of crisis, such as natural disasters. Ultimately, these financial resources support and assist Duskin in our endeavors to create value for stakeholders. Going forward, we will maintain this sound financial structure and continue generating cash flow that fuels investments for growth and profit returns.
Collaborative value creation with stakeholders
Manufacturing Capital
Duskin plants and contracted plants that provide one-of-akind products and services are capital of indispensable importance. Manufacturing plants in Japan consist of three sites for the Direct Selling Group and two sites for the Food Group. For the contracted manufacturing plants that process products and raw materials, we conduct periodic inspections, and constantly strives to make improvements and enhancements to quality.
In addition, our specialists for food processing plants conduct extensive quality inspections, covering facility management, process management, hygiene management and production management. This wide range of items on our checklist forms the basis of our evaluations, and leads to guidance for improvements.
Intellectual Capital
At Duskin, we place value on earning the trust and faith of customers, and treat the “researching the science of clean” as a mission critical to performing our role as a member of society. Based on our core technology cultivated through the development of dust control products, we offer an array of products that possess multiple functions, and aim to contribute to the field of creating healthy environments.
As of the end of FY2020, we held 143 patents in Japan and four outside of Japan. We hold patents in our core technology that is the source of our competitive capabilities, such as product forming technology, know-how and other ideas. In the previous fiscal year we invested 0.63 billion yen in R&D.
Natural Capital
Duskin has commercialized and grown an eco-friendly recycling-oriented business based on the rental of cleaning and hygiene products. We proactively take on initiatives to preserve the environment in a number of business fields, including food processing.
We always carefully consider the impacts on society and the environment at every stage of our business flows — from raw material procurement to product manufacturing, processing, delivery, the consumption and use of products by our customers and the collection and recycling of used products. Our focus is to develop safe and reliable products and services that help to reduce our burden on the environment. Moreover, our businesses pay close attention to recycling products and materials so as to extract as much value as possible from these limited resources.
Materiality Review
Even amid profound changes in the environment surrounding Duskin, we remain eager to pursue higher corporate value. We move forward with the concept of CSV (Creating Shared Value) to resolve economic, social and environmental issues through our business activities, and boost governance in ways that drive our creation of economic value, social value and environmental value at the same time. To this end, we have reviewed our material issues which had a strong component of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and evolved the issues into the ones that aim to create shared value (CSV), while also taking into account our contribution to SDGs. The updated material issues were decided after deliberation by the Sustainability Committee.

Overview
A Message from the President
  Teruji Yamamura
President and CEO
With the goal of being the most attentive service provider in the world, we continue on our course of growth as a company that prides itself on considering the needs of others and bringing people joy.
 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the public is now much more aware of the need for proper cleanliness, which has meant that demand for hygiene management and associated measures to combat the virus has intensified dramatically. Making the shift to leader in hygiene, health and cleanliness, Duskin has now made it clear that we are assisting our customers to perfect their hygiene environment through our high-quality products and services, which have been developed over our many years in the business. Based on our new Medium-Term Management Policy, we have implemented a host of reforms in response to the needs of the changing times, boosting our governance to achieve a multiplier effect of economic, social and environmental value — all with a view to achieving sustainable growth.
A look back at fiscal 2020 and current circumstances
Fiscal 2020 (year ended March 31, 2021) marked the final year of our Medium-Term Management Policy 2018, Phase 2 of our long-term strategy ONE DUSKIN. Developing the model we created in Phase 1, we have drawn up a plan designed to engender further growth. However, the coronavirus pandemic has greatly impacted our business since the third quarter of fiscal 2019. In order to fulfill our biggest responsibility, which is to maintain our franchise system, we have focused on sales recovery strategies while at the same time assigning priority to the safety of our customers, franchisees and employees. Still we were below our targets due to the pandemic. Though we did not reach our numerical goals, we believe that the policies we implemented last fiscal year form the foundations of growth for Phase 3. During the current fiscal year, we were slated to announce a new Medium-Term Management Policy starting in this fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, but due to uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic, we have had to postpone our plans. We will be publicizing our new policy, including numerical goals, as soon as it becomes feasible.
Fiscal 2020 marked a year where all of our group businesses were heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. During the first half in particular, we were plagued by problems with customers who were forced to close store locations during the State of Emergency Declaration, and further by the cancellation or postponement of numerous events. This led to a dramatic decline in sales for the Direct Selling Group’s dust control products and our Rent-All business. Though our performance fell on the previous year, at the same time the pandemic ushered in greater awareness of cleanliness and hygiene as well as a higher percentage of time spent at home. These factors led to a large increase in demand for a hygiene service package combining professional cleaning and technical services, as well as home air conditioner cleaning services. Sales of antibacterial mats and alcohol sanitizers as well as air purifiers climbed. Under the next Medium-Term Management Policy, our plan is to further boost these kinds of cleaning and hygiene products.
In the Food Group, Mister Donut, which had recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, was heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic during the first half of the year. During the second half, however, demand grew for takeout, and our MISDO Meets, a series of menu items jointly developed in recent years with other companies, received high marks. The result was an increase in total customer-level sales for the full year of 1.1% over the previous year. Led by the increase in sales for Mister Donut, sales for the Food Group saw an increase of 0.8% over the previous year.
Duskin’s role and vision for the future
Leading the way in creating clean and healthy environments
In light of the coronavirus pandemic that began last year, we have devised a framework for creating clean and healthy environments on a daily basis on all fronts. We have announced a major policy shift, from a cleaning company to one that creates clean and healthy environments. By letting potential customers know that Duskin’s products and services are there to help them create clean and healthy environments, it is our hope that we will reach a different customer base than before.

A Message from the President
   Management Philosophy
Prayerful Management
We aim to unite all Duskin businesses so as to serve our customers in the most effective and courteous manner.
ESG initiatives to achieve long-term growth
Doing our part for decarbonization
With a view to going carbon neutral by 2050, the Japanese government has set a goal of a 46% reduction of CO2 emissions in 2013 by 2030 — an indication of a greater focus on corporate decarbonization. Our business is based on a recycling business model where rental mops and mats are washed and reused. As we continue to bolster our ESG initiatives, we boost corporate value, which in turn leads to business growth.
One environmental initiative that we are considering is to replace the numerous vehicles used for rentals, sales and technical services around the country with electric vehicles. In addition, by optimizing delivery routes, one approach may be to reduce the number of vehicles deployed while maintaining sales. In order to gain understanding from our franchisees, these initiatives must be implemented gradually, but meanwhile we need to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) as we gradually make the shift.
Human resource development by taking up challenges
A long-term initiative to address the “S” in the “ESGs” — which refers to human resources or “social” — is to extend the re-employment age to 70 years. At present, the regular retirement age is through 60, and re-employment is an option through the age of 65. We are currently planning to change the former to 65 and the latter to age 70 over the next 10 years. In April 2021, to improve the efficiency of our operations, we launched our Shared Services Center, which integrates the administrative aspect of our businesses in one department. Along with streamlining corporate administration over the next three years, we are slated to re-organize our organizational systems.
As of next April, we will be adopting a new human resource system, under which talented employees can continue to get promoted and move into management–even skipping several ranks on merit. Due to recent trends such as double-income couples and the need for in-home care for family members, we are seeing a growing number of employees who do not want to be transferred. To meet these changing needs of the times, our plan is to build flexibility into our human resource systems and work options, and welcome a diverse array of personnel.
Our ideal employee is capable of thinking and taking action on their own. While speaking one’s mind can certainly cause rifts between people, innovation does not tend to come about when everyone simply agrees. Our founder believed that fearing failure and not taking action is worse than trying hard but not succeeding. I myself have faced many circumstances where things did not go well, but because I am not afraid of failure and was determined to achieve my goals, I chalked these failures up to experience, simply deciding that a particular method did not work. I would then apply what I learned to the next challenge.
Over the course of the 58 years since Duskin was established, we have been engaged in approximately 200 business projects, only about 14 of which have continued through the present time. When broken down into percentages, this is merely 5% to 10%. Conversely, this amounts to a 90%-plus failure rate yielding our current success, which is the reason we believe trial and error helps employees to develop.
Decision-making for the public good
Lastly, on governance, we revised our Operating Officer System three years ago, at which time we added a system where we hold strategic deliberations on different themes each time to the customary decision-making process by the Board of Directors. Dynamic deliberations have ensued, due in large part to the role of Outside Directors in these meetings. At present, we have three Outside Directors, each from different fields, two of whom are women, and our plan is to continue with this format in the future. We also have our Outside Directors share other roles besides the Board meeting, including product development meeting, information system meetings and the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee. Our Outside Directors have even come to my office, at which time I have had the opportunity to hear their very important opinions as business managers.

CORPORATE REPORT 2021 19
A one and only franchise system where franchisor and franchisees share our management philosophy
has been greatly stimulated by the coronavirus pandemic, such that even younger generations have become more sensitive to hygiene and cleanliness. For this potential new audience, instead of cleaning services, we offer to help maintain a clean and hygienic living environment, working together with the customer. To achieve our goals in this regard, we contract with third-party institutions in order to guarantee antibacterial and antiviral properties of our products. Also, we plan to generate new growth opportunities by way of joint development with research institutes and universities that can help us to further enhance the hygienic attributes of our products, as well as investment in venture companies.
As for overseas development, we have broadened our pest control services in Taiwan with a view to maintaining a growth path. In China, we are moving ahead with cleaning businesses other than dust control. Our services have earned a reputation for high quality compared to other companies. These factors, along with the fact that Japan’s hygiene standards are trusted in the Asia region, we believe that there are possibilities for expanding on our brand — Duskin as a leader in hygiene, health and cleanliness — in other countries as well as in Japan.
As for the Food Group, in addition to initiatives to increase takeout demand at Mister Donut shops, we have also implemented online ordering services as a contactless sales method. Because the Food Group had terminated an unprofitable business during the previous year, we will step up a review of our various businesses and optimize our business portfolio in order to focus investment on strategic businesses.
Division of labor between information dissemination and distribution
Amongst measures outlined in our new Medium-Term Management Policy, a particularly important one is restructuring information dissemination and distribution of products by way of digital transformation strategy. While franchise operation is considered a Duskin strength, for some customers, there was a delay in our collecting information about the products they use or they were not informed about the products and services. To resolve this issue, while sharing customer information between the franchisor and franchisees, we have changed our system such that Duskin headquarters is responsible for dissemination of information on products and services, while it is primarily our franchisees that distribute products. Through this division of labor, Duskin headquarters is able to directly assess customer needs and solve any issues.
Regardless of these changes, the management philosophy of our founder, which was to sow the seeds of joy amongst people and the greater society, remains unchanged. Indeed we are implementing various types of reform in response to the changing times for the very purpose of fulfilling our role as a company that continues to grow and serve the public.
The most trusted franchise business in the community
All business units and services join to respond to the needs of our customers

A Message from the President
  Japan’s revised Corporate Governance Code was enacted this year. The code has become stricter as more demands are made of corporate governance. Our mission as a stock market-listed company is to implement reform in accordance with our governance code, along with full disclosure. In order to be able to continuously implement transparent management, it is critical that employees are more concerned with serving society than with the benefit of the company. We believe that a company must in essence be a group of people that can decide whether or not a set of policies benefits the public or not.
Keeping ahead of changes and being good on “four sides”
The strength of our franchise chain lies in the fact that we have developed a solid relationship of trust between the franchisor and franchisees rooted in our corporate philosophy. One key role of our company is to protect our franchisees in the event of extraordinary circumstances. In this connection, in the spring of 2020, when the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became apparent, we gave relief money not only to our franchise owners but also to our Mister Donut employees, including part-time workers. The money was distributed to the recipients extremely quickly, and we received many words of thanks from our people working on-site. It is precisely because of the close relationship between Duskin headquarters and our franchisees, which share the philosophy of sowing the seeds of joy, that we were able to act promptly and precisely under these circumstances.
Our corporate philosophy of Prayerful Management perfectly fits the modern term “creating shared value” (CSV). This idea is also akin to the old-fashioned idea that if all is good with the seller, buyer and the public, then all is right on the “three sides.” Our company adds a fourth — the party that delivers our products and

services — the franchisees. This is why we talk about “good on all four sides.” At this juncture 58 years since our founding, we have a renewed sense of the fact that our company is built on a relationship of trust with our franchisees. Our franchisees have at this point in time changed hands two or three times, some within families, yet due to our solid management philosophy, the franchisor and franchisees continue to work together to carry out our destiny as a franchise.
To our stakeholders
Our new Medium-Term Management Policy is the final phase of our long-term strategy ONE DUSKIN, and we are at the point where we can now foresee the future after the strategy. Over the next three years, in accordance with the four themes of: (1) expanding existing businesses, (2) investment in new growth opportunities, (3) implementing structural reform and establishing a solid foundation and (4) coexistence with local communities, we are working to engender a multiplier effect between economic, social and environmental value as we step up our business base. The ultimate goal is to achieve sustainable growth. Although we have yet to foresee the end of the coronavirus pandemic, we at Duskin pledge to work with the localities in which we operate for not only coexistence but co-prosperity, and to help resolve economic, social and environmental issues through our safe, reliable and sustainable product and service lines. By way of this variety of means, we are dedicated to achieving a happier, more affluent life for all of our stakeholders. We deeply appreciate all of your collaboration and support for our Group, now and in the future.

Review of the Phase II of the ONE DUSKIN Long-Term Strategy
   Phase I
 Phase II
  Phase III
   FY2010 FY2011
FY2012 FY2014
   We aim to be regarded as the world’s most attentive product and service provider by our customers in every community.
To swiftly resolve the issues of people, products and services and system, we will consolidate existing businesses that had been individually developed into the following two:
 Clean Group (Dust Control business, Care Service businesses and others)
 Food Group (Mister Donut business and others) Priority issues
1. Business operations led by regional offices 2. Women’s involvement in development and
planning of products and services, business
operations and enhancement of training
3. Expanding customer contact points
4. Raising efficiency; strengthening the corporate
structure
We took the following initiatives:
 Established an organizational framework of
region-driven operations by delegating authority to regional offices which work closest to our customers. This structure enables regional offices to swiftly implement plans tailored to local characteristics.
 Increased the number of female Area Managers at regional offices, who supervise franchisees.
 Appointed more women in the product development and advertising sections.
 The Clean Group conducted cleaning demonstrations on the street and at post offices, tested online order placement and product delivery by courier service. Mister Donut introduced Baked Donuts, a new product category.
 Reallocated human resources to regional offices; reviewed operating procedures and streamlined them to improve efficiency.
There were contingencies unexpected at the time of planning, including the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011 and the associated nuclear power plant disaster as well as major changes in the situation overseas. In addition, as prices for raw materials, such as crude oil and grain, rose more than expected, we did not wait for the end of the Medium-Term Management Policy to re-extract the issues and instead proceeded to develop suitable measures and responses.
 Mister Donut entered Malaysia, and the Dust Control business expanded to South Korea.
 Sales of cleaning and technical services increased, which is largely because we were able to minimize opportunity loss by strengthening the structure to respond to the demand concentrated in short periods, such as air conditioner cleaning and year-end cleaning.
 We have introduced Baked Donuts and promoted sales of summertime donuts and donuts unique to certain local areas. However, sales were lower than in the previous year due to the impact of a drop in consumer spending.
 Sales for residential customers were at the same level as in the previous year due to the introduction of the LaLa floor mop. Sales for commercial customers, however, dipped lower than the previous year’s due to companies’ strong drive to reduce cost.
We will formulate the action plan “Commitment & Action” or the Phase I of our Long-Term Strategy ONE DUSKIN to build the foundation for the realization of the nine-yearlong strategy.
During the first three years of Phase I, we strive to recover our business performance and put it on a growth track through the following initiatives.
Basic approaches
1. Business model development: We will develop a business platform for Duskin and its franchisees to share and make the most of customer information.
2. New growth: We will focus on developing new businesses, and expand the Clean & Care and Mister Donut businesses overseas.
3. Structural reform: We will review the cost structures of production and logistics, distribution, procurement and information systems and focus on improving the profit structure.
4. Enhancement of corporate governance: In addition to our goal of fair and transparent management, we will strengthen our corporate governance as part of our growth strategy.
The first three-year phase made a foothold on achieving the ONE DUSKIN strategy.
We initiated the following:
New businesses
 Rebranded the Home Instead business into the Duskin Life Care business to strengthen services for the senior market.
 Started the Home Repair business as a new technical service.
Overseas development
Medium-Term Management Policy 2015 FY2018 FY2020

Numerical targets — consolidated sales: 169 billion yen, consolidated operating profit: 8.2 billion yen FY2020 results — consolidated sales: 153.7 billion yen, consolidated operating profit: 4.6 billion yen
Our goal in Phase II was to continue to develop the business model that we created in Phase I but was not achieved mainly due to the impact of the worsening coronavirus pandemic. Still, we were able to build the foundations for our ONE DUSKIN Long-Term Strategy in the following aspects.
We will reform and improve all aspects of our systems from product development to sales channels, so that all of our customers feel that “Duskin is empathetic, familiar and easy to access.”
    We will review all of our services to ensure our operations are seen from the customers’ perspective. These reviews are conducted jointly by the head office, which focuses on service and product development, and regional offices, which concentrate on responding to customers in each regional market.
Priority issues
1. Operational system reform: We will transform the system for delivering products and services to customers into a customer-oriented one that meets the needs of the times.
2. Corporate structure reform: To reduce costs, we will review the system from production to distribution.
3. Original and imaginative approaches to change the status quo: We anticipate the needs of our customers in each region and formulate policies.
4. New growth: We will expand the Dust Control and Mister Donut businesses overseas

Our Growth Strategies
Future Initiatives to Address Business Issues: Aiming to Enhance
Changes in the business environment and business issues
In recent years in Japan, the population is aging rapidly and there are growing concerns about labor shortages and senior care. In addition, people have become more conscious of food safety and reliability. Additionally, due to the coronavirus pandemic, hygiene and cleanliness have also been the subject of close scrutiny, a trend which has led to greater expectations for products and services that respond to a range of cleanliness and hygiene needs. Further, due to an increased number of people working at home and changes in work practices, daily life patterns have changed — in turn generating needs for digitizing a system to provide customers with information they want, as well as new distribution needs including deliveries and takeout. Taking these changes in our business environment as growth opportunities, we are moving forward with strategies that highlight the Duskin’s strengths of our franchisees, which are deeply rooted in our community, and a variety of customer touchpoints.
Remaining sensitive to changing customer needs, we continue to deliver products and services — from the perspective of information and distribution.
Future initiatives: four strategic themes
 Expanding existing businesses
Optimizing business portfolios and boosting the value chain
• Focusing investment on strategic businesses through portfolio analyses and reviews; withdrawal from unprofitable businesses

   Direct Selling Group
Leading the way in creating clean and healthy environments with a view to fine-tuning customers’ daily lives
Kazushi Sumimoto
Director and COO, Direct Selling Group
Our strategies address the needs of consumers and businesses arising in tandem with social changes. We offer solutions in the areas of hygiene management for a healthier home life; provide more sophisticated hygiene services to commercial customers and reduce their burden; make work and housework more efficient and enhance quality of life; and provide senior support. These initiatives lead to the solving of problems related to big social issues.
To implement information and distribution reform, we are optimizing digital touchpoints in response to diversifying needs by way of digital transformation, while keeping in-person contact with customers as one of Duskin’s major strengths. As such, we are building a structure that answers to all social needs.
Primary domains
 Hygiene
To improve our day-to-day life hygiene and cleaning products and services, we are expanding our hygiene product lineup as well as enhancing the antibacterial and antiviral properties of our core products such as mops and mats. In the specialized fields of hygiene, which are part of our strategy to combat infectious diseases, we bring together Duskin’s knowhow and hygiene-related products and services to offer hygiene service packages combining professional cleaning and technical services designed to meet customer needs. Further, we are engaged in development of products and services featuring sustained disinfecting properties for sterilization of living areas, elevators and more, as well as furniture and clothing surfaces.
 Work-life management
The coronavirus pandemic has brought about changes in work and lifestyles, which in turn has resulted in new needs for quality time at home, as well as greater efficiency of work and housework. The Direct Selling Group offers not only better efficiency of housework, as well as helping to create more time for the individual; we are also developing high value-added products and services to enhance both the work and home aspects of life, rather than a focus solely on allocation of time between work and off time. In this way we are striving to offer services in the area of work life management.
 Senior support
During the coronavirus pandemic, people have been restricted in spending time outside the home, as well as interacting with others, leading to growing concerns over health risks related to the elderly—including potential needs for more nursing care and progression of dementia. The Direct Selling Group, drawing on our extensive know-how in the areas of Health Rent (rental and sales of home healthcare items) and Duskin Life Care (quality home care for seniors), is further fine-tuning services for the elderly to help create an environment where they and their families can feel at ease, despite the changes brought about by the pandemic.
 The coronavirus pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the lives of consumers, as well as the actions and awareness levels of business providers in the context of their operations. Precisely because our social environment has changed rapidly, we are now responding to needs for fine-tuning, either by restoring as far as possible the pre-pandemic lifestyle of consumers and work environment, or by further incorporating newer patterns and methods.
The Direct Selling Group focuses on three separate areas in response to social needs: hygiene, work-life management and senior support. Ever since our founding, Duskin has engaged in the creation of comfortable, hygienic environments for both consumers and businesses, which means we have the comprehensive talent to provide “one-stop” packages of support meeting customer needs with our specialized know-how pertaining to hygiene and cleanliness. Building further on this strength, Duskin continues to develop its ability to create clean and healthy environments.

Primary domains and strategies
Hygiene
Facilitating awareness and understanding of our brand as a hygiene brand
Both consumers and businesses have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, both in terms of awareness levels and concrete actions, such that demand is on the rise for cleaner and more hygienic environments at home and in business operations. In response, the Direct Selling Group, believing it is our mission to provide even more assistance in this regard through our business activities, has adopted the tagline, “Creating Healthy Environments.” This tagline is a pledge to the greater society and a promise from our company. Throughout the Direct Selling Group, we deliver on our promise to forge a brand of a customer’s first choice regarding health and hygiene.

Performance and evaluation for FY2020
In the residential-use dust control product category, sales of mops, one of our primary products, dropped our sales activities to acquire new customers were very limited, especially during the first quarter, as well as unavoidable delays in replacing products for existing customers. However, along with changes in awareness and steps to prevent risk of infection amongst consumers, we have seen increased sales of antibacterial products due to increased needs for disinfection and antibacterial properties. The TuZuKu Long-lasting Disinfectant and Cleaner (a collaborative product with FUJIFILM Corporation) and our disinfectant-infused mop, one of our priority items, are among such products.
Sales of dust control products for commercial customers also declined. This is mainly because many customers temporarily closed their stores and restaurants under the guidance of municipal governments, and they cancelled or postponed replacing mats and other products during the first quarter. However, increased awareness of infection prevention has led to climbing sales for hygiene and cleanliness products such as our Clear Kukan air purifiers and Welpas Mild hand disinfectant, as well as our Sanitary Mat – Antibacterial Type product, acknowledged by third-party institutions based on scientific evidence for its disinfectant and antibacterial properties.
Market conditions and our competition
Dust control market (related to our Clean Service businesses)
Market conditions and our competition
Markets are projected to see recovery and growth, after a temporary shrink. Services for residential customers have been an expanding growth market prior to the pandemic, and this market continues to expand, getting an additional boost with needs arising out of lifestyle changes caused by the coronavirus. The market for commercial customers has temporarily shrunk due to declines in the restaurant business caused by closure and restrictions on opening hours. Meanwhile, business owners and operators have now begun to understand the need for disinfection and sterilization, leading to a rise in demand for services that help prevent infection. Though there are now more providers in both markets, we have our competitive advantage in the high quality of our services as well as our reputation for trust and reliability.
Key strategies
In order to answer to increased awareness and needs on cleanliness and hygiene associated with lifestyle changes, we are working to expand on our lineup for disinfectant, antibacterial and antiviral processing services, and become a one-stop shop of hygiene service packages combining cleaning, sterilization and antibacterial products and services.

   Duskin boasts 90% of the residential customer market share, and 50%-plus for
the commercial customer market share, in the dust control industry. Growing
coronavirus pandemic spawned changes in awareness of cleanliness and hygiene
and associated steps to prevent infection, and needs for cleanliness and hygiene
products are on the rise. As our competitors intensify their approach in the disinfection and antibacterial fields, we are bolstering our cleanliness and hygiene products, as well as our evidence-based approach on our rental mops and mats imbued with disinfecting, antibacterial and antiviral properties. We also seek to offer the benefit of our rental cycle systems that differ greatly from companies manufacturing primarily disposable items.

Senior Care Businesses
Performance and evaluation for FY2020
Our Health Rent (rental and sales of home healthcare items) business, an indispensable service in support of in-home nursing care during the coronavirus pandemic, continues to experience high demand. Both sales and the number of franchisees are on the rise.
The Duskin Life Care (support services for seniors) business has seen reduced sales due to concerns of users over potential coronavirus infection and the possibility of serious illness. However, sales are now on an upward trend because assistance for the elderly in their daily lives is an indispensable service.

In addition, needs for life assistance services falling outside Long-Term Care Insurance coverage, such as services predicting sudden health changes in the elderly and services designed to monitor people with dementia and the elderly, are projected to rise. In response to various needs that cannot be met by Long-Term Care Insurance, we offer services finely tailored to meet these needs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

In particular, our ServiceMaster professional cleaning service saw tremendous gains in our hygiene service packages (combining cleaning and sanitizing) and residential air-conditioner cleaning and its antibacterial processing service, due to greater awareness of cleanliness and hygiene during the pandemic as well as the higher percentage of time spent at home.

 New approaches to utilize information
In addition to POS data sent to Duskin headquarters and data from our partner companies, we also utilize information
posted by customers on SNS and our partner company websites. In this regard, we have two broad goals.
• Creating systems for providing information
Assessing continuously diversifying customer needs, we are creating systems designed to deliver optimal information. It is our hope to improve customer convenience by providing more accurate information than ever before.
• Improving sales forecasts
Duskin aims at reducing food loss, which is a significant issue in the restaurant industry. By building automated ordering systems in the future and by reducing time and effort spent ordering at shops and restaurants, we hope to see a rise in productivity.
Mister Donut and Other Food Businesses
Performance and evaluation for FY2020
Mister Donut saw a large decline in sales over the first half due to the coronavirus pandemic, but thanks to a series of well-received products as well as successful promotional strategies, sales increased in the second half.
Sales climbed for Bakery Factory, suburban-style large bakery shops, due to an increased number of store locations. However, as was the case with Mister Donut, sales fell for our Katsu & Katsu pork cutlet restaurants and our Pie Face specialty pie shops due to shorter hours and temporary closings caused by the pandemic.
 The past year has been a very difficult one for the domestic food industry in Japan due to the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic. In a reaction to the pandemic, we have implemented strategies assigning top priority to safety and reliability. At Mister Donut, one of our key businesses, we have developed more appealing and tastier products, accommodated an increase in demand for takeout and saw recovery in the second half. These improvements came about as a result of our relationships of trust with customers, which are based on half a century of our experience in different kinds of the food business.
However, despite our 50-year history in the business, there remain issues such as some shops not conveniently located, products they wish to buy not always available and long waits at some locations. In response, we implement a range of strategies in the areas of both information and distribution in order to resolve these customer issues.

Market conditions and our competition
Though the size of the restaurant market had grown gradually in recent years, it shrank due to the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic also led to the adoption of mobile phone ordering systems by many types of businesses, such that now many restaurant locations have them. Taking the fact that customers are choosing takeout—due to the voluntary trend to stay at home—as a good business opportunity, we are focusing on accommodating increased demand by enhancing our takeout menus.
The FY2020 market for sweets and desserts was projected to fall by 7.6% from the previous year; but instead, it in fact expanded as a result of increased demand (due to the stay-at-home orders) for sweets sold at supermarkets and convenience stores. The array of sweets available at convenience stores has diversified to now include high-quality, high-end items.

Mister Donut is striving to bring about an environment where customers can place orders, make payment and pick up their product anywhere. To create such an environment, we have launched an online ordering system. Further, in order to add to the number of locations where customers can pick up, we are moving ahead with research on locker-style delivery boxes, as well as taking an aggressive stance on setting up new roadside locations in the suburbs and kitchen-less locations in urban areas.
At our pork cutlet restaurants Katsu & Katsu, we are now starting a feasibility study for specialized takeout stores in order to address demand for takeout. In addition, we are implementing a new system where customers can place orders ahead of time or wait in their cars to make systems even more convenient. Also, in our other food businesses, we are setting up collaborative initiatives with specialized delivery companies, in order to solve issues of customers in areas where shops are not located nearby.

Strategies
Other Businesses
Performance and evaluation for FY2020
At our domestic consolidated subsidiaries, sales increased slightly at Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd. (management services for hospitals and clinics); Duskin Kyoeki Co., Ltd. (leasing and insurance agent) has also seen increases in leasing sales due to the updating of Mister Donut POS systems and the switch to automobiles equipped with automatic braking systems.
At our overseas consolidated subsidiaries, Duskin Shanghai Co., Ltd. (rental and sale of our Clean Services in Shanghai, China) saw increased online sales, although the pandemic made it difficult to conduct sales visits to commercial and residential customers.
Sales dropped at the Big Apple Group, which is engaged in the donut business primarily in Malaysia, as it had to rely on takeout and delivery for an extended period of time. At Duskin Hong Kong Co., Ltd. (raw materials and equipment procurement), sales increased because it procured and sold masks for Duskin in Japan.
Strategies for Duskin Healthcare
 Approach
Duskin Healthcare Co., Ltd. effectively responds to sophisticated anti-infection strategies demanded at the cutting edge of medicine, earning high marks from our contracted hospitals. In the future, as the company moves ahead with packaging anti-infection services, we consider it a key issue to involve qualified personnel in the development of infection prevention measures. The company’s frozen breakfast bento box was developed in response to a constant issue of hospital meals: a lack of personnel to prepare and serve breakfast. To further boost demand for these meals, the company will be developing more menu options for these breakfasts and is expanding sales at nursing-care facilities.
As part of initiatives for better work environment for our employees who need to take strict infection prevention measures, we are working on making reports online and creating new value by further solidifying our operating platform.
At Mister Donut, the primary business of the Food Group, the goal is to bring happy moments to our customers in store or at home. We employ five key strategies to achieve this goal.
Key strategies
Our first key strategy is to capture new markets. To achieve this, we are moving ahead with online-order and delivery services designed to address changes in external environments and consumer needs brought about by the pandemic. Second, as we work to maintain and bolster sales of primary products, we are also developing products that we hope will become new classics, as well as enhancing our MISDO GOHAN light meal line. Third, we are moving ahead with collaborative product developments in an effort to make the Mister Donut experience fun and our products always delicious. These include MISDO Meets and other collaborative items as well as limited-time only seasonal items. Fourth, as we solidify our operating environment, we are taking such steps as distribution reform and shop refurbishment. Fifth, as part of environmental conservation efforts, we are adopting measures to make us a more ecological company in our handling of the earth’s precious resources. With our 50th anniversary, Duskin is emphasizing these initiatives even more.
Regarding our other food businesses, we have begun feasibility studies for takeout specialty shops to address the demand for takeout at our Katsu & Katsu locations. Our goal is further expansion of this business.

Our Growth Strategies
Message from the CFO
   Financial Policy
Our goals are to generate cash flow, raise capital efficiency and execute a financial policy for supporting sustainable growth while vigilantly controlling capital costs.
Naoto Miyata
Director and CFO
Investment and cash flow
Duskin’s franchise network is a vital non-tangible asset. The network consists of franchisees and the franchisor, which are united by our unique management philosophy and share the same interests. Our business segment performance is highly correlated with general business trends, and this therefore requires operating capital, which also includes the cost of maintaining the franchise network, with sufficient reserves.
Over the next three years, we intend to actively invest in our company. Assuming current operating cash flow of around 13 billion yen, in a typical year about 10 billion yen is invested in already existing businesses. Along with the sale of cross-shareholdings and borrowing from financial institutions, for the time being, we will carry out growth investments. Any profits not allocated for these growth investments will, of course, be returned to our shareholders.
Moreover, as we focus on M&A and new business investment, we are investing in the digital transformation in order to enhance the customer experience and investing in human resource development. We also believe that from now on costs and investments related to our social contribution activities will be necessary. When we consider how Duskin can contribute to a sustainable society that seeks to implement Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is clear that what we do to enhance Duskin’s corporate value in the long term can incur certain costs in the short term.
But achieving sustainability is important because it is an investment in our future, and we are therefore actively exploring the potential of very long-term investments that we have not done in the past.
 Cash flow plan
   A look back at FY2020 and the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018
FY2020 ended with sales and profits lower than the previous year due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic drastically changed our business environment, and in order for Duskin to fulfill its ultimate responsibility of maintaining the company’s franchise network, the top priority has been ensuring the safety of our customers, franchisees and employees, even as we focus on getting sales back on track. Moreover, we prepared and executed a strategy that saw this changing business environment as an opportunity for new business growth. Most important in this regard were the courageous decisions of our company president; namely, to provide relief money to all franchisees and their employees, to install doors in all food showcases at cafeteria-type shops to ensure the safety of Mister Donut customers and to conduct an ad campaign at the Direct Selling Group to raise awareness about Duskin’s commitment to creating a healthy environment for consumers and businesses. These measures taken amid an uncertain business climate had a noticeable impact on our financial performance, but as Chief Financial Officer I think they were necessary to ensure the survival of our franchise network.
The Medium-Term Management Policy 2018 entered its final year amid these circumstances and, unfortunately, concluded without meeting its targets due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nonetheless, in addition to progress in our business foundation during this period, on the governance side we put in place the Operating Officer System in order to separate our execution and supervision functions and established the Investment Assessment Committee. In the area of human resource investment we initiated a succession plan and have also begun training next-generation management. We would have normally announced our next medium-term management plan, but given that the coronavirus pandemic has made the future even more uncertain, we will announce the next plan when circumstances permit.
Improving capital efficiency
As of March 31, 2021, Duskin had solid financial health, with total assets of 188.3 billion yen and an equity ratio of 77.2%. Generating both of profit that exceeds capital costs and cash flow enhances shareholder value, and in order to assess annual capital efficiency and return on investment (ROI), the Board of Directors discusses the direction of each business based on a business portfolio analysis. Furthermore, the Investment Assessment Committee, which I chair as CFO, has constructed an investment PDCA cycle and works to improve the performance of invested capital. We aim to achieve higher profitability and meet the expectations of our shareholders by increasing ROE to 5.0% at the earliest possible date, which we will achieve by establishing a new business foundation through growth investments, by making work processes more efficient, and by reducing costs.
Dividend policy
Consolidated payout ratio: 50%

  Shareholder returns
Duskin’s basic policy is returning profits to shareholders based on consolidated net income. Since FY2019, we have started determining dividends for each fiscal year based on a target consolidated payout ratio of 50%, and we intend to continue paying stable cash dividends. We are also taking a flexible approach to company stock buybacks from a total return ratio perspective.
Looking ahead, we intend to achieve a total shareholder return higher than the return on the TOPIX index and execute a growth strategy backed by a solid financial foundation while vigilantly controlling the cost of shareholders’ equity.

Our Growth Strategies
Research and Development
Fifty years ago, Duskin revolutionized the world of cleaning with the release of a specially treated cloth that dusted without water. Duskin started out as a dust control business, and ever since we have made “the science of cleaning” a central theme in our commitment to develop products and services dedicated to making the lives of our customers better.
Duskin Research and Development Policy
We take a consumer-first approach to research and development in the field of cleaning and hygiene. Our customer-first R&D approach is reflected in the following five pledges aimed at providing communities with healthy and comfortable lifestyles.
Hygiene-related Research
 1. The science of dust and dust control technology
The history of Duskin comes down to dust control. We have ceaselessly pursued research on how to efficiently capture and eliminate the dust found in homes and other indoor space. This research is informed by our regularly conducted “dust survey.” The Duskin Research & Development Center obtains the cooperation of typical households as sample for a survey focusing on the composition, characteristics and distribution of dust and how lifestyle habits affect the accumulation of dust indoors
Duskin mop
Duskin mat
   2. Mop dust-control performance and adsorbent technology
Our adsorbents contain technology that reduces the hygienic risk of the bacteria, mold, allergens (including
mite feces and pollen), viruses and other impurities contained in dust that adheres to mops.
Besides improving dust gathering capability, our mop R&D concentrates on developing technology that keeps mops clean and comfortable to use.
Duskin household mops*1 are the first in the dust control industry to receive the anti-virus processing*2 and antibacterial deodorant processing SEK Marks*3
*1: Do not include certain products.
*2: This process is not intended to treat or prevent disease and does not suppress the
actions of viruses.
*3: The SEK Mark is a certification mark administered by the Japan Textile Evaluation
Technology Council recognizing the performance, durability, and safety of textile products.
3. Mat dust control performance and adsorbent technology
Like our mop adsorbents, the oil-based adsorbents processed for our mat products not only capture dust and prevent dust from stirring up, they possess properties that suppress the growth of bacteria and mold. These properties reduce hygienic risk from bacteria, mold and other impurities even when a mat is dirty
4. Hygiene-related products and sterilization and antibacterial performance
   Along with our mops and mats, we also strive to improve the sterilization and antibacterial performance from the perspective of a clean and less risky hygienic environment for our other cleaning service products. Our detergents, for example, wash away dirt with surfactants that also reduce bacteria contained in the dirt by means of a sterilization effect. Our detergents also reduce hygienic risk with an antibacterial effect that makes it hard for bacteria to regrow on an object once it has been cleaned. Taking into account the detergent composition for different objects to be cleaned, we repeatedly perform a variety of trial-and-error experiments in order to get the best cleaning performance. Only the best choices among them are delivered to our customers.

Cleaning
Comfort
Research domains
Developing technology for cleaning, hygiene and comfortable lifestyle to become the industry leader in creating clean and healthy lifestyle—while Duskin is best known as a cleaning company, we are extending our R&D into the hygiene and comfort domains as part of our commitment to bring health to our customers through cleanliness.
    Duskin Research & Development Center
Trends such as the growing number of single-person households are bringing enormous changes to the living environment in Japan today. Corporations are also facing changes in work patterns arising from a shrinking labor force and workstyle reforms, and these changes have made it difficult for many corporations to maintain a hygienic workplace environment. Moreover, an increase in allergies and other disorders show that changing lifestyles and social environments are also affecting the physical and mental health of people.
In addition, the spread of the coronavirus has made masks, sanitizers and other infection prevention measures a part of daily life, while more hours worked from home are bringing about big changes to the lifestyle and workstyle of consumers. The hygiene needs of businesses are sharply rising because they need effective hygiene measures in order to stay in business. We believe it urgent to respond to the increasingly diverse hygiene needs of consumers and businesses and their increasing awareness of hygiene environment.
Duskin Research & Development Center is dedicated to safety and reliability with an eye on the present and the coming future. We also strive to bring comfortable and healthy living to our communities and contribute to our efforts to do business as a company providing products and services that “fine-tune” daily living.

Providing Safe, Reliable and Sustainable Products and Services
To ensure that we provide customers and consumers with safe and reliable products and services, we have built and put into practice a complete quality control system based on our Quality Policy. Also, to ensure stable procurement, we make an effort to strengthen our partnerships with suppliers and employ such strategies as purchasing goods from multiple suppliers and identifying sources for purchasing substitute goods.
For details about our Quality Policy, please refer to the following web page. (Available in Japanese only)
https://www.duskin.co.jp/sus/safety/philosophy/
Quality assurance framework
To ensure that all our products and services are safe and reliable, we have established a quality assurance framework that covers all products from development to after launch. We have also set up the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee, which meets twice a year to deliberate on the guidelines of quality control and assurance and the environment.
During the development phase prior to launch, the safety and reliability of products and services are objectively reviewed at the development meetings. For the development of food products and services and their specification changes, internal rules require that we ensure their safety at a meeting of the Food Safety Council. Following a launch, we conduct quality checks on products in distribution.Customers and consumersProvide safe, reliable and environmentally friendly products and services

Supporting local schools and education
Since 2000, Duskin has carried out research motivated by our conviction that cleaning can help develop the abilities of children. We have made publicly available an elementaryand middle-school cleaning education curriculum and hold seminars for teachers about this research, and we conduct on-site classes at elementary schools on the importance of cleaning.
In FY2020, with the expansion of the GIGA School Program and the impact of the spread of the novel coronavirus, Duskin opened an instructional website dedicated to cleaning education for children. The instructional content can be taught in every elementary school grade and is especially relevant to the home economics taught to fifth-grade students.

For the contracted plants manufacturing our products, we conduct several types of inspections, including comprehensive qualification for new contractors, inspection of their production operation and periodic inspections of all contractors, as part of our efforts for continuous improvement. Our inspection specialists for food processing plants conduct extensive quality inspections, including facility management, process management, sanitary management and production management. All plants are evaluated and ranked by the results of inspections and other evaluation items. Periodic inspections are conducted regularly (approximately once in every three years) depending on the plants’ rankings.
During FY2020, we conducted first-time inspections at 3 plants and periodic inspections at 24 plants.

With the higher frequency of heavy rains, typhoons and other extremely severe disasters in recent years, building a strong supply chain with disaster resilience has become ever more important. In preparation for the risk of temporary product supply disruptions due to damage to a Duskin product manufacturer from natural disasters, we have developed a contingency plan for the mainstay products in our dust control business, which would incur a particularly large impact.
• Continuity planning policy
1. Purchase goods from several suppliers
2. Check if direct suppliers are implementing their continuity plans
3. Identify similar products and alternatives that can serve as substitutes in an emergency

Negative impacts on the environment arising from the use of palm oil refined from oil palm fruit has been a growing concern in the world, because the development of oil palm plantations destroys tropical rainforests. When Duskin uses these kinds of raw materials, we establish a procurement network with the partnered suppliers to ensure fair and legitimate business practices.
In addition to three international standards – namely ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems, ISO 22000 Food Safety Management Systems and ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems, all our partner plants have obtained HACCP certification. Apart from these initiatives, the plants also focus on hygiene and sanitation control through different initiatives on a monthly basis, such as the 5S activities: Sort,
Set-in-order, Shine, Sanitation, and Sustain discipline, as well as safety and sanitation training programs. Furthermore, Duskin has established voluntarily imposed standards for waste-water treatment that are stricter than those set by governments. The plants collect and retain data from voluntary inspections to monitor water quality as part of their endeavors to preserve the natural environment.

Supporting Employees’ Growth and Career Development
Duskin offers various types of education and training to develop personnel to fully understand the philosophy of Prayerful Management and reflect it in their daily business practices. We conduct level-specific training for employees, including new hires, to teach the knowledge and skills required to effectively perform their duties; we also focus on training Area Managers, who support our franchise owners and energize the franchise network. In addition, we encourage employees to develop themselves through attaining publicly recognized qualifications and taking correspondence courses.

Goals of career development training
• Help employees renew their awareness of their roles and abilities, and their contribution to the company. Raise the awareness of next generation leaders.
• Create a climate in which women have a sense of fulfillment and feel encouraged to play active roles to utilize their perspectives. Improve the work environment by empowering those in managerial positions. Nurture the sensitivity of all employees so that they understand and respond to the diverse needs of the market.

At Duskin people are the foundation for every service we provide. With that in mind, our human resource education and training recognizes that we need people with compassionate hearts as well as knowledge and skill if we are to remain valuable to the customers we serve. We asked three employees who joined the company around a decade ago to give us their thoughts about what it means to work at Duskin, about company culture and about the workplace environment. They engaged in a frank discussion about their career vision for the years ahead.
Q1. Tell us about your careers so far and your career vision for the years ahead.

I joined Duskin in 2011, and I started out in the Mister Donut Business Group. For eight years I moved around the country, working first as an assistant shop manager and then as a shop manager. Then, two years ago, my dream came true when I was transferred to the Information Systems office. Back when I was job hunting I would sometimes go to a Mister Donut, and I was surprised by how the staff would go around the room giving refills and by their excellent hospitality. That experience got me interested in Duskin, and I decided that I wanted to try working at Mister Donut. I joined Duskin in 2013, and the whole time since I have moved through production-related positions. For my first three years, I worked on the factory floor in the Production department at the Yokohama Central Plant, where I worked on product processing. In my fourth year, I was assigned to my present position in the Technology department of Production & Logistics, and I have been working in the same department since that time. At university, I studied environmental-related fields, and I have always been interested in cleaning, and I wanted to work at Duskin because of my science background. I think working in Production & Logistics, where the work is related to environmental matters such as waste and wastewater processing, has fulfilled that wish.
I joined Duskin in 2011, the same year as Mr. Fujioka. I spent my student years in Tokyo. At the time, Duskin had a very strong image as a donut company located in Osaka, and I wanted to work there because I thought it would be interesting. When I joined the company, I was assigned to the Clean & Care Business Group (now the Direct Selling Group). For two years, I worked as a sales rep doing rental mop and mat replacement and serving customers and then engaged in a sales office management. After that, I worked on things like organization development and on various system development projects and as a business development manager who supports franchise operations. Then, in 2021, I was transferred to the Health & Beauty Division’s Planning & Operation. My near-term goal is to make the Mister Donut online ordering system easier to use and convenient. We introduced the system in 2021, but for shops to take online orders they also need to manage their inventory. We don’t make products after receiving an order like other chains, so it’s very important that shop staff have strong management skills. Improving customer convenience is important, of course, but we are also working on making the system easy for shop staff to operate. At the Clean Service Division of the Direct Selling Group, people in charge of development and people in charge of procurement were in separate sections. But in Health & Beauty, a relatively smaller division, we are involved in every phase, from development to procurement and sales, so there’s strong motivation to be involved with a single product from start to finish. I’m interested in product development, so some day I want to try and create a unique product.
My experience so far has been limited to work areas in Production &
Logistics, so I want to build up experience in Duskin’s various other
business divisions. On the other hand, we need to retain the kind of
expertise and skills possessed by re-employed staff who have reached
retirement age and so I’m also interested in the Professional Track under
the new personnel system. I want to think about my future career vision,
including utilizing my science skills as well as the option of polishing my
skills as a professional.

What do you think about Duskin as a corporation from a social perspective? And what is the appeal of working at Duskin?


Matsue
The number of two-income households is rapidly increasing, and that includes me. So you can really sense the rising demand for household cleaning services like Merry Maids. It’s part of life, Mister Donut included.
We have an 18-month old child, so we rented a baby crib from Rent-All. I experienced myself that renting is perfect for a baby crib. Also, when we were caring for grandmother at her home, we rented a nursing bed from Health Rent. Recently, my father did a rental mop contract, and when I look at things from the customer’s perspective, I realize that Duskin is a company that serves people of every age, from infants to the elderly.
I thought about how I would explain what kind of company Duskin is without mentioning the company name. Besides the cleaning product rental business, it has Mister Donut and other food businesses, and it also has Health Rent and other caregiving-related businesses that
address social needs. I think the appeal of Duskin is that it is a company with a wide range
of businesses that connect to society in many different ways.
In our company, both male and female employees frequently transfer and relocate, and that means there are ample opportunities to gain all kinds of experience. When one transfers to a different business division, it’s just like coming to a different company — even though it is the same company — because it has different ways of thinking and working. I think that’s also one of the things that makes Duskin appealing.

Tell us what you like about the company’s work environment and system and what you hope to see in the future in this regard.

Since we are a two-income household, when we had our first child I wanted to take the area-specific career track. But now that the system enables returning to the career track, I can also consider going back to that once our children are grown. Besides that, we will soon give birth to our third child, and my boss asked me if I wanted to take childcare leave. Recently at Mister Donut, more and more males are taking childcare leave.
Since I transferred to Osaka in April, I am using the corporation operated preschool*. My wife can’t return to work if we don’t choose a preschool, so this benefit system has been an enormous help. I am interested in the newly set up Professional Track that I mentioned earlier. Besides that, when I was in Yokohama, I used the correspondence course subsidy system to obtain health supervisor certification and I took an Excel class when it became necessary for me to do data tabulation at work. I think it’s great that we have a system that individuals can use to sharpen their skills.
At work, I want to achieve things one by one with the help of those around me even if it’s just a small goal. This kind of good personal relationship enables me to value this sense of accomplishment in a way that contributes to workplace satisfaction.
So far, I have worked in a variety of positions, and in every one of them personal relationships have been an enormous blessing to me as well. Being reassigned every few years and engaging in work that is different from the work I did before reinvigorates me and makes the work pleasant.
The company provides all kinds of support, and I think the environment is easy to work in. I hope that it brings in a few more team members and that we can build a system and environment that makes it easy for human resources to stay.

Aiming to Enhance Social Value
 Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that employees of various career and social backgrounds (sex, age, nationality and lifestyle) who respect one another and who use their abilities to the fullest is the most effective response to a constantly changing business environment and ever more diverse customer needs. We also believe that employee diversity creates new value and excellence. Along with formalizing this philosophy in the Duskin Code of Conduct, we have established hiring diversity targets for the percentage of female employees in management, employees from abroad and employees with disabilities.

Empowering women in the workplace
Effective use of diverse human resources to enhance corporate value and vitality requires a workplace environment that enables women to reach their full potential. Duskin has many female customers, so it is becoming increasingly important to develop products and services with a woman’s perspective.

Looking ahead, we will draft a third action plan for FY2022 through FY2025 based on the Act on the Promotion of Female Participation and Career Advancement in the Workplace. The action plan includes a variety of initiatives from the perspective of skill development, offering women greater opportunities, creating a more supportive workplace and culture.

With the increase in two-income families and one-person households, there is a rapidly growing need for house cleaning and helper services. The demand for these services is expected to expand further with increasing need for daily assistance for seniors in our super-aging society.
Duskin started hiring workers from abroad from April 2017 after receiving approval from the Kanagawa, Osaka and Tokyo governments as a specified organization for the Project to Accept Foreigners Conducting Housekeeping Services in National Strategic Special Zones. As of March 31, 2021, a total of 45 Philippine citizens were hired. These employees provide services at customers’ homes after undergoing training.
Hiring people with disabilities
We believe it is also a social responsibility of corporations to provide employment
opportunities to people with disabilities. These employment opportunities should be individually matched to the capabilities of the recruits. To provide more job opportunities at higher retention rates, we are carrying out initiatives to examine the types of jobs suitable for the different range of skills and interests of people with disabilities and to establish a structure to assist them. We continue to actively hire people with disabilities, and aim to reach a ratio of employees with disabilities of 3% or more. We will play our part to create a society where everyone can live with a sense of active participation, reward and purpose.

Basic Policy, Code of Conduct and initiatives regarding respect for human rights
The Duskin Code of Conduct advocates respecting human rights throughout the entire supply chain and clearly articulates that the spirit of respecting human rights will underlie every corporate activity. To advance our human rights efforts, and as a supplementary set of guiding principles to the Duskin Code of Conduct, we have established the Duskin Basic Policy Regarding Respect for Human Rights.
Duskin Basic Policy Regarding Respect for Human Rights

Work-Style Reform and Health-Focused Management
Duskin strives to provide a workplace environment that maintains employee work-life balance and enables employees to realize the full potential of their individual abilities and thereby boosting their motivation and a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. We also promote a variety of workstyles not restricted by time and location. Moreover, Duskin supports health-focused management for employees’ better health and increases the health literacy of every employee.

Creating positive working environments
To continue to sow the seeds of joy for people and communities, Duskin believes balance between work and home life is important for the health of our employees. Accordingly, we have put various measures in place to reduce long work hours and create better workplaces, aiming to keep the total work time per employee at below 1,800 hours annually.
In addition, Duskin has maintained “Kurumin” certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare since 2016, demonstrating our commitment as an enterprise that supports our employees’ childcare.

2021 Health & Productivity Management Organization certification In March 2021, Duskin received Health & Productivity Management Organization
2021 certification, a certification system operated by the Nippon Kenko Kaigi (Japan Health Council) with the support from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Duskin has received certification for five consecutive years — every year since the system began in 2017. Guided by the Duskin Health-focused Management Declaration, we promote health management initiatives and strive to raise the health awareness of every employee.
Duskin Group will continue to work in partnership with the health insurance society and labor union on the goal of obtaining certification for every Group company that is a member of the Duskin Health Insurance Society.

Duskin Health-Focused Management Declaration
For Happiness of Employees
Duskin will encourage and help our employees and their families to maintain and improve their well-being to lead their lives to their fullest potential as reflected in the philosophy of Prayerful Management. We hereby declare our commitment to health-focused management, through which we will support the health of our employees and the sound development of the company to sow the seeds of joy in society.

SDG targets
 One way Duskin contributes to creating a sustainable society is by applying 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) plus renewables over the entire product lifecycle. We also work hard on finding solutions to environmental issues to contribute to building a decarbonized society that is in harmony with nature and has a small environmental footprint.
Helping Achieve a Recycling-Oriented Society
The cleaning utensil rental systems that Duskin has successfully popularized in Japan value things based on a “repeated use, shared use, reduction of needless waste and disposal” business approach. Duskin’s rental system enables effective environmental management over the entire lifecycle of the product. Along with an effort to make effective use of limited resources, Duskin promotes an environmentally conscious business operation, from product development to reuse, recycling, and disposal after use.
Direct Selling Group: Reuse of mop and mat products
All used items are collected from customers, and 97% of the collected items are processed in the laundry plants and reused. The remaining 3% unusable items are utilized as fuels. All products are repeatedly used until their usable life ends. Dust and dirt on mops and mats are also recycled into materials for cement.
Together with Our Environment
Social needs and challenges
• Greater awareness of the SDGs and the environment • Accelerated shift toward a circular economy

Revising the Environmental Management Framework and Environmental Policy
Duskin established its Environmental Philosophy and Environmental Policy in 1998, and we pursue a wide range of environmental conservation activities. To ensure that Duskin continues to abide by its Environmental Philosophy and carry out activities to preserve the global environment, our environmental management framework now delegates the President and CEO as the Chief Environmental Officer. We have also revised company Environmental Policy in order to clearly articulate to our stakeholders our goal of contributing to a sustainable society in the mediumand long-term out of concern over the environmental issues of the last few years.

Duskin Green Target 2030
To ensure that Duskin contributes to achieving company growth and a sustainable society, in June 2021, we established Duskin Green Target 2030, a set of company environmental management goals through 2030.
These newly established targets that help achieve a recycling-oriented society include reducing food waste related to Duskin food businesses, reducing the use of fossil-fuel-derived plastics within the Duskin Group and within Duskin franchisees and franchised plants, and increasing container and packaging plastic recycling.

 Reducing Container and Packaging Plastic
As a source of ocean garbage and other pollution, plastic has a major impact on the environment and on daily life. Duskin implements the following methods for handling plastic materials. These methods contribute to achieving a sustainable society by using resources effectively and by reducing environmental burden throughout the entire lifecycle of the plastic containers and packaging that we use.
Reducing CO2 Emissions Solar power generation system
Duskin’s company-owned offices strive to reduce fossil fuel derived energy by using renewable energy. Our training facility, the Duskin School, has solar power generation panels installed in some of the building’s glass walls. The Osaka Central Plant has installed a solar power generation system with 350 panels that generate up to 100kW of power.
In addition, six locations directly operated by the Direct Selling Group have installed solar power generation equipment. Besides making effective use of renewable energy, in the event of a power outage during a natural disaster, these sites can function as part of the region’s disaster response framework.
      Medium term
Long term
1. Reduce
Reduce the amount of plastic used for containers by making containers thinner and lighter and by condensing container contents to make containers smaller.
     2. Reuse
Develop new types of refillable and reusable containers so that containers can be used repeatedly.
Difficulty
3. Recycle
Actively incorporate recycled resin and similar materials into plastic containers and develop easy-to-recycle containers
4. Renew
Shift from fossil-fuel derived plastic to plastic derived from plants and other renewable raw materials
  The kitchen detergent Raku-in Pack system
The Raku-in Pack system features a pouch containing detergent that the consumer inserts into a reusable bottle. Since the consumer can refill the Raku-in Pack Bottle or Raku-in Pack Bottle Mini simply by covering the pouch with the top of the bottle, there is no need to open the pouch by hand in order to refill the container. The pouch is vacuum packed, so the consumer can use the bottle until all of the detergent is gone. What’s more, it’s sanitary.
Enhanced convenience encourages bottle reuse thus reducing plastic bottle waste and promoting efficient resource use.
Currently, Moisture-rich Body Soap, high-moisturizing body soap, kitchen detergent, and nachu Mouthwash are compatible with the Raku-in Pack system.
Entering the used plastic recycling business
• Duskin invests in R Plus Japan, Ltd.
Carbon-neutral LNG (CNL)
Carbon-neutral natural gas, or CNL, offsets greenhouse gases generated by natural gas throughout the extraction-to-combustion process with CO2 credits, and LNG consumed under this scheme is not considered a source of global CO2 emissions.
Since April 2021, gas consumed at the Duskin Tokyo Tama Central Plant has been carbon neutral, thus reducing the plant’s CO2 emissions. The plant generates about 1,721 tons of CO2 annually, and it is estimated that the carbon neutral effort will reduce emissions by 1,192 tons, or about 70%.
Besides investigating ways to introduce CNL to our other plants, Duskin will continue to contribute to achieving a sustainable society by expanding and enhancing the value of CNL within the company and by purchasing CNL through the Carbon Neutral LNG Buyers Alliance, an alliance established by 15 companies that purchase CNL, including Duskin, together with Tokyo Gas, which procures and supplies CNL.
Promoting low-emission vehicles
Duskin is expanding its use of low-emission vehicles. We make it a rule to both adopt low-emission gas vehicles for service vehicles and adopt hybrid and other vehicles with excellent environmental performance for Duskin headquarters use.
At the Duskin headquarters, we are replacing cars with hybrids, electric cars and other vehicles that comply with the latest gas emissions regulations. Moreover, and with a focus on company-owned sales offices and affiliated companies, we are energetically promoting idling stop and equipping service cars with auto-brake functions in order to prevent rear-end collisions.

   Fold the pouch
  Duskin entered the used plastic resource recycling business by becoming an investor in R Plus Japan, Ltd., a joint capital venture launched in June 2020. Prompted by the need to respond to the globally recognized problem of plastic waste in the ocean, the new business will enable Duskin to both fulfill its corporate social responsibility and contribute to the government’s used plastic resource recycling strategy.
Even before our investment in R Plus Japan, Duskin has been at work on a number of efforts to solve the plastic waste problem. These efforts include introducing biomass register bags to our dust control business and discontinuing free register bags and adopting biomass straw at Mister Donut shops. R Plus Japan is developing new ways to recycle used plastic, and Duskin is working with the company to help create new technology and methods that will, in the future, enable us to procure materials recycled from plastic waste.

 Action on Climate Change
Duskin positions the risks and opportunities associated with climate change as critical management issues. In order to advance information disclosure based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we classify and study climate-related risks as risk associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy and risk associated with the physical impacts of climate change.
Governance
We established the Sustainability Committee, which consist of the Outside Directors, the Operating Officers, and the Standing Audit and Supervisory Board Members. This committee, serving as an advisory body to the Board of Directors, studies and deliberates the basic policies and key issues associated with climate change.
We also established the Quality Assurance & Environment Committee, which studies and determines agreements concerning environmental conservation and improvement issues, and the Environmental Liaison Committee, which manages the progress of environmental policies, as sub-organizations under the Sustainability Committee. This structure helps the Board of Directors to identify and monitor actual risks and opportunities, and to enhance climate change-related governance.

Risk management
We conducted a qualitative provisional climate change risk assessment to evaluate the possibility of climate change
having a significant impact on the financial performance of our businesses.
Through a careful review of the results, we have identified the key drivers that could ultimately have a major impact on the business continuity of the Duskin Corporate Group and franchisees. We will continue to employ scenario analysis to evaluate and assess the risk posed by these key drivers.
• Adopted scenarios
• IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario: Global average temperature rise of at least 4°C from pre-industrial levels • IPCC SR 1.5 scenario: Global average temperature rise kept below 1.5°C
Indicators and targets
To contribute to achieving a decarbonized society, we have established two targets to be met by 2030: shifting 50% of
the energy consumed for the Duskin Group’s business activities to renewable energy by 2030 and reducing CO2 emissions at company-owned facilities by 46% from their 2013 level.
In FY2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, employee travel and commuting declined, with the result that Scope 3 energy consumption and emissions were lower than the previous year.
Also, to ensure accurate and transparent information disclosure, Scopes 1, 2, and 3* energy consumption and CO2 emission figures have been certified as accurate by a third party.
* Scope 1: Greenhouse gas emissions directly emitted by the Duskin Group
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the use of electricity, heat or steam supplied by other companies
Scope 3: Indirect emissions not included in Scope1 and Scope2 (emissions by other companies engaged in activities related to the business)

SDG targets
 Duskin ensures the implementation of all of the principles contained in the Corporate Governance Code. For additional information, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report on our website. (Available in Japanese only)
https://www.duskin.co.jp/sus/governance/corporate/pdf/governance.pdf
Five key characteristics of corporate governance
❖ Of the nine board members, three are Outside Directors.
❖ The ratio of Outside Directors on the Board of Directors remained
at 33%, as it was in FY2019.
❖ Of the nine board members, two are women.
❖ Duskin is offering greater opportunities for women, who are essential to our business growth. One of our efforts is to ensure board diversity by promoting the appointment of female Directors.
❖ All Directors, including Outside Directors attend every Board of Directors meeting and actively engage in discussions on the company’s business growth and on how to increase our corporate value in the medium and long term.
❖ This attendance rate reflects the average attendance rate for the Board of Directors meetings since the general meeting of shareholders held in June 2020.
❖ To ensure the effectiveness and transparency of appointments to and evaluations of the Board of Directors, Duskin established the Directors Evaluation Committee, which is composed only of independent directors and functions as an advisory board to the Board of Directors.
❖ The Operating Officer System expedites the execution of company business by delegating decision-making authority for matters concerning a particular division to the officer in charge of that division. Delegating authority in this way enables the Board of Directors to focus on deliberating on important agenda items and on supervising the execution of company business.
Initiatives to strengthen corporate governance
We are strengthening corporate governance, as we believe it to be one of the most important issues for management. In 2017 we created a Directors Evaluation Committee and introduced an Operating Officer System in 2018. With the aim of ensuring the independence of the Directors Evaluation Committee and maintaining its effectiveness, we changed it to consist of only independent directors and to function as an advisory body to the Board of Directors.
Taking into account amendments to laws and changing society, we will continue to work toward further improvements in corporate governance.FY

Corporate Governance
 Basic policy
Upholding Founder Seiichi Suzuki’s philosophy of Prayerful Management, we are committed to each of our business operations to sow the seeds of joy for people and communities. Our interpretation of corporate governance is for all of our employees to incorporate his earnest wish, as reflected in the philosophy, in our everyday activities.
Duskin positions the strengthening of corporate governance as one of its highest priorities to build a stronger relationship with stakeholders, increase corporate value over the medium to long term, and achieve sustainable growth. Duskin is further bolstering its structure, organization and systems to ensure transparent and sound management. Duskin also places compliance at the center of all our corporate activities to continuously improve our corporate value.
Corporate governance structure
Duskin corporate governance uses an audit and supervisory board system. We have introduced the Operating Officer System to streamline the Board of Directors’ decision-making process and strengthen its supervision of company business. To ensure the system’s effectiveness, we have also set up the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. Additionally, to ensure that the process of determining the remuneration of individual directors is objective and transparent, we have established the Directors Evaluation Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors. At the Board of Directors, Directors monitor and supervise other Directors’ performance. The Audit and Supervisory Board consists of independent outside Audit and Supervisory Board Members capable of objectively conducting audits and internal fulltime Audit and Supervisory Board Members, who are well acquainted with our business operations and have skills needed to gather information. Under this system, the Audit and Supervisory Board Members, internal and outside, perform accurate audits. We consider this structure highly effective as it supports customer-oriented management while ensuring sound and efficient business operations. This system also enables us to swiftly and precisely respond to changes in the business environment.

Mr. Yoshizumi supervised business operations from April 2011 in North America as General Manager, North America Division and President of Ajinomoto North America, Inc. Mr. Yoshizumi was appointed an Outside Director because he is expected to provide Duskin with advice based on his past experience and expertise from the perspective of overall management supervision and raising corporate value in the mediumand long-term.Nobuko SekiguchiAfter working as a management consultant, Ms. Sekiguchi joined Capcom, where she served as a Managing Corporate Officer responsible for corporate planning that included preparing the Med-Term Plan, managing the annual budget, working on organizational reforms, and M&A. She held a leading role in reforming Capcom’s personnel system. Ms. Sekiguchi was appointed an Outside Director because she is expected to provide Duskin with advice based on her past experience and expertise from the perspective of overall management supervision and raising corporate value in the mediumand long-term.Yukiko TsujimotoAs a Director at Procter & Gamble Japan, Ms. Tsujimoto has a wealth of experience and insight in corporate management.

1 We always think of customers in everything we do. 3 We are ethical in all our actions.

Note: All three are independent directors.
Standards for independence of Outside Directors and Outside Audit and
Supervisory Board Members
To ensure the independence of an Outside Director or Outside Audit and Supervisory Board Member, Duskin selects a member in accordance with our own selection criteria as well as the independence standards of the Enforcement Rules for Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
When selecting the candidates, Duskin confirms that they comply with all items of the criteria. Then, the Board of Directors makes the final decision.
Note: Independence standards for outside directors established by our company are stipulated in our annual securities report (available in Japanese only).
https://www.duskin.co.jp/sus/governance/corporate/
Directors’ remuneration
Duskin positions Directors’ remuneration as an important issue for our corporate governance. To raise Directors’ motivation to achieve mediumand long-term sustainable growth and enhance corporate value, Duskin established the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System. With this system in place, their contributions and capabilities are determined and reflected in their remuneration.
The methods used in calculating Director remuneration and actual remuneration in FY2020 are as follows.
Process and calculation methods of Director remuneration and actual remuneration
Successor development plan
Duskin formulated its succession plan in FY2019 to foster next-generation management and successors to our chief executives. We have created an educational program to train those with the appropriate qualities, as well as a selection process for executive officers and candidates for director positions. We launched these operations in FY2020 and regularly share information and report to the Board of Directors on the progress. The President and CEO conducts monthly individual meetings with all Operating Officers. Quantitative assessments of their performances and improvements are made every six months in line with the Directors Evaluation and Nomination System, with the opportunity used to provide further guidance as well as to review their capabilities and performance with them.
Training Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members and deepening their knowledge of Duskin
Starting in FY2020, Duskin has been preparing a succession plan and putting in place an executive-class training plan. Duskin provides periodic training that Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members need in order to perform their decision-making and executing duties, and training that operating officers need in order to perform their business duties. When appointing Outside Directors, the President and CEO explains the candidates about Duskin’s management philosophy. After confirming their agreement on the philosophy, the President and CEO further explains Duskin’s business strategy and business operations. In addition, to help them deepen their knowledge of Duskin, the company provides them opportunities to visit major business sites, training facilities and plants.
Policy related to acquisition and holding of cross-shareholdings
The policy for cross-shareholdings is to hold a suitable number of shares only when there is a legitimate reason for owning these shares. Investments in stocks for which there is no legitimate reason for ownership are reduced or eliminated. Every year, the Duskin Board of Directors determines if the ownership of each cross-shareholding is proper or not. Decisions are based on the need for each cross-shareholding regarding business activities, such as business alliances, maintaining and strengthening business relationships, Duskin’s cost of capital, share price movements and other factors.
Constructive dialogue with investors, analysts and shareholders
Duskin conducts a variety of investor relations (IR) and shareholder relations (SR) activities to earn trust in the company’s management, receive a proper evaluation of the company and achieve sustained business growth and mediumto long-term growth in corporate value. Our senior management and Directors protectively respond to the requests of individual or institutional investors to meet with them. Information, evaluation and opinions gained through IR and SR activities are reported at meetings of the Board of Directors twice each year.
We strive to improve our IR tools, including our website, that are useful for individual investors and shareholders in making investment decisions. Duskin proactively discloses the financial results, business strategies, sustainability-related information, news and other topics of interest.

Message from Outside Directors
Three Outside Directors look back on the issues addressed in the 2020 Corporate Report and give their views on Duskin’s future direction and what the company needs to do now to enhance corporate value.
     Outside Director
Tomoya Yoshizumi
Joined Ajinomoto Co., Inc. in 1978. Named a Member of the Board in 2007. Served in leadership positions, including President of Amino Acids Company, and General Manager, North America Division, Bioscience & Finechemicals Business Division, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. and President of Ajinomoto U.S.A. (now Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America, Inc.). An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2017.
To meet our ROE targets is a management’s responsibility to our shareholders
The Board of Directors, including Internal Directors, give their opinions much more frequently, including topics beyond their own area of responsibility, and discussions have become more multifaceted and energetic as a result. This has made it possible to talk about withdrawing from underperforming businesses, and in my opinion Duskin is making solid progress on evaluating the viability of its businesses from a “selection and concentration” perspective. To further build this momentum, I will continue to express my opinions as an Outside Director representing our shareholders. I hope this will help accelerate the pace of optimizing and strengthening the overall value chain, which is another priority for Duskin.
The succession issue is one of the Outside Directors and Audit and Supervisory Board Members Council’s priorities. I am chairman of the Directors Evaluation Committee, which includes two Outside Directors. At the Committee meetings, we are deliberating how best to transparently and impartially evaluate next-generation leadership candidates who have produced results within each business group. If that works well, I think it will further raise the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. We are also looking at human resource education with an eye on the Group’s next-generation leadership. Clearly showing what kind of human resources we need is a management responsibility, and we are therefore discussing this issue with those in charge of personnel affairs.
Duskin conducts business guided by the philosophy of Unifying Business and Morals, and in order to practice this philosophy as a publicly listed company, achieving our ROE targets is a vital responsibility of all of management. I believe it is the role of Outside Directors to support the President and Group COOs in their efforts to meet these performance targets and to contribute to meeting these performance targets and returning some of those results to our shareholders. With a sense of responsibility and a sense of urgency toward our shareholders, I will therefore continue to advocate for effective management.
Outside Director
Nobuko Sekiguchi
After working at a foreign affiliated company and as a management consultant, Ms. Sekiguchi joined Capcom Co., Ltd. in 2005, where she was appointed as a Corporate Officer. While there, she was engaged in leadership roles including Head of Corporate Planning & Human Resources Division. An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2019.
Duskin is a pioneer of product rental and SDGs
Compared to last year, discussions at Board of Directors meetings have become much more substantial. Besides discussion about proposals from individual business lines, there is a great deal more discussion about the company in the medium-term of three to five years and about overall company strategy. Last year I mentioned the need for more constructive proposals from the Board of Directors, and since then our Corporate Planning team, which guides medium-term strategy not only actively included the proposals on the company strategy in the agenda, but also they have prepared materials with concrete numbers that make it possible to have productive discussions. From a corporate governance perspective, I do not think there are very many companies capable of such frank discussion, and in the future I hope that we can contribute more time to discussing strategy. I want to encourage Internal Directors to express their opinions even more than they have so far.
Currently, increasing sales is an issue at Duskin, and a growth strategy is key to achieving sales growth. Duskin has been in the rental business for mop and mat products for some time, and the company has long advocated SDGs. Duskin also has superb services, and I think that the company has yet more potential for enhancing brand value. Moreover, it is my opinion that Duskin needs to leverage these strengths toward the new challenge of achieving a digital transformation of the company’s overall business model, including franchisees all over Japan. I have also attended, as an observer, the information system meetings that the company started last year in order to better understand the IT and digital challenge.
There is growing awareness within the company for the need for digital training for executives, and we will continue to apply Duskin’s resources to an all-out effort aimed at meeting the needs of the next-generation of consumers.
Outside Director
Yukiko Tsujimoto
Ms. Tsujimoto joined Procter & Gamble Far East Inc. (now Procter & Gamble Japan K.K.) in 1986. After resigning the position of Director at Procter & Gamble Japan in 2014, she assumed the post of Representative Director at shapes Co., Ltd. An Outside Director of Duskin Co., Ltd. since June 2020.
Understanding Duskin’s strengths, building a “third pillar” to help support the company 50 years from now
While I have served as an Outside Director for just one year so far, my impression is that Duskin practices effective governance not only in form but in substance. I can attend company meetings as an observer when I think it necessary, and I can obtain sufficient information about management issues by, for example, asking those involved to explain in advance the details of a presentation given at a Board of Directors meeting. It is easy to express opinions at Board of Directors meetings, and to my mind as an Outside Director they are easy to work with.
At Duskin, I would say that employees listen to the various opinions of other people and really try to do what needs to be done. Besides fulfilling my role as an Outside Director on the Board of Directors, and informed by my past experience and knowledge, I make an effort to contribute to enhancing corporate value. Taking part in new product and service development meetings and stating my opinions about things like customer understanding and development processes are among such efforts.
Duskin’s strength is a business model—and the brand power that accompanies it—that forms a single line extending from the product planning stage, through sales and services, and directly to the customer. In line with a changing social environment and customer needs, I hope that Duskin headquarters will take the initiative in using advances in technology to form even more robust, direct connections with our customers, including market segments that until now have posed challenges to the company.
Currently, Duskin’s business rests on two main pillars: clean service and Mister Donut. In the future, Duskin needs to further strengthen its business foundation by working hard on nurturing a third pillar. As a member of management, I am always thinking about what kind of company we want Duskin to become 50 years from now and working hard to contribute to making the company a profitable and growing business.Issues discussed in the 2020 Corporate Report
In the 2020 Corporate Report, Outside Director Yoshizumi and Outside Director Sekiguchi discussed such issues as the lack of comments and the need for constructive proposals from a companywide perspective from Internal Directors. They also discussed applying selection and concentration as a way to effectively allocate managerial resources, how best to handle digitalization and the need for stronger corporate governance.

Corporate Governance
 Risk Management Risk management policy
The risk that is a part of the business environment is becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Some risks are extremely difficult to predict in advance, such as the coronavirus pandemic that has been spreading worldwide since last year. Nonetheless, Duskin is making efforts to assess all kinds of risk in advance. We have taken measures to prevent coronavirus infection in order to avoid and minimize any damage it might cause to company operations should it become a threat.
Risk management system
Duskin has prepared Basic Rules on Risk Management and has established a risk management department and assigned supervisors according to these rules. We have also established the Risk Management Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors. At our subsidiaries, we appoint risk management supervisors appropriate to the company’s scope and nature of business, and we practice comprehensive and the Duskin Corporate Group risk management.
Furthermore, we have set up a secretariat office consolidating all risk management-related operations and clerical work within the Risk Management section of the Quality Assurance & Risk Management so that any section in charge of risk management and secretariat office can work together on preparing a response should the company be exposed to risk. In addition to these measures, we will deploy a response task force should an event occur that has a high potential for exposing the Duskin Corporate Group to risk.
Common types of risk and their countermeasures
Compliance
Basic policy and framework
At Duskin, “compliance” means putting ourselves in the place of others and thinking and acting according to their expectations. To ensure a healthy business operation and raise corporate value in the long term, and so that every employee earns the trust of our customers and of society in general, our daily business conduct is guided by the Duskin Code of Conduct and we always strive to observe compliance.

https://www.duskin.co.jp/sus/governance/standard/
Initiatives to promote compliance Compliance Committee
Duskin has set up the Compliance Committee as an advisory body to the Board of Directors. The Compliance Committee monitors the effectiveness of the Code of Conduct, and it conducts surveys on compliance-related issues and requests appropriate actions to remedy them. In FY2020, the number of major compliance violations was zero.
Compliance training sessions
To ensure that its members understand and faithfully observe the Duskin Code of Conduct, the Duskin Group holds compliance training sessions every year for all directors and employees. In FY2020, Duskin conducted corporate risk management training for directors and management-class employees and Personal Information Protection Law and insider trading training for regular employees. We will continue to provide training that fosters deeper appreciation and understanding of corporate compliance.
Whistleblower hotline
In accordance with the Whistleblower Protection Act, Duskin operates a direct notifi-
cation hotline system that includes the Corporate Compliance section as the system’s
100
in-house contact and an outside law firm as its external contact. The system can be used not only by full-time employees but also by part-time and dispatch employees. Moreover, a whistleblower can remain anonymous so that he or she cannot be fired, transferred, discriminated against or otherwise treated unfairly for using the hotline. In FY2020, the number of hotline users increased due to anxiety and other factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and by distributing new hotline posters at all business locations aimed at making the availability of the hotline better known.

 Description of risk
 Countermeasures
 Business model (Franchise system)
 Difficulty in obtaining consent and cooperation from franchisees, which leads to suspension or delay of business plans
Have sufficient communication with franchisees to obtain consent for cooperation and sharing expenses when developing and introducing new products and services as well as opening new shops and renovating existing shops.
  Termination or cancellation by franchisees, lawsuits with franchisees, violations of laws and ordinances by franchisees and scandals
 Implement comprehensive programs to provide guidance and training to franchisees while continuing to develop relationships with them.
 Changes in business environment
  Decline in market size of the Clean Service business
 Develop products, expand sales channels, and respond to diversified payment methods; expand the Care Service businesses, which are expected to grow, by recruiting new franchisees.
  Mister Donut business risks: changes in market trends, competition and consumer preferences; higher cost of ingredients
Expand the business through: new openings in urban and suburban areas; shop renovations and relocations to meet customers’ needs and locational factors; value-added menu development; business development mainly in Asia.
 Product safety
  Quality problems of products provided by the Direct Selling Group
 Objectively check safety and reliability of the products starting with the development stage; focus on maintaining quality standards even after the launch of products, by conducting quality checks from time to time.
 Food safety
   Food poisoning and violation of laws and ordinances, including Food Sanitation Act, at our shops and restaurants
  Develop and operate an internal food safety management system, including the establishment of hygiene management guidelines and regular voluntary inspections using third-party experts.
 Service quality
  Liabilities for accidents occurred when offering a service. Health hazards arising from service defects or problems involving equipment and materials
 Prepare manuals on accident prevention and emergency response, and thoroughly improve the skills of employees through education and training. Since service staff need to have certain technical skills, we will maintain a consistent level of service quality through training and licensing systems.
 Product manufacturing (Procurement)
 Difficulties in manufacturing products due to unexpected natural disasters and other emergencies
Procure products from multiple suppliers except where the products purchased rely on specific singular suppliers because of a unique production technology.
 Natural disasters
   Suspension of business operations or damage to facilities caused by large-scale natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods
  Establishment of a safety confirmation system, preparation of response manuals and maintenance of a business continuity plan to minimize the damage caused by natural disasters; conduct disaster response drills.
 Coronavirus pandemic
 How the pandemic will progress remains unclear, but should it continue for the long term, or should it become more severe, it has the potential of having an even greater impact on business performance
Implement countermeasures to prevent spread of infection and ensure safety, with customer safety the top priority. As a franchisor, we support all our franchisees to ensure that every shop and sales unit around the country stays in operation.
 Information security
   Significant problems such as personal information leaks caused by insufficient measures to counter external threats such as cyberattacks and inadequate IT security
  Formulate regulations such as Personal Information Protection Rules; conduct training for executives and employees; hold seminars for franchisees; develop and operate a system for safeguarding and managing personal information, including measures for IT system security.
   Duskin has formulated Rules on Insider Information Management and the Detailed Rules on Insider Information. All information on Duskin’s businesses, operations and performance is gathered and controlled at the IR Section, which is responsible for the handling of information. We disclose our information based on the belief that the timely and appropriate disclosure of corporate information to investors is the basis of a sound securities market. We are committed to ensuring the fairness and soundness of the securities market.
 Day of Resolve
At the Duskin Group, May 31, 2002 is known as the day of the Large Meat Dumpling incident*. On that day, the Duskin Group was issued a partial suspension of business order by the Osaka Prefectural Government due to a violation of the Food Sanitation Act. To remember the lessons of this event, and to ensure that they serve as a guide in the future, the Duskin Group has established May 31 as the Day of Resolve, a day on which every employee writes a message to consumers and to society in general reaffirming their pledge to always observe compliance. It has been nearly 20 years since the Large Meat Dumpling incident, and observing the Day of Resolve every year contributes to raising our awareness of the importance of compliance and to preventing such an incident from ever happening again.
*The Large Meat Dumpling incident: A food additive unauthorized at the time in Japan was used for the Large Meat Dumpling menu sold at Mister Donut. While Duskin discovered this problem at the early stage of the incident, the use of this food additive was not disclosed to the public until inquiries were made by the media. This resulted in severe social criticism.
Regarding climate change and other environmental-related risk, see pp. 52-53 of this report.

1. Analysis of Business Performance
 Overview
The economy during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (FY2020) declined dramatically due to the expanding coronavirus pandemic, giving rise to extraordinarily challenging circumstances. During this period, the number of new infections had declined but rebounded several times and again began to increase at the end of the fiscal year. There has yet to be a definitive projection on the timing of the end of the coronavirus pandemic. The economy had begun to move gradually, but the uncertainty we now face has intensified about the future. Amidst this environment, as we entered the final fiscal year of the Medium-Term Management Policy 2018, we faced a dramatically changing business environment caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In order to fulfill our most important responsibility, which is to maintain our franchise chain in good standing, we have given priority to the safety of our customers, franchisees and employees as we implement sales recovery measures, and at the same time established and carried out strategies to take changes in the business environment as growth opportunities.
Direct Selling Group, committed to helping our customers to fine-tune the rhythm of their daily lives, carried out research and development on the virus-reducing properties of materials, adsorbents and disinfectants used in existing rental products, in response to the increasing need for cleaning and hygiene services. The group focused on publicizing and selling products that have been recognized and certified by third-party institutions. The group also developed and provided new products and services, such as hygiene management products, a hygiene service package combining cleaning and technical services, and hygiene management for event venues. Through these measures, we are remaking our brand image into a company forging healthy environments in a broader sense, under the banner of “Creating Healthy Environments” for both consumers and businesses. We have also implemented advertising initiatives to boost recognition amongst consumers.
The Food Group also has carried out a series of initiatives, mainly to address the coronavirus pandemic. At Mister Donut, the Group’s primary business which has celebrated its 50th anniversary, we focused on takeout demand with MISDO Meets and other services amidst declining dine-in demand. We have also hired actor and singer Masaki Suda to be our 50th anniversary promotional ambassador. In order to ensure customer safety, we installed doors to all of our showcases at our cafeteria-style shops where customers pick up donuts from open showcases.
We also took steps to enhance our corporate governance. These steps included a review of the Operating Officer System to clarify the responsibilities of our Operating Officers and the launch of the successor development plan prepared during the previous year to train management-level successors.
 Sales and operating profit
Consolidated sales for FY2020 fell on the previous year by 5,332 million yen (3.4%) to 153,770 million yen. This is mainly attributable to declined sales for the Direct Selling Group due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic while the Food Group saw increased sales thanks to higher sales at Mister Donut. Consolidated operating profit fell by 1,926 million yen (29.3%) to 4,651 million yen. In addition to declines in gross profit due to dropping revenues, profits fell due to installation costs of showcase doors at the cafeteria-type locations at Mister Donut totaling of 1,137 million yen as well as advertising costs used to promote the tagline “Creating Healthy Environments” implemented in the fourth quarter.
Note: Amounts less than the stated units are dropped.
  Ordinary profit (non-operating income and expenses)
Ordinary profit fell on the previous year by 1,295 million yen (16.3%) to 6,633 million yen, though non-operating income
improved due primarily to increased sales at NAC Co., Ltd., an equity method affiliate.
 Profit attributable to owners of parent
Profit attributable to owners of parent fell 2,769 million yen (49.5%) on the previous year to 2,821 million yen. This was due primarily to declines on a gain on sales of investment securities as well as relief money of 1,658 million yen allotted mainly to franchisees in response to the significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

1. Expand building management systems, strengthen ZEB (Net Zero Energy Buildings) proposals, and facilitate the spread of energy usage with low environmental impact to maintain balance between a more comfortable environment and limiting energy consumption.
2. Strengthen expansion of total solutions, which includes processes from product and system proposals to construction and maintenance services.

The requirements for buildings are shifting to long life, safety and security, and environmental performance is becoming an increas- ingly large part of their value. We create proposals for manage- ment systems that consider not only the performance of individual products, but the building as a whole.
Moreover, going beyond simple energy-saving strategies, we are also strengthening ZEB solutions, which utilize renewable energy to enable energy usage for the building as a whole to be reduced to nearly zero. Kanaden has been certified as a ZEB
Planner, and has been working to establish a foundation for total system proposals.
By accelerating these initiatives, we will boost our approach to building owners and architectural design offices.
With the need for new buildings declining, we will also strengthen our initiatives in the areas of service and maintenance, and accumulate and analyze data to come up with new solutions that go beyond simple proposals for renovation.

1. Facilitate the transformation of businesses from the provision of components to solutions and consulting services by strengthening our solutions proposal capabilities.
2. Contribute to solving customer problems and the evolution of manufacturing with accumulated manufacturing facility knowledge in addition to the utilization of new technologies, such as AI and IoT, and automation proposals.
3. Promote and strengthen alliances with partner companies to improve responsiveness to deal with systems in Japan and overseas.

In recent years, by addressing the need for robots and automation at manufacturing sites, we have accumulated knowledge in various areas of cutting-edge technology. Going forward, as AI, 5G and other technologies that have wide applications become more common within society, we will need to change our sales style and customize our techniques to match customer requirements. Naturally we will propose individual components to help the customer resolve their issues, but by also gaining their trust through the proposal of entire solutions and in the area of consulting, we will maintain an ongoing business relationship. This is another reason to promote technological cooperation that transcends the barriers of individual divisions, combine it with technology developed in other areas of the business, and provide high value-added products.
In order to strengthen the deployment overseas of automation and labor-saving solutions developed in Japan, we are also seeking to bolster our structures for creating and supporting proposals made in cooperation with partner companies.

Initiatives of the ULVAC-Osaka University Joint Research Laboratory for Future Technology
On November 1, 2018, ULVAC, Inc. and the Graduate School of Engineering at Osaka University established the ULVAC-Osaka University Joint Research Laboratory for Future Technology (hereafter referred to as the “Joint Research Lab”) in the Central Terrace Building of the University’s Suita Campus. Through Osaka University’s industry- academia collaboration framework, the Joint Research Lab is working to achieve practical applications of the seeds of basic research in
the engineering field, contribute to academia and industry based on medicine-engineering collaboration in the medical field, and develop highly creative human resources by promoting industry-academia exchanges. ULVAC positions the Joint Research Lab as a center of excellence for basic research and aims to create new value, including creation of quantum dot phosphors employing ULVAC’s proprietary technologies, which will lead to next-generation displays including full- color illumination, as well as technology for their mass-production, and the establishment of fundamental technologies in medicine and next- generation ceramics as part of development of application for the ultra- fast freeze-drying technology.
1) Development of next-generation displays (quantum dot, LED) 2) Creation of next-generation devices using photon spin
3) Establishment of a cell preservation technique using ultrafast
 freeze-drying technology,
etc.

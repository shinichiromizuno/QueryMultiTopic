On September 22, 2021, ULVAC, Inc. and Tokyo Institute of Technology (hereinafter the “Tokyo Tech”) established the ULVAC Advanced Technology Collaborative Research Cluster (hereinafter the “Collaborative Research Cluster”) on the Ookayama Campus of Tokyo Tech. ULVAC and Tokyo Tech have achieved results through individual research cooperation, but to further strengthen the collaboration between the company and the university as organizational partners, we set up the Collaborative Research Cluster with the support of the Tokyo Tech Open Innovation Platform.
Combining the Tokyo Tech’s plasma diagnostics technology and AI technology, the Collaborative Research Cluster aims
to improve the performance of plasma processing equipment by measuring plasma conditions that could not be measured before. The synergy created by laboratories from different fields working together is expected to produce new research results that cannot be obtained through individual collaborative research. Additionally, leveraging this organization-to- organization collaboration will lead to a wide range of positive outcomes, not only in joint research but also in fields such as personnel development, leading to the advancement of future growth for both ULVAC and Tokyo Tech.

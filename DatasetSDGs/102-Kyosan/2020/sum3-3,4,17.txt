Kyosan supports Yokohama FC of J1 Soccer League as its sponsor. A professional soccer club based in Yokohama, Yokohama FC has been committed to act as “a club of citizens for citizens.”
In accordance with this commitment, the club organizes an event called “Let’s Play with Yokoha- ma FC!,” a program designed to improve the physi- cal fitness of local children. The staff members of Yokohama FC visit two after-school recreation clubs (“Hamakko Fureai School” and “Hokago Kids Club”), to help the children with learning how to cooperate with each other, be innovative and creative, and have challenging mindset though sports. Kyosan endorsed the idea of the program and has become its official partner.
Yokohama FC also organizes soccer lessons and matches at J-Village Stadium in Naraha-machi, Futaba District, Fukushima Pref., to support the reconstruction of the region which was severely damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Determined to provide a “never-fading and durable support,” the club members visit the region from Yokohama, to share the joy of challenges and physical activities. This supportive action is also sponsored by Kyosan.

Conducted by Yokohama Waterworks Bureau in partnership with private companies and other organizations, the “W-eco·p” is an initiative launched to improve and preserve a water source forest, located in Doshi-mura, Yamanashi Pref. and owned by Yokohama City. Kyosan participates in the financing of the project, to back up the improve- ment of the water source forest of 15ha in total to be completed in five years from 2020.
The rain and snow water falling on the ground are filtered by the soil of the water source forest, which eliminates the impurities contained in the water. Improving the conditions of water source forests is crucial for ensuring the supply of good-tasting and safe water. That is why Kyosan is committed to support the preservation of the forest where the water source of Yokohama is located.

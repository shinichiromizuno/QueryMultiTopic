Kyosan works to conserve the environment through measures such as reducing the environmental load in all of its business activities, including the provision of products and services.
We are therefore committed to proactively engaging in green procurement that considers the environment (prioritizing the purchase of products with low environmental impact) with regard to our procurement activities, and have created the Green Procurement Guidelines to promote material procurement that is compatible with environmental conservation.

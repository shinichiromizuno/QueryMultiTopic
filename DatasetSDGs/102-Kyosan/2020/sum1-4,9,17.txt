As a science and technology advisor to Yokohama Science Frontier High School and its affiliated junior high school, Kyosan provides them with educational programs for young students who will bear the next generation, on such subjects as “Role of Railway Signals” and “Creation of Things,” including through lectures, factory tours and exhibition at school festivals, as well as other opportunities to deepen the exchange with local communities.
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Company, we donated a 3D printer, a subsonic wind tunnel unit and fluid analysis simulation software to the schools. The 3D printer is used for the “3D Printer Contest,” in which the students compete on their skills of designing and elaborating 3D printed objects. The instructors and judges for this event are sent from the Company. In 2019, the students were invited to present objects associated with the 10th anniversary of the schools, and the best objects were selected and awarded by judges.

For Goal 17, “Strengthen the means of implementation and
revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development,” we do not only discover and develop innovative drugs independently
using world- leading technology and knowledge in various areas. We also vigorously pursue in-licensing and out-licensing of new drug candidates.
In addition to alliances with venture companies and other pharmaceutical companies, we form partnerships with a wide range of stakeholders
from universities and research institutes to government agencies, local communities and NPOs in an effort to resolve problems via open innovation.

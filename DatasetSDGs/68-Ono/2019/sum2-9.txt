For Goal 9, “Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive
and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation,”
ONO contributes to encouraging innovation and building research and development (R&D) infrastructure. To vitalize R&D in order to create new drugs, we will not only invest in internal R&D but also provide grants, such as those for investigator-initiated clinical trials. Furthermore, the ONO Medical Research Foundation and ONO Pharma Foundation promote research to help build a bedrock for innovation through research grants to researchers inside and outside Japan.

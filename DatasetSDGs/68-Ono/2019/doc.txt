To Achieve Sustained
Growth And Continue Being Needed by Society,
ONO PHARMACEUTICALS Works Toward Solving Issues
Facing Society Respecting its Corporate Philosophy

Since our establishment in 1717, we have upheld
the corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man’s
Fight against Disease and Pain,” and remain fully committed to the pharmaceutical business we engage in. We have united our efforts in meeting our challenge.
Making progress for more than 300 years, we have seen social conditions keep on changing but people’s desire to stay healthy and our mission of delivering innovative drugs to patients around the world have been and will be unchanged.
To achieve sustained growth, I believe we must respond rapidly with agility to any changes that challenge our operations. We must also fulfill our responsibility to all stakeholders including not only patients and healthcare professionals but also shareholders and investors, suppliers, local communities, and employees.
The environment surrounding healthcare, both inside and outside Japan, is changing significantly at astonishing speed.
In many developed countries, populations are aging with birth rates declining, and in emerging countries and developing countries, populations are increasing with longer average life expectancies. With these circumstances, increased social security costs are becoming a matter of public concern. Especially, Japan is facing significant increases in medical
and nursing care costs, making it harder to secure funding. The country therefore is proceeding with healthcare cost reduction measures including the fundamental review of the NHI drug pricing system. In addition, changes in disease structure and past
innovations have shifted targets with unmet medical needs for drug discovery and development to more complicated diseases. As a result, the success rates of drug discovery have dropped and development periods have been prolonged with increased R&D costs, challenges that pharmaceutical companies have to address.
Meanwhile, life science and medical technology are developing rapidly in scientific and technological advances. In addition, information and engineering technologies are growing more sophisticated and open innovation is progressing, creating merges not limited to within pharmaceutical/healthcare fields. I believe therefore we can be committed to solving many of the challenges as a pharmaceutical company.
Our destination beyond growth is to be a Global Specialty Pharma company, priding ourselves in the original and innovative new drugs we offer and in competing in the global arena. Embracing a wide range of values and hiring a diverse workforce, we are determined to take advantage of our strengths to the fullest extent to work toward that goal.
Holding up dignity and pride as a company that engages in the business of pharmaceuticals that impact human lives, we remain acutely aware of our social responsibility and will constantly face up to the challenge of disease and pain.
We highly appreciate your continued and most generous support and cooperation in these endeavors.

History of Tackling Challenges
We are always committed to meeting our challenges to discover innovative drugs.
   1962
 Professor Bergström deter- mined the chemical struc- ture of PGE1, PGF1α, etc.
 1965
 PGs came to ONO’s knowl- edge and ONO launched PG research.
Transforming from
an apothecary
to
a pharmaceutical manufacturer
Tackling “Impossible Challenge”: Prostaglandins
The History of our Prostaglandin Research
Established as an apothecary in 1717, ONO transformed into a full-fledged company with both manufacturing and sales functions in the 1947.
In 1965, motivated by the lecture of Dr. Bergström (later Nobel Prize winner) on invitation to the Association for Gerontological Research conference, ONO launched research on the bioactive lipid prostaglandins (PGs) to gamble
its future. At that time, PGs were said to be dream substances that had all possibilities to have major impact on pharmaceutical development. However, there was doubt that PGs could be commercialized as pharmaceuticals because they are produced in trace amounts in vivo and unstable substances that are lost in a short time. A team of a mere 20 researchers tackled PG biosynthesis, despite the lack of funding and research facilities, successfully producing PGs for research use. The team planned and tried to mass-produce PGs by chemical synthesis but didn’t achieve this end.
In 1967, ONO sent its researchers to Professor Corey (later Nobel Prize winner), who pioneered the total chemical synthesis of PGs, to have them learn its process. In 1968, ONO succeeded in the total chemical synthesis of PGs on a commercial basis for the first time in the world.
Contribution to Healthcare
It took 9 years since the start of PG research before ONO launched the world’s first PG drug on the market in 1974 and has since delivered 11 PG related products to patients.
 1968
 ONO became the world’s first company to succeed in the total chemical synthesis of PGs.
 1974
 ONO successfully devel- oped and launched the world’s first PG drugs on the market.
   12
ONO has channeled its abundant resources including research staff into drug discovery research in PGs, while driving forward R&D collaborations with academia as well as pharmaceutical companies both inside and outside Japan.
The world’s first PG products ONO developed and marketed were those in obstetrics and gynecology, and ONO subsequently developed and launched drugs to meet healthcare frontline needs in a wide range of domains including cardiovascular medicine, gastroenterology, and respiratory medicine. ONO has so far brought 12 items of PG products into the world.

   Tackling “New Conceptual Challenge”: Anti-PD-1 Antibody
The History of our Anti-PD-1 Antibody Research
PD-1 was discovered at Kyoto University and ONO started a research collaboration with the university in 1992. The functions of PD-1 had long been unknown. The researchers discovered in 1998 that PD-1 knockout mice develop autoimmune diseases, and found in 2002, 10 years after the identification of PD-1, that it plays a role in cancer immune evasion mechanism.
At that time, ONO was internally not positive to the research project as the company had no experience in anticancer drug development and no antibody generation technology. There was also a strong perception among healthcare professionals that was suspicious of the concept of treating cancer by boosting the immune system. This was a big hurdle that stood in the way of finding a joint development partner and seeking understanding from medical institutions to perform clinical trials. However, the R&D team was persistently committed to the project, without any preconceived ideas, believing in the potential of anti-PD-1 antibody. Their efforts changed the mindset within the company, which led to understanding and cooperation from healthcare professionals.
In 2014, when 22 years passed since the discovery of PD-1, the company obtained marketing approval for and launched cancer immunotherapy OPDIVO.
Contribution to Healthcare
Conventionally, the three pillars of cancer treatment have been surgery, chemotherapy (pharmacotherapy), and radiation therapy. They are added to by a novel approach to treatment brought about by OPDIVO, of which the action mechanism releases the brakes that cancer cells put on the body’s immune system. This is accordingly considered as an innovative approach and cancer immunotherapy is currently expected as the “4th cancer therapy.” It offers a new treatment option to healthcare professionals as well as patients for which traditional treatments have little therapeutic effect.
 1992
 Kyoto University isolated and identified PD-1 gene.
 2002
 PD-1 was found to be involved in immune evasion in cancer.
Further Innovation
 2006–
 Clinical trials using anti-PD-1 antibody started in the US in 2006 and in Japan in 2008.
 2014
 The antibody was launched in Japan for the first time in the world as a therapeutic drug against melanoma.
    11
OPDIVO has an action mechanism that does not directly attack cancer cells but utilizes the immune system to fight cancer, raising expectations for its potential to be effective across a wide range of tumors. Since marketing approval
for melanoma in 2014, the drug has been approved up to June 2019 for 11 tumor types around the world, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Clinical trials are still ongoing to obtain approval for additional tumor types.

OPDIVO
Intravenous Infusion for the Treatment of Malignant Tumors
Sales in FY2018
Percentage increase/ decrease from FY2017
        90.6 billion yen
 +0.5%
 OPDIVO is an anticancer drug approved in Japan for cancer immunotherapy targeting PD-1, a world first. It is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that reactivates antitumor immune response using the body’s own immune system.
In Japan, since its launch to the market in September 2014, OPDIVO has been approved for 7 types of cancer (as of June 2019). Despite the influence of NHI drug price reduction, OPDIVO expanded sales in FY2018 to 90.6 billion yen thanks to an increase in volume terms mainly resulting from addition of cancer indications.
KYPROLIS
for Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Malignant Tumors
In the world except Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, ONO’s partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (US) has obtained regulatory approval in more than 60 countries for the treatment of several types of cancer and has been proceeding with adding indications for other cancers. Accordingly, royalty income based on OPDIVO sales overseas increased to 58.5 billion yen for FY2018.
Competition is heating up in development and marketing of cancer immunotherapy inside and outside Japan, especially in the lung cancer area. While promoting OPDIVO’s proper use and collecting information on its safety, ONO is working hard on adding indications for other cancers, extending the therapy line as well as developing combination therapies. ONO will continue working to maximize OPDIVO’s value.
In the drive to add more indications to OPDIVO, ONO is currently working to obtain approval for more than 20 additional cancer indications. In Japan, ONO applied for approval of partial changes in approved items for treatment of advanced or recurrent MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer in March 2019 and unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer in May 2019.
KYPROLIS is a highly selective anti-multiple myeloma drug that inhibits the action of proteasome, an enzyme complex within human cells, thereby causing functional cell death of myeloma cells. The sales of KYPROLIS reached 4.9 billion yen in FY2018. Multiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy caused by abnormality of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Although several regimens for multiple myeloma are currently available, the disease progresses in remitting-relapsing nature and eventually no longer responds to therapy, also known as refractory disease. Additionally, adverse drug reactions and co-morbid conditions have been reported following long-term treatment, making continued treatment difficult.
Amid increased competition from the fast-paced launch of new anti-multiple myeloma drugs, ONO reviewed the framework for information dissemination activities in October 2018 to conduct the activities with higher levels of expertise.
In March 2019, ONO submitted supplemental application of KYPROLIS. With the current dosage and administration, KYPROLIS should be given twice a week. This application is intended for approval for once-weekly administration.

EMEND Capsules / PROEMEND
for Intravenous Injection for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting
DEMSER Capsule
for the Improvement of Status of Catecholamine Excess Secretion in Pheochromocytoma
BRAFTOVI Capsule and MEKTOVI Tablet
for the Treatment of Malignant Tumors
EMEND / PROEMEND is the first selective neurokinin
(NK) 1 receptor antagonist in the world. It is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.
More patients with cancer are treated with immunotherapy drugs and a smaller number of patients are using an anticancer drug with high emetogenic risk. Meanwhile, following major overseas guidelines, including NCCN Guidelines and ASCO Guidelines, antiemetic guidelines issued by Japan Society of Clinical Oncology released in October 2018 have recommended the use of EMEND
for patients using an anticancer drug with moderate emetogenic risk, and the use of EMEND is expanding. The FY2018 sales of EMEND / PROEMEND increased by 6.6% to 10.6 billion yen from the previous year.
DEMSER is a promising drug with an efficacy in the improvement of the symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma (PC), a neuroendocrine tumor, who are not able to sufficiently control the symptoms caused
by catecholamine excessively secreted from PC—including hypertension, tachycardia, headache, palpitation—with sympatholytic drugs which have been usually used. Launched to the market in February 2019, DEMSER is a product for which development companies were recruited in Japan at the “Review Committee on Unapproved or Off- label Drugs with High Medical Needs,” established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), and ONO has been developing this product. In May 2015, the product was designated for the orphan drug by the MHLW.
BRAF inhibitor BRAFTOVI and MEK inhibitor MEKTOVI suppress the proliferation of tumors by targeting and selectively inhibiting the key enzymes of BRAF and MEK1/ MEK2, respectively, which are different kinases associated with cancers. The combination therapy is expected to provide more potent anti-tumor effects.
BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI were launched in February
2019 for use in combination therapy for the indication of unresectable melanoma with a BRAF mutation. Currently, the drugs are undergoing clinical trials for BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer.

for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes
GLACTIV, a dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 4 inhibitor, is an oral drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes. It regulates blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients with the mechanism of action selectively inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme that metabolizes a gastrointestinal hormone, incretin. It thereby enhances the body’s own insulin secretion ability in a glucose dependent manner and decreases glucagon release, signaling the liver to reduce its production of glucose. Impacted by competitors such as combination drugs and once- weekly administered formulations in addition to the NHI drug pricing reform, the sales of GLACTIV for FY2018 decreased 1.8% to 26.9 billion yen from
the previous year. Appealing the strength of GLACTIV with data of clinical trials in Japanese elderly patients and a large amount of efficacy and safety information accumulated through its long-term use by patients in Japan, ONO will carry on its effort at earning its reputation for GLACTIV Tablets being the first-choice drug in treatment of type 2 diabetes.
FORXIGA Tablets
for the Treatment of Diabetes
FORXIGA is an oral drug for the treatment of diabetes. This drug reduces blood sugar by excreting excess blood glucose via urine through the inhibition of SGLT2, a transporter
that acts to regulate reabsorption of glucose in the kidney tubules. With evidence accumulated for suppressing cardiovascular events, SGLT2 inhibitor is earning growing reputation. Its sales for FY2018 increased 31.0% to 14.5 billion yen from the previous year. In March 2019, FORXIGA was approved for additional indication of type 1 diabetes.

ORENCIA is a subcutaneous injection for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It inhibits secretion of cytokines by blocking the signal that activates T cells, resulting in the suppression of joint inflammation. The RA drug market is becoming more competitive due to the entrance of generic versions of widely used TNF inhibitors and competing auto- injectors. With the entire RA drug market growing, however, ORENCIA for subcutaneous injection is seeing increased use, well evaluated by healthcare professionals in terms of both efficacy and safety. ONO will continue directing efforts toward raising patients’ quality of life. The sales of ORENCIA for FY2018 increased 23.3% to 17.4 billion yen from the previous year.
RIVASTACH Patch
for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease
RIVASTACH Patch is a transdermal patch for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. It reduces the progression of deteriorating cognitive functions such as memory loss (forgetfulness) and disorientation (inability to recognize time and place) by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and thereby increasing the amount of acetylcholine in the brain and enhancing neurotransmission. While antidementia drug needs are increasing, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor sales are affected by generic drug use expansion. The sales of RIVASTACH for FY2018 increased 0.2% to 8.9 billion yen from the previous year. In March 2019, ONO obtained approval for the formulation containing a new base of RIVASTACH Patch with a synthetic rubber.

Discovering Innovative Drugs to Enhance ONO’s Identity, ONO always Meets the Challenges that Face us
to Create Values for our Stakeholders through Business Activities
Q1 Tell us about ONO’s business results and prospects for the future.
We achieved increased sales and revenues for FY2018 and see steady future growth prospects.
A1
In our consolidated financial results for FY2018, revenue increased by 10.2% and operating profit increased by 2.2% compared to FY2017, resulting in sales and profit growth. The revenue of products and goods were 208.9 billion yen. The anticancer drug OPDIVO, one of our core products, faced increased competition in addition to price cutting. However, its sales ended almost flat thanks to a significant year-on-year increase in volume terms supported mainly by the expansion of indications to gastric cancer, with which many patients are afflicted in Japan, and safety information accumulated through its administration to many patients. The sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug ORENCIA and diabetes drug FORXIGA increased by 23.3% and 31.0%, respectively, over the previous year. In addition, royalty and other income from increased overseas OPDIVO sales substantially went up, contributing greatly to the entire business results.
On cost grounds, R&D costs were 70 billion yen, an increase of 1.2 billion yen from the previous year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses excluding R&D costs were 70 billion yen, an increase of 2 billion yen from the previous
year. The R&D costs per sales were 24.3%, considerably higher than the pharmaceutical industry’s average]. As a pharmaceutical company dedicated to drug development, we continue to actively invest in R&D while curbing nonessential spending to generate earnings and improve profit margins.
In FY2019, we hope to obtain marketing approval applied in FY2018 for several drugs in development pipeline, which will contribute to sales in the second half.
For information, we transferred the domestic marketing approval for our 11 long-listed products (5 brands) to Maruishi Pharmaceutical, leading us to concentrate management resources on the discovery, development
and commercialization of new drugs to achieve further sustained growth.

017 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

  Q2
A2
Tell us about the R&D performance and outlook.
We launched three drugs on the market in FY2018 and applied for approval for new drugs and supplemental approval for many additional indications. In FY2019, we will also launch three new drugs and file many approval applications.
Gyo Sagara
President, Representative Director, and CEO
We are currently working to develop combination therapies in an effort to maximize the product value of the anticancer drug OPDIVO, the biggest growth driver at ONO. In FY2018, we made great progress by obtaining approval
(for additional indication) for combination therapy with the immunotherapy drug YERVOY in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Although OPDIVO had been approved for monotherapy only in renal cell carcinoma patients with treatment history with other anticancer drugs, the drug can now be used in combination with YERVOY in patients without such treatment history.
In addition to OPDIVO, FY2018 saw great progress in the oncology domain. We launched BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI for treatment of melanoma. We applied for marketing approval of ANAMORELIN for improvement of body weight loss and
anorexia in patients with cancer cachexia.
Other than the oncology domain, we launched DEMSER, a product for which we developed as a development company recruited at the Review Committee on Unapproved or Off-label Drugs with High Medical Needs. We obtained approval of ONOACT and FORXIGA for additional indication of ventricular arrhythmia and type 1 diabetes, respectively. In addition, we applied for approval of IVABRADINE for
the treatment of chronic heart failure and of OPICAPONE for improvement of the end-of-dose motor fluctuations of Parkinson's disease.
We believe that expanding our product lineup would contribute to treatment of more patients and significantly to our financial results beyond FY2019. In FY2019, we hope to file many applications for approval as in the previous year.

Q3 What do you think the pharmaceutical industry is required to do?
The industry is increasingly required to keep balance between innovation and cost.
A3
Political and economic instability is increasing across the world, and natural disasters, such as earthquakes and heavy rains, occur more frequently causing higher degree of damage to affected countries. We have to always be ready to respond with agility to risks arising from various changes, while always working with good judgement based on accurate information to take change as an opportunity to further grow.
To be a going concern, we are also highly required to contribute to solving social and environmental challenges through business activities. We try to figure out and put into practice in daily business activities what we can do beyond drug discovery for society as a corporate citizen.
The environment surrounding the pharmaceutical industry has been toughening for a long time and this situation is expected to continue in the years to come. Drug discovery
is becoming increasingly more difficult and development costs are surging. Meanwhile, healthcare cost reduction measures are inevitably further promoted with populations aging and birthrates dropping in major countries in the world.
Under such severe circumstances, however, we have to develop and distribute innovative drugs, even in next 100 years that bring true benefit to all patients. We need to use management resources effectively to create innovations
in years to come, and to discover better drugs faster and
at less cost for patients around the world who need new drugs. We also have to work across the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that innovations created undergo proper evaluation, so that pharmaceutical companies can continue to make positive contributions to society.
Q4 What do you think about ONO’s relationship with society?
We do not only develop high quality pharmaceuticals that contribute to healthcare. But we also contribute through business activities to solving issues facing society and creating sustainable society.
A4
Our social mission is not limited to developing and supplying drugs that conduce to healthcare. Under the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct stating that we must work in harmony with society and local environment, we conduct business activities with mutual prosperity in mind. Such ideas and actions are in common with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, which are to be achieved by 2030, including actions to end poverty, improve health and well-being, and combat climate change. As the SDGs are common goals for the international community including developing and developed countries, the SDGs can be used to identify business opportunities and risks.
Given that corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts are increasingly expected to be made and that our corporate scale is expanding, we have redefined our important CSR issues (materiality). We have also chosen SDGs that we
should particularly contribute to achieving in relation to our specified materiality.
We strive to develop high-quality drugs that meet healthcare needs, thereby contributing to achieving SDG
3, “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,” while pursuing business activities that help solve social issues and realize sustainable society.
 019 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

Q5 Tell us about ONO’s business model.
We specialize in and focus management resources into drug development.
A5
To achieve sustained growth in a tough and complex business environment, we believe it important to focus our finite management resources on drug discovery and development as an R&D-based pharmaceutical company specializing in prescription medicines to contribute to realizing social sustainability.
ONO’s business model we pursue is not only to take up the challenge of discovering our own innovative drugs but to develop new drugs with promising new drug candidate compounds in-licensed from around the world.
ONO’s Unique Drug Discovery Approach
and Disease Expertise Enhancement
We work on discovering original and innovative drugs by identifying unique compounds with use of disease expertise. Our drug discovery process is based on our unique drug discovery approach: the “Compound-Orient” approach.
Since successful total chemical synthesis of bioactive lipid prostaglandins (PGs) in the 1960s, we have collected a library of compounds that may act on various therapeutic targets such as lipids and enzymes. We utilize this library in the approach to find diseases against which the properties of compounds are most potentially effective. This approach, although highly risky, may lead to discovering compounds with unique pharmacological action.
In addition, we have been driving open innovation for
more than 60 years through the adoption of world-
leading technologies and knowledge. We globally pursue various forms of collaborations that may lead to discovery
of new drug candidate compounds, including research collaborations with world top-class scientists as well as drug discovery alliances with biopharmaceutical companies with leading-edge technologies.
In drug discovery research, we focus on four priority areas: oncology, immunology, neurology, and specialty products. Based on the compound-orient approach, we accumulate knowledge and expertise of diseases in each of the priority areas at the Research Centers of Oncology, Immunology, Neurology, and Specialty Products established in each domain to identify and develop innovative and breakthrough pharmaceutical products for disease treatment that is high in healthcare needs where patient satisfaction with current treatment is low.
Licensing Activities
In addition to in-house drug discovery, licensing strategy is another important point for stable, forward-looking expansion of our development pipeline for the future. We vigorously work on in-licensing of new drug candidate compounds that have high value in terms of corporate strategy and efficiency.
For in-licensing of new drug candidate compounds, we are facing more intense competition with other companies. Taking advantage of our compact corporate scale, we move with speed to seek collaboration partner candidates. Considering the properties of in-house developed compounds and the competitive environment we face, we examine and determine strategy per compound or product to out-license at early development stage or at a stage
where the compound is indicated to be effective and safe
in clinical practice; or to take the compound forward to in- house development or own marketing outside Japan. Even when determining out-licensing, we take into account per compound or product the possibility of future own marketing operations in candidate destinations.

Q6 Could you tell us what your growth strategy is for the future?
We implement a new growth strategy to push toward becoming a global player.
A6
To become a global player, we currently conduct business activities under four growth strategies: “Maximizing Product Value,” “Game-changing R&D,” “Globalizing Business,” and “Strengthening Corporate Infrastructure.”
(a) Maximizing Product Value
Through active R&D efforts, companywide collaboration and enhanced HR development capacity, we will achieve expedited market launch and additional indication approval and peak sales in the shortest period from launch. In addition, we will develop a strategy formation that constantly ensures competitive advantage by adjusting with agility to environmental changes in each stage of the product life cycle. We will thereby maximize the potential of every product we offer.
(b) Game-changing R&D
In the world, there are still many people suffering from disease without therapy at all. We are striving to achieve its vision of becoming a Global Specialty Pharma company that can satisfy as-yet unmet medical needs. Based on
our unique drug discovery “Compound-Orient” approach, we have identified the oncology, immunology, neurology, and specialty domains with high medical needs as our priority areas of research, so as to accumulate knowledge and expertise of diseases in each of the priorty areas for developing new drugs that will provide new treatment options with innovation to the frontline of healthcare. For this, we will strengthen and enhance research and drug discovery alliance with world-leading universities, research
institutes, and biopharmaceutical companies in specific research areas so that we can expand our development pipeline aiming first-in-class drugs with high originality. We will also drive forward activities in areas with great medical needs, by in-licensing innovative compounds and acquiring novel technologies.
(c) Globalizing Business
To supply the world with new drugs that we have created, we are reinforcing overseas business expansion in anticipation of our own overseas marketing of specialty products such
as anticancer drugs and other specialty medicines. In South Korea and Taiwan, we have already set up wholly owned subsidiaries and have started selling our products. We are also working to improve and strengthen our development and other systems, with a view to future marketing through our own sales organizations in US and Europe.
(d) Strengthening Corporate Infrastructure
We continue to reinforce our operational infrastructure, with global standards in mind, in order to expand our overseas business and to continuously beat off the intense competition with other companies. We need to adapt to diverse changes in our business environment and overcome competition.
For this purpose, we must develop human resources
and encourage diversity so that we can have a stronger framework for development. In addition, we strive to fulfill our social responsibility toward all stakeholders, through advancing activities in line with key challenges that we have identified to address to achieve long-term sustained growth.

Q7 Tell us about your strategic investments to build poles of growth.
We focus on investing in creating new innovations and human resources development.
A7
Creating Innovations
We continue actively driving R&D investment so that we can discover new drugs truly desired by patients and deliver them as quickly as possible to the frontline of healthcare. To create next innovations, we need to ensure the quality of R&D. We also have to work toward expanding our corporate scale to boost funds for R&D spending from around 70 billion yen now to as much as 100 billion yen.
Our past experience tells us that it is difficult to keep on discovering innovative drugs in-house alone. We believe it important to learn outstanding knowledge and technologies from outside around the world. To do this, we actively conduct research collaborations and drug discovery alliances. Currently, we are conducting more than 300 joint
research projects with universities, research institutes and biopharmaceutical companies inside and outside Japan.
We have teams in place at our research division and local subsidiaries in the US and Europe which are in charge of finding exploratory research alliance partners and building productive alliance framework. Our staff assuming this role visit academic institutions, etc. on their own to propose and plan more constructive joint research projects through dialogues with world top-class researchers.
We pursue development of advanced drug discovery technologies on a global basis. During the past several years, we have adopted new discovery modalities and technologies through partnership, including discovery of drug candidate compound exploiting bispecific antibody technology and
drug discovery in neurology disease area exploiting artificial intelligence technology.
We post our researches to joint research and drug discovery alliance partners to engage in original research projects and bring knowledge and results gained therefrom back to us at ONO to boost the level of research capabilities that we have as an organization.
We devote prominent resources and efforts toward acceleration of open innovation much more than other companies of the same scale do, striving toward creating new drug seeds that may contribute to the frontline of healthcare in the future.
Human Resource Development
To turn ONO into what can be called a Global Specialty Pharma,
we have to keep strengthening our corporate infrastructure in
line with global standards. It is essential, among other things, to develop human resources and create employee-friendly working environments. So, we are keenly making investments into, including, organizational improvements and promotion of efforts to build a sense of ownership at work.
To adapt quickly and flexibly to ever-changing business conditions, we have to hire a diverse workforce. We work hard to promote
and include diversity in our workplaces. We believe that diversity enhancement means building working environments where everyone can be motivated regardless of race, nationality, gender, career, and other attributes including behavioral characteristics and set of values. We try to improve by learning from others, which could result to create a climate of generation for global innovation. To develop and energize human resources, we will continue enhancing training programs to provide employees with opportunities for growth and awareness, considering changes inside and outside the company.
We have been strengthening mid-career professional recruitment to promptly reinforce capabilities we need as a company that handles life-supporting products. Notably, we hired more than 400 midcareer professionals in FY2018, compared to only two in FY2012. Currently, we hold workshops for employees to achieve and deepen understanding of our mission statement, so that all employees with diverse backgrounds can work together toward realizing our vision. It needs to make our workplaces more worker-friendly to ensure that diverse workers can demonstrate their full potential in their organization. We are implementing programs and improving systems, giving consideration to ensuring that all employees maintain a good work-life balance. We are also reforming the mindset of employees, who can benefit from them. We promote working group activities and information sharing for improving operational efficiency, so that individual employees can maximize their value per hour through reformation of their mindset of the way they work using such programs and systems.
In addition, we conduct health and productivity management. We have increased staffing and strengthening activities of the Health Up Committee—which was set up in April 2018 with members from the company, the labor union, the occupational health staff, and the health insurance society—for promoting health maintenance/ improvement of employees and their families.

Q8 Tell us about your governance system.
A8
We work to raise the effectiveness of our corporate governance.
We need to secure the trust of all stakeholders and fulfil our
social responsibility to realize sustained growth and increase our medium- to long-term corporate value. We therefore continue working to enhance our corporate governance and to pursue management that fulfill responsibility to all stakeholders.
In terms of corporate governance, we believe that our critical issues are not only the compliance of laws but also the enforcement of our management transparency and soundness to respond to the trust of all stakeholders and increase our corporate value. With this in mind, we are committed to developing a more effective governance system considering the business environment surrounding us and our business results.
Currently, our Board of Directors consists of eight members including three outside directors. Outside directors participate
in decision-making process of business strategies and other important management matters. They oversee the execution of directors’ duties by checking mainly business reports and the status of internal control system development and operation. As members of the Executive Appointment Meeting and the Executive Compensation Meeting, they also exercise effective supervision over the management. As for operational management, we are striving to improve management efficiency and speed up decision- making through, for example, implementation of a corporate
officer system with delegation of authority. We also ensure that operations are managed under the check and balance supervision system. Management challenges are reviewed and decided
for execution, depending on their importance and content, at meetings chaired by the responsible director or corporate officer. Our Board of Auditors consists of two thoroughly independent outside auditors and two full-time auditors who are thoroughly familiar with ONO’s business and have the authority to gather high-level information. The outside auditors, the posts assumed by a lawyer and a certified public accountant with broad advanced knowledge of corporate legal or accounting affairs, cooperate with the full-time auditors to raise audit effectiveness. The auditors conduct audits in cooperation with our Internal Audit Capability (Business Audit Department) and accounting auditors.
In December 2017, we participated in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which consists of ten principles in four areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We signed to join the UNGC to penetrate the ten principles to all employees through daily activities.
 Q9 Tell us about your efforts to earn credibility with the public.
We work to ensure product reliability and safety assurance and stable product supply, and to raise compliance awareness.
A9
The effectiveness of ensuring compliance will translate into earning our credibility with the public and improving our corporate value. We work to raise compliance awareness broadly. Internally, we do not only develop and raise compliance awareness by having regulations and programs in place to ensure compliance. But we also strengthen mutually assured compliance under a cross-functional compliance promotion system. Externally, we strongly request our affiliates and suppliers to take same measures for compliance.
Prescription drugs are related to human life and health. Pharmaceutical companies should manage various possible risks
that might exist internally and externally and should address them quickly and properly if occurring. To perform proper risk management of our corporate group including subsidiaries,
with appropriate internal rules in place, we have prepared handling procedures and regularly review them in response to the business environment. We also overhauled our business continuity plan (BCP) in 2016, improving our emergency response capabilities.
We have also been working to strengthen the emergency response systems at our business operation sites so that each site can continue business activities and secure stable supply in

case of a large-scale emergency. In March 2018, our new Tokyo Building was completed, equipped with facilities in preparation for disasters. It is designed to serve as another emergency command center besides our headquarters in Osaka. In addition, a new plant has been completed in Yamaguchi Prefecture,
due to go into operation in spring 2020, joining the current main Fujiyama Plant in Shizuoka Prefecture to strengthen our production systems.
To assure the reliability and safety of drugs on the market, it
is essential to implement evidence-based production activities and for medical representatives (MRs) to provide accurate drug information and collect and feedback drug safety information. We have a framework in place that can lead to further quality improvement. In this framework, we can analyze and evaluate, based on latest scientific evidence, information provided by healthcare professionals and patients as well as collected from scientific literature and surveys, and provide latest evidence- based, accurate information to the frontline of healthcare.
Q10 What do you think about relationships with stakeholders including shareholders?
A10 We strengthen relationships with all stakeholders
while communicating with them in pursuing business activities.
Companies work with various stakeholders in pursuing business activities. We have to ensure legal compliance, corporate governance, and transparency. However, we believe we also have to build and continue strengthening relationships with
all stakeholders through business activities respecting their interests and dialogues with them, to attain sustained growth toward becoming a Global Specialty Pharma.
We adhere to the policy of disclosing necessary information accurately, fairly, impartially, and promptly to all stakeholders— including patients, healthcare professionals, shareholders, investors, suppliers, local communities, employees, relevant governmental agencies, and industrial associations—to promote communication/constructive dialogues with them.
We consider the redistribution of profits to shareholders as a vital management policy.
In terms of dividend pay-out, we will prioritize stable dividend distribution in the medium to long term while taking account
of our business results and general social conditions, making
appropriate distribution of our profits in line with our business performance. We regard the purchase of treasury shares as
part of raising capital efficiency and comprehensive shareholder returns. As usual, we will flexibly consider and carry out the purchase, keeping future demand for funds in mind, for the purpose of redistributing more profit to shareholders, raising capital efficiency or tightening the supply-demand balance in the stock market. If we purchase our own shares, we intend to hold up to 10 percent of them as treasury stock and cancel the rest. We periodically review the proper benchmarks of management indices including ROE and work hard to achieve higher performance so that these indices will go up.
As an R&D-based pharmaceutical company, we would like to fulfill the expectations of stakeholders. We will continue to meet various challenges that face us to become a company undergoing growth in middle and long term. We highly appreciate your continued support.

  Management Strategy

About ONO’s Materiality
ONO has striven for CSR by defining important areas of focus based on the ISO 26000. In FY2018, in addition to responding to external requirements, we redefined our materiality (important CSR issues) to clarify CSR themes which we should emphasize. ONO actively engages in CSR according to the new materiality that we have established.
n Overall Flow for Determining Materiality
   Step 2: Analyze Materiality
Step 3: Verify Validity
Step 4: Review
We broadly grasped and organized CSR issues per value chain in our business activities based on the ISO 26000, the GRI Standards, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the evaluation items for socially responsible investment.
We analyzed the CSR issues by importance from the point of view of ONO and importance based on expectations of our stakeholders, and then mapped each of those CSR issues on a horizontal and a vertical axis. The importance from the point of view of ONO was assessed by our Directors, Corporate Officers and CSR Committee Members based on our corporate policy, and priority and importance were evaluated for each issue.
The importance based on expectations of our stakeholders incorporated the feedback received from our shareholders and investors in addition to the evaluation items of institutions that practice responsible investment as the representatives of stakeholders outside of ONO. When we review the items and importance of materiality in the future, we will further incorporate the opinions of an even greater number of stakeholders.The results of this materiality analysis were deliberated and determined by the CSR Committee before gaining approval at the Management Meeting chaired by the CEO.
We engaged in a dialogue with external experts about the process of our materiality analysis, the identified themes that are set and future initiatives to verify the validity of each important issue. ■ The dialogue with external experts is described in detail on ONO’s CSR site.

 Game-changing R&D
Our Mission in Research and Development
 Deliver our contribution to society by developing drugs that truly benefit patients
Drug Discovery Strategy
▌Drug Discovery Research
 Based on the “compound-orient” drug discovery approach focusing on characteristic bioactive lipids and unique drug targets to generate innovative new drug candidate compounds, we have established a research organization in each of the newly specified four priority areas of drug discovery. Each organization accumulates knowledge and expertise of diseases in each of the priority areas to properly understand healthcare needs, working toward developing breakthrough pharmaceutical products with medical impacts.
In addition to small molecule drug discovery on which we have focused, we also tackle the challenge of providing new treatment options with innovation to the healthcare frontline by using biologicals including antibodies, cells and viruses.
▌Drug Discovery Research Domains
We enhance knowledge and expertise of diseases in each of the priority areas by focusing our resources on the oncology, immunology, neurology, and specialty research domains as priority areas with high medical needs. To reinforce our competitiveness in drug discovery in each domain, we performed structural reform in April 2019 by adding the Research Centers of Immunology, Neurology, and Specialty Products to the already-existing Oncology Research Center.
Keeping in mind our R&D mission “Deliver our contribution to society by developing drugs that truly benefit patients,” we are tackling diseases that remain unconquered as yet, and addressing areas that are high in healthcare needs where patient satisfaction with current treatment is low. Our discovery research aims to identify and develop innovative and breakthrough pharmaceutical products.

▌Open Innovation
ONO has discovered new drug discovery seeds and developed breakthrough new drugs initiated therefrom through collaboration with research institutes including universities since before the words “open innovation” started to become widely used. We continue to vigorously pursue research collaborations with world top-class researchers mainly in the priority areas of research. To speed up, and raise success rates of, development of new drug candidate compounds from the seeds, we will strengthen and enhance drug discovery alliances with biopharmaceutical companies using advanced technologies of the partners to further expand our R&D pipeline.
In FY2018, following the forming in FY2017 of alliances for human bispecific antibody development and for advanced computational method-based drug discovery, we joined the establishment of the academic-industrial “Immune-mediated Inflammatory Diseases Consortium for Drug Discovery,” which consists of academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in Japan. We also continued vigorously forming drug discovery alliances with biopharmaceutical companies with proprietary or superior technology. Such partnering activities successfully initiated include a collaboration agreed with Fate Therapeutics (US) for discovery and development of off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T]-cell drugs for cancers; a research collaboration agreed with twoXAR (US) for discovery and development of neurological disease drugs using AI technology; a drug discovery collaboration agreed with Vect-Horus (France) for discovery and development of neurodegenerative disease drug candidates; and a strategic drug discovery alliance agreed with Cancer Research UK and LifeArc (UK) for cancer immunotherapy.
We will continue directing our drug discovery efforts into the future toward discovery and development of innovative new drugs in priority areas of diseases with as-yet unmet medical needs, focusing on oncology, immunology, neurology, and specialty products, by maximizing our open innovation strategy. For this, it is important to collect cutting-edge scientific information and proceed with drug discovery based thereon ahead of the competition as fast as possible. We post middle-ranked employees with extensive experience in discovery research to our overseas subsidiaries in the US and UK, and they visit world top-class researchers and biopharmaceutical companies in the US and Europe to launch alliances. Pursuing collaborations with speed, we work to create new drugs that can bring about innovation in the healthcare frontline.
] CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) therapy:
CAR-T cell therapy is a type of cancer immunotherapy. The CAR includes parts recognizing cancer antigen and T-cell activating domain. Once the CAR-T cell recognizes cancer via CAR, the CAR-T cell is going to be highly activated and kill the cancer cells.
A Research Capability Combining Knowledge with Technology
The development of innovative new drugs is driven by the spirit of challenge and the motivation of individual scientists and their ability to think creatively responding to change. We set high and achievable targets with clear outcomes, in order to enhance motivation and creative thinking among our researchers. ONO’s research organization is based on project teams where members converge from different fields, bringing cutting-edge expertise from contrasting backgrounds. The interaction within the teams stimulates and mutually enhances our research achievements. Each project team actively promotes open innovation with the aim of discovering innovative drugs with top-class researchers all over the world.
We conduct drug discovery research through coordination of the efforts of three laboratories, the Minase Research Institute, the Fukui Research Institute and the Tsukuba Research Institute, and work to strengthen our research capability to further accelerate, and raise success rates of, drug discovery. In April 2019, a Translational Research Laboratories was newly established in the Research Project Management to bridge between basic and clinical research for the promotion of research. The Minase Research Institute’s research building No. 3, our center for invention and medicinal chemistry, has seen more than three years of operation, which started in March 2016. Now integration of our compound synthesis and analysis functions has further matured, and thereby driving R&D forward by building capability with consistency in chemistry research, from exploration of breakthrough drug seeds through to clinical researches. This has led to strengthening combination of knowledge and technology among researchers and among teams.
The Minase Research Institute
The Institute has a wide variety of research functions, including medicinal chemistry, research into the characteristics and efficacies of compounds, discovery research in oncology, immunology, neurology, and specialty product domains, exploratory research for analysis of disease-causing substances and new compounds that can control these substances, research aimed at the development of formulations whose quality and function as pharmaceutical products can be assured, as well as mass production and cost reduction for the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients.
The Fukui Research Institute

 Game-changing R&D
Accelerated Clinical Development
We are committed to promoting clinical development with enthusiasm to deliver new drugs that meet the needs of frontline healthcare as soon as possible, for the benefit of people suffering diseases throughout the world.
To create development plans and trial designs with the aim of obtaining marketing approval in the shortest time, we work to properly understand unmet needs of the healthcare frontline by analyzing target diseases multilaterally. We also proceed with activities with the Discovery and Research Division to shorten the period from commencement of drug discovery to establishment of efficacy and safety in humans (POC). In addition, we are speeding up collecting the data required for filing applications for marketing approval in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan by conducting multinational clinical trials and advancing mutual use of results from overseas studies with our partners.
In April 2019, we strengthened our system for promoting quality enhancement and speedy clinical development by newly establishing within the Clinical Development Division a CRO Management Department specifically designed to increase in quality of trials and in efficiency of relevant management tasks, including clinical trial quality control and regulatory inspection handling.
Currently, we have almost as many as 100 clinical trials ongoing mainly in the immuno-oncology domain, one of our key strategic areas.
In clinical development in the oncology domain, we are progressing investigation of biomarkers and combination therapies as a pioneer in cancer immunotherapy to provide patients with better treatment options.
Starting in January 2018, we have an Oncology Clinical Development Department in place, which consists of the Oncology Early Clinical Development Planning for early clinical development stage and the Oncology Clinical Development Planning for late clinical development stage. A similar organizational structure was set up for clinical development in the primary care domain. In October 2018, we reorganized the Primary Care Clinical Development into the Early Clinical Development Planning for early clinical development stage and the Clinical Development Planning for late clinical development stage.
We have strengthened our system that can accelerate implementation of POC establishment and validation study, so as to meet the needs of frontline healthcare as soon as possible.
Vigorous Activities for Licensing Initiatives
We continue to forge ahead with licensing activities to take in new drug candidates with the aim of introducing compounds attractive for diseases with high therapeutic need, and compounds that have high value in terms of corporate strategy and efficiency, while taking into consideration the development pipeline and existing products. Our aim is to expand the development pipeline to provide a continuous stream of new market launches. In the oncology domain, we take advantage of our strength with OPDIVO in acquiring product candidate compounds in a wide range of areas such as molecular target drugs including antitumor drugs and cell therapies.
Our licensing activities have brought about results. For example, we launched the MEK inhibitor binimetinib and the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in Japan for melanoma treatment in February 2019, the inhibitors of which we obtained a license from Array BioPharma (US) in FY2017 for development and commercialization in Japan and South Korea. Clinical trials are also ongoing for colorectal cancer treatment with the products. In FY2018, we started collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical to conduct clinical development for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma in Japan in the combination therapy of OPDIVO and the multi-kinase inhibitor “cabozantinib.” We agreed on clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS,” US) and Clovis Oncology (US) to evaluate the combination therapy of OPDIVO and the PARP inhibitor “rucaparib” in multiple tumor types including ovarian cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. In addition, we entered into a strategic research partnership with Repare Therapeutics (Canada) for development and commercialization of Repare’s small molecule Pol-theta inhibitor.
Meanwhile, we are working in anticipation of our own overseas marketing in the US and Europe. We also have departments in charge of licensing activities keenly out-licensing discovered compounds to our partners upon examining optimum measures to deliver our new in-house developed drugs to patients worldwide as quickly as possible, in light of proposed indication and market size. We have deepened collaboration activities with our long-time alliance partner BMS, continuously increasing compounds jointly developed by both companies, including BMS assets—IDO1 inhibitor, anti-TIM-3 antibody, and PEG-modified IL-2—in addition to OPDIVO and ONO-4578 created by ONO, a selective antagonist of EP4 which is a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor.
We continuously and vigorously promote licensing activities as a potential means of expanding our development pipeline and globally marketing new drugs we develop.

Four Growth Strategies
 Maximizing Product Value
We conduct R&D activities to maximize the product value of the anticancer drug OPDIVO, the biggest growth driver at ONO. It also works on exploiting the full potential of each of its products through evidence-based information dissemination activities, community-based activities, marketing activities to shorten the time between product market launch to peak sales, and activities to ensure product quality and reliability.
Maximizing OPDIVO’s product value
To maximize OPDIVO’s product value, we work with its partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (US) with focus on four perspectives.
   We work with corporate partners to progress clinical trials targeting various tumors. In Japan, we have already obtained approval for OPDIVO to treat seven cancers: melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, and malignant pleural mesothelioma. We are working on development to obtain additional approval for more than 20 indications for cancers.
Although the status of development varies from region to region, development is in the final stages for several cancers including esophageal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian cancer.
 Adding indicated tumors
 We move ahead with clinical trials to enable OPDIVO’s use at earlier stages from third- to second- to first-line anticancer treatment.
OPDIVO can be used as a first-line anticancer drug in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. To enable OPDIVO to be used in many other cancers including head and neck cancer and gastric cancer, the Clinical Development Division plays a leading role in efforts toward therapy line expansion.
 Adding treatment lines
 OPDIVO may, in combination with anticancer drugs having different action mechanism including another immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, have more therapeutic effects rather than alone. We already proceed with clinical trials in various combinations in different dosages and dose regimens with IDO1 inhibitors or anti-LAG-3 antibody, mainly with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody Yervoy, which has been already approved for combination with OPDIVO for the treatment of some type of cancer.
 Developing combination therapies
 Biomarkers, substances in a living organism, are indicative of any change in disease or reaction to therapy. Their measurements can be used as an indicator of presence or progress of disease or therapeutic effects. Discovering biomarkers useful in selection of anticancer therapy is beneficial to patients in that they may receive optimum therapy as early as possible.
We advance the search for optimal biomarkers that will predict patients who are more likely to be expected to exhibit the therapeutic effects of OPDIVO.
 Searching for biomarkers
  Activities to maximize OPDIVO’s product value

destined for market launch. We also consistently perform cost management from active pharmaceutical ingredient production to commercialization, as well as manages costs of raw and labeling/packaging materials from the supplier selection stage. We ensure that all drugs are produced, whether in-house or through outsourcing, under appropriate quality assurance system. ONO’s plants have a quality assurance system in place that is compliant with global regulations such as the US GMP and PIC/S GMP. In outsourcing production, ONO checks, through regular quality auditing, that appropriate manufacturing control and quality control are conducted.
We take various measures to stably supply high-quality drugs, including education and training of all workers involved in production and quality assurance, strengthening the quality system in accordance with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System, and upgrading of risk management systems at our manufacturing centers.
▌Strengthening Production Systems
Our manufacturing centers in Shizuoka and Osaka are compliant with GMP (a set of standards relating to the manufacturing control and quality control of pharmaceuticals). The main Fujiyama Plant proceeds with continual improvement and expansion of its facilities. In addition to strengthening our production capabilities aimed at future business expansion, a new plant has been constructed in Yamaguchi to mitigate the risk of major disaster from the business continuity perspective. This new plant is now in the final stages of verification before beginning operation. Equipped with a production line for highly active antibody drugs, the plant is planned to produce injections including anticancer drug OPDIVO and multiple myeloma drug KYPROLIS. The plant is scheduled to start operation in spring 2020 upon completion of regulatory procedures, including obtaining drug manufacturing license, to serve as a manufacturing center that will support ONO’s production capabilities together with the Fujiyama Plant.
 Scientific Information Dissemination Enhancing Product Value Through Provision and Collection of Proper Information and Through Activities that Meet Medical Needs and Community Characteristics
Drugs are of no value unless they can be used properly in those who are suffering from disease while undergoing medical treatment. We conduct scientific information dissemination activities based on market research and analysis, not only to properly provide and collect evidence-based information but also to offer therapy options appropriate to patient needs and community characteristics.
▌Marketing Activities to Enhance Product Value
The Sales & Marketing Division has the Oncology Business Unit, the Primary Care Business Unit, and their respective medical representatives (MRs) develop a strategy formation based on market research that constantly ensures competitive advantage by adjusting with agility to environmental changes in each stage of the product life cycle to maximize the potential of every product we offer.
In addition, we make every effort to collect patient opinions through meetings with healthcare professionals to understand
potential healthcare needs toward development of narrative- based medicine (NBM), which is based on actual clinical experiences for patients. We will make use of what has been obtained through these efforts in future information dissemination activities to enhance product value.
▌Information Sharing Framework Architecture
In addition to providing information, MRs uphold the importance of exchanging information with medical professionals to ascertain whether our drugs truly benefit each individual patient and their family throughout the course of the patient’s treatment. Our information-sharing framework enables our MRs to share across the company the valuable information they gather from the frontline of healthcare. We also have a system in place that allows all the MRs to access the information at all times from their tablet devices. All the MRs are equipped with highly secure smartphones. The smartphones feature a sales force automation (SFA) system that makes the entire sales process more efficient, as well as functions for using the AI-based FAQ system.
Our framework promotes information sharing and enables rapid responses to healthcare providers’ needs. In addition to the FAQ system, we use AI to continually bring efficiency to MR activities.

▌Relaying Up-To-Date Drug Information to Frontline of Healthcare
Pharmaceuticals and medical technology undergo daily advances. It is one of the roles of drug manufacturers to relay as quickly as possible up-to-date information about such drugs and technology to the frontline of healthcare and to provide opportunities for information exchange. We actively provide information by organizing symposiums and seminars in conjunction with academic conferences held in Japan and through workshops and lectures in regional areas. In addition, we put effort into disseminating up-to-date drug information through operating several websites for medical professionals. In FY2018, we held more than 130 live webinars. We also provide small-scale area live webinars in line with community needs to relay up-to-date drug information to the frontline of healthcare.
▌Prompt and Appropriate Provision of Medical and Scientific Information
Our Medical Affairs Department works to attain a high level of expertise and academic knowledge in oncology and primary care domains to assess and collect medical and scientific needs of healthcare profes- sionals through meeting with experts or attending at advisory board meetings. In response to request from healthcare professionals, we provide such evidence-based medical and scientific information with transparency to contribute to the healthcare frontline.
▌Strengthening Community-Based Activities
With medical care zone initiatives for community areas proceeding toward the establishment of community-based integrated care (CBIC) systems, we propose possible improvements in the medical care (MC) systems through consultation with medical providers upon understanding of the characteristics of the healthcare provision system of each community area, so that our drugs will truly benefit each individual patient, to become a player who can carry out information dissemination activities to be appreciated by medical professionals.
In October 2018, we set up an Area Support Promotion Department by expanding its functions that respond to reconstructed MC systems and CBIC systems in local communities. With this department, we work to assess, and promote solutions to, challenges and needs of government bodies and healthcare providers on community-by-community basis. As an activity that distinguishes ONO MRs from the rest, our MRs hold table discussion meetings (TDMs) in each area. TDMs are projects where lectures are organized based on themes proposed in line with the context of local healthcare issues, providing opportunities to solve questions in daily medical care through discussion between lecturers and participants. TDMs are thoughtfully planned and orchestrated so as to contribute to local healthcare through responding to different needs of each area.
 Safety and Quality Assurance Enhancing Product Value Through Drug Reliability Assurance Activities
From a patient standpoint, ONO conducts drug reliability assurance activities with global perspective through drug life cycle to constantly check for drug quality assurance and reflect opinions from healthcare professionals and patients on further quality improvement. In addition, we analyze and assess, based on latest scientific evidence, drug quality and efficacy and safety (adverse reaction) information collected from, e.g., reports from patients and healthcare professionals, literature, and surveys, to constantly provide updates to the frontline of healthcare.
▌Quality Assurance Policy
We not only meet the legal requirements as a marketing authorization holder, but also set out our own quality manual to establish a drug quality system and work to continuously improve systems so as to provide high-quality drugs from the viewpoints of patients, caretakers and healthcare professionals. In addition, we contribute to society through stable supply of pharmaceuticals that are assured to a high-quality standard.
▌Initiatives for Proper Use of Pharmaceuticals
We develop a risk management plan and collect and manage safety (adverse reaction) information for each pharmaceutical. We assess collected data and information and if necessary, revise the cautions on package inserts and make announcements about proper use. As safety information has been drastically increasing inside and
outside Japan after market launch of anticancer drugs, we assess such information based on opinions from external medical experts to promote the proper use of the drugs, e.g., by disseminating it through promotional materials, conference presentations, and medical journals. In addition, the Corporate Regulatory Compliance Safety and Quality Assurance Division, containing a section responsible for data, also uses and utilizes medical databases to analyze pharmaceutical product profiles and safety information for proper use.
▌Maintenance of Product Recall System
We have a system in place to recall any products with efficacy, quality or safety problems and to promptly provide medical professionals with information on them. We also have relevant departments jointly conduct periodical drills in preparation for product recall to check that they can be executed quickly even in unexpected circumstances.

 Promotion of Business in Asia
As a beachhead to expand revenue sources into overseas markets, we have been reinforcing overseas business expansion starting in Asia. We established wholly owned subsidiaries, ONO PHARMA KOREA CO., LTD. (OPKR) in South Korea in 2013 and ONO PHARMA TAIWAN CO., LTD. (OPTW) in Taiwan in 2014. The subsidiaries have since launched their own marketing and have demonstrated steady progress.
We have obtained approval for anticancer drug OPDIVO for additional indications not only in Japan but also in the rest of the world. The drug has been approved for 7 and 9 types of cancer in South Korea and in Taiwan respectively (as of June 2019). To significantly contribute to advancement in cancer therapy in South Korea and Taiwan, we also put efforts into
Business Expansion into the US and Europe
We have pursued in-licensing of new drug candidates developed in-house to deliver them to healthcare settings outside Japan, except in South Korea and Taiwan, where we have our own sales organization in place. Currently, however, we are establishing a system to sell our drugs on our own, also in the US and Europe, the world’s largest markets.
To market globally on our own, we have to set up local centers for clinical development and build a structure that ensures that we can perform clinical development and apply for approval by ourselves. In April 2019, we transferred the functions of the
safety measures by, e.g., rolling out scientific activities countrywide with Japanese and Western doctors appointed as lecturers to promote proper drug use. In addition, we conduct information dissemination activities not only on a countrywide level but also on a small-scale, locally-focused level to bring a fresh sensitivity to both markets as part of efforts to become the market leader in oncology in Asia.
We have also established a division within our Head Office that is in charge of planning operations in South Korea and Taiwan and expansion into other Asian markets. In close cooperation with the locally incorporated subsidiaries, the division investigates issues and develop overseas business strategies.
through consultation with the regulators.
For business launch in the US and Europe, we intend to market in-house developed products in disease domains that do not require a large-scale sales force. We will sell such new drugs with efficacy and safety expected superior to those of the competition. Among our current pipelines, we consider, as global development pipelines, compounds under development to treat acute leukemia or intractable diseases with physical changes or metabolic abnormalities due to growth hormone hypersecretion, so that we can deliver new drugs to patients
 Global Clinical Development Division from Japan to our US subsidiary ONO PHARMA USA, INC. (OPUS). We will pursue organizational improvements that enable us to conduct clinical trials in the US and Europe and conduct application for approval

We continue upgrading our drug development infrastructure in Japan, the rest of Asia, the US, and Europe to strengthen and speed up our global development system.

 Strengthening Corporate Infrastructure
ONO strengthens corporate infrastructure to conduct company management based on the global standards. It is essential for our sustainable growth to handle corporate governance, the development of human resources, compliance with laws and regulations, and climate change. ONO therefore continues to engage in activities from a long-term perspective.

   ▌Board of Directors
▌Board of Auditors
When selecting candidates for directorships we consider the balance of knowledge, experience and skills compatible with the whole Board of Directors’ ability to make expert and comprehensive management decisions. We are also more clearly defining the responsibilities of management to our shareholders and have set the term of office for directors at one year, so as to enable rapid responses to changes in the management environment.
We have set the number of directors on the board to a number that is appropriate to enabling rapid and sound decision-making and that enhances managerial transparency and oversight. The Board of Directors currently consists of eight members including three outside directors and generally meets once a month. It is at these meetings when important management matters are decided and oversight of directors’ duties takes place. In addition, the Board of Directors also values the opinions of Corporate Auditors and engages in discussions including the perspectives of specialists in law, finance, and accounting as well as gender perspectives.
We have strengthened our auditing capability by appointing four auditors to the Board of Auditors, including two thoroughly independent outside auditors and two full-time auditors who are thoroughly familiar with ONO’s business and have the authority to gather high-level information. The full-time auditors and the outside auditors work together to strengthen audit effectiveness.
The meeting of the Board of Auditors is held on a regular basis. The auditors are working with our Internal Audit Capability (Business Audit Department) to enforce auditing efficiency, and endeavors to improve its functions of the management oversight by enhancing the effectiveness of audits in cooperation with the accounting auditor.
▌Executive Appointment Meeting
The Executive Appointment Meeting consists of the President and Repre- sentative Director who is the chair, one Internal Director, and three Outside Directors, and it ensures transparency and objectivity in the designation of candidates to be Directors and Corporate Auditors and the appointment of
037 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

executive management members and it discusses policies for succession planning of the chief executive officer (President, CEO) and other top management members and corporate governance of ONO. In addition, executive officer appointments are proposed to and approved by the Board of Directors after deliberation by this Meeting.
▌Executive Compensation Meeting
The Executive Compensation Meeting consists of the President and
Representative Director who is the chair, and three Outside Directors, and it ensures transparency and objectivity in the compensation amount of individual Directors and the calculation method and discusses the appropriateness and future of the executive compensation system. In addition, executive compensation, etc. is proposed to and approved by the Board of Directors after deliberation in this Meeting.
▌Internal Control System
ONO provides for an internal system in accordance with the basic policies of the internal control system decided upon by the Board of Directors. In addition, ONO strives to ensure compliance and to detect internal control issues early through our Internal Audit capability (Business Audit Depart- ment) and thereby maintains and increases the appropriateness of organizational operation. Furthermore, we have established compliance windows in and outside the company to increase the self-maintenance function of the organization and we are striving to reduce reputation risks from whistle-blowing outside the company. Development and operation conditions of the Internal Control System are reported periodi- cally to the Board of Directors to improve organizational operation continuously.
▌Operational Management Structure
ONO is striving to ensure and increase the efficiency and correctness of decision-making and operational management by, for example, the President and Representative Director, the Directors and Corporate Officers who take responsibility for each division, as well as the managers of relevant departments to deliberate important operational manage- ment matters and above all, matters to put before the Board of Directors from various angles in Management Meeting & Other Meetings. We are also seeking to strengthen operational management capabilities and to accelerate decision-making by implementing our Corporate Officer system, transferring authorities, and taking other measures. In addition, ONO also includes attendance at Management Meetings and inspection of the minutes within the scope of auditors’ work.
Corporate Governance Code
Based on the aim of the Corporate Governance Code stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we develop structures appropriate for our businesses through assessment of the effectiveness of the meeting of the Board of Directors that is held annually and other measures and thereby strive to increase management efficiency, soundness, and transparency, etc.

Risk Management
Based on recognition of the possibility of major risks, ONO engages in the prevention of their occurrence and develops systems to handle cases where risks actually occur appropriately. In April 2019, a new organization to perform entire risk management (ERM) was established to reinforce the system.
▌Rules and other systems on the management of the risk of losses
(1) We manage risks related to compliance, product quality and safety, safety and health, the environment, disasters, information security, and other issues on the basis of internal rules and through the preparation and distribution of procedures in the relevant sections, as well as through training and other measures.

Corporate Governance
(2) Cross-organizational risks and risks deemed to have a significant impact on management are monitored and addressed at a meeting attended by the President and Representative Director, the Directors and Corporate Officers in charge, and the managers of relevant divisions. In case of unexpected risks, the President gathers the relevant persons to solve any problems promptly as necessary.
(3) Risks specific to a division are addressed by that division through the preparation of handling procedures, which are reviewed constantly in accordance with changes in the business environment.
▌Structure to ensure proper business operations of the corporate group composed of ONO and its subsidiaries
We provide consultation and guidelines for our group companies with regard to their legal compliance and risk management. While respecting their autonomy, we request that each company provides us with regular business reports and consult with us on important business issues in advance.
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
We have organized the Crisis Management Headquarters and established a structure designed to minimize the impact of an emergency on mission- critical operations according to the instructions of the Emergency Response Committee chaired by the President, so that we can continue business activities or recover promptly and resume them if they are suspended in cases of an emergency such as a natural disaster or serious accident. The BCM Committee, which is chaired by the General Administration Headquarters and in charge of business continuity management (BCM), and the Secretariat have been formed to maintain and strengthen our abilities to respond to crisis and continue our business operations, and promote relevant management activities during normal times.
Equipment for disasters, including emergency power equipment, two-line power receiving systems, and other measures, have been adopted at the Head office, Tokyo Building, each manufacturing plant, and each research institute, and seismic isolation devices against earthquakes have been introduced at the Head office, Tokyo Building, and Minase Research Institute. Furthermore, we have established a system to handle emergencies at two bases, in Osaka and Tokyo.
  ■ Messages from Outside Directors (Independent Executives)
Outside Director Yutaka Kato
I assumed the office of Director of ONO PHARMACEUTICAL as an independent executive in June 2013. Outside directors attend at meetings of the Board of Directors and get involved in management decision-making from a third-party perspective. Through such involvement, the outside directors play a role in strengthening the company’s governance structure. Outside directors may identify what the industry or the company takes for granted, as peculiar to the public at large, and can give advice accordingly. I believe that reflecting social perspectives in management decisions on various issues enables the support that can ensure true competitive advantage. For this reason, I proactively provide helpful information from my study results, the details of my serial articles in business magazines, and the papers of my seminar students.
In general, outside directors cannot even participate in discussions if they have little knowledge about the industry and the company. ONO, however, makes sure to, upon appointment of outside directors, provide us with sufficient explanation with detailed information about modes of action of drugs on living organisms and clinical trials. This allows us to actively participate in discussions at the Meeting of Board of Directors.
Fortunately, business results have been
good. However, ONO is expected to
begin a new era after celebrating its
300th anniversary. It is important at this
milestone juncture to comprehensively
revise internal systems and adopt a
clear strategy to take us into the future.
In particular, I consider the following
activities to be important: further
strengthening research and
development abilities; maximizing
product value and strengthening corporate infrastructure in order to ensure sustainable competitive superiority; and sales expansion of ONO’s products in overseas markets. Outside directors are expected to cooperate with internal management members concerning the issues involved in these management strategies.
We need to remind ourselves constantly of our Corporate Philosophy: Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain. It is imperative that we are aware of our duty to engage in corporate activities for people around the world.
  039 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

 Outside Director Jun Kurihara
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has been discussed in various ways, is drastically changing the corporate environment and competitive condi- tions throughout the world. These new technologies offer companies the possibility of prosperity and at the same time they have the risk of causing a crisis of decline and disappearance. Pharmaceutical companies that strive to promote more effective use of management resources and to reduce risks in association with drug discovery by using AI will strengthen their company structure and will be able to overcome various issues despite increasing uncertainty. I strongly expect that ONO will continue to develop new technologies and to enjoy its excellent results as a leading company in the biomedical field.
The situation where the birthrate is declining and the number of elderly people is growing has become more serious in Japan; nevertheless, we must restore financial soundness. It is essential for Japan-based Japanese companies to make internal structures more efficient and to expand to overseas markets. Although my abilities are limited, I have directly experienced habits and values that are different from Japan through my more than 10 years of overseas life. At the same time, I understood
overseas habits and values and then
learned how Japanese companies and
individuals grow. Concerning AI
technologies, I also learned differences
in technology levels and use methods
inside and outside Japan and their
respective advantages and disadvan-
tages. In addition, I have also learned
by trial and error what qualifications
are required for persons who can work
to bridge the gap between Japan and
overseas and how these qualifications can be acquired.
I would like to participate in decision-making for management along with other Outside Directors while identifying the differences between perspectives both inside and outside Japan. In other words, I will keep my eyes sharp with an “externally cool gaze” on ONO, prick up my ears, and distinguish dangerous sounds, and thereby contribute to decision-making for management.
   Outside Director Masao Nomura
One year has elapsed since I assumed the office of Outside Director of ONO as an independent director. I participated in all major meetings, including meetings of the Board of Directors for one year.
Since I have engaged in company management in an industry that has no direct relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, I participated in management from a different perspective. Through discussions at the meetings of the Board of Directors, the attitude of top management members to face corporate governance honestly and comply with it touched my heart.
Under the lofty corporate philosophy “Dedicated to Man’s Fight against Disease and Pain,” ONO engages in reinforcing corporate governance and the entire company engages in achieving the company philosophy. Needless to say, the purpose of company management is appropriate profit seeking and sustainable growth. In order to achieve this purpose, it is a basic premise to maintain company soundness and to gain reliability from society and stakeholders under a defined corporate philosophy.
Japan is facing a declining birthrate and an aging population more than other developed countries and it is one of the first in the
world to reach the 100-year life.
When we face this new era, our major
theme is to overcome every disease
and pain and to live a healthy and
fulfilling life at every age. ONO is a
company that carries out a big social
mission to make this theme a reality.
In the pharmaceutical industry where
the business environment is
drastically changing, ONO must
observe compliance and reinforce the
corporate governance structure to increase its social presence and value and to continue trying to enter the global market in the new era as well. Although my ability is limited, I would like to use my experience in company management, participate in management from an independent and objective perspective as an Outside Director with an “external perspective,” and thereby contribute to the development of ONO.

Fair Operating Practices
ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Compliance Structure
ONO has the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct to be aware of the responsibilities it holds as a pharmaceutical company in the development and provision of medicines on which human lives depend and to ensure that it acts in compliance with laws and regulations and that it meets high ethical standards.
Our compliance structure consists of the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Codes of Conduct, which serve as a foundation for guiding our corporate activities; the Compliance Program, which provides standards of conduct for the activities; and the Codes of Practice, which are based on the pharmaceutical industry standards on promotion and other activities.
When putting compliance with laws and regulations into practice, we repeatedly remind our employees of their duties to ensure transparency in transactions and prevent fraud and corruption, and to act taking consideration of the social context at home and abroad.
As a pharmaceutical company keenly aware of corporate ethics both in principle and in practice, we will continue to strengthen our level of compliance in line with our ethical principles.
ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Compliance Structure
We have internal and external contacts for reporting and consulting on compliance issues for all group companies, including the 24-hour external contact for counseling service. This system ensures harassment and other compliance violations are prevented as well as stopped from reoccurring. Likewise, an appropriate working environment can be ensured, and necessary actions and measures can be taken to minimize any damage or decline in credibility in the event of a compliance violation.
From the perspective of protection of informants, matters related to the privacy of informants, such as their name, etc., and matters related to the details of reporting will be kept strictly confidential and only provided to relevant persons necessary for investigation. In addition to the measure to prohibit prejudicial treatment of any kind when making the report and the measure to corrective actions in cases where a disadvantage is found, we prohibited the reported person from divulging the details of the reporting and the names of informants and other matters in the course of fact finding. Furthermore, this system also accepts anonymous reports.

▌Engagement in Fair Promotion Activities
In terms of pharmaceutical marketing, so that the Compliance Promotion Department, Sales and Marketing Division, and other relevant departments cooperated with each other in order to provide optimal medical treatment from the patient standpoint, we established the Pharmaceutical Promotion Code in our Codes of Practice as an action guideline and we practice this Promotion in accordance with the guidelines.
ONO defines the term “Promotion” as “providing and conveying pharmaceutical information to medical workers so as to disseminate the appropriate use of pharmaceuticals based on such information.” We proactively carry out promotion activities, while always examining whether they are acting in accordance with the spirit of the Pharmaceutical Promotion Code in our Codes of Practice regardless of whether there are any specific provision or description in the Code. We also comply with the Code and adhere to the Guidelines for Provision of Marketing Information of Prescription Drugs that are proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the JPMA (Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association) Code of Practice, and the Rules of the Fair Trade Council of the Ethical Pharmaceutical Drugs Marketing Industry, as well as respecting the IFPMA (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations) Code of Practice, which is a code established by an association in which the JPMA participates. Furthermore, in response to the commencement of operation of the Guidelines for Provision of Marketing Information of Prescription Drugs, we established the division supervising provision of marketing information and the examination and supervising committee and also the contact window for marketing information provision, and disseminated the contact window to healthcare personnel, and we will thereby conduct further fair promotion activities.

Compliance Promotion Initiatives
▌Compliance Promotion System
To promote compliance, we have appointed a Corporate Compliance Officer and set up a Compliance Committee. The Compliance Committee examines and deliberates compliance-related issues, plans and promotes training and cooperates with the internal auditing department to check the extent to which compliance has been disseminated and practiced.
 043 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

▌Compliance Education System
We give the following training courses for employees to enhance their aware- ness of compliance. We schedule a period for training (three months) every year during which all employees are required to join lectures given by the leaders of respective departments, and training courses using an e-learning system, to improve their familiarity with and understanding of compliance in general. In addition, in case of violation of compliance, we give special compa- nywide training to prevent occurrence or recurrence of violation of compliance, depending on the nature of the case.
In particular, with regard to harassment, not only do we provide training courses for management staff, but we also have external lecturers hold sessions on harassment, thereby enhancing awareness of compliance. Concerning the thorough implementation of fair promotion activities, compli- ance promotion staff members visit each sales branch twice a year to provide MRs with compliance training focusing on dissemination and raising awareness of the Pharmaceutical Promotion Code in our Codes of Practice. The Compli- ance Promotion Department and Sales and Marketing Division hold monthly joint meetings with Trade Practice Committee members of the Fair Trade Council to share information and provide training. Furthermore, at meetings held by leaders in the Sales & Marketing Division, systems to improve familiarity with the aforementioned standards within the Division are developed.
▌Ethical Considerations
We always take consideration of ethics at every stage of research and develop- ment.
We have established internal ethical rules for research using human-derived samples (blood, tissue, cells, genes, etc.) based on the basic guidelines issued by the Japanese government. We have also established the Ethics Committee for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subjects, as the advisory body comprising members from inside and outside the company. Such re- search is conducted only after the Committee conducts strict assessment of its ethical and scientific validity.
For research using laboratory animals, we have an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in place. The committee reviews such research in advance to determine whether the protocols are prepared with due consideration of the 3Rs - replacement (to use alternative methods), reduction (to use a smaller number of animals) and refinement (to relieve pain and distress) - to ensure appropriate conduct of animal experiments with respect for the lives of the animals and with consideration for animal welfare. In addition, we conduct self-inspection and assessment of the status of ongoing animal experiments, for example, and obtain third-party certification of these activities from the Center for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and Use in the Japan Health Sciences Foundation.
Clinical trials, which are essential for verifying the safety and efficacy of investigational drugs, must be performed with respect for the rights of trial subjects. Clinical trials are closely monitored for patients’ safety and are stringently conducted under high ethical standards. We are committed to evalu- ating the real merit of investigational drugs by steadily applying essential and complete testing procedures that comply with Japan’s Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and Cosmetics (PMD Act)
and other related legislation, as well as the global standards based on the spirit of the Declaration of Helsinki.

In promoting fair and transparent business activities, we ensure thorough awareness of the prevention of unfair and corrupt practices by repeatedly training our employees.
In order to contribute to healthcare and people’s health around the world through continuous new drug R&D, along with a stable supply of our products, we need to engage in collaborative activities (support for patient organizations) and cooperate with research and medical institutions to help patients overcome disease and pain. To enhance the fairness and transparency aspects of such collaboration and cooperation, it is important to ensure transparent relationships with our partners. We therefore disclose information on costs of our assistance to medical institutions and patient organizations in accordance with our transparen- cy guideline developed in consideration with the JPMA’s relevant guideline.
As public interest rises globally on compliance to laws governing unfair and corrupt practices, we are mindful of the need to be aware of both domestic and international social contexts, and we therefore adopted in 2017 the ONO Anticor- ruption Global Policy and Regulations on the Prevention of Corruption. These are intended to clearly define and state our company’s stance and system in prevent- ing bribery and corruption. We are endeavoring to put these more strictly into practice.
As for publicly funded research, we instituted our Guideline on Publicly Funded Research as well as our Regulations on Publicly Funded Research in compliance with Japanese government guidelines and we are committed to ensuring proper operation and management.

▌Promotion of CSR Procurement
ONO established the Basic Policy for Procurement Activities and CSR Procure- ment Guidelines and ONO promotes CSR procurement so that the entire supply chain can achieve the development of a sustainable society. The Basic Policy for Procurement Activities is a basic policy for all employees involved in procure- ment activities. The CSR Procurement Guidelines compile matters for which the cooperation of suppliers is required. In addition, in March 2019, we started to use CSR management evaluation system, EcoVadis, and prepared a system where the CSR management level of important suppliers in the supply chain can be identified objectively and continuously.
ONO established a sound network with suppliers through CSR procurement, developed a greater cooperation system, and thereby aims to increase mutual corporate value.

Human Resources and Human Rights
Promotion of Human Resources Development
Based on the belief that “Business is people,” we actively support the development of individual abilities and positive action taken where they are never afraid to fail so that individual abilities can fully demonstrate.
▌Basic Concept for the Development of Human Resources
We aim to invest in individuals who can work as members of a pharmaceutical company dealing in pharmaceuticals related to human lives and in members who can have competitive capability to help us make the leap to becoming a R&D-based pharmaceutical company that can grow and develop in a global field. While investing in the development of human resources, ONO sets the concept of recruitment and career development as follow: Self-disciplined persons who keep trying to achieve goals, such as persons who:
● are innovation-minded and never give up trying until the end;
● can demonstrate their abilities as one of team the members
environment and can work collaboratively;
● have a strong sense of responsibility for, and are proud of, their
own jobs;
● always take a positive approach and can learn and grow
independently; and
● act in an ethical manner with common sense.
▌Provision of Growth Opportunities
We provide opportunities for growth and awareness for our employ- ees through various training programs. We organize a wide range of collective training for employees in each phase of career develop- ment, including companywide joint training for new employees from all divisions and departmental introductory training. To develop global human resources with capability for success irrespective of environment and location, we offer training programs and second- ment to our overseas subsidiaries. We also aim to provide good training for managerial staff with a focus on the management skills required for organizational growth and the capability demanded of each role and job position. Contents of these training programs are being enhanced continuously.
Furthermore, we encourage the self-development efforts made by employees by enhancing the voluntary training system and support system for self-learning in order to foster “self-disciplined” human resources. Concerning the voluntary training, we provide the learning content beyond the framework of positions and departments and the opportunities to increase awareness for cooperation between depart- ments. Under the supporting system for self-learning, we are always
preparing an environment where attendees can learn a broad range of subjects, including leadership, management, accounting, and more. The number of available subjects for correspondence learning in- creased from approximately 140 as of March 2018 to 500 or more in FY2019.
In order to accelerate organizational globalization, we are engaging in various activities to enhance employee language abilities, including English training camps, study abroad, schooling, dispatching lecturers, and granting subsidies for online English conversation class, and approximately 440 employees in total received English-related training in FY2018.
Moreover, we provide training at medical institutions so that MRs can understand the needs of patients and their families and can deliver our products that bring true benefit to patients. We conduct training at facilities related to diabetes and at medical institutions specialized in dialysis thanks to agreements for this type of our training and cooperation with medical institutions. In addition to MRs, employees engaging in research and development also participate in training at medical institutions. We consider that these activities will result in drug discovery that meets the medical needs of patients more than ever.
Respect for Human Rights
In all of our business activities, ONO respects the human rights of every person and will act accordingly.
In upholding this principle, we have adopted the policy of “no discrimination due to race, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, belief or philosophy, academic background, disability or illness, or other attributes,” in creating and managing our HR system. We have prohibited any form of harassment and conduct compliance training.
ONO supports international codes of conduct including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labor Standards, and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
   045 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

Enhancing the Creation of Workplace Environments with Job Satisfaction
ONO is moving ahead to create workplace environments where employees can work with job satisfaction and a sense of security. We are continuously committed to the development of support systems and working conditions that help employees work in various styles, as well as
 the improvement of their work-life balance, so that each and every demonstrate their full potential.
▌Promotion of the Reviewing the Way Employees Work
For the purpose of creating employee-friendly workplace environments where employees can experience job satisfaction, we consider that the shortening of work hours is an essential and fundamental challenge to be addressed for the development of a pleasant work environment. To this end, we focus on the review of working styles.
Since FY2014, we appoint a promotion committee member in each department to involve the whole company in the activities, and the members work to raise awareness and encourage employees to make operations more efficient and to take paid holidays. In FY2018, we have also improved flexibility, including system correction and expansion of use, by updating the web conference system, promoting the use of IT, flexible working time systems, and telecommuting systems. In April 2019, we newly introduced a system that enables employees to take paid leave by the hour. Through these initiatives, we achieved positive results such as a year-on-year decrease in overtime working hours by 5.7% and a year-on-year increase in the rate of taking paid holidays by 17.2% in comparison of FY2014 and FY2018.
▌Childcare Support Initiatives
We believe that society as a whole should give more support to families raising children and that businesses should tackle the issue of creating environments that facilitate child bearing and parenting.
At this time, we established the 6th Action Plan (from April 2019 through March 2021) and included the promotion of childcare leave for male employees and the creation of a system to support career development for employees reinstated from childcare leave or employees who are raising children. Since April 2017, we have been promoting initiatives to build an environment in which men can actively take part in child-raising, such as the introduction of a new childcare support system, holidays to encourage employees to take part in child-raising, as well as the strengthening of activities to ensure that the male employees who wish to participate in child-raising by taking childcare leave can obtain the consent of the people around them.
ONO has been certified as a general business operator meeting the criteria based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2017.

▌Programs to Enhance Worker-friendliness
ONO offers various employment and support systems.
We have systems that allow employees to continue working during various major life events and to achieve a good work-life balance, as well as support systems that help employees who develop cancer, together with leave and subsidy systems. ONO designs systems so that employees can have more options in the way they work, for example, in cases of legally required systems, ONO’s systems ex- ceeds the statutory standards.
We continuously improve these systems by listening to the workers’ wishes so that they meet the actual needs of employees. Further- more, ONO strives to disseminate the details of the systems thor- oughly by preparing and delivering handbooks that describe the benefit programs, application procedures for each system, FAQs and other information and by providing announcements via Intranet so that enhanced systems are correctly understood and utilized.
▌Commitment to Safety and Health
For safety and health, ONO regularly hold safety and health commit- tee meetings to continuously improve the working environment and employees’ health. In our production and research sites, safety and health inspectors report findings from inspection patrols to the committee and propose improvements, effectively familiarizing employees with health and safety procedures, and taking appropriate actions. All our establishments are inspected annually for disaster prevention measures, fire extinguishing and disaster prevention equipment, safe handling of machinery, safety procedure implemen- tation levels, transportation operations, as well as cleanliness and tidiness. At the ONO Head Office and other company sites which have a health committee, health patrols are conducted every two months to check desks and cabinets, thereby providing thorough control of cleanliness and tidiness. Each committee discusses health issues based on the results of workplace environmental measurements. We established the Central Safety and Health Committee as a place to share information and exchange opinions between all of the safety and health committees and have implemented safety and health activities across the entire company. Labor and management proac- tively engage together in measures for the prevention of industrial accidents and early reinstatement after an industrial accident.

Promotion of Health and Productivity Management
For ONO to contribute to society by creating and developing innovative pharmaceuticals under its corporate philosophy, it is essential that employees and their families are mentally and physically healthy, that our worksite is a place where individual abilities can be fulfilled to their utmost, and that lives of employees and their families are satisfying. For further implementation of activities in a systematic way, our company, labor union, industrial health staff members, and health insurance association organized the “Health Up Committee” in April 2018 based on the Representative Director’s health declaration.
As a result of “Health and Productivity Management” implemented by all relevant persons, ONO was certified in 2019 as an Outstanding Health and Productivity Management Organization in the large enterprise category (White 500) by METI and Nippon Kenko Kaigi (large-sized corporation department).
  ▌Prevention of Diseases / Early Detection / Early Treatment Support
● ONO requires its employees to receive an annual health checkup and employ- ees over 35 years old and their dependent spouses optionally undergo a complete medical checkup instead of a statutory health checkup. The complete medical checkup rate has continued to be approximately 99% excluding unavoidable reasons, such as employees taking leave, etc.
● Contract facilities for complete medical checkup exist in prefectures through- out Japan. The number of contract facilities as of April 2019 is 184 so that employees and their dependent spouses can easily receive the complete medical checkup.
● ONO supports the cost of screening tests for each cancer and many employees receive optional screening tests related to cancer when they undergo a complete medical checkup. We provide mail-in-type cervical cancer screening to female employees under 35 years old.
Cancer screening test rate (FY2018)
(Target: cervical cancer, employees over 20 years old; other cancers, employees over 40 years old)
● After employees receive their health checkup, industrial health staff members recommend pursuing a consultation at a medical institution or give health instructions as necessary, or they recommend that employees with a high risk of lifestyle-related disease and their families receive specific health instructions.
▌Mental Health Measures
● ONO has provided internal training on mental health and conducted individual consultations by industrial health staff members in order to contribute to prevention, early detection, and early treatment of mental disorders, and we engage in these activities in cooperation with industrial physicians.
● We conduct stress checks once a year for all employees and the implementa- tion rate is approximately 98%. After the checks, we continuously improve our worksites based on the results of organization analysis.
● ONO established a free consulting service counter operated by an external company and developed a system where employees can consult with experts via phone or e-mail in addition to face-to-face consultation.
▌Measures Against Passive Smoking and Promotion of Health
● ONO started a total ban on smoking on ONO premises from April 2019. We had been increasing awareness organizationally by establishing “No Smoking Day,” by implementing an internal questionnaire, by preparing and display- ing original posters using employee illustrations, and by other means. Thereby, we transferred to the phase of a total ban of smoking and took other measures, including removing smoking areas on the premises and other measures.
● In order to support employees who are trying to quit smoking, we have conducted an internal Quit Smoking Competition with the aim to stop smoking within six weeks in a fun and smart way. ONO supports employee activities to promote their health by providing allowances for treatment as an outpatient of the quit-smoking department, by providing an online quit smoking program, and by other measures.
● ONO conducts a walking campaign every year. Employee teams and their family members can participate in the campaign in addition to individual employees so that everyone can voluntarily join in the campaign. In addition, people who achieve a specific goal will receive local products from a disaster area as an achievement award. The number of participants is increasing year by year and the campaign is expected to encourage employees to make a habit of walking.
● Physical checkup meetings are conducted every year at major offices, and they include measurement of body composition, age of the blood vessels, bone density, and other items. Participants can check the conditions of muscles and bones that are not made clear by health checkups alone and they can also receive individual advice on diet and exercise from medical staff members. Therefore, the number of participants is increasing every year.
▌Health Management Support
● ONO operates a portal site where employees can check the results of their complete medical checkups and periodic health checkups at any time with their terminal device regardless of where they received the checkups. The portal site provides information to help employees with accurately under- standing checkup results and to correct lifestyle habits.
● We also established a “Health Management Site” which compiled the stress check system, health consultation window, and other systems. ONO is making efforts so that employees can correctly understand and use systems contributing to health maintenance.

Promotion of Diversity and Inclusion
At ONO, we make continuous efforts to promote diversity in our workplaces. For the purpose of responding promptly and flexibly to environmental changes and increasing corporate value, we believe that it is important to enhance the diversity of our corporate members’ attributes, set of values and behavior, while recognizing their individualities.
 ▌Establishment of Diversity Inclusion Promotion Structure
In order to understand the meaning of diversity and to make them use for management of diversified human resources, we provide Diversity Management Training to all managers. In addition, we are promoting an increase in internal understanding by including content in the training for employees by year of employment or by position and other training with the aim of increasing “Diversity & Inclusion.” In addition to internal activities, we are striving to share information on know-how and activities for increasing diversity by participating in cross-industry study meetings and seminars.
▌Women’s Participation Promotion Activities
We direct our strong endeavors in this area especially for the creation of systems that enable women to flourish. We have made strong drives to recruit women and to promote measures to prevent women from leaving the company due to major life events. Thanks to these efforts, the number of female employees has steadily increased and the employment rate of female employees as of March 2019 increased by 4.0% from March 2013 and the retention rate of female employees in FY2018 is 97.1%. We are continuing to move ahead with the creation of systems to increase the number of female employees and to support them in building up a career. We will do this by steadily implementing our Five-Year Action Plan (for the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2021), which is based on the Act of Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace (Women’s Participation Promotion Act), set out in 2015.

Efforts Towards Improvement of Medical Access
ONO engages in improvement of access to medicine through the efforts of our companies and activities via partnerships.
We are striving to contribute to researches in diseases for unmet medical needs and for rare diseases and intractable diseases and countries and regions where medical infrastructure has not yet matured.
▌Improvement of Access to Medicine through Re- search and Development
We are developing pharmaceuticals and providing pharmaceuticals through drug discovery and licensing activities for rare diseases for which the number of patients is small and therefore it is difficult to develop therapeutic agents. In addition, we consider pharmaceuticals that are appropriately assessed for children should be used for child patients and we engage in obtaining additional approval for indications for child patients. For drug discovery and research for intractable diseases, we are engaging in activities to provide new options for treatment in industry-academia cooperation.
▌Improvement of Medical Infrastructure by Support Activities and Donations
In August 2018, we started the ONO SWITCH Project, which is an activity to donate a specified amount to medical-related NPOs and NGOs based on overtime payments that have been reduced by work-style reforms. Furthermore, ONO joined the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) in 2018. We empathize with their activities and ideas and we are making a financial contribution to improve access to medicine in low- and middle-income countries.

Activities to Achieve an Abundant Global Environment
ONO established the ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Environmental Guidelines for our environmental activities and formulated a voluntary environment action plan and Environment Challenging Ono Vision (ECO VISION 2050) based on the Guidelines. We defined the specific content of actions as well as numerical goals by means of which we will strive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from business activities on a company-wide basis. In this and other ways, we will fulfill our corporate social responsibility towards the environment and engage in activities by prioritizing the environment in all business areas and by contributing to the realization of an abundant global environment.
 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL Environmental Guidelines
█ Aware of corporate social responsibility for the environment, we will work to protect and preserve the global environment in all of our business operations.
█ In addition to fully complying with all environment-related laws and regulations, we will establish targets and action plans in an effort to protect and preserve the environment, including natural resources and biodiversity.
█ We will make environmental considerations in all our business operations and we will implement environment- focused measures such as saving resources and energy, the conservation of water resources, recycling, reducing waste, and preventing pollution.
█ We will endeavor to do “Monozukuri” to produce eco- friendly products and will cooperate with society.
█ We will strive to further understand environmental issues and to promote environment related activities with the participation of every employee.
▌Promotion of Environmental Management
Our environmental management promotion structure is developed so that Members of the Board of Directors, Senior Executive Officers/ Executive Directors, General Administration Headquarters supervise company-wide environment management, the CSR Promotion Section operates the structure, and the Environment Committee consists of committee members from each department who are responsible for specific on-site monitoring and promoting environmental management. Each of the production and research sites with environmentally major impact has a subcommittee to work on environmental issues. Each production site makes continuous efforts to reduce environmental impact under an ISO 14000- compliant environmental management system in place. Progress of activities is required to be reported once or more per year at the Management Meeting chaired by the CEO.
In addition, employees receive necessary training on environmental management concerning the operations that
could have impact on the environment, to reduce environmental risks.
Furthermore, we also have a structure to minimize environmental impact arising from emergency disasters, by providing training and onsite education and formulating manuals to prepare for them.
▌Environmental Vision
ONO has established a mid- and long-term environmental vision towards 2050, Environment Challenging Ono Vision (ECO VISION 2050). ONO will promote activities to reduce its environmental burden under the ECO VISION 2050.

Institute, and Tokyo Building use solar power generation system for which the CO2 emissions factor is zero.
ONO was selected to the A List company which is the highest evaluation in FY2018 under the climate change investigation conducted by CDP in UK. This was the result when ONO’s activities were evaluated globally. At the same time, ONO is a specified business operator under Japan’s Act on the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Saving Act) and has been evaluated at the highest rank, S Rank, for four consecutive years as an excellent business operator where energy saving activities are advancing. In addition, ONO received an Osaka Stop Global Warming Award Excellence Prize in FY2018 from Osaka Prefecture as a business operator who engaged in particularly excellent activities in terms of global-warming prevention measures and other measures.
▌Achievement of Water Circulation Society
In order to achieve a water circulation society, ONO addresses the preservation of water resources from the perspective of both production activities and research activities. The use of quality freshwater is essential for our business activities. Based on the water risk evaluation using the tool of the World Resources Institute (WRI AQUEDUCT), our main sites have not been located in high water stress areas as of 2018.
In FY2018, water consumption was 350,000 m3 where water consumption per unit of production increased by 8.7% from FY2017. We make efforts to reduce water consumption amounts and to provide strict quality control of water discharge as we promote activities that take biodiversity into consideration.
▌Achievement of Resource Circulation Society
We promote company-wide initiatives to reduce the amount of industrial waste landfilled in order to achieve resource circulation society. Residues after intermediate treatment were sent to landfill sites where materials can be recycled to reduce the amount of landfilled industrial waste, which decreased by 94.0% to 0.45 tons in FY2018 compared to the previous fiscal year. In addition, industrial waste landfilled per unit of production decreased by 37.2% compared to FY2017.
The production and research sites have achieved “Zero Emissions” and commit to continue the status. Also, we visit intermediate and final waste disposal contractors to confirm that our industrial waste is properly disposed of. We are promoting efforts aimed at recycling industrial waste, using thermal recycling by authorized heat recovery facilities and choosing final waste disposal sites that utilize the material recycling system.

   063 Corporate Report 2019
ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.
1) IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
The Group has applied IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (published in May 2014), and “Clarifica- tions to IFRS 15” (published in April 2016) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “IFRS 15”) from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Along with application of IFRS 15, excluding the interest and dividend income, etc., based on IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments,” revenue is recognized by applying the following five steps:
Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation

(i) Sale of merchandise
For the sale of merchandise, revenue is recognized at the point when it is delivered, since material risks and economic value associated with ownership of the merchandise are transferred to customers at the time of its delivery, and customers acquire control over it, and thereby the Group’s performance obligations are considered to be satisfied.
The revenue arising from sale of merchandise is calcu- lated by deducting the amount of rebates and discounts based on the number and amount of sales from the consideration in the sales contract, and the consideration to be refunded to customers and the amounts to be collected on behalf of third parties are recognized as a refund liability. The most likely amount method based on contractual conditions and past results is used to estimate rebates, etc. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue previously recognized.
Consideration related to sale of merchandise is mainly received within one year from the delivery of merchandise to customers. This does not include significant financing components.
(ii) Royalty revenue, etc.
Royalty revenue is consideration for license contracts, etc., calculated on the basis of revenue, etc., of the other party in the contract, and it is recognized as revenue taking the time of occurrence into consideration.
License revenue is up-front payment and milestone revenue received under license contracts, etc., related to development or rights to develop or sell products, etc., executed between the Group and third parties. For license contracts, etc., when performance obligations are satisfied at a specific point in time, performance obliga- tions under the contract are considered to be satisfied at the time of granting development or selling rights, etc., for up-front payment and milestone revenue, and at this point, the up-front payment and milestone revenue are recognized as revenue. When performance obligations are satisfied over a certain period of time, the consider- ation is recognized as contract liabilities, and up-front payment and milestone revenue are recognized as revenue over a certain period of time, such as the estimated development period according to the method of measuring the degree of progress regarding satis- faction of the performance obligations determined for each individual contract.
Milestone revenue is recognized as revenue, considering the probability that there will be a significant reversal of
revenue previously recognized, from the time that milestones specified in the contract are achieved.
Royalty revenue, etc., are mainly received within one year from the vesting under the contract. This does not include significant financing components.
Based on the five-step approach above, as a result of reviewing the revenue recognition period for license revenue such as up-front payment received under license contracts in light of satisfying performance obligations, up-front payment received from license contracts, which was recognized over time as deferred income under the previous standard, is recognized as one-time income at the time of granting development or selling rights, etc. Also, as a result of a review in light of the definition of customers, certain items which were formerly deducted from revenue are treated as cost of sales from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
For the application of these standards, the Group adopted a method to recognize the cumulative effect recognized as a transitional measure on the date of initial application. Also, certain accounts payable formerly included and presented within trade and other payables, as well as certain provisions, are included and presented within trade and other payables as refund liabilities from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019.
Consequently, compared with cases calculated using the previous accounting standards, at the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, mainly trade and other payables increased by ¥618 million ($5,566 thousand), retained earnings increased by ¥4,127 million ($37,179 thousand), deferred tax assets decreased by ¥1,820 million ($16,393 thousand), provisions decreased by ¥823 million ($7,414 thousand), other current liabilities decreased by ¥646 million ($5,824 thousand), and long-term advances received decreased by ¥5,095 million ($45,899 thousand).
For the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared with cases calcu- lated using the previous accounting standards, revenue increased by ¥8,889 million ($80,080 thousand), cost of sales increased by ¥9,553 million ($86,059 thousand), operating profit decreased by ¥664 million ($5,978 thousand), and profit before tax decreased by ¥664 million ($5,978 thousand).
Also, for the consolidated statement of financial position as at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, compared with cases calculated using the previous accounting standards, mainly trade and other payables increased by ¥996 million ($8,971 thousand), retained earnings increased by ¥3,666 million ($33,030 thousand),
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial Section
deferred tax assets decreased by ¥1,617 million ($14,564 thousand), provisions decreased by ¥1,231 million ($11,092 thousand), other current liabilities decreased by ¥17 million ($155 thousand), and long-term advances received decreased by ¥5,030 million ($45,318 thousand).
2) IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”
The Group has applied IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” (revised in July 2014), from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The Group applied the exception, not restating the comparative periods presented, according to the transi- tional option. The application of this standard does not have a significant effect on the Group’s financial results and financial position.
3) IFRIC 22, “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”
The Group has applied IFRIC 22, “Foreign Currency Trans- actions and Advance Consideration,” from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The application of this standard does not have a significant effect on the Group’s financial results and financial position.
(5) Changes in Method of Presentation

Note 3
Significant Accounting Policies
The significant accounting policies have been applied consis- tently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
(1) Basis of Consolidation
§1 Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Even if the Group does not have a majority of voting rights, the Group concludes that it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins on the date the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and continues
“Other” in cash flows from investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 are separately presented from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 due to the increased quantitative materiality. In order to conform with the current years presentation, the consolidated financial statements are reclassified for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
As a result, ¥531 million for “Other,” which was shown in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, is reclassified into ¥800 million in “Proceeds from withdrawal of time deposits” and ¥(269) million in “Other.”
(6) U.S. Dollar Amounts
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen. The translations of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan using the rate of ¥111 to $1, the approximate rate of exchange at March 29, 2019. Such translations should not be construed as representa- tions that the Japanese yen amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that or any other rate. Amounts of less than one thousand U.S. dollars have been rounded to the nearest one thousand U.S. dollars in the presentation of the accom- panying consolidated financial statements. As a result, the totals in U.S. dollars do not necessarily agree with the sum of the individual amounts.
through the date the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary without a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, and a difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity as equity attrib- utable to owners of the parent company.
In cases where the accounting policies applied by a subsidiary are different from those applied by the Group, adjustments are made to the subsidiary’s financial statements, if necessary.
All intercompany receivables, payables, and transactions of the Group and unrealized profit and loss from inter- company transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The closing date of all subsidiaries is the same as that of the Company.
 065 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

§2 Associates
An associate refers to an entity over which the Group does not have control but has significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the entity. Signif- icant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but does not have control over those policies.
Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost and accounted for by the equity method of accounting in the consolidated statement of financial position from the date when the Group obtains significant influence until the date the Group loses significant influence. In cases where the accounting policies applied by an associate are different from those applied by the Group, adjustments are made to the associate’s financial statements, if necessary.
The closing date of all associates is the same as that of the Company.
§3 Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
The Group measures the consideration for an acquisition as the sum of the consideration transferred in a business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest and in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquisition. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The non-controlling interest is measured at fair value or based on the appropriate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The Group recognizes goodwill as any excess of the consideration for acquisition over the net amount of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. If the net amount of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree exceeds the consider- ation for acquisition, the acquirer recognizes the excess amount as profit or loss on the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.
(2) Foreign Currencies
The consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company’s functional currency. Each entity of the Group applies its own functional currency and measures its transactions using its functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using spot exchange rates or approx- imate rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using spot exchange rates as of the closing date. Exchange differences arising from such translations and settlements are recognized in profit or loss. However, exchange differ- ences arising from financial assets measured through other comprehensive income and cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency using spot exchange rates as of the closing date, while income and expenses are translated into the presentation currency at the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. In cases where foreign operations are disposed of, the cumulative amount of translation differences related to the foreign operations is recognized as profit or loss in the period of disposition.
(3) Financial Instruments
§1 Financial Assets
(i) Initial Recognition and Measurement
Trade receivables, etc., are initially recognized on the date when they are incurred. All other financial assets are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments. Financial assets are classified as either financial assets measured at fair value or financial assets measured at amortized cost.
All regular-way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a settlement date basis. Regular-way purchases or sales refer to purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
At initial recognition, all financial assets, except for those measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial assets. Transaction costs of financial assets measured through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
(ii) Classification and Subsequent Measurement a. Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost
Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:
• The financial asset is held within a business model whose
objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. 066

Financial Section
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
After initial recognition, the carrying amounts of the financial assets measured at amortized cost are calcu- lated using the effective interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses arising in the case of derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
b. Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
Financial assets are classified as debt instruments measured at FVOCI if both of the following conditions are met:
• The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
• The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
c. Equity instruments measured at FVOCI
After initial recognition, equity instruments designated to be measured at FVOCI are measured at fair value, and any changes in fair value are included in net gain (loss) on financial assets measured at FVOCI in other compo- nents of equity.
When such financial assets are derecognized, the accumulated other comprehensive income is immedi- ately transferred to retained earnings. Meanwhile, dividends from such financial assets are recognized as profit when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.
d. Financial assets measured at FVPL
Financial assets, except for financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and equity instruments measured at FVOCI stated above, are classified as financial assets measured at FVPL.
After initial recognition, financial assets measured at FVPL are measured at fair value, and any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
(iii) Derecognition of Financial Assets
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset expires or is transferred, or when it transfers substan- tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset.
(iv) Impairment of Financial Assets
At the end of each fiscal year, the Group evaluates whether the credit risk on financial instruments has increased significantly since initial recognition. With respect to impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses on such financial assets. If credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased signifi- cantly since initial recognition, the allowance for such financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the allowance for such financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. Whether credit risk is significantly increased or not is determined based on the changes in default risk. The assessment of whether or not there is a change in default risk takes into account information that is reasonably available to the Group and supportable as well as past due information. When the credit risk on a financial asset is considered low at the end of the fiscal year, the Group determines that the credit risk on the financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition. Expected credit losses are measured based on the discounted present value of the differences between the contractual cash flows and the cash flows expected to be received. However, with regards to trade receivables, etc., the allowance is always measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, regardless of whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The amount of expected credit losses or reversal is recognized in profit or loss.
§2 Financial Liabilities
(i) Initial Recognition and Subsequent Measurement
The Group holds financial liabilities that are measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially measured at fair value minus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recog- nition, the carrying amounts of financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are calculated using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising from amortization using the effective interest method and derecognition are recognized as profit or loss in the consolidated statement of income.
(ii) Derecognition of Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the Group’s contractual obligations are discharged, canceled, or expired.
067 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

§3 Offsetting of Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amounts are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
§4 Derivatives
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as derivatives to address the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Forward foreign exchange contracts are initially measured at fair value when the contract is entered into and are subsequently remea- sured at their fair value. Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized as profit or loss in the consolidated statement of income. However, gains and losses on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
§5 Hedge Accounting
The Group designates forward foreign exchange contracts that are derivatives in respect of addressing the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuation as hedging instruments for cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items in accordance with the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. In addition, at the inception of the hedge and during the life of the hedge, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the under- lying hedged items attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedge accounting is as follows:
The effective portion of changes in fair value of deriva- tives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other components of equity. The ineffective portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss in the same line as the recognized hedged item. However, in cases where the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the gains and losses previously recognized in other compre-
hensive income and accumulated in equity are trans- ferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income and accumu- lated in equity remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit or loss.
§6 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments traded on active financial markets as of each reporting date are based on quoted prices in the markets or dealer prices. The fair values of financial instruments for which no active markets exist are calculated by using appropriate valuation techniques.
(4) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are composed of cash on hand, bank deposits drawable at any time, and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date, which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
(5) The Standard for Measurement and the Value of Inventories
Inventory costs include raw materials, direct labor, and other direct costs as well as relevant overhead expenses. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is mainly determined using the weighted-average method. Net realizable value is deter- mined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
 
(6) Property, Plant, and Equipment (Except for Leased Assets)
The Group applies the cost model for subsequent measurement of property, plant, and equipment and records them at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant, and equipment comprises costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and initial estimations of asset retirement obligations. Depreciation of an item of property, plant, and equipment commences when the assets are available for use.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. 068

Financial Section
Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated by the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of major asset items are as follows:
impairment losses. However, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired separately are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization for intangible assets commences when the related assets are available for use. Except for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or which are not yet available for use, each intangible asset is amortized by the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of major intangible asset items are as follows:
Sales licenses: 8 ─ 17 years
Software: 3 ─ 8 years
The estimated useful lives used in calculating the amortization of sales licenses are determined by considering the effective period of the patents and others.
The estimated useful lives and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year, and any changes are treated as changes in accounting estimates and applied prospectively.
Internally Generated Intangible Assets (Research and Development Costs Internally Generated)
Costs arising from development (or from the devel- opment phase of an internal project) shall be recog- nized as an asset if, and only if, all of the following have been demonstrated:
(i) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
(ii) the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
(iii) the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
(iv) how the intangible asset will generate probable
future economic benefits;
(v) the availability of adequate technical, financial, and
other resources to complete the development and
to use or sell the intangible asset; and
(vi) the ability to measure reliably the expenditure
attributable to the intangible asset during its devel-
opment.
Due to the risks and uncertainties relating to the approval and development activity of pharmaceutical drugs, the Group determines that the recognition criteria for capitalization as intangible assets are considered not to have been met unless it obtains marketing approval from the relevant regulatory authorities.
Internally generated development expenses arising before marketing approval has been obtained are expensed under “Research and development costs” as incurred.
Buildings and structures: Machinery and vehicles: Tools, furniture, and fixtures:
15 ─ 50 years 4 ─ 15 years 2 ─ 20 years
The estimated useful lives and depreciation method, etc., are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year, and any changes are treated as changes in accounting estimates and applied prospectively.
(7) Impairment of Property, Plant, and Equipment
During each fiscal year, the Group determines whether there is any indication of impairment on each asset. If any indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount is computed at the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or value in use of the asset or cash-generating unit. If the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recov- erable amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and impairment loss is recognized.
The value in use is computed by discounting the estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks inherent to the asset, etc. For the calculation of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used based on available fair value indices.
An impairment loss recognized in prior years is assessed as to whether there is any indication that the impairment loss for an asset or a cash-generating unit may have decreased or may no longer exist. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is estimated. In cases where the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit, impairment losses are reversed up to the lower of the estimated recov- erable amount or the carrying amount, net of accumu- lated depreciation that would have been determined if no impairment losses had been recognized in prior years.
(8) Intangible Assets

§2
069 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

§3 Impairment of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or intan- gible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment individually or on a cash-generating unit basis at the end of each fiscal year or whenever any indication of impairment exists.
Impairment tests are performed by calculating the recoverable amount of each intangible asset and comparing the recoverable amount with its carrying amount. In cases where a recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be estimated, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-gener- ating unit is measured at the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. The value in use is computed by discounting the estimated future cash flows to the present value.
The discount rate used is a pretax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks inherent to the asset using unadjusted estimates of future cash flows.
(9) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases when substan- tially all the risks and rewards of ownership are trans- ferred to the Group. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
In finance lease transactions, leased assets and lease obligations are carried at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. Leased assets and lease obliga- tions are presented as property, plant, and equipment and borrowings, respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial position. Leased assets are depre- ciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs and the repayments of the lease obligations based on the interest method, and finance costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income.
In operating lease transactions, lease payments are recognized as an expense by the straight-line method over the lease terms in the consolidated statement of income. Contingent rents are recognized as an expense in the period when incurred.
Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is identified based on the substance of the arrangement in accordance with IFRIC 4, “Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.”
(10) Employee Benefits
The Group participates in both defined benefit and defined contribution plans as employee retirement benefit plans.
§1 Defined Benefit Plans
For the Group’s defined benefit plans, the cost of providing retirement benefits is measured by the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of any changes in the asset ceiling, and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recog- nized through other comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred and immediately reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position. Remea- surements recognized in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified to retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which revisions to the plans occurred. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the reporting period to the net defined benefit liability or asset and presented as “finance income” or “finance costs.” Defined benefit expenses are classified into the following components:
• Service costs (current service costs, past service costs
and others)
• Net interest expense or income
• Remeasurements
The retirement benefit assets or liabilities recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position represent the actual surplus or deficit in the Group’s defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available future economic benefits in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
§2 Defined Contribution Plans
Contributions paid for defined contribution plans are expensed in the period in which the employees provide the related service.
(11) Provisions
The Group recognizes provisions when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that it will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made.
Where the time value of money is material, a provision is measured at the present value of estimated expenditures required to settle the obligation. The present value is
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. 070

Financial Section
computed using a pretax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks inherent to the liabil- ities.
(12) Revenue
Revenue, excluding interest and dividend income, etc., is recognized by applying the following five steps:
Step 1: Identify the contract with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the
contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation
§1 Sale of Merchandise
For the sale of merchandise, revenue is recognized at the point when it is delivered, since material risks and economic value associated with ownership of the merchandise are transferred to customers at the time of its delivery, and customers acquire control over it, and thereby the Group’s performance obligations are considered to be satisfied.
The revenue arising from sale of merchandise is calcu- lated by deducting the amount of rebates and discounts based on the number and amount of sales from the consideration in the sales contract, and the consider- ation to be refunded to customers and the amounts to be collected on behalf of third parties are recognized as a refund liability. The most likely amount method based on contractual conditions and past results is used to estimate rebates, etc. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal of revenue previously recognized. Consideration related to sale of merchandise is mainly received within one year from the delivery of merchandise to customers. This does not include signif- icant financing components.
§2 Royalty Revenue, etc.
Royalty revenue is consideration for license contracts, etc., calculated on the basis of revenue, etc., of the other party in the contract, and it is recognized as revenue taking the time of occurrence into consideration. License revenue is up-front payment and milestone revenue received under license contracts, etc., related to development or rights to develop or sell products, etc., executed between the Group and third parties. For license contracts, etc., when performance obligations are satisfied at a specific point in time, performance
obligations under the contract are considered to be satisfied at the time of granting development or selling rights, etc., for up-front payment and milestone revenue, and at this point the up-front payment and milestone revenue are recognized as revenue. When performance obligations are satisfied over a certain period of time, the consideration is recognized as contract liabilities, and up-front payment and milestone revenue are recog- nized as revenue over a certain period of time, such as the estimated development period according to the method of measuring the degree of progress regarding satisfaction of the performance obligations determined for each individual contract.
Milestone revenue is recognized as revenue, considering the probability that there will be a significant reversal of revenue previously recognized, from the time that milestones specified in the contract are achieved. Royalty revenue, etc., are mainly received within one year from the vesting under the contract. This does not include significant financing components.
(13) Income Taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Current tax expense is measured at the expected amount of a refund or payment of taxes from/to the taxation authorities. The Group’s income taxes are calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Current tax expense is recognized as an expense, except for the taxes attributable to items recognized directly either in other comprehensive income or equity.
Deferred tax expense is calculated based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their tax basis as of the closing date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carryforward of unused tax credits and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are principally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities are not recognized for the following temporary differences: • Deductible temporary differences associated with
investments in subsidiaries and associates where it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or it is not probable that taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be used.
071 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.

• Taxable temporary differences associated with invest- ments in subsidiaries and associates where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are estimated for the year in which these assets are realized or these liabil- ities are settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the closing date.
(14) Treasury Shares
Treasury shares are recognized at cost and deducted from equity. Neither gain nor loss is recognized on the purchase, sale, or retirement of the treasury shares. Any difference between the carrying amount and proceeds on sales is treated as capital reserve.
Note 4
Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Judgment Involving Estimations
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(15) Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit and loss for the year attributable to owners of the parent company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted by the number of treasury shares for the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated adjusting the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(16) Share-based Payments
The Company has a share option plan as an incentive plan for the Board of Directors (excluding outside directors). Share options are recognized as expenses over the vesting period and the corresponding amount is recognized as an increase in equity. In addition, the fair value of share options is calculated using the Black-Scholes model at the grant date.
 The Group’s consolidated financial statements include management estimates and assumptions for measure- ments of income and expense, and assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on manage- ment’s best judgment along with historical experience and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances as of the closing date. However, there is a possibility that these estimates and assumptions may differ from actual results in the future due to their nature.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reevaluated by management. The effects of revisions to the accounting estimates and assumptions are recognized in the period of the revision and future periods.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the Group’s consoli- dated financial statements are as follows:
• Impairment of property, plant, and equipment and intan- gible assets
With regard to property, plant, and equipment and intan- gible assets, if there is any indication that the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the Group performs an impairment test.
Important factors that trigger the impairment test to be
performed include significant changes adversely affecting the results of past or projected business performance, significant changes in the usage of acquired assets or changes in overall business strategy, and significant deterioration in industry trends or economic trends. The amount of impairment is determined based on the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use measured based on the valuation of risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted at an appropriate rate. Future cash flows are estimated based on business forecasts. There is a possibility that a future event may result in changes in assumptions used in such impairment tests and may affect future operating results of the Group.
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognized on temporary differ- ences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabil- ities for accounting purposes and the corresponding tax bases using the effective tax rate applied to the temporary differences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized to recover the deferred tax assets.
• Actuarial assumptions for retirement benefit accounting The Group has a number of retirement benefit plans,
Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD. 072

Financial Section
including defined benefit plans. The Group calculates the present value of defined benefit obligations and related service costs based on actuarial assumptions. The actuarial assumptions require estimates and judgments on variables, such as discount rates and net interest, etc. The Group obtains advice from external pension actuaries with respect to the appropriateness of the actuarial assumptions including the variables.
Note 5
The actuarial assumptions are determined based on the best estimates and judgments made by management; however, there is a possibility that these assumptions may be affected by changes in uncertain future economic conditions. In cases where the assumptions need to be revised, the revision may have a material impact on amounts recognized in the consolidated financial state- ments.

weighted-average cost of capital, and the pretax discount rate used in the calculation of value in use is from 7.5% to 11.8% for the year ended March 31, 2019.
As a result of impairment testing, the Group does not recognize any impairment losses for patents and licenses for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019. The Group recognized impairment losses for software of ¥65 million ($587 thousand) for the year ended March 31, 2019.

     Notes: 1. The differences between deferred tax expense and the amount recognized in profit or loss are exchange differences on translation of foreign operations and others.
2. The effective statutory tax rate used to calculate deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2018 and 2019 in Japan is 30.6%.
3. Taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities were not recognized, amounted to ¥2,357
million and ¥2,858 million ($25,750 thousand) as of March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. This is because the Group is able to control the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences, and it is certain that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
4. The Group has applied IFRS 15 from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as described in “2. Basis of Preparation (4) Changes in Accounting Policies.”
Since the cumulative effect of the initial application is recognized as adjustment of the retained earnings at the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 according to the transitional option, the amount for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 is not restated.

Retirement Benefits
The Group has defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum payment plans for its defined benefit schemes. Effective October 1, 2004, the Company introduced a new defined benefit corporate pension plan combining the defined benefit corporate pension plan (formerly additional pensions under employees’ pension fund plan) and a tax-qualified pension plan, and granted employees the option to select a defined contribution plan for certain
(1) Defined Benefit Plans
lump-sum payment plans. In addition, the Company has set up a retirement benefit trust in order to supplement funding deficits in benefit obligations.
Further, three overseas subsidiaries have defined contri- bution plans, one overseas subsidiary has a lump-sum payment plan, and two domestic subsidiaries participate in corporate pension fund plans (multiemployer pension plans) in addition to lump-sum payment plans.

      The Group’s operating policy for plan assets is as follows: The Group’s basic policy for plan asset management aims to secure necessary long-term returns within a tolerable risk level in order to ensure future payment of pension benefits stipulated in the terms of defined benefit corporate pension plans and lump-sum payments.
A target rate of return is set aiming to exceed the rate of return necessary for maintaining sound operations of the defined benefit corporate pension plans over the
future, specifically higher than the expected rate of return for pension financing.
In order to meet this return target, the asset portfolio is verified by both the Company and the investment management institutions to be in conformity with the basic policy, and, in addition, the composition of the asset portfolio is reviewed as necessary.
The basic policy is subject to change in accordance with changes in the Company’s status and systems or operating environment surrounding the Company.

(2) Multiemployer Pension Plans
Two domestic consolidated subsidiaries have joined
corporate pension funds (multiemployer pension
plans). The funds were established as a successor for
employees’ pension funds (multiemployer pension (3) plans) and the subsidiaries transferred in March 28,
2018, resulted from obtaining approval of dissolution of the employees’ pension plan from the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare on the same day. These plans are integrated-type defined benefit plans, and therefore, the amount of pension assets corresponding to the contributions made by each company cannot be
determined reasonably. Thus, the amount of the contri- bution is recognized as postemployment expenses in the same manner as defined contribution plans.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Group recognized ¥2,885 million and ¥3,052 million ($27,493 thousand) as expenses for defined contribution plans for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

Financial Instruments
(1) Equity Management
The Group manages its equity in view of maintaining the confidence of investors, creditors, and the market, securing a firm capital base for continued future growth, and implementing strategic investments necessary to maximize corporate value while distrib- uting consistent dividend payments.
The Group’s capital management focuses on net debt where cash and cash equivalents are deducted from interest-bearing debt and equity (attributable to owners of the parent company and non-controlling interests). The Group considers methods of capital distribution to shareholders based on an evaluation of the medium-term strategic plan, including business perfor- mance, future research and development of new medicines, partnerships with bio-ventures, and additionally the introduction of pipelines to complement research and development risk. This evaluation will exert influence on decision-making regarding the level of dividend payments and the Group’s market purchase of treasury shares.
(2) Financial Risk Management
The Group is constantly exposed in its operating activ-
For the year ended March 31, 2018

For the year ended March 31, 2019
¥ 51,539 514,121

   107 Corporate Report 2019 ONO PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.
ities to various financial risks, including credit, liquidity, market, and others (e.g., foreign exchange and price fluctuation). In order to avoid or mitigate these risks, the Group manages risks according to certain basic policies. The Group policy is not to enter into speculative derivative or equity transactions, but to operate funds primarily through debt instruments such as safe government bonds, etc., while also partially employing financial assets with guaranteed liquidity to meet short-term capital requirements. For derivative transactions, the Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with settling payments in foreign currencies. Such transactions are controlled by the Accounting Department of the Company.
(3) Credit Risk Management
Credit risks are risks that result in financial losses incurred by the Group when a customer goes into default for contractual obligations. When full or partial collection of trade receivables, etc., is considered impossible, or extremely difficult, it is deemed to be a default.
The Group’s trade receivables are exposed to the credit risk of its customers. In addition, like other pharmaceutical companies, the Group is exposed to concentrated credit

risk from a small number of wholesale companies
through which it sells its products. In cases where any of
these wholesale companies face financial difficulties,
there is a possibility that this may have a severe and
disadvantageous influence on the Group’s financial
performance.
The Group’s revenue mainly consists of royalty revenue
and sales of products through a small number of whole-
salers, and the total revenue from the top five group
companies (including the parent company and the group
company) accounts for about 76% of “Revenue” in the
consolidated statement of income. Trade receivables
from the top five group companies as of March 31, 2018
and 2019 were ¥56,081 million and ¥55,140 million
($496,761 thousand), respectively.
In order to mitigate monetary damage caused by the
default of such counterparties, the Group, in principle,
determines credit limits and trade terms and conditions
based on the credit management policy. In addition, in
order to minimize the amount of uncollectable receiv-
ables, the Group manages due dates and balances by
transaction, and executes continuous credit evaluation by
receiving credit updates for its main counterparties from
third party rating agencies. With regard to trade receiv-
ables, etc., that do not contain significant financing
components, the allowance is always measured at an
amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, as follows:
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
regardless of whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, and the Group has never recorded a significant bad debt loss on its trade receivables in the past.
The Group is also exposed to issuer credit risk for bonds held to make use of surplus funds and shares held for political purposes. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risk of the financial institutions that are the counterparties in derivative transactions used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with settling payments in foreign currencies. Because the Group operates funds primarily through secure debt instru- ments and executes transactions with highly rated financial institutions in order to prevent the emergence of credit risk in advance, credit risk is low.
The carrying amounts of financial assets after impairment presented in the consolidated statement of financial position represent the Group’s maximum exposure to financial asset credit risk.
At the end of each fiscal year, the Group evaluates whether the credit risk on financial instruments has increased significantly since the initial recognition, and with respect to impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses on such financial assets.
The movements in allowance for doubtful accounts are

       (4) Liquidity Risk Management
The Group is exposed to the liquidity risk of not being able to fulfill its payment obligations at present or in the future due to an inability to source sufficient cash. The Group, in particular the Accounting Department, maintains appropriate reserves and manages liquidity
risk through monitoring of the Group’s cash flow forecasts and results. Because the Group has sufficient cash and cash equivalents and other highly liquid assets and secures stable cash in flows from operating activities, this risk is low.

§2 Price Fluctuation Risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of share price fluctua- tions that arise from equity instruments.
These equity instruments are basically held for the purpose of business strategy and not for short-term trading purposes. In addition, the Group periodically reviews the fair value of the instruments and the financial condition of issuers and the like, and in cases where the issuer is also a counterparty company, takes into account the relationship with that company and reconsiders the composition of holdings in the company as necessary.
In case that the share price of equity instruments held by the Group increases or decreases by 10% at year-end, accumulated other comprehensive income (net-of-tax) would increase or decrease by ¥12,767 million and

(7) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
§1 Fair Value Measurements
The methods and assumptions used in measuring the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables
Since these items are settled in a short period of time, the fair values of these items are approximately equiv- alent to their carrying amounts.
Marketable securities and investment securities
The fair values of marketable securities and investment securities are measured using quoted market prices. The fair values of unlisted shares are measured through rational methods, such as the adjusted net assets method and others.
Other financial assets and other financial liabilities • Insurance reserve fund
The fair value of the insurance reserve fund is measured based on the surrender value because there are no significant contractual restrictions associated with a refund.
• Forward foreign exchange contracts
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are measured based on quoted market prices for forward foreign exchange contracts under the same terms and conditions as of the closing date.
• Time deposits
The fair values of time deposits are based on discounted future cash flows using an interest rate assumed to be applied if similar contracts were to be newly carried out.
• Others
Since other items are settled in a short period of time, their fair values are approximately equivalent to their carrying amounts.
 
Borrowings
The fair values of borrowings are based on discounted future cash flows using a current interest rate for liabilities under similar terms and conditions. The fair value of lease obligations is measured based on discounted cash flows using a current interest rate for lease agreements under the same terms and condi- tions.

 §3 Fair Value Hierarchy
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement requires an entity to classify the fair value of financial instruments into Level 1 through Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based the observability of the inputs used in the fair value measurements of financial instruments.
The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
Level 1: Level 2: Level 3:
Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date.
Inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.
Inputs are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities.

2. As for remuneration of key management personnel, remuneration of internal directors consists of fixed remuneration, bonuses and share-based payments, and remuneration of outside directors and auditors consists of only fixed remuneration. The fixed remuneration of internal directors is determined in consideration of factors such as the size of the Group’s business, the nature of their duties, scope of responsibility of each management personnel, and consistency in treatment with respect to other employees with a remuneration database from major consulting companies. The bonuses and stock options as share-based payments are determined in consideration of management indicators, such as revenue and operating profit that reflect performance and qualitative indicators such as contributions to enhancement of long-term corporate value. On the other hand, in consideration of factors, such as the nature of their duties and to ensure the independence from the execution of business, the remuneration of outside directors and auditors consists of only fixed remuneration. To determine the level of remuneration of outside directors, the Company refers to a remuneration database from major consulting companies so that the Company can seek suitable persons who have significant experience and broad knowledge.

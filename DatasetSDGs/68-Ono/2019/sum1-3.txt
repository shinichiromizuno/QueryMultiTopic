We strive to realize Goal 3, “Ensure healthy lives and promote
well-being at all ages,” through business operations as a research and development company specializing in prescription drugs based on our corporate philosophy to be dedicated to man’s fight against disease and pain. To decrease the mortality rate of non-communicable diseases raised as a target of the SDGs, we concentrate our research efforts into diseases such as cancers, immunological diseases and central nervous system disorders to contribute to the creation of original and innovative therapeutic medications for diseases for which medical needs are still unmet. Furthermore, in addition to aid for diphtheria, whooping cough, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid vaccines as well as the hepatitis B vaccine to address infectious diseases, ONO contributes to therapeutic medications with low marketability, such as malaria, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, as well as new development, such as vaccines and diagnostic pharmaceuticals, through participation in the Global Health Innovative Technology Fund.

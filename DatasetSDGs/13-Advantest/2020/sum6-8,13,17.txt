Basic Policy
To fulfill our social responsibilities throughout our supply chain, Advantest publishes our Procurement Policy and Supply Chain CSR Promotion Guidebook on our website, and stipulates compliance with relevant laws and social norms as well as support for initiatives related to human rights, labor, and environmental conservation. In addition, we require suppliers to sign our “Basic Transaction Contract,” which includes provisions related to ESG (Environment, Society, and Governance).

(1) CSR Procurement and Product Quality Improvement
In addition to conducting quarterly QCD* evaluations for suppliers, we also conduct an annual CSR questionnaire for the important suppliers who account for 80% of our transaction value. The questionnaire is adaptable to changing conditions, with the content being reviewed every year based on the Supply Chain CSR Promotion Guidebook and analysis of our pri- ority issues and survey results through the previous year. We also create summaries of results for each supplier and work for mutual improvement through feedback.

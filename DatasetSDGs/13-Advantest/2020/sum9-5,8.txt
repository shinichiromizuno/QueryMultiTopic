(1) Diversity Management
The active participation of each and every employee is indispensable for the sus- tainable growth of the company. Advantest has set “Inclusion and Diversity” as one of its core values, and is actively working to form a corporate culture that fosters an environment where everyone can work comfortably, and where each Advantest employee can maximize their individual potential, abilities, and motivation. In recog- nition of these efforts, in 2019 Advantest Europe GmbH (AEG) was selected as one of the 100 greatest places to work in Germany by the international Great Place To Work® Institute.

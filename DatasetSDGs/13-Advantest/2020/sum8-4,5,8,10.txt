Advantest considers employees a vital corporate resource. We support their diverse lifestyles and individual growth, and strive to help them grow together with the company. In September 2000, we established our Basic Philosophy of Human Resources, and continue to work on fairness and employee engagement, while actively supporting human resources development. We also support the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the Universal Dec- laration of Human Rights, and the Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, and aim to be an organization that emphasizes diversity while giving due consideration to the principles of human rights and labor.
Basic Philosophy of Human Resources
Advantest considers that employees are irreplaceable management resources (human capital), and has formulated the fol- lowing philosophy as a basis for our measures related to human resources.
1. Focus on results
By encouraging people to take on challenges, we promote a personnel system in which employees who have overcome
difficulties and achieved innovative results are evaluated and rewarded appropriately.
2. Fairness and engagement
We perpetually strive to make all our measures and systems objectively fair, with the goal of obtaining maximum employ-
ee engagement and achieving optimal results.
3. Active support for human resources development
We work tirelessly to improve ourselves, and actively support employees who wish to acquire advanced specialized knowledge and broaden their education.

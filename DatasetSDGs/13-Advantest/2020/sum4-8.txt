(2) Human Rights Issues Helpline
Advantest has set up a corporate ethics helpline for human rights problems or consultations that are difficult to solve in the workplace, enabling employees to report issues and consult directly with the Corporate Ethics Office. The Corporate Ethics Office plays a central role in handling reports and consultations, and keeps the names of individuals strictly confidential to avoid possible unfavorable treatment or retaliation. From fiscal 2019, we also set up a channel for reports to an external law firm to make helpline consultations and reports even easier. These helplines can also be used outside Japan.
In Japan, we have set up a Human Rights Protection Committee which works together with our labor union to resolve consultations on human rights issues. In fiscal 2019, we received two harassment-related consultations, both of which have been resolved. The Human Rights Protection Committee takes appropriate measures after giving due consideration to the privacy of the individuals involved, and seeks prompt solutions. In this way, we strive to create workplaces where all employees respect each othersâ€™ human rights and can work with peace of mind.

Advantest considers climate change response to be a key management issue. We are working to reduce CO2 emis- sions not only in-house but across the entire scope of our business activities, including our value chain. In April 2020,
we disclosed relevant information in alignment with the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-re- lated Financial Disclosures). We are also preparing to obtain SBT* (Science Based Targets) certification.
In terms of mid- to long-term CO2 emission reduction targets for business activities, we aim for a 30% reduction in (kt-CO2)
40
FY2030 (compared to FY2018) and a goal of “net-zero
CO2 emissions” by 2050. In August 2020, we joined the in- 30 ternational initiative RE100, which aims for business activi- 20 ties to use 100% renewable energy, and are promoting CO2 10 reduction globally by introducing renewable energy. We
have already achieved 100% renewable energy sourcing in the United States (2012) and Germany (2019), and in April 2020, we started introducing renewable energy at our Japanese R&D bases in Gunma and Saitama Prefectures. We plan to achieve RE100 at the Gunma Factory by 2030.
From 2030, we will aim to achieve the target of net-zero CO2 emissions in 2050 by further accelerating the intro- duction of renewable energy sourcing in Japan and Asia as appropriate given conditions in each region.

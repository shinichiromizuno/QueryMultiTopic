1) Creating a Workplace where Human Rights are Respected
Advantest believes that human rights are an important factor to consider in the global expansion of our business. We sup- port international human rights norms such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and respect basic human rights in light of the laws and regulations of each country and region where we operate.
In addition, we have signed the United Nations Global Compact, a global initiative advocated by the United Nations, and support its 10 principles by promoting initiatives in the four fields of human rights, labor, the envi-
ronment, and anti-corruption.
The Advantest Way includes a Code of Conduct that lays out our policy on human rights pro- tection. It prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, age, nationality, religion, social origin, physical disability, illness, or sexual orientation. We have also formulated a human rights and dis- crimination manual and a harassment prevention guide to promote protection and respect for hu- man rights, which guides us in developing the spirit of the United Nations Global Compact in our workplaces worldwide.

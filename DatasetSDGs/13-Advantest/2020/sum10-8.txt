(2) Global Hiring for a Global Workforce
Advantest emphasizes a global perspective in our system for hiring, training, and allocating human resources, aiming to give excellent employees fair access to opportunities regardless of nationality and promoting employees across national borders. Through exchanges, we are enhancing the development of global human resources and the globalization of our organization.
10 out of 24 executive officers of the Advantest Group are foreign nationals (as of March 2020), and the Advantest Corpo- ration (Japan) employs people from nine different countries.
(3) Workplaces That Foster Innovation
Advantest believes it is important for employees to share their know-how and skills, and we aim to create work environments where people can converse freely. In fiscal 2019, we significantly renovated our in-house gathering areas such as the cafes and cafeterias at our R&D centers and factories in Japan. In planning the renovations, we visited the offices of overseas subsidiaries to exchange opinions, and as a result set up not only
refreshment lounges but also casual meeting spaces and active spaces where employees can stretch. Bright open spaces with natural lighting are widely used to foster innovation, improve communication, and promote physical and spiritual refreshment.

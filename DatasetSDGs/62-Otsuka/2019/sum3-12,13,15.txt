3. Environmental Issues
Given that global warming is a major social issue, public attention is focused on CO2 emissions from food production as part of realizing a carbon-free society. The plant-based foods that Daiya Foods develops, manufactures and sells have a low carbon footprint, reduce environmental load, and are more sustainable. Daiya Foods was founded on the belief that plant-based living is better for people’s health and better for the planet. Its range of plant-based foods resonates with many people and as a category leader it is evolving into a high-growth company.
Soybeans are a part of Japan’s traditional food culture and contain quality dietary proteins, and have been referred to
as “the meat of the fields.” Focusing on the high nutritional value and potential of soybeans, Otsuka Pharmaceutical
has developed and commercialized soy-derived nutritional foods under three brands at its in-house research center—SOYJOY, SOYSH and SoyCarat. Soybeans directly consumed by people around the world account for a mere 6% of total soybean production. Beef is one source of protein, but to produce 1 kilogram of beef, it is said to take 10 kilograms
of grain, such as soybeans. There is data suggesting that the production of soybeans requires one-fiftieth of the water and one-twentieth the amount of energy needed to produce the same volume of beef. Based on the concept of “Soylution” (soy + solution), Otsuka Pharmaceutical provides solutions for both human health and environmental issues through a range of soy products.

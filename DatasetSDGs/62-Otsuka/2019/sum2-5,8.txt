2. Women’s Health
Women experience mental and physical changes throughout their lives. The effects of rapid hormonal changes are felt by women in their 40s and 50s in particular, which can impact their social life.
The Otsuka group has identified women’s health as one
of the priority areas of its Nutraceutical Business. We are disseminating information to promote better understanding of physical changes in women and developing related products.
Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s Saga Nutraceuticals Research Institute conducts research on total health maintenance
for women in their 40s and older, including research into symptoms of menopause, bone and skin issues, and blood vessel health, and continues to generate evidence on active ingredients. In addition, our experts in women’s health carry out activities across Japan to spread accurate understanding of the mental and physical changes experienced by women and related health issues, as well as solutions to those issues.

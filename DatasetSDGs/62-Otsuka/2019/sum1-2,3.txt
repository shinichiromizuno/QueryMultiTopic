Social Issues Targeted by Otsuka
1. Irregular and Unbalanced Diets
While there is seemingly an abundance of food in the developed world, diversification in daily routines and an increase in single-person households contribute to eating alone, skipped meals, and unbalanced diets. This can lead to poor physical and mental well-being. The Otsuka group is tackling various social issues related to nutrition by developing nutritional products and implementing dietary education activities.
Leveraging expertise in concentrated liquid diets from our clinical nutrition business, we created Calorie Mate, which provides nutrition for general consumers. It supports healthy dietary life in busy modern lifestyles, and is a pioneer in nutritionally balanced foods in Japan. As the top-selling brand,* it continues to lead the field. Compact and with a long shelf life, Calorie Mate is convenient as a nutritional food for use during sports, when there is no
time for breakfast or other meals, and during work or study,
and can also be kept as a disaster provision.

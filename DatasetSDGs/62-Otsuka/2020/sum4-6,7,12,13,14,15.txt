Environment
As a global group that contributes to the health of people worldwide, the Otsuka group works sincerely to reduce the impact its businesses have on the global environment, and seeks to contribute to the creation of a sustainable society that can protect nature and the future of the earth. To support the solution of social issues related to the global environment, the Otsuka group has formulated an environmental policy and activity guidelines, and has determined
the materialities of its environmental initiatives to be climate change, resource recycling and conservation, and water conservation. We have set goals for 2030, and are carrying out activities aimed at achieving them.

The Otsuka group’s first ISO14001 certification was acquired in 1999.1 Since then, we have worked to acquire certification for the manufacturing sites of each group
company, and promoted activities to achieve the environmental goals set by each company.2 With the increasing severity of environmental issues in recent years, companies are being called upon to contribute to the resolution of such issues.
To strengthen group-wide efforts toward more efficient and effective environmental activities, the Otsuka
group’s five of major companies in Japan3 and Otsuka Holdings as the supervising organization acquired ISO 14001 integrated certification in August 2020. Under the integrated environmental goals and management systems outlined in the certification, we will further strengthen our environmental initiatives and make group-wide efforts to achieve the goals.

Introduced CO2-Free Electricity1 and Green Power Certificates
Since 2019, the Otsuka group has introduced CO2-free and electricity from other renewable energy sources , extending their use to manufacturing sites. In fiscal 2020, we reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 84,000 tons (equivalent to the annual emissions of approximately 29,000 households2) through the introduction of renewable energy.
In addition, five domestic group companies3 purchased Green Power Certificates for switching to green power at all sales sites and headquarters of the five group companies in Japan, and other offices, thereby reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 6,000 tons/year.
Going forward, the group will work together toward the realization of a decarbonized society, and ultimately of a sustainable society, by optimizing and maximizing energy use through the introduction of renewable energy and fuel conversion, while exercising synergistic effects among group companies.

Evaluating Water Risk at Manufacturing Sites
Considering environmental risk in each region is also important for sustainable growth in the diverse business models of the Otsuka group operating around the world. Since 2017, the Otsuka group has conducted primary water risk assessments at all consolidated manufacturing sites using the water risk assessment tool “Aqueduct,” developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), so as to understand and minimize the impact of
Introduced solar Power Generation System
for In-House Consumption
As a countermeasure against climate change, the Otsuka group has set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030.1 Toward this goal, we are promoting the further utilization of renewable energy and improving energy use efficiency through the introduction of co-generation systems and, including solar power CO2-free electricity generation systems.
In 2020, we introduced solar power generation systems for in-house consumption at the Kushiro Factory of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory and Otsuka Pharmaceutical India. We estimate that this will result in annual CO2 emission reductions of approximately 10% at Kushiro Factory, and by 6% at Otsuka Pharmaceutical India.

We also formulate analysis records for each site and implement comprehensive risk assessment by utilizing more detailed water data and collaborating among group companies. We will pursue the water resource conservation improve and use efficiency by identifying regional risks and promoting more specific research and collaboration among group companies, and by taking measures for region-based management and effective utilization.

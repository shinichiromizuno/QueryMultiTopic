The Otsuka group believes that the creation of innovation and sustained company growth come from the activities of a diverse range of employees in a free and open-minded workplace environment. To this end, we aim to foster a corporate culture that rouses an appetite for creativity. We not only invest in the development of human resources, but we also actively promote diversity in our workforce. As well as establishing a safe working environment, we also make efforts to realize fair hiring, evaluation, and promotion of employees, respecting human rights.

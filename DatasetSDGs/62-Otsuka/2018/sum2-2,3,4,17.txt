Based on the recognition that CSR is an integrated part of our business operations, the Otsuka group implements CSR initiatives under its corporate philosophy of “Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide”. Health is a universal desire of all people around the world. The Otsuka group engages in activities on a daily basis to prevent and treat disease and to contrib- ute to the maintenance and improvement of people’s health worldwide. The world we live in still faces a host of medical-related issues, such as the spread of infectious diseases, insufficient medical care facilities, and lack of effective therapeutic drugs. In aiming to solve these problems, we constantly ask ourselves what it is that only we can do. Accordingly, we carry out activities to find solutions for unmet medical needs that most companies have yet to address.
Moreover, owing to skyrocketing medical costs, maintaining and improving health is now an issue that society as a whole, not just individuals, must face head-on. Alongside initiatives that raise awareness of health among individuals, the Otsuka group also contributes to initiatives for maintaining and improving health in society at large through collaboration with local communities.

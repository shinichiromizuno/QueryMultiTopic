Active dialogs with investors
Kumagai Gumi works to properly, fairly, and promptly disclose information pertaining to our management and business activities.
In engagements with securities analysts and institutional investors, we held earnings briefings (2 times in the fiscal year ending March 2021, both with top management in attendance), small meetings (5 times in the same period, all with top management in attendance), and individual meetings and teleconferences (61 times in the same period, including 4 with top management in attendance).
Amid the spread of the COVID-19 FY2020, in addition to small meetings using online tools and participation in overseas investor meetings hosted by securities firms, we conducted flexible and proactive IR activities in response to the demands of shareholders and investors, including the new initiative of holding financial briefings in a hybrid online and venue-based format. The "Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic" content in our securities report for the fiscal year ended March 2020 was received positively by shareholders and investors, and was included in a collection of best-practice cases of written information disclosure released by the Financial Services Agency in 2020.
Amid growing interest in ESG investment in recent years, the Kumagai Gumi Group works to enhance ESG- related content in its various tools, and, recognizing the importance of non-financial information, holds ESG- specific meetings with institutional investors.

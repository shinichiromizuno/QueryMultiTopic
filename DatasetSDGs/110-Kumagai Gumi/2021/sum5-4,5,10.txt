Diverse Human Resources Fundamental concepts of human resources
We recognize that there are concerns over a declining workforce in the construction industry, and that securing human resources will become more difficult. Under these circumstances, Kumagai Gumi is actively undertaking the preparation of environments and systems that allow diverse human resources to perform their capabilities to the maximum. We are working to promote active participation by women, the employment of persons with disabilities, and reemployment after retirement to improve our employment environment and make it a foundation that supports management.

Kumagai Gumi works to resolve the advancing age of employees and imbalances among generations, and engages in recruitment activities with an awareness of diversity.
Based on information including future business performance trends, we formulate recruitment plans that take into consideration employees' total number, job types, age distribution, and other factors 5 and 10 years ahead, and engage in hiring of new graduates and mid-career employees.
In fiscal 2019, we set up a job return system. We are creating an environment by which retired employees who meet certain conditions can join the company again, to make use of experience gained at other companies.
Workplaces where women can play active roles
From December 2015, we increased our hiring of women and formulated and enacted an action plan to improve the workplace environment, in line with the Act on Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.
Status of employment of persons with disabilities
As a new initiative for the employment of persons with disabilities, we offered workplace training for students from special support education schools. We included site tours in the training so the students could gain familiarity with the construction industry. Accepting trainees in multiple departments also helped change the mindsets of employees.

Status of reemployment after retirement
We operate employment-related systems under the premise of employment until the statutory retirement age of 65, and contribute to the expansion of reemployment of retirees who wish to continue working. For Kumagai Gumi, the technical and sales capabilities of retirees constitute valuable assets that we hope to pass down to the next generation without interruption.
To energize employees and organizations alike, we are enhancing employee benefits to create comfortable work environments. As of April 2021, 353 retirees are working in the company.

Summary of the previous Medium-Term Management Plan and review of FY2020
Medium-Term Management Plan
The stated fields of focus in the previous Medium- Term Management Plan were (1) major infrastructure renewal, (2) renewable energy, (3) disaster prevention and mitigation measures, and (4) utilization of civil engineering projects for forest conservation. We were able to achieve results in large-scale highway renewal construction, hydroelectric repowering, onshore wind power, Mega Solar power, and other areas. Drawing on these achievements, we aim to further evolve our
management capabilities and expand our scope of inclusion.
Despite changes in timing of additional renewal contracts due to the pandemic, orders in fiscal 2020 increased from the previous fiscal year to 100.1 billion yen. Sales were 121.4 billion yen, exceeding 120 billion yen as in the previous fiscal year and remaining at a high level.

have built up a track record of construction using Cotter floor slabs, and will further pursue size reduction and simplification to enhance our advantage in floor slab replacement construction.
We will address the renewable energy field with one- stop support for design, procurement, and construction. In this field, we will seek to increase orders and accumulate know-how, as well as to strengthen our engineering and risk management capabilities at the
initial stage of construction.

Initiatives in FY2021
In the Kumagai Gumi Civil Engineering business, we declared fiscal 2019 as DX Year 1. In fiscal 2021, the third year, we will digitalize our existing operations to improve efficiency and will undertake development of next-generation technologies.
In the field of major infrastructure renewal, we will establish a business model for securing profits. To meet the increasing scale of construction work and the diversification of the content of orders in this field, we will strengthen partnerships with other companies. We

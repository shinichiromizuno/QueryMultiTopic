We deliver "Quality that Inspires Happiness"
Kumagai Gumi established the Customer Satisfaction (CS) Promotion Office (current Sustainability Promotion Group) in 1998. The following year, we established Customer Consultation Offices at all of our branches.
The customer satisfaction (CS) functions of Kumagai Gumi are placed within the Management Strategy Office. The organization is designed to directly reflect the voices of customers in our management.
Primary CS activities of Kumagai Gumi
1) Customer insight questionnaires
Three years after delivering a structure to customers, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation questionnaire. In FY2020, we received 60 questionnaire responses (57 in FY2019).

2) Visit customer for asking their insight
Our top management makes visits not only to our regular patrons but also to customers with whom we have lost regular contact, to directly listen to their frank thoughts and incorporate these into our management. Restraining from visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY2020 we made only one visit (17 visits in FY2019).
3) Improvement of aftercare system
We perform centralized management of regular inspection, requests, inquiries, defect information, and other information using "construction clinical records," and share this information within the company.
4) Instillation of CS awareness in employees
We conduct internal commendations (2 commendations in FY2020) and lectures (in October 2020) on CS initiatives to instill Kumagai Gumi's CS awareness in our employees and achieve CS with the involvement of all.

Corporate Information
The Kumagai Gumi Group's Value Creation History
 1898 to 1945
Our founding and initial growth period
Work on difficult projects in difficult places
Kumagai Gumi started its operation
in January 1898 when Kumagai Gumi founder Santaro Kumagai, who had worked as a stone mason in Fukui, undertook aqueduct construction at the Shikununo Power Station. Kumagai Gumi has carried forward his words of "If there is any challenging construction work, let me do it" to take on challenging construction projects.
1937 Whole line opening of Sanshin Railway Line
1946 to 1960
Postwar reconstruction period Birth of Kumagai Gumi as tunnel experts
After the war, Kumagai Gumi established its Building Construction Division and contributed to the reconstruction of
Japan. The Civil Engineering Division
was involved in many tunnel construction projects. It was quick to adopt mechanized construction, and dramatically improved productivity. The division took charge of the hard construction of the Omachi Tunnel at the Kurobe River No. 4 Power Plant and solidified the reputation of Kumagai Gumi as tunnel construction experts.
1958 Opening of the Omachi Tunnel at the Kurobe River No. 4 Power Plant
1961 to 1980
Second growth period
Rapid progress and challenges
As the Japanese economy grew rapidly, Kumagai Gumi's Architectural Construction Division made remarkable advances, including the receipt of consecutive BCS Prizes and the construction of skyscrapers. The Civil Engineering Division, too, recorded numerous achievements that include the first use in Japan of NATM, which became
a standard tunnel construction method. We went on to conduct business development on a global stage, particularly in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia.
1981 to 1990
Third growth period
Active business expansion
Our Overseas Projects expanded not only
in Asia but US, Australia and so on. In 1985, Kumagai Gumi recorded over one trillion yen in orders along with the industry's highest ordinary income of 32.6 billion yen.
1991 to 2014
From crisis to reorganization
Kumagai Gumi was hit by the bursting of
the economic bubble. Facing a financial crisis triggered by massive real estate investments, the company requested financial aid two times. It promoted
thorough business revolution, tackled
new fields of construction, and undertook
the development of technologies such as unmanned construction. In 2014, Kumagai Gumi completed the cancellation of preferred stocks and achieved its reconstruction.

Interview with the President
Kumagai Gumi Co., Ltd. President
Yasunori Sakurano

As a leader of the construction services that society requires, we will earnestly address social issues and continue taking on challenges.
Looking back on the previous Medium-Term Management Plan, please tell us about the results.
While we did not hit our initial targets,
I feel that our steps toward growth are gradually gaining in strength.
  The Kumagai Gumi Group set a Medium-Term and Long-term Management Direction in 2017, under which we have moved ahead with the Medium-Term Management Plan since fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2020 marked the final year of the Management Plan.
Looking back on the results of those three years, sales were generally favorable but ordinary income failed to achieve our initially expected profit margin, which unfortunately meant that we did not reach our target values.
The three pillars of our strategy under the Medium- Term Management Plan were "maintain and increase contracted construction business," "create new businesses," and "form strategic alliances with other companies." Contracted construction business performed relatively well against a backdrop of robust construction
Summary of the Previous Plan (FY2018-FY2020)
demand, and while it did not reach the target value, it achieved a growth rate among the highest level in the industry. Our productivity, the source of earning ability, also steadily increased. Regarding the creation of new businesses and strategic alliances with other companies, we are have moved ahead with diverse projects, including our collaboration with Sumitomo Forestry. These plans lagged somewhat in Overseas Projects and other areas, however. While we have sown seeds for the future, we were not able to sufficiently nurture those.
As such, there are issues that have been left unsolved for the next fiscal year, but I feel that we did achieve results. The theme of the Medium-Term Management Plan was "Strategies for Accelerating Growth" for the reborn Kumagai Gumi Group. Our steps toward that growth are steadily increasing in power.
 /Consolidated Business Results
Sales generally were in line with our expectations, but consolidated
ordinary income did not reach the target number, the profit margin we had initially envisioned was not realized.
/ROE
Return on Equity was around the target value of 12%.
/Dividend Payout Ratio
We paid stable dividends, aiming for a target value of 30%.

Social issues for the year 2030 and beyond
  The COVID-19 pandemic that the world is wrestling with now is an event that talking about the uncertain era ahead, I feel. From here on out, it will be vital for the management of the Kumagai Gumi Group that we anticipate such uncertain changes and create systems that adapt flexibly and promptly to risks and opportunities.
With the pandemic, social values and people's modes of behaviors have changed greatly. The same is true with ways of working. Our group is enacting telework and other measures, but we face the problem of having many divisions in which such initiatives are difficult, as at civil engineering and architectural sites. From here on out, we will further accelerate our promotion
of DX (digital transformation) and transform how we do business.
The achievement of a sustainable society, as symbolized by the SDGs, is a surging movement in the world. In Japan, the intensification of natural disasters, aging infrastructure, declining economic power due to population decline, and other social issues are emerging. As a construction group, we have responded to a variety of social issues and have contributed to the development of society. Upholding this stance, we will take these social risks as opportunities for business expansion and will continue taking on challenges aimed at sustainable growth.

The Kumagai Gumi Group Corporate Report 2021 19
Under what sort of recognition did you formulate the new Medium-Term Management Plan?
We discussed what sort of society we are aiming for, set our a long-term vision, and formulated a management policy aimed at 2030 and beyond.
What sort of business strategy do you plan to undertake in the new Medium-Term Management Plan?
While further bolster our core construction business, we will accelerate growth in peripheral domains and take on the challenge of pioneering new businesses.
  The new Medium-Term Management Plan that we formulated sets out a "long-term vision" as a premise of the three-year plan that starts in fiscal 2021. This management policy looks ahead to 2030 and beyond, showing how we will contribute through our core business to the SDGs, globally shared goals aimed at achieving a sustainable society.
As I noted, even greater uncertainty is expected in society. In such times, accurately predicting how society will have changed a decade from now is difficult. However, it's vital for the future of our group that we draw up an image of our own future and discuss our path for getting there.
In formulating this Medium-Term Management Plan, we performed repeated reviews through a working group focused on young and mid-career employees who will lead the next generation, and held thorough discussions in management meetings.
What we reaffirmed through such discussions was the importance of aspirations, including the integrity and spirit of endeavor that Kumagai Gumi has carried forward since its founding. We incorporated these ideas into our long-term vision, and expressed the role of the Kumagai Gumi Group with the words "We take on difficult projects in difficult places as a group of construction technology professionals. We build social infrastructure and provide diverse values in terms of both construction services."
In the new Medium-Term Management Plan, we will advance strategies over the course of three years from fiscal 2021, based on our long-term vision. There are three pillars of this business strategy.
The first is "bolster overall construction business." This is a core business that forms a foundation for the group's growth. One field that we will focus on within deepening of the construction business is large-scale infrastructure renewal, for which growing demand is expected in domestic Civil Engineering. In domestic Building Construction, we will ramp up our development of the medium- to large-scale wooden construction market together with Sumitomo Forestry. In March 2021, we launched "with TREE," a medium- and large- scale wooden construction brand as a collaboration between our two companies. This is a business that I want to get on track. In Overseas Projects, we intend to strengthen our expansion in the Asian region, including in Taiwan, where orders are rising.
Our second strategy is "Accelerate construction- related peripheral business". Within this domain, we plan to position the four business areas of renewable energy, real estate development, infrastructure management, and technical product sales, and to accelerate growth and create solid sources of revenue. In the renewable energy business, we plan to move ahead with ongoing businesses such as woody biomass power generation, while also examining offshore wind power generation, an area attracting attention. In the real estate development business, we will work to develop overseas projects to follow our projects in Jakarta, Indonesia. In businesses peripheral to construction, we will actively partner with other companies, including our collaboration with Sumitomo Forestry, to accelerate the speed of business.
Our third strategy is "Develop new business domains". This is another very important strategy for the group in achieving further growth.
 Strategies for sustainable growth

Strategies for sustainable growth Interview with the President
What are your reasons for setting new non-financial goals from an ESG perspective?
The pursuit of ESG could be called the root of the Kumagai Gumi Group's management. We set new goals to make this management policy clearer.
Do you have a message for shareholders and investors regarding capital policy or other topics?
Our ROE and payout ratio remain steady.
We will continue to make aggressive growth investments while closely examining capital cost
   In the Medium-Term and Long-term Management Direction that we established in 2017, we included strengthening of management in terms of ESG perspectives, and formulated our ESG Initiative Direction in 2019. In the new Medium-Term Management Plan that we launched, too, management from an ESG perspective can be considered the root. For this reason, we clarified our non- financial goals in each of the fields of E (environment), S (society), and G (governance).
From this fiscal year, we will also connect our business to the SDGs and work to address risks and opportunities. Strengthening the foundation that supports our management is also vital. Advancing digitalization is one of the priority measures in the Medium-Term Management Plan. In May 2021, we established a DX Promotion Department to expand this area throughout the company. Taking into consideration the hiring of DX human resources and collaboration with other companies, we will pursue work style reform and will streamline and automate our business processes.
In technological development, too, we will contribute to the formation of a sustainable society featuring decarbonization and a recycling orientation. We will
accurately capture these business opportunities and build a research and development system that leads to increased profits.
In human resource development, we continue to promote diversity, including active participation by women. We have received recognition in this area. For instance, we were selected in "the New Diversity Management Selection 100 companies" by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in fiscal 2020.
A topic that is extremely important as a foundation of ESG/SDGs management is the enhancement of governance, including risk management. In Board of Directors meetings, we hold discussions concerning major business projects with outside directors to thoroughly identify any risks. To strengthen our financial risk management system, in April 2021 we separated and expanded an examination group that was part of the Finance Department, creating a new Examination Department. We are also tackling the issue of reforming the governance system of the Kumagai Gumi Group. We extend compliance training to the employees of group companies, collaborating closely with the management of the companies.
Under the Medium-Term Management Plan, we plan 40 billion yen in growth investments over the three years of the plan, with the aim of 33 billion yen in consolidated ordinary profit three years from now in fiscal 2023. We will carefully consider projects with a focus on businesses peripheral to construction that we consider growth areas, and will make aggressive investments with appropriate distributions taken into account.
In these growth investments, we place an emphasize on the cost of capital. For ROE, one of our numerical targets, we are aiming for 12%, the same as in the previous Medium-Term Management Plan. In fiscal 2020, too, our ROE has reached a level close to this target, achieving capital efficiency that greatly exceeds our expected cost of capital. We will continue striving to achieve a stable payout ratio of 30%.
Looking ahead, we will actively hold institutional investor meetings in Japan as well as overseas. We
also hope to increase opportunities for dialogs with our varied shareholders. I will continue working to optimize the balance between growth investments and returns to shareholders. My intent is to achieve solid growth while listening to opinions of our stakeholders.
  Management Strategy: Strengthen the Management Foundation
What do you think will be important for the Kumagai Gumi Group in achieving sustainable growth?
A spirit of endeavor toward the future is nurtured in an environment in which diverse human resources can play active roles.
We will work as one with our employees to tackle the challenge of our further growth.

Three years have passed since I became the President of Kumagai Gumi. Although we've fallen under this unexpected pandemic situation, I've tried to head out to sites and branch offices as much as possible to talk directly with employees. I've also actively engaged in dialogs with our customers and other stakeholders.
Interacting with employees in this way, there's something that I've recently come to feel. Our efforts to promote diversity are yielding results, and a culture in which varied and diverse human resources can play active roles is taking root.
In order to realize the "Proactive Measures for
sustainable growth" set forth in our new Medium-Term Management Plan, it's important that we create an organization that lets diverse people fully exert their abilities and acknowledge each other in free discussions, and that fosters the new ideas emerging from this. I want to take the lead in further advancing the reforms that are taking place in the company.
The spirit of endeavor that has been passed down since our founding is important to Kumagai Gumi. Our group will work as one to tackle the new Medium-Term Management Plan and will continue taking on challenges aimed at new growth.

Kumagai Gumi's ESG/SDGs Strategy
To realize long-term growth and to contribute to the formation of a sustainable society, the Kumagai Gumi Group has adopted the Medium-Term and Long-term Management Direction announced in November 2017, and has expressed that we will strengthen management from an ESG perspective.
In April 2019, we formulated the ESG Initiative Direction, identified key issues in our group's long-term business development, and clarified our targets concerning related SDGs.
Based on the long-term vision presented in the Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2021-FY2023) formulated in May 2021, we organized the relationships between our business activities and the SDGs, and will engage in promotion of the SDGs in accordance with our ESG initiatives. As a group, we will contribute to solving social issues.
ESG Initiative Direction
1. Kumagai Gumi identifies key issues (Materiality) to be resolved from the perspective of Environment, Social, and Governance, and pursues sustainable business activities.
2. Kumagai Gumi creates new value by leveraging the group's technologies, experience and expertise. We engage in business activities that contribute to the resolution of social issues represented by the SDGs.
3. Through its business activities, Kumagai Gumi aims to build relationships of trust with its stakeholders and to increase its corporate value.

Kumagai Gumi's ESG/SDGs strategy
Sakurano
Many of the fields of focus in the Medium-Term Management Plan have a deep connection to ESG and the SDGs. One of these is the renewal of social infrastructure in Civil Engineering. In Building Construction, the medium- to large-scale wooden construction that we are undertaking with Sumitomo Forestry will become a major pillar. In Overseas Projects, we plan to focus on improving urban infrastructure in Asian countries.
Sasaya
The three fields that you mention are the core businesses of the Kumagai Gumi. I think it's a very fortunate thing that engaging in these businesses connects directly to the SDGs.
Kumagai Gumi comprehensively organized the relationships between ESG and SDGs in a matrix format. This is effective in systematically making Kumagai Gumi's SDGs management visible to both ESG investors and stakeholders at large. It also lets employees really sense the themes
Taking personal responsibility for the SDGs
Sakurano
To help achieve the society that we envisioned in our long-term vision, we have to create more
diverse value than ever before. Toward that
end, I believe that partnering with companies in even more diverse fields
will become increasingly important.
Sasaya
Creating a mindset that leads to concrete action is also important. I think this will allow addressing the SDGs even more smoothly.
Sakurano
On that point, I think that we're starting to see changes in employees' mindsets in Kumagai
Online https://www.kumagaigumi.co.jp/ir/management/strategy/index.html (Japanese only)
they're tackling, and in a universal language. SDGs management can proceed through this.
Sasaya
Support for carbon neutrality is a necessity. Where does Kumagai Gumi stand on this?
Sakurano
 Fusing the perspectives of the SDGs with
our management, we will contribute to the
achievement of a sustainable society.
We invited Hidemitsu Sasaya, a professor at Chiba University of Commerce and a CSR/SDGs consultant. President Yasunori Sakurano and Mr. Sasaya discussed Kumagai Gumi's business and management from the perspective of the SDGs.
Considering the society we should seek, from a sustainable perspective
We've set a target of zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, have joined RE100 and JCLP, and have acquired SBT certification. These actions express our strong commitment to achieving a decarbonized society, both inside and outside the company.
Gumi. We operate an original social contribution activity platform that we call "the Kumagai Gumi Smile Project." Employees have recently begun voluntarily engaging in social contribution activities through this platform. The content of these activities have gone beyond the environment to cover fields including education, welfare and so on. The influence of the project has raised our feeling.
Sasaya
That's good to hear. Working to address social issues will make a broader network with all kind of people, including local communities, which leads to greater learning by employees themselves. If I were to make one suggestion, it would be to advance the mechanism a bit further so individuals can see which of the SDGs their activities equate to. That lets them feel some personal responsibility for the SDGs.

Sakurano
The Kumagai Gumi Group began its new Medium- Term Management Plan in 2021 and formulated a "long-term vision." This envisions the society we should strive for from 2030 onward, and our path for contributing to that society.
We made the decision to try envisioning society
from 2030 onward, in our own way.
Sasaya
So, the Kumagai Gumi Group went back to the starting point to consider the society it should aim for. I think that's admirable. As this is an era in which the future is hard to see, you now have to lift your gaze higher as transformation progresses.
Sakurano
For our long-term vision, we put together a project team focused on mid-career and young people, and conducted discussions. We adopted a backcasting method by which we envision an ideal future, then identify what we should do to achieve that.
Sasaya
That's also an apt way to proceed. What are the social issues of the future? How should you utilize the legacy that Kumagai Gumi has created to solve these issues? Does society need innovation? It's very important to identify these things in terms of both opportunities and risks.
Sakurano
Doing that lets us all rethink the significance of the
Kumagai Gumi Group's support for society.
Sasaya
Since the company's founding, Kumagai Gumi has no doubt engaged in business that helps solve social issues. If you compare your many projects so far with the 17 goals of the SDGs, many of your projects should naturally address those goals. Listening to you, I feel that the Kumagai Gumi Group is a corporate entity that holds extremely high potential with respect to the SDGs.

Summary of the previous Medium-Term Management Plan and review of FY2020
Medium-Term Management Plan
The stated fields of focus in the previous Medium- Term Management Plan were (1) major infrastructure renewal, (2) renewable energy, (3) disaster prevention and mitigation measures, and (4) utilization of civil engineering projects for forest conservation. We were able to achieve results in large-scale highway renewal construction, hydroelectric repowering, onshore wind power, Mega Solar power, and other areas. Drawing on these achievements, we aim to further evolve our
management capabilities and expand our scope of inclusion.
Despite changes in timing of additional renewal contracts due to the pandemic, orders in fiscal 2020 increased from the previous fiscal year to 100.1 billion yen. Sales were 121.4 billion yen, exceeding 120 billion yen as in the previous fiscal year and remaining at a high level.

 Overseas Projects
For each of our construction, development, and infrastructure maintenance and operation businesses, we will collaborate with partners such as Sumitomo Forestry and our Taiwanese subsidiary Taiwan Kumagai Co., Ltd., to engage in business aimed at sustainable growth, primarily in the Asian region.

During the period of the previous Medium-Term Management Plan, we developed construction business in Taiwan through Taiwan Kumagai Co., Ltd., advanced development projects with Sumitomo Forestry in Thailand and Indonesia, and strengthened our infrastructure maintenance and operation work in Hong Kong.

In fiscal 2020, stagnation occurred in activities and the progress of project due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the coup d'etat in Myanmar. Amid this, we carried out initiatives to create new business opportunities, including participation in the renewable energy business in Vietnam and the launch of a real estate business company in Taiwan.

Initiatives in FY2021
In the construction business, we will focus on urban infrastructure development in the Asian region and support for Japanese companies expanding overseas, and will work to develop construction bases overseas. In businesses peripheral to construction, we plan to make a full-scale entry into the renewable energy business in Vietnam and to
engage more aggressively in PPP/concessions businesses. We will further activate human resources and technological exchanges with Taiwan Kumagai, strengthen our construction and real estate development businesses in Taiwan, and utilize synergies with Taiwan Kumagai in
business development in Southeast Asia as well.

Construction-related Peripheral Businesses
In addition to the construction contracting business, businesses peripheral to construction, which we undertake as a business entity, greatly contribute to the sustainable growth of the Kumagai Gumi Group.
We will accelerate business through collaboration with Sumitomo Forestry and other companies to secure solid sources of revenue.

In the renewable energy business, we launched a solar power generation business in March 2020. In July of the same year, Iidate Bio Partners Company Limited, in which Kumagai Gumi is an investor, was selected as the implementing body of a woody biomass power generation project in the village of Iidate in Fukushima Prefecture. We have since moved forward with the project.

In the real estate development business, we engaged in active information collection from the market and from business partners to provide excellent real estate information linked to projects.
In the field of strategic partnerships with other companies, we are undertaking collaboration in the biomass fuel development and sales business, with plans to focus on commercialization in the future.

To achieve carbon neutrality and contribute to a sustainable society, we will contribute to the achievement of a decarbonized society through the realization of renewable energy focused on biomass power generation and wind power generation, and the biomass fuel development and sales business. We will continue our initiatives in the PFI business and strengthen our initiatives in the concession business and infrastructure management business to capture long-term profit opportunities.
We will also aggressively engage in the real estate development business and peripheral related businesses, including in-house development.

Feature The Challenge of the Cotter Floor Slab Method for Bridges
Expressways are key infrastructure that serve as the arteries of a society.
The aging of expressways has become an issue in recent years, with renewal work planned in many locations. Through advanced technology and outstanding Worksite Excellence, Kumagai Gumi contributes to solving such social issues.

   Addressing the social issue of aging expressways
Installation of a massive floor slab in about 15 minutes
From the construction of Tengu-bashi Bridge (heading toward Tokyo), the fourth bridge, in June 2021, we have completely introduced the Cotter floor slab method. The cotter joints, too, have evolved into a more compact and light form. Work was performed at night, due in part to coordination with other processes.
At the brightly lit work site, a huge cotter floor slab is suspended from a crane and is installed on the bridge girders under the direction of young engineers. The position and the height are adjusted to a high precision of scant millimeters. When installation is complete, the workers insert wedge pieces into the joints and fix them with bolts.
On-site Manager Machiya describes the work.
"We've become quite proficient in the work as we've made improvements on site. The time required to install one Cotter floor slab is about 15 minutes. At Tengu- bashi Bridge, we install five slabs at once, so the work will be completed in about 1 hour and 20 minutes."
Contributing to society and the environment with outstanding Technology Strength and Worksite Excellence
Machiya adds that there are many other merits of the Cotter Floor slab method that can be appreciated only at the worksite. The greatest of these is safety management.
In conventional construction methods, concrete is cast on-site. This involves many tasks that require skill, such as creating concrete placing form and inserting reinforcing steels. This created considerable tensions over safety management. With cotter floor slabs, however, this work is no longer needed. Moreover, the elimination of councrete placing form has enabled a major reduction of waste, contributing significantly to environmental aspects.
The total length of Japan's expressways is about 9,071 km (as of March 2021), with renewal projects planned for many locations. Kumagai Gumi is also undertaking development of new cotter floor slabs for urban expressways to meet such societal needs.
The Tohoku Expressway plays a vital role as the main transportation artery running through eastern Japan. Large-scale renewal projects are planned to address deterioration of the expressway. The renewal work being carried out between Hachimantai in Iwate Prefecture and Hirakawa in Aomori Prefecture, a stretch under the jurisdiction of the Towada Management Office of the Tohoku Branch Office of East Nippon Expressway Company Limited, is part of such a project. Kumagai Gumi is in charge of replacement work on five bridges in this project.
"This construction work will replace floor slabs laid on the bridge girders with highly durable precast PC floor slabs. In this project, Kumagai Gumi is undertaking full- scale adoption of revolutionary new technology,"
says On-site Manager Takahiro Machiya. The proprietary new technology that he speaks of is the Cotter Floor slab method for bridges.
This method roughly doubles the speed of construction and halves required construction staff compared with conventional methods, achieving a major increase in efficiency.
Traditional floor slabs have rebar joints at both ends; at the site, concrete must be cast on these portions, a task requiring considerable labor and skill.
On the other hand, Cotter floor
slabs use cotter joints developed
particularly for this connecting portion. This enables joining with a joint width of only about 2 cm, making on- site concrete casting unnecessary.
Precasting 99% of the floor slabs also improves the quality of the concrete. Its outstanding performance, including the capability for partial replacement, has won the Innovative Technique Award of the Japan Society of Civil Engineers.

Diverse Human Resources Fundamental concepts of human resources
We recognize that there are concerns over a declining workforce in the construction industry, and that securing human resources will become more difficult. Under these circumstances, Kumagai Gumi is actively undertaking the preparation of environments and systems that allow diverse human resources to perform their capabilities to the maximum. We are working to promote active participation by women, the employment of persons with disabilities, and reemployment after retirement to improve our employment environment and make it a foundation that supports management.
Related information P13 Number of employees Number of female managers About recruitment
Kumagai Gumi works to resolve the advancing age of employees and imbalances among generations, and engages in recruitment activities with an awareness of diversity.
Based on information including future business performance trends, we formulate recruitment plans that take into consideration employees' total number, job types, age distribution, and other factors 5 and 10 years ahead, and engage in hiring of new graduates and mid-career employees.
In fiscal 2019, we set up a job return system. We are creating an environment by which retired employees who meet certain conditions can join the company again, to make use of experience gained at other companies.
Workplaces where women can play active roles
From December 2015, we increased our hiring of women and formulated and enacted an action plan to improve the workplace environment, in line with the Act on Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace.
Status of employment of persons with disabilities
As a new initiative for the employment of persons with disabilities, we offered workplace training for students from special support education schools. We included site tours in the training so the students could gain familiarity with the construction industry. Accepting trainees in multiple departments also helped change the mindsets of employees.

Status of reemployment after retirement
We operate employment-related systems under the premise of employment until the statutory retirement age of 65, and contribute to the expansion of reemployment of retirees who wish to continue working. For Kumagai Gumi, the technical and sales capabilities of retirees constitute valuable assets that we hope to pass down to the next generation without interruption.
To energize employees and organizations alike, we are enhancing employee benefits to create comfortable work environments. As of April 2021, 353 retirees are working in the company.

Special 2 A new challenge in the region of our founding
Feature
Aiming to Achieve Medium- and large scale wooden construction38 The Kumagai Gumi Group Corporate Report 2021 39A hybrid structure with medium- to high-rise wood structures in mind
"When I heard about this project, I thought I definitely wanted to work on it. One reason was because it was the rebuilding of our traditional head office, and another was the wood structure,"
says Tetsuji Sabe, On-site Manager for the project. The most significant feature of the new main office building is its hybrid wood and steel frame structure. We are adopting Insulated Fire- Resistant λ-WOOD® (Lambda WOOD), a wooden fireproof structural member developed by our company, for the first time in columns and beams. We are also pursuing an urban wood structure capable of withstanding snow loading in winter through the use
of cross laminated timber (CLT) earthquake-resistant walls.
"We need to use a construction method suited to wood structures, which differ from the steel frame structures that we often handle. From this point onward, it was Kumagai Gumi's first experience with this." (Sabe)
The team carried out assembly of the wood structure in collaboration with Sumitomo Forestry engineers who have a wealth of experience with wood residential structures. This project, however, involved an office building. The beams have a long span, as much as eight meters. As structural members on this scale are not found in houses, it was a novel experience for the project members, who learned and cultivated knowledge on- site. Their experiences will be accumulated as Kumagai Gumi technology that will support the next generation.
 On-site Manager
Tetsuji Sabe
 Since our founding in 1898, Kumagai Gumi has maintained its Headquarters in Fukui, our place of origin. The construction of a new Headquarters building with a wood and steel frame hybrid structure is underway, and will mark the history of the new Kumagai Gumi.
Another key feature of the new head office building is that it is a Net Zero Energy Building (ZEB), a concept attracting attention as an initiative aimed at a decarbonized society. The aim of a ZEB is to reduce the balance of the building's annual primary energy consumption to zero. The head office building project achieves "Nearly ZEB." Ayana Fuchizaki of the Architectural Environment & Engineering Department, who took charge of these technologies, talks about this.
"The new head office faced a lot of restrictions in aiming for ZEB, including the Sea of Japan-type climate peculiar to the Hokuriku region, and the small building site. We brought together the technologies of Kumagai Gumi

Initiatives for wooden architecture projects
 The history of Kumagai Gumi began in 1898 when our founder Santaro Kumagai undertook construction of the Shikununo Power Station, the first power plant in Fukui Prefecture. Even after Headquarters functions
were moved to Tokyo in 1964, the head office remained in Fukui. As the main office has aged, we are now rebuilding it.

Technology Development System
Kumagai Gumi's Technical Research & Development Division, Civil Engineering Management Division, and Building Management Division collaborate on the development of technologies. We set out policies related to technology development, research topics in new business domains, and other matters through the Technology Development Management Subcommittee, and carry out development of technologies that directly connect to business.
Technology development under the Medium-Term Management Plan
The Kumagai Gumi Group's Medium-Term Management Plan sets out areas of focus related to technology development as follows, to strengthen our management foundation.
We believe that basic research aimed at a decarbonized society, technology development in renewable energy or other fields aimed at a sustainable society, and future- oriented initiatives in domains such as smart cities will lead to opening up new business domains for us. We will also engage in co-creation with other companies on production systems that use robotics, AI, and other technologies to contribute to innovation and the advancement of various functions in construction.
Patent-related measures
Our patent applications filed in fiscal 2020 were mainly related to materials, structures, and fire resistance in the field of wood, accounting for about 20% of our total number of applications. The number of patent applications related to caregiving assistance and movement assistance is also increasing, accounting for about 10% of our total number of applications.
In this area, to prepare for overseas expansion of the independent walking aid developed by Kumagai Gumi (refer P9), we are acquiring intellectual property rights

       Insulated Fire-Resistant λ-WOOD® (Lambda-WOOD) acquires Ministry certification for 1 to 3 hours fireproof performance
 Planning Group
Technical Research & Development InstituteNew Technology Innovation Center
  One challenge in achieving medium- to large- scale wooden construction is fire prevention and fire resistance performance. The Building Standards Act stipulates the fire resistance performance of major structural parts, varying with the number of floors of a fire-resistant building. Constructing a high-rise wood structure without constraints related to the number of floors requires a demonstrated fire resistance of 3 hours for columns and beams and 2 hours for floors and walls.
In evaluation tests of fire resistance, heating that simulates a fire is performed for 1 to 3 hours while a constant vertical load is applied, to confirm that the load-bearing member does not carbonize between the time that the heating is stopped and the time that the fire is extinguished naturally.
Developed by Kumagai Gumi, Insulated Fire- resistant λ-WOOD was certified in March 2021 by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for use in all fire-resistant structures as a wood fire-resistant structural member with 1 to 3 hours of resistance in laminated lumber
columns and beams and 1 to 2 hours in CLT floors and walls.
Insulated Fire-Resistant λ-WOOD layers a hard gypsum board and an insulating fire- resistant panel on the "fire-stopping layer" installed around the load-bearing structural member (pillar) to reduce the thickness of the member. This allows free selection of surface finishing material.
Insulated Fire-Resistant λ-WOOD (pillar) is being used in the construction of our new Fukui head office.

 Value creation initiatives
    
In the conduct of its business, the Kumagai Gumi Group prioritizes respect for human life and maintains high health and safety management standards to prevent labor accidents, improve health, and create comfortable working environments. We comply with social norms, laws, our internal standards, and other rules, and have established a Safety and Health Management System which we operate with high effectiveness.
Sharing of safety and health information and prevention of the recurrence of accidents and incidents
To enforce the sharing of safety and health information and prevention of the recurrence of accidents and incidents, we introduced the Safety Portal System in April 2021 and worked to accumulate and centralize data.
We will also create a database of the results of daily safety and health patrols, and will develop a system for drafting workplace Safety and Health Control Plans.
Safety education for employees
We established educational guidelines to improve the labor/occupational health and safety management capabilities of our employees, and conduct occupational health and safety education and systems education at Headquarters and branches. While we were unable to conduct our usual group education in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we refined and carried out online education and e-learning. The possibilities have expanded for new teaching methods that are effective and efficient.

Since receiving the first company-wide certification under the Construction Occupational Health and Safety Management System (COHSMS) program in 2008, Kumagai Gumi has maintained its system while renewing certification, and works to prevent labor and construction accidents.
Initiatives concerning foreign workers
Many foreign workers are active in the construction industry, and labor accidents involving these workers have increased accordingly. We have translated our Workers' Basic Education booklet into foreign languages to provide basic safety and health knowledge and are supporting education for business operators. We are aiming to create safe and secure workplace environments for foreign workers by means including creating foreign language versions of the materials for occupational health and safety education performed when entering work sites, to promote understanding of workplace rules.
Initiatives for safe work by elderly persons
We are strengthening initiatives to protect seniors, including placement of "thoughtfulness stickers" that encourage surrounding workers to warm to elderly persons, visualization of fall prevention measures, setting of age limits and permission systems for work that involves a risk of falls, and awareness education that encourages elderly persons to make use of their abundant experience while instilling self-awareness of physical weakening.
Through such efforts, in recent years we have reduced accidents involving elderly persons, which had been on the rise.

Kumagai Gumi believes that complying with social norms, laws, our internal standards, and other rules, establishing management systems and operating with high efficacy to respond to changes in the business environment, and working to improve the capabilities of employees, specialty constructors, and other parties through education and training, are important elements in quality assurance.
The Quality and Environment Committee, chaired by an Overall Quality and Environment Control Manager appointed by the President, and the Quality and Environmental Expert Subcommittees under it, examine quality issues and environmental issues. We regularly check the status of progress toward targets, conduct system audits, and constantly check and improve the effectiveness of our management systems.

With the integration of management and the environment, the formation of environmentally considerate businesses, the establishment of group-wide environmental management systems, and the strengthening of risk management against environmental accidents as our fundamental concepts of ESG Initiative Direction Safety and Health, Quality and Environment Policy Biodiversity Initiative Direction
Environmental target setting Annual plan
environmental management, the Kumagai Gumi Group engages in efforts to solve social and environmental issues and achieve a sustainable society through our business activities.

As an "Eco First" company, Kumagai Gumi has engaged since 2010 in initiatives aimed at the achievement of a sustainable society. In February 2021, we joined the RE100 initiative aimed at shifting all electricity used in business activities to renewable energy, and made a major change in our direction toward decarbonization.
Moreover, after reviewing and resetting our medium- to long-term targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in the same month we obtained certification for the Science Based Targets (SBT) international framework aimed at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
To achieve the targets, we will further accelerate decarbonization in our business activities through means including the promotion of Net Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) that contribute to significant energy conservation in buildings, while further reducing fossil fuel usage in heavy machinery and vehicles and actively adopting renewable energy.
Compliance with environmental conservation laws
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic in FY2020, we undertook the following initiatives to prevent violations of environmental laws and regulations, and strove to comply with environmental laws and regulations.
1. Education on environmental laws and regulations in intensive employee education at Headquarters, by the Headquarters manager in charge of environmental regulations (5 times)
2. Education for branch managers, etc. (2 times)
3. Implementation of e-learning concerning proper treatment of
construction waste
(Construction-related staff)
* In FY2020, no fines or penalties were levied due to
legal violations, and no suits were filed.
Environmental incidents
No environmental incidents occurred in FY2020.

We deliver "Quality that Inspires Happiness"
Kumagai Gumi established the Customer Satisfaction (CS) Promotion Office (current Sustainability Promotion Group) in 1998. The following year, we established Customer Consultation Offices at all of our branches.
The customer satisfaction (CS) functions of Kumagai Gumi are placed within the Management Strategy Office. The organization is designed to directly reflect the voices of customers in our management.
Primary CS activities of Kumagai Gumi
1) Customer insight questionnaires
Three years after delivering a structure to customers, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation questionnaire. In FY2020, we received 60 questionnaire responses (57 in FY2019).

2) Visit customer for asking their insight
Our top management makes visits not only to our regular patrons but also to customers with whom we have lost regular contact, to directly listen to their frank thoughts and incorporate these into our management. Restraining from visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY2020 we made only one visit (17 visits in FY2019).
3) Improvement of aftercare system
We perform centralized management of regular inspection, requests, inquiries, defect information, and other information using "construction clinical records," and share this information within the company.
4) Instillation of CS awareness in employees
We conduct internal commendations (2 commendations in FY2020) and lectures (in October 2020) on CS initiatives to instill Kumagai Gumi's CS awareness in our employees and achieve CS with the involvement of all.

 Stakeholder engagement
Engagement with Employees Promotion of work style reform
Respect for human rights
Employee education concerning human rights
We conduct training on human rights for new employees. We use this as an opportunity to deepen understanding of human rights through a broad range of topics, including social discrimination, discrimination toward LGBT persons and persons with disabilities, harassment in general, and human rights violations on the Internet.
Prevention of harassment
We conduct e-learning for all employees on the prevention of harassment.
About 80% of employees undergo the e-learning program, which covers (1) power harassment, (2) sexual harassment, (3) harassment related to pregnancy, childbirth, childcare leave, and nursing care leave, (4)
Health management
Kumagai Gumi has established a health promotion office staffed by general industrial physicians and health nurses in the Human Resources and General Affairs Department in Headquarters, and has readied systems for the comprehensive support of employees' health with the cooperation of industrial physicians and health promotion managers at all branches. Every fiscal year, we formulate an employee health promotion plan as part of our programs for mental and physical health promotion, and carry out health promotion activities that seek an upward spiral in PDCA activities.
With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide up-to-date information to the countermeasure task force and to employees as needed, and offer support including health checkup and interview recommendations for employees at particularly high risk of serious illness.

  Work Style Reform Action Plan
Summary (Plan period: 2018-2020)
Launching full-scale work style reform in 2018, Kumagai Gumi formulated the Work Style Reform Action Plan as an action plan with numerical targets.
In FY2020, employees taking five or more days of
Results of Work Style Reform Action Plan initiatives
annual paid leave increased from 62.9% in FY2018 to 100%, while the rate of male employees taking childcare leave increased from 4.9% in FY2018 to 34.3%. While work style reform has steadily taken root, the correction of overtime hours remains an issue that we continue to tackle.
dealing with harassment, and (5) a confirmation test. We also make prevention of harassment a mandatory item in managerial training.
Communication in personnel evaluations and execution of work
We conduct goal setting interviews at the beginning of the term, progress confirmation interviews at the mid- point of the term, self-evaluation confirmation interviews at the end of the term, and finally an interview on evaluation results, for a total of four interviews a year between employees and their superiors.
Employees are able to state their wishes regarding future workplace assignment and skill development to the Personnel Department in the form of a "Career Plan Declaration" via our in-house application system at any time, without going through superiors.
Organization Recognition Program ("White 500") of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a corporation that practices excellent health management. We intend to continue strengthening measures for the health of not only employees but all workers at Kumagai Gumi sites.
Initiatives for employees with higher risks
All employee health checkup results undergo careful checking by industrial physicians. For employees requiring follow-up, we provide continuous support along with recommendations for consultations and interviews. To prevent brain and cardiac disease and mental health disorders caused by overtime hours, we offer accumulated fatigue checklists for eligible employees and every month provide consultation with industrial physicians to persons who request it. In addition to this, we provide special follow-up through visits by industrial physicians, interviews with employees, and other measures to address workplaces in special environments, such as overseas or at disaster reconstruction sites.
Initiatives for mental health
In initiatives involving mental health, we carry out stress checks, employee training (self care and organizational care), and support for return to the workplace, among a wide range of activities that extend from primary to tertiary prevention.Three areas of reformNumerical targets and timing for their achievementInitiative resultsIndicatorsFY2018

Kumagai Gumi has endeavored to promote work style reform for improvement of productivity and operational efficiency, and to reform awareness. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY2020 we introduced telework and staggered work hours as emergency measures. We also introduced a telework system and a staggered commuting hours system as measures to prepare for emergencies and to achieve diverse work styles.
As part of our efforts to reform awareness, since FY2019 we have engaged in the Small Start Project to build up small reforms that will lead to individual motivation. As one such effort, in FY2021 we fully adopted office casual wear throughout the company and
connected this to comfortable working environments. We will continue reducing overtime work through means such as further reviewing business processes, during this important three-year period moving toward the imposition of overtime work limit regulations on the
construction industry in fiscal 2024.
Amid expectations for changes in working environments
and diversification of employees' senses of values, we will create environments and systems that enable flexible selection of work styles while meeting diversifying needs, and that draw out employees' willingness to contribute to the company.

Active dialogs with investors
Kumagai Gumi works to properly, fairly, and promptly disclose information pertaining to our management and business activities.
In engagements with securities analysts and institutional investors, we held earnings briefings (2 times in the fiscal year ending March 2021, both with top management in attendance), small meetings (5 times in the same period, all with top management in attendance), and individual meetings and teleconferences (61 times in the same period, including 4 with top management in attendance).
Amid the spread of the COVID-19 FY2020, in addition to small meetings using online tools and participation in overseas investor meetings hosted by securities firms, we conducted flexible and proactive IR activities in response to the demands of shareholders and investors, including the new initiative of holding financial briefings in a hybrid online and venue-based format. The "Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic" content in our securities report for the fiscal year ended March 2020 was received positively by shareholders and investors, and was included in a collection of best-practice cases of written information disclosure released by the Financial Services Agency in 2020.
Amid growing interest in ESG investment in recent years, the Kumagai Gumi Group works to enhance ESG- related content in its various tools, and, recognizing the importance of non-financial information, holds ESG- specific meetings with institutional investors.

Kumagai Gumi has formulated purchasing management rules with the objectives of risk management, ensuring transparency in the selection of business partners, and consideration of the environment. In April 2021, we formulated our Procurement Policy and Procurement Policy Guidelines to further promote sound business activities. Our aim is to improve governance and compliance in our procurement activities, and to work with partner companies and business partners to increase added
value throughout the value chain.

In September 2020, Kumagai Gumi announced its Declaration of Partnership Building.
In our supply chain, we consider not only materials and equipment but also human resources, particularly in the partner companies who work with us on-site to complete construction, to be of extreme importance. In that sense, our partner companies are our most important partners in our supply chain. Seeking cooperation, coexistence, and co-prosperity with partner companies, we will work with partners to secure skilled workers and support their development, not only complying with the normalization of transactions but also promoting improvement in the treatment of skilled workers based on the Declaration of Abiding by Labor Cost Quotations advocated by the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors.

The Yuuei Kyoryoku Kai is an organization of 859 Kumagai Gumi partner companies (as of April 1, 2021). It engages in activities under a policy of Kumagai Gumi and Yuuei Kyoryoku Kai working together as close partners to take action in all areas of QCDSE and to promote the creation of positive workplace environments.
Activities in FY2020
Under the COVID-19 pandemic, Yuuei Kyoryoku Kai continued taking contagion prevention into consideration in its activities, through new initiatives such as conducting branch hearings remotely.
The association conducted a questionnaire study aimed at securing and training leaders, an urgent issue within the construction industry, and undertook measures to improve the working environment of skilled construction workers. It also created a "Workers' Basic Education, Pocket Edition" and safety posters in Japanese, English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Indonesian, as part of its consideration for positive working conditions and safety for foreigners in the workplace.
FY2021 activities
The association held best-practice presentations on the themes of quality assurance and productivity improvement. It plans to evolve and revitalize these into presentations that are more focused than ever on best practices on-site and in branch activities.

In May 2019, Kumagai Gumi launched the Kumagai Gumi Smile Project as a means of engaging in unique social contribution activities.
The project uses matching gifts that connect individual employees' initiatives to even greater social contribution. We total the number of employees who have participated in social contribution activities in the regions of our workplaces and departments, and make donations of social contribution expenses based on that number for each fiscal year.
In FY2020, 812 employees engaged in 86 instances of activities in areas including the environment, education, welfare, and community contribution. In FY2021, the company donated 11 million yen in social contribution expenses. The donations were applied to
areas including our KUMAGAI STAR PROJECT social contribution activities and disaster relief funds, as well as support for four organizations working on social issues.
Continuing from FY2020, we will continue supporting the following organizations in FY2021.
● JUON NETWORK (Activities that relate cities and countryside and give consideration to nature)
● Kosodate Hiroba Zenkoku Renraku Kyogikai (Activities to support Childcare in the community)
● Japan Cancer Society (Support for cancer patients, awareness of cancer diseases)
● Zenkoku Kodomo Shokudo Shien Center Musubie (Local network bases that serve meals)

Launched in 2015, this KUMAGAI STAR PROJECT engages in school building construction as a contribution to international society in countries in which Kumagai Gumi has business sites.
So far, we have constructed three elementary and junior high school buildings in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.
As a new initiative, we have begun offering "KUMA- STAR" scholarships to 10 students from the third school. We established a "watch-over employee system" for interaction with students through letters and other means until graduation from junior high school. This is expanding into an activity involving many employees.
The activity has been praised by outsiders, and was introduced in online teaching materials for elementary and junior high school students in Japan, as well as among high-quality infrastructure project best practices collected by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism

Corporate Governance Fundamental concepts and system
In order to make our Management Philosophy of "We aim to serve as a corporate group that contributes to society through business activities centered on construction" a reality, we consider enhancement of the efficacy of our corporate governance a priority issue.
Corporate governance system
Drawing on the aims of the Corporate Governance Code, Kumagai Gumi has adopted a corporate governance structure that comprises a Board of Directors, a Board of Corporate Auditors, and an independent accounting auditor to enhance the effectiveness of our corporate governance.
To achieve clarity in management responsibilities and to build an optimal management system in response to changes in the business environment, the term of office of Directors is set to one year. We also appoint three Outside Directors who provide counsel to management from an objective standpoint.
The nomination of Directors and Executive Officers and amounts of compensation are determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of reports by the Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee, composed of the President and Representative Director and Outside Directors, to ensure objectivity and transparency.
With regard to Audit & Supervisory Board Members, we appoint Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors
  from among persons who have appropriate experience and capabilities and who have knowledge of finances, accounting, and legal matters, in order to conduct audits with high efficacy.
Regarding accounting audits under the Companies Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, we undergo impartial audits by GYOSEI & CO.
Meeting the Corporate Governance Code
Details are noted in the Corporate Governance Report, which is available at our website or the Tokyo Stock Exchange website.
Corporate Governance System
Once a year, Kumagai Gumi Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members take part in an anonymous questionnaire survey evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. We verify the results of the survey and consider improvements. From the FY2018 evaluation onward, we are conducting reviews of our evaluation item settings and evaluation results through external experts.
In FY2020, based on issues for improvement from the previous fiscal year, we worked to energize deliberation in the Board of Directors through review of the number and ratio of Outside Directors, revision of some
Directors’ compensation and selection of Outside Executives List of the Board of Directors
standards for Board of Directors agendas, measures for strengthening compliance and group governance, exchanges of opinions following proceedings, and other means. Based on subsequent results of self-evaluation and reviews by external experts, we confirmed that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole is secured. We also shared issues for consideration, including 1) further promotion of delegation of authority through revisions to standards for agendas, 2) promotion of medium- to long-term discussions concerning management, and 3) further strengthening of compliance and group governance.

General Meeting of Shareholders
Compensation for Directors is based on a system of compensation linked to shareholder interests, functioning appropriately as an incentive to continuously improve corporate value. When determining individual compensation, our basic policy is to set an appropriate level based on the responsibility of the individuals, and, within the limit of the total amount of compensation for Directors decided at General Meetings of Shareholders, determine amounts through the Board of Directors based on findings reported by the Nomination & Compensation Advisory Committee.
Specific compensation for Directors consists of monetary compensation (fixed compensation and bonuses) and stock compensation. For Outside Directors who bear supervisory functions, it consists of only monetary compensation (of fixed compensation, an amount of compensation according to position). The fixed compensation is monthly monetary compensation, and consists of compensation according to position and compensation according to contribution to business performance.

Fundamental concepts of compliance
In order for Kumagai Gumi to continue earning the appreciation and trust of customers and society, we believe that all of our officers and employees must take responsibility for their daily actions, comply with laws, social sensibilities, and corporate ethics, and maintain an awareness of compliance.
Compliance system
Kumagai Gumi's compliance system consists primarily of three internal functions: Autonomous functions by Headquarters and branch offices, support functions by the Administration Division and other specialized divisions, and auditing functions by the Audit Office (refer to figure below).
In addition, the Legal Compliance Audit Committee, an organization independent of management, periodically carries out evaluations of the company from an outsider's point of view and advises management of any problems uncovered, in order to strengthen the enforcement of compliance.
Legal Compliance Audit Committee
The Legal Compliance Audit Committee is composed of internal company committee members as well as outside committee members who include attorneys and other experts. It convenes every year.
Compliance training and compliance reinforcement month
To improve basic understanding of compliance, from October 2020 through February 2021 our company conducted an internal training program on topics including antitrust law, bribery, and corruption, targeting employees of Kumagai Gumi as well as group companies, from a perspective of strengthening the group's compliance structure.
In addition, we have designated October of every year as a compliance reinforcement month.
Internal whistleblower system
The Kumagai Gumi Group has set up a hotline for quickly assessing, correcting, and preventing problems involving compliance. We are working to root out compliance violations by accepting a wide range of whistleblower reports, including from our employees, group company employees, and partner businesses. We have also introduced an in-house leniency program (measures reducing penalties for whistleblowers) to encourage use of the voluntary whistleblower system.
Internal whistleblower system
Means of whistleblowing

System for prevention of collusion and prevention of bribery, etc.
Kumagai Gumi's Compliance Rules of Conduct stipulate that, in the receipt of orders for construction work, acts that violate criminal law, antitrust law, or other law, or that impair fairness and impartiality in bidding, are prohibited. Through means including training and the collection of pledges, we ensure that employees are not involved in violations, and have built a structure to prevent the occurrence of violations through an internal reporting system.
Prevention of insider trading
The Kumagai Gumi Group complies with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and related laws and regulations, and has established Internal Regulations on the Prevention of Insider Trading to enhance the effectiveness of compliance. Based on these regulations, we have established an Insider Information Management Committee to perform information management across the company.
Setting of Tax Policy
In March 2020, the Kumagai Gumi Group clarified its existing initiative direction concerning tax affairs to create the Kumagai Gumi Group Tax Policy, with the aim of further improving corporate governance and compliance regarding tax affairs and fostering proper awareness of taxation payment matters among executives and staff members.
Status of legal suits and violations of laws
As of the end of March 2021, our company is involved in five civil cases in Japan.
In FY2020, no serious legal violations (including administrative sanctions, administrative measures, etc.) occurred that involved measures such as suspension of designated bidding at a national level.
Information security
Kumagai Gumi established its Information Security Policy in 2007, and takes concrete measures to protect
information assets from unauthorized access, leakage, falsification, loss, disaster, and other threats. We have also appointed an Information Security Officer and established an Information Security Committee.
Protection of Private Information
Kumagai Gumi has established fundamental rules and regulations, such as the Basic Principle, the Privacy Policy, and the Private Information Protection Regulations, and engages in initiatives to properly handle and protect the private information of all
stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.
Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
In the event of a major disaster, Kumagai Gumi will make every effort to achieve rapid recovery of sites under construction and the restoration of infrastructure, and to respond to requests for restoration aid from customers and local residents. We have formulated a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) as a basic policy for contributing to prevention of secondary accidents, restoration of urban functions, safety of local residents, and recovery of the private economy.
Operation of the Safety Confirmation Communication System
In preparing support systems based on business continuity plans, confirmation of the safety of employees is the most important matter. We operate a system that allows confirmation of safety status, extending even to group companies and partner companies, and the Kumagai Gumi Group has established systems to support quick recovery.
Measures to the COVID-19 pandemic
Kumagai Gumi has set up a COVID-19 task force headed by the President, to carry out swift decision-making and execution of measures. From the perspective of ensuring the health and safety of employees, their families, and people in cooperating companies, we provide employees with guidelines for dealing with COVID-19 pandemic (infection countermeasures, restrictions on activities, business continuity, etc.). In accordance with the state of the pandemic and government policy, we are continuing with business through the promotion of telework and staggered commuting, guidance for partner companies, and contagion control measures.

Interview with an Outside Director
 Yasunori Sakurano President
 We hold active discussions from varied perspectives at Board of Directors meetings. Our aim is to further enhance corporate governance.
Kumagai Gumi appoints Outside Directors to bring diverse perspectives into management and to enhance its corporate governance. President Yasunori Sakurano spoke with Sakae Yoshida, who took the position of Outside Director in June 2020.
 Outside Director Sakae Yoshida
 Surprised by progress in active participation by women
Sakurano A year has passed since you became an Outside Director. What impressions do you have of Kumagai Gumi?
Yoshida The atmosphere inside the company seems positive, flat and lively. I was a little surprised, as the company has a history of 120 years, and before taking the position I had an image of it as stolid.
In particular, I was impressed by how far active participation by women has progressed, beyond what I'd imagined. Women are demonstrating capabilities not only in office managerial positions but also in sales and in the field.
Sakurano The company experienced stagnation for some time, but in recent years has begun to grow again. In line with this, we're undertaking various activities with the aim of "management with participation of all." Efforts to promote active participation by women have taken root in recent years, and it seems to me that the atmosphere within the company is changing.
Incidentally, what's your impression of the Board of Directors?
Yoshida I think the Board of Directors is also functioning well in terms of diversity. The Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members have diverse careers and experience, and I'm often inspired by the discussions.
However, it also seems to me that discussions by the entire Board of Directors could go even further.
Engaging in active discussions through competing opinions from diverse perspectives
Sakurano In what sort of way?
Yoshida I think this is common among Japanese
companies, but discussions in Board of Directors meetings tend to be one-way, with Directors involved
in business execution responding to questions from Outside Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members.
I think we should take it forward a step from there. Isn't it ideal to instead draw conclusions through vigorous debates that transcend participants' respective positions? That's another reason why the role of Outside Directors is very important. For my part, I try to stir things up with statements that trigger discussion.
Sakurano I think that discussions in Board of Directors meetings have been invigorated with the addition of Outside Directors, but I think we're still halfway along that path, as you note.
You were originally a chemical engineer, and you have a wealth of experience in production and engineering departments. You also have experience overseas. It's my hope that you can leverage that manufacturing experience in this different field of construction.
Yoshida In the engineering department of a chemical manufacturer, I was also in a position to order construction work, such as for production equipment. In short, my standpoint differed 180 degrees from that of a construction company. I want to make use of that experience too.
Social contribution activities that reveal "self- powered" employees
Sakurano In addition to the active participation by women that you mentioned, are there other things that you've felt about Kumagai Gumi?
Yoshida I feel that employees have very high awareness of diversity and environmental issues. Perhaps it's a matter of being "self-powered," but it's my impression that employees work proactively on their own, without having to be pushed by the company. The company also implements a unique structure that uses matching gifts, with employees taking active part in social contribution activities.
You mean the Kumagai Gumi Smile Project.
Right. The company supported the Kosodate Hiroba Zenkoku Renraku Kyogikai (Activities to support Childcare in the community) as a project under this, and I took part in the activities with employees.
Creating structures for the enforcement of compliance
Sakurano Compliance is another very important topic for Kumagai Gumi in earning the trust of society. What are your thoughts on those efforts?
Yoshida It's my feeling that we're solidly tackling compliance, including the enforcement of legal compliance. At the same time, I think there are some concerns.
Activities such as compliance training are carried out extremely thoroughly. Looking ahead, I think we need structures to monitor the effects of these. The thing about corporate compliance is that even if 99 people get it, negligence by just 1 person can lead to serious problems. Building up solid mechanisms is important.
The backbone of the company must not be shaken
Sakurano As a final topic, tell me your thoughts on the new Medium-Term Management Plan.
Yoshida I think it's important that we make a clear distinction between our commitments to investors and other stakeholders, and the targets that indicate the direction that the company should take. If these are confused and are not accompanied by results, we may not be able to earn the trust of society, and employee motivation may not be enhanced.
Sakurano Thank you very much. We will continue making use of the opinions of Outside Directors and other stakeholders to enhance our corporate governance.

During the consolidated fiscal year, the Japanese economy showed some signs of increase in capital investment, production, and exports, despite no move toward subsidence of the COVID-19 pandemic that spread globally from the beginning of 2020. Private consumption struggled under repeated requests to the public to remain at home; corporate profits also fell sharply, particularly in industries related to private consumption, and GDP declined for the first time since the period of the Lehman Brothers collapse.
Intheconstructionindustry,corporateconstructioninvestment was restrained, particularly in the manufacturing industry. Housing investment was weak but remained flat overall, while public investment remained firm under the execution of relevant budgets. Accordingly, a firm business environment continued overall.

Non-operating expenses increased by 100.0 million yen from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 500.0 million yen, due to an increase in syndicated loan fees and other factors.

Income taxes, etc. The company recorded adjusted income taxes of 1.5 billion yen due to income taxes, residential taxes, and business taxes of 6.6 billion yen, and adjustments in income taxes, etc. due to a decrease in deductible temporary differences.

62 of extraordinary losses.
* Numbers are rounded down to the nearest 100 million yen.
Management performance by segment

Although the amount of construction brought forward at the beginning of the term was significantly lower than at the beginning of the previous consolidated fiscal year, sales declined only 0.6% to 121.4 billion yen due to an increase in construction volume at the end of the period.
Operating income increased 1.2% from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 7.7 billion yen due to factors including significant cost reductions in completed delivery work and the acquisition of additional design changes. Building Construction Although orders received increased in the housing sector, orders declined in the warehouse and logistics facility sector, rebounding from the several orders for large projects received in the previous consolidated fiscal year. In addition, some orders for large projects scheduled for the end of the fiscal year were carried over to the following fiscal year. Accordingly, orders received decreased by 21.2% to 183.2 billion yen.
Although the amount of construction brought forward at the beginning of the term was at the same level as in the previous consolidated fiscal year, sales increased 3.8% from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 238.7 billion yen due to steadily increasing sales of large-scale construction work.
Operating income increased 16.7% from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 14.7 billion yen due to factors including significant cost reductions in completed delivery work and the acquisition of additional design changes. Subsidiary Sales increased by 7.2% from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 105.7 billion yen due to an increase in the amount of construction carried forward at the beginning of the term at GAEART Co., Ltd. and Taiwan Kumagai Co., Ltd.
Operating income increased 8.0% from the previous consolidated fiscal year to 5.5 billion yen due to an increase in gross profit associated with an increase in sales, as well as improved profitability primarily due to a decline in crude oil prices at GAEART Co., Ltd.

Current assets increased by 1.1 billion yen (0.4%) from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year to 311.7 billion yen. Although cash deposits decreased by 3.8 billion yen due to factors including advance expenditures for large-scale construction and the relaxation of payment terms to vendors, notes receivable and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts increased by 6.5 billion yen due to an increase in sales.
Fixed assets increased by 3.6 billion yen (5.7%) from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year to 67.8 billion yen. Investment securities increased by 6.8 billion yen due to reasons including an increase in the market value of shares held.
Liabilities (-4.9% year on year) Liabilities decreased by 11.0 billion yen (4.9%) from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year to 215.7 billion yen.
Status of cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities Cash flow from operating activities was positive 6.5 billion yen (positive 300 million yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year) due to factors including the recording of 26.0 billion yen in profit before income taxes.
Cash flow from investing activities Cash flow from investing activities was negative 4.3 billion yen (negative 2.2 billion yen in the previous consolidated fiscal year), due to factors including the acquisition and renewal of equipment and the acquisition of shares of affiliated companies.

Cash and cash equivalents The balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the consolidated fiscal year, including increases due to currency conversion, decreased by 3.8 billion yen (5.1%) from the end of the previous consolidated fiscal year to 71.3 billion yen.
Return to Shareholders
Our basic policy for distribution of profits is to fairly and stably return profits to shareholders, taking into account factors including our current business performance, our medium- to long-term business outlook, and the business environment, while striving to enhance internal reserves for the purpose of enhancing our management foundation and expanding business income.
At the end of the 84th term, we paid a dividend of 120 yen per share. Looking ahead, we will further weigh the return of profits to shareholders, and will continue returning profits with the goal of a 30% payout ratio. Regarding the acquisition and retirement of treasury stock, our policy is to carefully consider these actions with capital efficiency and cash flow conditions taken into consideration.

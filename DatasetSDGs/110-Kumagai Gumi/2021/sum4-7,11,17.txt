Construction-related Peripheral Businesses
In addition to the construction contracting business, businesses peripheral to construction, which we undertake as a business entity, greatly contribute to the sustainable growth of the Kumagai Gumi Group.
We will accelerate business through collaboration with Sumitomo Forestry and other companies to secure solid sources of revenue.

In the renewable energy business, we launched a solar power generation business in March 2020. In July of the same year, Iidate Bio Partners Company Limited, in which Kumagai Gumi is an investor, was selected as the implementing body of a woody biomass power generation project in the village of Iidate in Fukushima Prefecture. We have since moved forward with the project.

In the real estate development business, we engaged in active information collection from the market and from business partners to provide excellent real estate information linked to projects.
In the field of strategic partnerships with other companies, we are undertaking collaboration in the biomass fuel development and sales business, with plans to focus on commercialization in the future.

To achieve carbon neutrality and contribute to a sustainable society, we will contribute to the achievement of a decarbonized society through the realization of renewable energy focused on biomass power generation and wind power generation, and the biomass fuel development and sales business. We will continue our initiatives in the PFI business and strengthen our initiatives in the concession business and infrastructure management business to capture long-term profit opportunities.
We will also aggressively engage in the real estate development business and peripheral related businesses, including in-house development.

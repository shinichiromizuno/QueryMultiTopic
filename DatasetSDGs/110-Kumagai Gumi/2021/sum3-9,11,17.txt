 Overseas Projects
For each of our construction, development, and infrastructure maintenance and operation businesses, we will collaborate with partners such as Sumitomo Forestry and our Taiwanese subsidiary Taiwan Kumagai Co., Ltd., to engage in business aimed at sustainable growth, primarily in the Asian region.

During the period of the previous Medium-Term Management Plan, we developed construction business in Taiwan through Taiwan Kumagai Co., Ltd., advanced development projects with Sumitomo Forestry in Thailand and Indonesia, and strengthened our infrastructure maintenance and operation work in Hong Kong.

In fiscal 2020, stagnation occurred in activities and the progress of project due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the coup d'etat in Myanmar. Amid this, we carried out initiatives to create new business opportunities, including participation in the renewable energy business in Vietnam and the launch of a real estate business company in Taiwan.

Initiatives in FY2021
In the construction business, we will focus on urban infrastructure development in the Asian region and support for Japanese companies expanding overseas, and will work to develop construction bases overseas. In businesses peripheral to construction, we plan to make a full-scale entry into the renewable energy business in Vietnam and to
engage more aggressively in PPP/concessions businesses. We will further activate human resources and technological exchanges with Taiwan Kumagai, strengthen our construction and real estate development businesses in Taiwan, and utilize synergies with Taiwan Kumagai in
business development in Southeast Asia as well.

 The Daiichi Sankyo Group recognizes compliance is fundamental for the sustainable growth of a company. In addition to adhering to applicable laws, regulations etc., the Group conducts compliance management that acts with the high ethical standards and social norms for a healthcare company.
Contribution to SDGsReason for selectionSince pharmaceutical companies handle products that affect human lives, we are asked to meet the high ethical standards. Compliance issues may damage corporate reputation. On the other hand, activities inherent to the pharmaceutical industry and the various stakeholders involved can result in latent risks that improper conduct may occur. Due to recent well-publicized incidents within the industry regulations continue to be strengthened.
Across the Daiichi Sankyo Group companies, we believe compliance is the foundation of our business activities. Therefore, we promote a compliance management system which encourages each employee to behave with the high ethical standards, in addition to complying with applicable laws and regulations.
For our mid-term target, the Daiichi Sankyo Group will maintain the high ethical standards throughout the Group and mitigate compliance risks by further enhancing its global governance structure and compliance programs.Long-term targetAn organization in which every employee behaves with high ethical standards as well as in compliance with applicable laws and regulationsChallenges for realizing materiality (toward FY2025 targets)To raise awareness for compliance among all executives and employees

                                 To Raise Awareness for Compliance
In recent years, global companies are expected to establish broad-ranging global policies regarding the requirements for the behavior of individuals across their respective organizations. Moreover, global policies are required to be adhered to and disclosed appropriately outside of a company to show that its global business activities are being conducted with integrity. In April 2015, we established a global policy on the individual behavior of all executives and employees. Replacing the Daiichi Sankyo Group Individual Conduct Principles, we established the Daiichi Sankyo Group Employee Code of Conduct (“ECC”) to provide broader, uniform standards of individual behavior expected of executives and employees of all Daiichi Sankyo Group companies in April 2020.
We are also conducting training programs regularly to increase awareness of the ECC. In FY2020, we conducted its training using unified materials for the Daiichi Sankyo Group, not only to raise awareness of the ECC, but also to foster
Promoting Sustainable Procurement Activities
To realize a sustainable society, the Daiichi Sankyo Group believes that it is essential to work together with its business partners to promote sustainable procurement based on
a mutual understanding. As part of these efforts, the Group conducts a CSR Self-Assessment Survey every three years based on the Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCC)* in cooperation with its major business partners, in order to deepen their understanding of BPCC and strengthen communication with them. We are conducting the second survey (FY2020 to FY2022), having sent the questionnaires to 403 major business partners in Japan and overseas in FY2020, and 340 companies (84%) have already responded as of March 31, 2021.
CSR Self-Assessment Surveys
a sense of harmonization across the Group companies. We will continue to provide training regularly to raise individual compliance awareness among executives and employees, which will help to reduce compliance risks.
In light of the survey results, we will promote and strengthen sustainable procurement based on mutual understanding through continuing communication with our business partners.
Additionally, the Group is working on building a system to objectively evaluate and continually monitor potential risks of our business partners by using an external data source, which further enhances our compliance system with respect to our business partners.
*This Code of Conduct stipulates compliance rules in such fields as ethics, human rights, safety and health, and environmental management with which the Group urges its business partners in Japan and overseas to comply.

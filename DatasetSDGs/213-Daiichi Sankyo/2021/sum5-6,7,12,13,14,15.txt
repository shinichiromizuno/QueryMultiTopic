 As a healthcare company with the purpose, “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world,” the Daiichi Sankyo Group sees global environmental conservation, which is the basis of life and livelihood, as a key management issue.
Contribution to SDGs
        Reason for selection
The impact of environmental issues on sustainability, such as the intensifying natural disasters associated with the progression of global warming and marine plastics pollution, has become apparent. Environmental protection is a challenge that requires the concerted efforts of the world, including companies.
We recognize that changes in the disease structure and concerns about the stable supply of medicines are risk factors for our long-term business due to environmental impacts. We, as a responsible member of society, will work integrally in our business activities and environmental initiatives for a sustainable society, reducing the environmental impact of our products and operations.
      Long-term target
As a healthcare company, we will proactively reduce the environmental impacts of our business operations and seek to implement advanced climate change countermeasures.
      Challenges for realizing materiality (toward FY2025 targets)
Reduction of the environmental impact of the entire supply chain
Proactive introduction and use of renewable energy
Use and implementation of decarbonization technologies, such as hydrogen application
Expansion of the scope of use for plastics removal, and technological development Minimization of environmental risks such as pollution risks

    Economic value creation
Enhance of corporate value by improving evaluation of environmental management initiatives (reduction/avoidance of the damage risk to corporate value)
  *Scope1: Direct emissions from the reporting company’s factories, offices, vehicles, Combustion of fuels etc.
Scope2: Indirect energy-derived emissions from electric power and other energy consumed by the reporting company
Scope3: Indirect emissions other than Scope1 and Scope2. Category 1 is emissions from activities up to manufacturing of raw materials, parts and containers / packaging materialsMajor Initiatives
Conducting a scenario analysis in accordance with the Recommendations of the TCFD and incorporating the results into Environmental Management Targets (FY2021–FY2025)
Joining RE100*, an international initiative
Installing a solar power system (Onahama Plant and Pfaffenhofen Plant) Addressing water-related disaster risk (Japan)
Addressing water withdrawal risk (China and Brazil)
Utilizing renewable energy (globally)
* RE100 is a global initiative promoting 100% corporate renewable energy, operated by the Climate Group, an international environmental NGO, and CDP that urges companies to disclose their climate change measures.
Pfaffenhofen Plant in Germany has installed a self-consumption solar power system and has started to use renewable energy. The estimated annual energy production of 580 MWh, which accounts for approximately 8% of the Plant’s total power consumption, will contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by 350 tons. Activation of the system is expected to reduce energy cost by ¥12 million per year.

                                 Contributing to the Realization of a Sustainable Society as a Healthcare Company
Environmental issues such as intensifying weather-related disasters associated with progressing global warming, depletion of natural resources, air/water pollution, and marine plastic pollution are now threats to the sustainable development of society as well as people’s health.
We conduct business activities to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life through providing pharmaceutical products. We know, however, that those activities could cause environmental impact that might raise environmental issues.
Aiming to create a society where people lead healthy and safe lives
Whole value chain Research and Pharmaceutical development technology
What underlies our promotion of environmental management is the following belief: activities necessary to provide pharmaceutical products must not unnecessarily contribute to in environmental phenomenon that may threaten people’s health and daily lives.
In the current 5-year business plan, we will contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by proactively implementing various initiatives to reduce environmental impact from R&D to sales all across the value chain.

Reducing Environmental Impact and Implementing Advanced Measures for Climate Change
In the current 5-year business plan, we defined three future visions as 2050 long-term targets towards the realization of sustainable society: “Carbon neutrality” toward a decarbonized society, “100% recycling rate” toward a circular economy, and “Minimization of environmental risk” to fulfill our duties for a society co-existing with nature. These long-term targets are shared at each site of our 50 Group companies in 24 countries across the world.
Specifically, we have been working on carbon neutrality through saving energy and reducing carbon emissions in our
FY2025 Targets toward Carbon Neutrality
business activities, while setting early a CO2 reduction target according to SBTi* toward the accomplishment of the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement. To accelerate the realization of carbon neutrality by 2050, we will proactively utilize installable carbon-neutral technology, on top of buying renewable electricity, installing a large-scale solar power system using plant premises, and upgrading the facilities to high-efficiency facilities, among others.
* Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): An international initiative that encourages companies to set CO2 reduction targets based on scientific evidence in order to help accomplish the goal of the Paris Agreement of keeping the average increase in global temperature below 2°C.

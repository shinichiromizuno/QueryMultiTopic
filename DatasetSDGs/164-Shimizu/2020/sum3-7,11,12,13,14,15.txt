As global warming, deforestation and environmental pollution become more serious, we must increase efforts to leave behind an bountiful earth for the next generation. Shimizu will contrib- ute to the realization of an environmentally friendly, sustainable society through corporate activities aimed at reducing the bur- den on the environment.
Targeting ZEB with the Latest
in Energy Conservation and
Energy Generation
Shimizu has led the industry in working to create ZEB (zero energy building) thus far. We acquired the first carbon neutral* status in Japan in our headquarters building, which was completed in 2012, and completed Seicho-no-Ie’s Office in the Forest in 2013, Japan’s first ZEB. We are also building new office buildings for our Tohoku Branch and Hokuriku Branch using new energy conservation and energy generation technologies. Shimizu will build the region’s first ZEB. for Hokuriku Branch using natural energy from the local cli- mate and a hydrogen energy usage system. We aim to contribute to a broad range of SDGs, including SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy, and SDG 13, Climate Action.

With rapid changes such as aging, population decline and urban- ization, the future requires a society where everyone can live safely and comfortably. Shimizu is contributing to the creation of inclusive communities where everyone can live in health and comfort by building user-friendly facilities and communities.
Creating Communities
Where All Can Live
Comfortably
Shimizu will build Toyosu MiCHi no Eki, Japan’s first “urban road station” in the Toyosu 6-chome, Blocks 4-2 and 4-3 Project (tentative name) in Koto-ku Tokyo, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2021. In addition to providing open space for shoppers to relax and interact, it will also be equipped with a smartphone-compatible voice navigation system to eas- ily guide visitors, including wheelchair users and visually impaired peo- ple, to their destinations by the appropriate route. Urban digital twins will be built to link physical (real) space to cyber (virtual) space. The goal is to create a community that is comfortable and provides a high quality of life full of vitality. We think this will not only contribute to the achievement of SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities; it will also contribute to achieving SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being, SDG 8, Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 10, Reduced Inequalities.

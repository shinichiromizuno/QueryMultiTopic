Ecological Mission 2030-2050
As the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) formulated by the United Nations in 2015 are drawing interest, Shimizu is working on the activities outlined in our Ecological Mission 2030-2050, which is aimed at achieving Goal 13 (Climate Action). We think that reducing the CO2 emissions from our own business through construction and office activities (Scope 1/2) and reducing the CO2 emissions from customers through the operation of buildings we have designed and built (Scope 3) are especially important, and we have established KPI for reduction activities and are working toward them.

Medium & Long-term Goals
We convened a construction working group and began activities aimed at achieving our goals for reducing CO2 emissions from construction sites.
About 70% of CO2 emissions from construction sites is said to come from the combustion of diesel fuel in heavy equipment used in construction. The working group interviewed construction equip- ment manufacturers and others to compare the fuel costs for the old equipment to the new types equipment that meet the latest standards and confirm the pace at which Shimizu should switch to the latest equipment. We will reference this information in future CO2 reduction activities.

CDP Climate Change Performance Scoring
In fiscal 2016, Shimizu scored a B ranking in the CDP Japan Report (after achieving an A ranking for four consecutive years up to fiscal 2015). However, we reclaimed our spot on the A list in fiscal 2017.
We will continue to pursue activities aimed at

Shimizu introduced a cloud management system for data on energy use to accurately determine CO2 emissions and manage the energy used at Shimizu’s offices (head office, branches, business locations, investment properties, etc.) and manage it in an integrated manner.
In the future, we will make this database viewable by all employees so they can confirm where there is room for reduction in energy usage. We also plan to roll it out to affiliated companies, together with workstyle reforms that reduce the work involved in data entry and other aspects.
 reducing CO2 emissions that will earn a spot on the A list in the future. We also intend to respond by disclosing information according to the stan- dard global methods (proposed by TCFD, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure).

ing group verified energy saving technologies.
The working group performed simulations with various kinds of energy saving technologies to evaluate
energy saving performance in the buildings that were part of the model in quantitative terms. It verified various kinds of technology for achieving ZEB in the process. In the future, Shimizu will also contribute to reduction in customer CO2 emissions during building operation by using the ZEB Visualizer (The ZEB Visualizer is a ZEB proposal simulation tool that uses 3D modeling developed by Shimizu.) to propose the optimal ZEB solutions for specific customers.
We have obtained third-party certification of CO2 emissions from Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC Tokyo.
* Calculation standards are listed on the website (https://www.shimz.co.jp/company/csr/environment/pdf/data_2018.pdf).
 Other Activities
In addition to the three categories (P59) for which we have established KPI, we are working to contribute to the global environment by reducing CO2 emissions in our supply chain, from upstream to downstream, through our own activities aimed at reducing emissions.

     Acquisition of FSC® CoC Certification Under the Forest Certification System
We approve of initiatives to protect the forests by using lumber harvested from properly man- aged forests to solve the various challenges facing global forests, such as the decline in for- ests, impact on climate change and society, and economic losses caused by illegal logging. Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings therefore obtained FSC® CoC (Forest Stewardship Council® Chain-of-Custody) Certification in February 2018. The FSC® CoC Certification has awarded the largest number of certifications among forest certification programs and it is highly trusted internationally.
Initiatives at Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings
The use of lumber from certified forests has mainly been limited to use for printing paper up to this point. Recently, however, major distribu- tors and manufacturing companies have also begun to use products from certified forests. At Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings, we use FSC certified materials for our original wooden kino style products that are used in com- memorative furniture presented to customers upon completion of a project and gifts of appre- ciation given to shareholders, which contributes

Pollution Prevention
Preventing deterioration of the neighboring living environment and protecting the health and preventing exposure of employees and workers to asbestos is a major social issue. Shimizu therefore con- ducts special training on asbestos on an ongoing basis.
The entire company also works to render the PCB waste Shimizu owns harmless (through a subcontractor), to properly manage industrial waste from products containing mercury, and to prevent pollution from construction wastewater.

In the future, we will expand the certified products we handle and will establish a supply chain of certified forest products for all products made by Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings, and promote more activities that protect the forests by using the trees.

  Kyobashi Wildlife Day
Shimizu is a member of the Japan Business Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB). Corporate members of JBIB all hold wildlife observation events in the green areas of each company at the same time. We hold the Wildlife Days event to make biodiversity a mainstream concept by joining together to spread the news. Sixteen companies and over 2,400 people participated in this event.
On May 22, which is International Day for Bio- logical Diversity, Shimizu teamed up with the Daiichi Life Group, one of our customers, and held the Kyobashi Wildlife Day event in Tokyo Square Garden, an outdoor garden in Kyobashi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, as part of that effort. A total of 25 employees from the two companies assisted with
the activities, which included observing wildlife, playing field bingo, and trying out beekeeping.
We have set our sights on expanding this beyond employees and customers to city residents in the future, and will provide activities to educate people about biodiversity.

This project was ordered as a design & build project, meaning that the customer placed one order for both design and construction of the halls. This project required Shimizu take the fact that these are facilities related to the Olympics and Paralympics that will be removed after they have been used for about 10 years into consideration in proposing the technology. We therefore proposed an ecological, environmentally friendly buildings that can be recycled and the proposal was accepted. This involved considerations such as minimizing the impact on the environment during construction to build the new halls and when eventually dismantling them.
In fiscal 2017, Shimizu received the Prime Minister’s Award for distinguished service in promoting the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), which is sponsored by the 3R SUISHINKYOGIKAI in this project, This was the first such award of distinction for Shimizu.
Award ceremony
    The theme which received the award was “Building 100% recyclable exhibit halls that are easily removable.”
During construction we used pile head ring sockets (developed at the Institute of Technology), which made the use of footing beams unnecessary in the entire foundation. We used steel pipe piling because they would be removed in the future and reused. A pure steel frame was used for the upper structure. Double folded plate was used for the roof, and ALC for the exterior walls. We received the award because all of these materials could be recycled.
Shimizu also received 3R SUISHINKYOGIKAI Chairman’s Awards for the following projects in fiscal 2017: Plans for the Nomura Building in Yokohama, construction site redevelopment on the west side of Kyobashi 2-chome, new construction site for a redevelopment project to the west of the north exit from Tachikawa Station, construction to improve the ground for the smokestack foundation at the Soma thermal power plant.
ECO First Certification
Shimizu obtained ECO First certification from the Minister of the Environment on August 7, 2018 for our pledge to work on our own initiatives in environmental protection.
Shimizu’s ECO First pledge covers the main goals for fiscal 2030, which include measures to combat global warming, effective use of resources, and initiatives in biodiversity.
In the future, we will enlist the entire company in promoting these initiatives and fulfilling our pledge.

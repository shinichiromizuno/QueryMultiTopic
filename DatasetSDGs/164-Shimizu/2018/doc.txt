      Management Principles
Faithful Monozukuri and a Spirit of Innovation
Shimizu was founded in 1804. Kisuke Shimizu I, who was born in Etchu Toyama, began the company by open- ing a carpentry shop in Kanda Kajicho, Edo (present day Tokyo). Shimizu’s aim since founding had been to devote wholehearted attention to work and created reliable quality products. In the more than 210 years that have passed since then, we have incessantly pursued new knowledge and technologies to meet the needs of our customers and society.
About Shimizu Initiatives in Various Areas Business Base Corporate Governance Financial Statements and Data Collection
The Analects and the Abacus: Carrying on the Spirit
    Kisuke Shimizu I (the first) and Kisuke Shimizu II (the second), Who Built the Foundation of Shimizu Corporation
Eiichi Shibusawa, who is called the father of capitalism in Japan, was a great facilita- tor in the establishment of numerous private companies and businesses that con- tributed to society from the Meiji period onward. He is known for his immense contributions to the modernization of Japan.
Shimizu was also one of the companies that received great benefit from Shibusawa’s contributions. The connection began with the construction of the Dai-Ichi National Bank in 1872. The high praise of Kisuke Shimizu II, who built Japan’s first bank using the latest quasi-Western styles architectural techniques, by Eiichi Shibusawa, who was the Superintendent of the bank, was the beginning of a strong relationship. After the sudden death of Mannosuke, the third generation of Shimizu management in 1887, the Shimizu shop at the time welcomed Eiichi Shibusawa as an advisor, based on the last wishes of Mannosuke that they obtain the advice of the esteemed Eiichi Shibusawa on all matters.
The Analects and the Abacus contains the teach- ings of Eiichi Shibusawa from this era.
The Analects and the Abacus speaks about the compatibility of ethics and economics. It conveys the concept that a business can prosper by con- tributing to society through ethical corporate activities.
Shimizu has always relied on these teachings as the basis of management over the course of our long history since that time.
Kisuke Shimizu I increased the number of customers with his outstanding skills and business acumen, and built the foun- dation for the business by undertaking the construction of the west wing of Edo Castle in 1838, among other projects. Kisuke Shimizu II built the Tsukiji Hotel, Japan’s first fully Western-style hotel for foreigners at the end of the Edo period (completed in 1868) at his own expense, and man- aged the hotel after it was completed. He also built the foundation of Shimizu by designing and building the Dai-Ichi National Bank (the former Mitsui-Gumi House) and the Mitsui Exchange Bank, which are representative of the early Meiji period, as well as other projects that demonstrated his inno- vative spirit, high technical skills, and built trust.

We will continue to pass on the faithful craftsmanship and spirit of innovation built by Kisuke Shimizu I and II through The Analects and the Abacus, which contains the teachings of Eiichi Shibusawa. These are important principles that must remain constant, even in times of great change.

Restoring Trust
Kazuyuki Inoue
President and Representative Director
On March 23, 2018, Shimizu Corporation was indicted for alleged violations of the Antimonopoly Act relating to a bid on a Chuo Shinkansen construction project ordered by the Central Japan Railway Com- pany. We are deeply regretful that such an incident has occurred and offer our sincere apologies.
The company intends to implement measures to ensure even stricter compliance and stronger gover- nance. We will enlist the entire company in working to restore trust in Shimizu Corporation and ask for the steady support of all of our stakeholders in the future as well.

The Value that Shimizu Provides to Communities
The needs of communities and customers are becoming more diverse and sophisticated as people’s sense of values and lifestyles change with the rapid advancement of technology. Japan is also facing a declining population and an aging society with fewer children being born, aging infrastructure, and the frequent occurrence of natural disasters. The many problems facing the construction industry globally, such as global warming, abnormal weather events, and increased energy demand, are also growing more severe. Expectations of companies and the roles they are expected to play in achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) set forth by the United Nations in 2015 are also increasing.
The Shimizu Group aims to be a company that is valued by society and continues to be chosen by customers. We will achieve this through the dedicated pursuit of sustainability of communities and buildings and structures, continuing to provide value that exceeds the expectations of our customers, and by creating the communities described below and contributing to the achievement of SDGs as a “Smart Solutions Company.”
1 Contributing to the Realization of Safe and Secure Communities
We will continue to place importance on the philosophies of faithful craftsmanship and being market- oriented, which make up the DNA of the Shimizu Group. We will dedicate ourselves to safety and quality assurance, and will provide security to communities and customers.
Natural disasters have been more frequent and more intense in recent years. The social roles that the construction industry plays in maintenance, management, and extending the life of infrastructure, and in rapid recovery and restoration, have grown increasingly larger amid concerns over the possibility of a major earthquake, either directly beneath the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, or in the Nankai Trough or other critical locations. The Shimizu Group assists companies with the formulation of BCP (business continuity plans) to prepare for major disasters, works to develop disaster prevention and mitigation technologies, and provides safe and secure buildings and services to communities.
2 Contributing to the Realization of Comfortable, Smart Communities
We strive to create communities where people can live and work with passion by creating spaces that are highly comfortable and convenient for the people who use them, and that take their well-being into consideration. We also contribute to the creation of communities that are convenient for all types of people by providing universal designs and renovation and services to create barrier-free environments as we work to enhance sustainable value over a building’s life cycle.
Shimizu is actively pursuing the optimal use of ICT (Information Communication Technology), and auto- mation and industrialization of group production processes. We are also taking on the challenge of developing a vision for the future of the construction industry and are creating smart production systems that utilize AI, robots, and other advanced technologies to improve the comfort and productivity of con- struction sites and achieve innovation in the business as a whole.
3 Contributing to the Realization of Environmentally Friendly, Sustainable Communities
We recognize the long-range impact that the construction industry has on the surrounding environment, from construction to operation and demolition. The Shimizu Group puts the environment at the center of all of its business activities. We work to reduce CO2 emissions, achieve energy savings, and conserve resources over the entire lifecycle of buildings, and take other steps in business activities to reduce the burden on the environment. We also promote initiatives in ecosystem preservation and biodiversity.
We are also taking on the challenge of building and encouraging the spread of ZEB (Zero Energy Buildings) to make a society with low or no carbon emissions a reality. We are focusing on the renewable energy management business, projects that achieve harmonious existence with nature, and other busi- nesses to contribute to the creation of environmentally friendly, sustainable communities.
* Well-being: The state of being comfortable, healthy or happy

     Smart Vision 2010, Long-term Vision
In June 2010, Shimizu formulated Smart Vision 2010 to indicate the direction the company should aim for over the next 10 years.
Shimizu wants to be the type of company that continues to grow along with the society as a front- runner in creating environments where people can live comfortably and securely. To achieve that vision, we are aiming to be a Smart Solutions Company that focuses intently on the sustainability of buildings and communities in our core construction business and continues to provide value that exceeds the expectations of our customers.

Progress Report on Midterm Management Plan 2014
In 2016, two years after Midterm Management Plan 2014 was started, the numerical targets were revised due to changing market environment and strong performance. Despite concern over international politi- cal uncertainty and geopolitical risk, the Japanese economy is gradually rebounding and investment in construction is brisk, particularly in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Forecasts for fiscal year 2018, the final year of the plan, are 1.79 trillion yen in net sales (+17.8% YoY) and 126.0 billion yen in ordinary income (+1.5% YoY).
To advance the construction business, we were able to improve the profit margin earned on robust construction market. However, as society ages, fewer children are born, and the productive population of Japan declines, the construction industry will also face serious problems in securing and training workers, improving productivity, and reforming workstyles. To improve productivity, we will continue to use BIM (Building Information Modeling), develop new construction methods, machinery, and robots that will require fewer workers, and utilize ICT and AI in the future as well. To secure and develop workers, we will promote a five-day work week, and improve other benefits for skilled workers to make the construction industry more attractive.
To achieve steady growth in the three key business areas, we strengthened the system for obtaining global orders, by targeting not only Japanese companies and ODA (Official Development Assistance), but also from local and multinational clients, and were able to secure stable revenues. We have also strength- ened internal and external alliances and are working to expand business volume. In the building stock management business, we leveraged strengths as a group, primarily in the investment development business, and achieved stable results. In the future, we will continue to increase our portfolio of attractive building stock, and will also put effort into the BSP (Building Service Provider) business. In the sustain- ability business, we established the LCV Headquarters in October 2017. We are also pursuing and expanding business in energy services, and are entering new areas such as the renewable energy busi- ness, and the carbon emission elimination business.
To further strengthen the management foundations, we took steps for a stronger corporate system. This included fortifying our technology base in order to maintaining Shimizu’s reputation as technical leader, and implementing effective HR management, including our supply chain.
We also actively worked together with local communities as a good partner, and were able to contrib- ute to these communities. We will continue to promote compliance management and high ethical values among all officers and employees in the future.

Midterm Management Plan 2014
In July 2014, Shimizu formulated Midterm Management Plan 2014 (2014–2018), a five-year plan based on the long-term vision. The three basic policies of this plan are to advance the construction business; steadily develop the three key businesses of the global business, building stock management business, and sustainability business; and further strengthen the management foundations, while maintaining a steady response to the current robust demand for construction and also keeping an eye on long-term trends in the construction market.

     Financial Policy
Shimizu will invest in research and development to improve productivity at construction sites through robot development, ICT, and other technologies, in order to achieve even higher profitability in the construction industry and to prepare for the large decline in skilled workers in the future. We will also invest in the real estate development business, the power generation and electricity retail business, the infrastructure man- agement business, and others, whereby will build a diverse revenue bases in these new areas. We will also continue to increase equity capital to prepare for the risks in new areas of business, and will maintain an appropriate level of interest-bearing debt to secure and maintain stable means of financing.
In terms of shareholder return, we consider that strengthening the company’s financial bases to provide the foundation for long-term growth and paying stable dividends are important management issues. Our basic policy on the allocation of profits is to pay out dividends that are supported by stable business performance. We plan to pay annual dividends of 26 yen per share (a dividend payout ratio of 22.4%) in fiscal 2018.
ESG Initiatives
The business environment has recently been changing at a dizzying pace, and this has also provided vari- ous risks and opportunities. I believe that we need to manage in a way that takes the environment (E), social (S), and governance (G) elements into consideration for Shimizu to achieve sustainable growth amid such conditions. We are working on ESG initiatives and on enhancing corporate value from the following four perspectives in the rolling three-year management plan (FY 2018–FY 2020), which is based on Midterm Management Plan 2014.
1. Pursue both offensive and defensive environmental management through more initiatives aimed at reducing CO2 and preserving biodiversity. (E)
2. Steadfastly promote diversity management (more advancement of women, employment and advance- ment of people with disabilities, etc.) (S)
3. Pursue CSR activities that are linked to business activities, and participate in activities that contribute to society, volunteer activities, etc. (S)
4. Promote effective corporate governance and management in a highly reliable, transparent manner (G)
Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Develop- ment Summit in September 2015.
All U.N. members are called upon to achieve the goals under the principle of “no one left behind” stated in the SDG action plans for People, the Planet, and Prosperity.
Of the 17 SDGs, Goal 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), and Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), include actions that should be actively pursued by the construction industry. Shimizu is working on Goal 7 (Affordable and clean energy), and other goals as part of our business. In managing the company, it is also important to pay attention to Goal 8 (Decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (Responsible production and consumption), Goal 13 (Climate action), Goal 14 (Life below water), and Goal 15 (Life on land).
I think it is important for Shimizu employees to understand the SDGs. I personally conduct activities to educate employees on them, and work to make sure that each employee is able to think about SDGs from his or her own perspective. A department dedicated to SDGs and ESG was also established in April 2018.
I do not regard the SDGs and ESG as just social demands; we are adopting them as our basic stance on management and business activities in the future. We are currently in the process of formulating the next long-term vision and revising the Midterm Management Plan. These will naturally incorporate “new value” that takes those elements into consideration.
Since Shimizu was founded in 1804, we have placed importance on the high aspirations and attitude towards business of the founder, Kisuke Shimizu I, and his successor, Kisuke Shimizu II, of performing faithful craftsmanship, being market-oriented, and maintaining a spirit of innovation. In developing the company’s business, we have also focused on the basic principles of management in The Analects and the Abacus, which contains the teachings of the venerable businessman, Eiichi Shibusawa, who repre- sented Japan in the Meiji and Taisho eras (1868–1926). I believe that we have been successful precisely because we have met the expectations and earned the trust of all stakeholders in each era. I will person- ally stand at the helm and enlist the coordinated efforts of all employees in making sure that Shimizu will also be able to continue providing value that exceeds the expectations of our customers in the future.

Two tower condominiums in the Tokyo Wonderful Project completed in 2016, in Shin-toyosu
We used the first patented seismic isolation and vibration control system in Japan in both towers, and also built them to improve the livability of the con- dominium units. We provide residents with safe, secure, and comfortable living accommodations by manifesting Shimizu’s integrative strengths through our advanced R&D capabilities and concepts.
 Special Feature
Building Value for Society
Achieving Safety and Security Through the Construction Industry
The recent frequency of earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic erup- tions, and other natural disasters is placing increasing impor- tance on the social role of the construction industry. This role includes building and maintaining infrastructure, rapid response on recovery, and restoration projects. Through these, Shimizu provides the safety and security to protect the lives of our cus- tomers and their businesses.
There are also concerns about the future potential for a major earth- quake, either directly beneath the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area or in the Nankai and Sagami troughs. Moreover, the impact of global warming has exposed the potential risk for disasters other than earth- quakes, such as massive typhoons or torrential rains.
Shimizu is contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Develop- ment Goals 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by developing technology to mitigate the damage from such disasters from many perspectives. Forecasting and diagnostic technologies, disaster prevention and mitigation technologies, and technologies that enable rapid recovery and restoration of normal daily life after a disaster are among the technologies we contribute.
Shimizu will continue to contribute to the realization of safe and secure communities in the future as well.
Areas of Shimizu Technologies That Provide Safety and Security

Left: SKYZ TOWER & GARDEN Right: BAYZ TOWER & GARDEN
center: Toyosu Megumi Kindergarten
Earthquake-resistant core structure Response control devices (U-shaped steel damper)
Seismic isolation devices
 In the 31-story BAYZ Tower, we built brightly-lit dwelling units using window sashes that reached to the ceiling on all floors. We achieved this through the use of the Swing Saver hybrid seismic isola- tion and vibration control system that enabled use of large beams of 600 mm in height or less on the outer perimeter of the building. This system uses vibra- tion dampers every few floors and connect the seismic isolation structure in the dwelling parts to the earthquake- resistant structure for the core.
 Using the Shimizu three- pointed star-shaped, hybrid seismic isolation and vibra- tion control system to increase the space between columns in the 44-story SKYZ Tower enabled us to create a plan that reduced the restrictions imposed by columns on the open side of balconies and created wide openings for dwellings.
Steps Taken by Shimizu
Protecting buildings from shaking during an earthquake (Seismic isolation, vibration control, seismic control,
and seismic retrofitting)
Protecting the building interiors from shaking during an earthquake
(Seismic isolation of non-structural components, partial seismic isolation)
Protecting projects from liquefaction (Liquefaction countermeasures)
Protecting lives from fire
(Improved fire resistance, evacuation safety measures)
Protecting lives from tsunami (Reducing human casualties)
Accurate knowledge of threats (Identifying disaster risk)

“Ohorayama Wind Farm”
Japan’s largest wind farm in a mountainous region
We utilized Shimizu’s engineering expertise to build Japan’s largest wind farm in a mountainous region in the town of Otsuki, on the western end of Kochi Prefecture. To construct the 33 MW wind farm, we built a 7.5 km road, transported the 50.2-meter-long blades and other wind turbine components, and installed 16 km of buried power transmission lines.

MM21-54 Block Project
Working for Greater Improvements in Productivity
through the Full Use of BIM
The MM21-54 Block Project, which is a Shimizu investment development project, is a large eco-BCP- based office building under construction at the entrance of Minato Mirai. We are making full use of BIM (Building Information Modeling) in this project to realize major improvements and benefits throughout the construction and production process.

Matsudo City General Hospital
The entire city hospital was built on a seismic isolation base, giving it new life as a safe and secure hospital. The artwork of local middle school students is displayed in various locations throughout the hospital, giving it a special atmo- sphere. The creativity the designers put into cre- ating a fun interior in the pediatric and perinatal areas is delighting the children and their families.
Many requests were received from various departments and I recall working with the princi- ple planner to figure out how to allocate the lim- ited space properly. The team also responded swiftly to requests made during construction. This showed me the advantages of design and build.

We worked to add greater value to the hospital by having construction supervisors with extensive track records and researchers at the Institute of Technology with highly specialized knowledge repeatedly examine the details from the design stage and incorporate Shimizu’s expertise. We were also careful to create an environment that was relaxing for patients and their families while also providing a high degree of safety and func- tionality. We devised ways to give the space a fun and happy ambience by incorporating wide-open views and employing forest-theme designs that make it easy for staff on the pediatric ward to care for children and give the children the security of feeling cared for.

Job Site Manager MM21-52 Block Job Site Yokohama Branch
Because you can use components with the same dimensions as the actual components in BIM, you can examine the many different aspects you need to look at to construct a building with a high degree of precision. Examination of provisional plans on BIM also produces plans of a level that can be actually used.
In the future we will take on the challenge of achieving even greater improvements in produc- tivity as an innovative model job site by using automated conveyor robots, steel frame welding robots, and other automated equipment linked to BIM. I also hope to develop young planners and construction managers into strong engineers that are trusted by clients through such challenges.

As the division that specializes in promoting BIM, we are using a new cloud service that we have been piloting since last fiscal year to share BIM data with the companies that produce the work- ing drawings in Vietnam, China, and other coun- tries and follow projects remotely. Using the BIM data we have produced here for 4D construction simulations, 3D alignment and adjustments, and management of construction through the use of a tablet helps to improve job site productivity. The knowledge acquired in this project will be rolled out nationwide in the future and will lead to improvements in productivity for Shimizu as a whole.

Construction Period Drastically Reduced —Skyscraper in Indonesia “Menara Astra”
Menara Astra is a skyscraper (height 261.5 m) located in the Sudirman Central Business District, the largest business district in the capital of Jakarta. The tower has become a landmark of the area due to its remarkable height. A joint consortium led by Shimizu completed this super tall building, planned as a head office building of Indonesia’s largest conglomerate, PT Astra International, Tbk. Construction was completed four months ahead of the original contract deadline.
  Chiba Section of the Tokyo Gaikan Expressway Outer Ring Finally Opens!
The Chiba section of the Tokyo Gaikan Expressway (Nicknamed the “Outer Ring”) finally opened on Satur- day, June 2, 2018. Shimizu constructed four areas of this section: The Owada construction area, the box culvert section in the Ichikawa Tajiri, the Ichikawa Koya I.C., and the Keisei Sugano Underpass. Not only will the opening of this section ease traffic congestion and improve productivity in the Greater Tokyo Area, it is also expected to make a substantial contribution to disaster response by securing a route in a disaster.

Comment from the Project Director
Ms. Shirley Thou, Project Director, Astra International
Menara Astra is Astra International’s symbol of growing achievements in Indonesia. Shimizu was selected from list of International contractors to build and display Astra’s significant corporate presence in the centre of Jakarta.
Shimizu’s Main Contract award included MEP, interior finishes, and NSCs. As early as tender award Shimizu team engaged consultants and subcontractors to review construction method, material usage efficiency, and optimisation of labour skills in order to build the ultimate
  Comment from the
sustainable building within the limitation of local resources. Menara Astra achieved the first Green- mark Platinum building under Singapore’s 2015 building code in Jakarta. The building is 32% more energy efficient, 35% less water consumption and 40% less lighting usage compared with standard office building.
Menara Astra was completed 4 months ahead of contract schedule and successfully handover for client’s operation in 4Q 2017. I personally had an extraordinary pleasure working with Shimizu team to deliver Menara Astra as a significant building that upraised building quality standard in Jakarta.
Through our successful experience in Menara Astra, I wish Shimizu team’s success and transfer the knowledge gained to build future great projects.

  TOPICS Keisei Sugano Underpass construction received an award from the Japan Society
of Civil Engineers!
The box jacking method which used a non-open-cut (R&C) con- struction method where the expressway intersects with the Keisei Railway at Sugano Station received a technology award (I) from the Japan Society of Civil Engineers in fiscal 2017. A struc- ture that was more than 18 meters in height was jacked into the ground just under the station. This construction was an unprec- edented construction with high technical difficulty It was highly acclaimed as a method that can be used in many other types of underground construction and construction near railways.
  30 Shimizu Corporate Report 2018
The Owada construction on the Outer Ring began in June 2011 and took seven years to complete successfully. The area I was in charge of was located in a quiet residential district and we there- fore paid careful attention to the surrounding environment in proceeding with construction. The opening of this Outer Ring Expressway and High- way No. 298 completely changed traffic conditions in the area surrounding Matsudo and Ichikawa, and was so successful in resolving the problems with traffic congestion that congestion now seems like a myth. We received many expressions of grati- tude from nearby residents. This made me happy to have participated in this project and gave me a renewed sense of pride in my work.

Operation in the First Overseas Project that Shimizu has Developed on its Own
S.LOGI Niiza, a next-generation logis- tics facility is under construction at a location that is within 25 km from the center of Tokyo and near the Tokoro- zawa Interchange. It is also close to a JR cargo terminal station, making it suitable for a modal shift to railway transport. All of the logistics facilities Shimizu has developed to date have been of the BTS (Built to Suit) type and have one tenant. This project is the first time that Shimizu has taken on the challenge of multi-tenant facility. Building Construction, Civil Engineering, and Investment Devel- opment have been working as one team since we presented the com- petitive proposal to Niiza City.
S.LOGI Niiza is Shimizu’s largest project, with a total floor area of 190,000 m2.
This project is located in an indus- trial park in the eastern part of Jakarta. Shimizu is developing ser- viced apartments that offer both the livability and functionality of a con- dominium with hotel services. This is the first project that Shimizu has developed on its own overseas. The development, design, and construc- tion will be performed by Shimizu, and the local subsidiary of Fujita Kanko Inc. will operate it. The ser- viced apartments will offer quality on par with Japan that will meet the needs of people living in Indonesia on assignment, both those who have just arrived and those living in Indo- nesia long-term.

Specific Initiatives
Maximized the Property Value of Older Buildings through Environmental, BCP, and WELL Renovations
   In LCV Headquarters, after we have acquired an existing building that has reached the point of needing renovation, we give the building a new lease on life by equipping it with the latest envi- ronmental performance, BCP functions, and health and comfort (WELL), and provide sustainability renovation services aimed at maximizing property value.
Our first foray into the business occurred in March 2017, when the Investment and Development Division acquired trust beneficiary interest in the DSB Group Shiomi Building, an office building (in Koto-ku, Tokyo) that Shimizu had built 22 years before.
The Design Division drew up the design proposed by LCV Headquarters and the Tokyo Branch per- formed the renovation work while the existing tenant (who occupied the entire building) remained in the building.

   Initiatives in Frontier Areas Backed by a Pioneering Spirit and Strong Structures
Shimizu began working on the concept of developing untouched frontier areas such as the ocean and space in the 1980s, and has continued to work steadily on this.
We established a new Emerging Frontiers Division in April 2018, aimed at moving from the conceptualization and R&D stage to commercialization.
We intend to accelerate the pace of planning and verification to achieve commercialization in frontier areas rapidly, and make these businesses that will be the future cornerstones of our next long-term vision.
The Lunar Ring is a concept for transmitting power generated on the surface of the moon to earth and supplying 100% of the power needed on earth.
This idea was generated by switching our thought process from the concept of using the limited resources on earth while conserving them to generating a close to limitless supply of clean energy and using it freely.
Our goal is to control environmental destruction caused by global warming and resource depletion, and realize a sustainable society on a global scale.

   GREEN FLOAT and OCEAN SPIRAL: Two Concepts for Ocean Cities
   We will use the expertise of the Shimizu Civil Engineer- ing Headquarters in the small rocket launching busi- ness, which includes construction of rocket launch pads as well.
Satellite data
In the use of lunar development, the origination point of Shimizu’s activities in space, our goal is to support the movement of people to space by conducting R&D on the design and construction of facilities for living in space and on other planets or celestial bodies, and applying construction technology to space.
Conceptualization of lunar base
Green Float, an island with a sustainable environ- ment, is an ocean city that floats on the Pacific ocean directly over the equator. We are aiming to create a plant-like city that continues to absorb CO2. It will be located on equator, an area with the most sunlight and fewest typhoons.
We are exploring solar power generation in space, use of structural materials that have mag- nesium from sea water as a component, and other concepts.
Ocean Spiral, the deep-sea city of the future, is a concept for transporting people, electricity, and ocean bed resources along a spiral route that con- nects a globe-shaped residential area, which is 500 meters in diameter and floats near the ocean’s surface, to a factory on the ocean floor.
We envision utilization of state-of-the-art technology for the generation of power from the temperature differentials in the ocean, the world’s first offshore fish farm that makes use of the temperature and nutrients in the deep sea, and equipment to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into methane gas with meth- ane-generating bacteria on the ocean floor.

 The increasing number of small satellites launched will enable the use of even more satellite data in the satel- lite data usage business. This will add value to Shi- mizu’s businesses in construction, engineering, LCV, and other areas.

Shimizu Swing Mass Damper
The Shimizu Swing Mass Damper (SMD) is a control device that is installed on the rooftop to control the complex shaking of ultra high- rise buildings due to long-period earthquake motion. When the planar shape of a building is not perfectly square, the natural period of vibra- tion for the longer and shorter sides of the building differ. The conven- tional rooftop control devices can only match the period of the shaking in one direction, so they cannot sufficiently control the shaking.
In contrast, Shimizu’s SMD incorporates dynamic screws inside the device. The dynamic screws convert the shaking to a rotational motion which produces a powerful counterweight effect. The mechanism shakes slowly at the same period as the building (lengthening the period shaking), and is capable of counteracting shaking with differing periods in two directions.
Because one device can control shaking of two differing periods, it is lighter and uses less space than a conventional rooftop control device.
Scanning and Projection Mapping System (SP-MAPS)
When excavating a mountain tunnel in an area where the soil quality is poor, arch-shaped steel supports are erected at designated intervals and concrete is sprayed to stabilize the tunnel. After the cutting sur- face (working face) has progressed to a certain extent, a concrete base called invert concrete (hereafter, “invert”) is also installed in the bottom of the tunnel to prevent deformation and collapse of the tunnel by integrating it with the upper supports.
The SP-MAPS developed by Shimizu makes it possible for one worker to perform the entire process, from installing the system to confirming the excavation status. The time required from measurement to expo- sure is only one minute, greatly reducing the number of people and work involved.
This system also does not require a worker to stand in the excava- tion area to confirm excavation status, so it also increases the safety of the work.

 Initiatives in Improving Productivity
  Aiming to Create an Attractive Construction Industry
Responding to the labor shortages in the construction industry is an urgent challenge as the number of people in their productive years declines. Shimizu is working to improve productivity in the construction production process as one major means of dealing with this shortage. We will take active steps to con- tinually improve productivity and make other improvements in the future and will strive to make the construction industry more attractive so that we can continue to provide better construction service and meet the increasingly diverse and complex needs of customers.
Improving Productivity through Robot Development (Building Construction)
  Improving Productivity through Use of ICT
As one means of improving productivity, Shimizu has expanded the range of employees we supply with smartphones and tablets (iPads) from con- struction managers to employees involved in sales and design, and are developing and using the optimal applications for each area. Using iPads at job sites to hold meetings, perform inspections, monitor processes, and accomplish other tasks has smoothed out the construction management process in particular. We have also replaced the bulletin board for the morning meet- ing with a large monitor. The work to be per- formed and notifications for that day are projected on the screen from an iPad in diagrammatic form. Using ICT technology in this way not only improves work efficiency, it ensures seamless, accurate communication through visualization, and this enables us to achieve better quality and greater safety. Shimizu will accelerate the use of ICT technology even more in the future.
Improving Productivity through BIM Use
The 3D BIM data is used to check interference and simulate construction, and enables visual exami- nation of many aspects. This helps to prevent reworking. It is extremely effective for coordinating among different areas of expertise and examining intricate fittings, in particular. Secondary use of BIM data also enables sharing of awareness among the relevant parties through the visualiza- tion of analytical data or creation of a model with a 3D printer. This is useful for speeding up the identification and resolution of problems. (Examples of specific initiatives are listed on Page 26)

Image of Shimz Smart Site
The development and pilot period has ended, and the Shimz Smart Site system is now in full operation at the karaksa hotel Shin-Osaka Pre- mier (tentative name), a high-rise hotel on which construction began in June 2017. The various robots (except for the Autonomous-ELV) will be put to work as construction progresses toward the scheduled completion in August 2019.
Shimizu will roll-out these robots mainly to large job sites in the Greater Tokyo Area from 2019, and will also actively pursue development of robots in the future to expand the types of applicable construction work.
i-Construction (Civil Engineering)
Shimz Smart Site is a next-generation production system that enables workers and robots to work together. It achieves this through ICT-based con- struction, with BIM at the core. The system includes a lightweight all-weather cover and the five robots listed in the right column.

Construction work using ICT in progress on Yamba Dam
Shimizu has introduced ICT-based construction and precast concrete for concrete structures in all aspects of the Yamba Dam construction project in Agatsuma-gun, Gunma Prefecture. A drone is used for measurements. The bulldozers and vibrating rollers are equipped with GNSS antennas and use satellite data to monitor concrete height and the number of roller compactions. Shimizu is working reduce the number of workers required and shorten the construction period through substan- tial reduction in the number of surveyors and unskilled workers, and are also working to improve productivity through the introduction of IT tools for construction management tasks.

Keeping the light on SHIMZ DNA
Each and every employee is a precious asset to Shimizu, and we consider our employees “human resources.” Firmly entrenching the spirit of crafts- manship and passing down the DNA of Shimizu form the foundation for development from the perspective of developing people who make
good products. Shimizu works to develop human resources whom customers and the community trust as first-class professionals through cross- sectional training, specialty training by area, and functional training.
Securing Workers
Securing human resources in the construction industry is an urgent challenge as the number of workers in the labor force declines. This will also affect the handing down of skills to the next generation. We are devoting ourselves to various efforts to solve these challenges.

Diagram of the Management Structure
Five-day Work Week Initiative
Obtaining the cooperation of subcontractors and skilled workers is essential in order to implement a five-day work week at job sites. From May 2018 onward, Shimizu has supplemented wages by a certain percentage of turnover each month if the designated conditions for job site closure are met. This is being done to counteract the reduc- tion in income that skilled workers would experi- ence by increasing the number of days on which the job site is closed. This system will remain in
Securing Skilled Workers
Cooperating with the Kanekikai, a partner to Shi- mizu, Shimizu implemented job site tours for high school students, children, and others with the goal of securing workers for the construction industry. We have focused mainly on students of technical high schools for high school job site tours to give the next generation that will assume responsibility for the future the opportunity to become familiar with the construction industry. The tours for chil- dren were targeted at children and other family members of foremen and craftsmen.
We began posting recruitment ads on Internet recruiting sites in fiscal year 2015 to assist in recruitment. In fiscal 17 companies hired 25

General New Employee Training
Shimizu encourages the mindset of acquiring the knowledge needed in the three categories of being a member of society, a member of the con- struction industry, and a Shimizu employee from the time new employees enter the company. We conduct cross-sectional training in April, Septem- ber and February during the first year employees are in the company. The program is set up to acquire the DNA passed down by Shimizu and the monozukuri mindset in stages.
New employees learn the basics as members of society in April. Our goal is to also make them aware of their social mission as people who work in the construction industry, teach them the his- tory of the company, and have them understand the management principles.
In September, training is held at Shimizu Memo- rial Park in Koba, Toyama City, the birthplace of Kisuke Shimizu I. Employees also visit the Shibus- awa Memorial Museum in Kita-ku, Tokyo to learn about Eiichi Shibusawa, who was heavily involved

 Initiative to Promote Enrollment in Social Insurance
Job board for subcontractors on the Shimizu corporate website
 Shimizu has always worked to promote enroll- ment in social insurance to provide an attractive work environment that skilled workers can feel secure working in for a long time.
In October 2015, we began concluding agree- ments with subcontractors that clearly state the calculated cost of the statutory social benefits that a subcontractor will incur as a category
separate from construction costs. In fiscal 2017, we far surpassed our goal for the percentage of skilled workers enrolled in social insurance, which was a percentage equivalent to the manufactur- ing industry. Shimizu will continue to assist with promoting enrollment in social insurance in the future to improve treatment of skilled workers.

Fiscal 2017 Results:
Health and Safety Performance
The accident frequency rate* improved to 0.47
from 0.53 in fiscal 2016.
* Accident frequency rate: Number of deaths and serious injuries per million cumulative worker hours (Figures for all industries and for the construction industry represent accidents resulting in one or more lost work days, calculated on a calendar-year basis. Figures for Shimizu’s represent accidents resulting in four or more lost workdays, calculated on a fiscal-year basis.)
Accident Analysis
Falls of under two meters were the most frequent, followed by falls of over two meters, slips and trips, and getting caught. Although the number of accidents resulting in four or more lost workdays decreased, the number of incidents and percent- ages increased for falls of two meters or more and less than two meters, both of which were specifically targeted for improvement.
Safety Patrols by President Inoue
President Inoue conducts safety patrols each year during National Safety Week and National Indus- trial Health Week. On July 5, 2018, he toured the Tokyo Civil Engineering Branch job site for the tunnel connecting the international terminal to the domestic terminal at Tokyo International
Specific Initiatives in Fiscal 2018:
Rededication to “Back to Basics” in Safety Management
In light of the fact that Shimizu is unable to prevent various kinds of falls (falls of two meters or more and falls of less than two meters) last fiscal year, we will make sure that all workers serve as the first line of defense against the risk of falls at job sites by using the lessons learned from past accidents. We will be diligent in operation of the PDCA cycle in work that carries a high risk of falls. Job site managers and the rest of the organization will maintain a firm awareness of not causing any acci- dents, and will make sure, when beginning work, that everyone, from supervisors at Shimizu up to the frontline workers, understands the accidents that might occur and the impact that such acci- dents have. After sharing the urgency of this mes- sage, they will adhere to work procedures.
  Developing Multiple Skills
Large steel frame construction projects have increased in recent years, mainly in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, and a busy period for specific types of construction unique to steel frame structures is anticipated. To provide work- ers skilled in types of construction not experienc- ing a busy period with the skills needed in types of construction that are experiencing a busy period, Shimizu established a practical training facility on the premises of an affiliated company in August 2017 and conducted training in the
Excellent Foremen
Since 2007, we have presented “Shimizu Crafts- man” awards on the anniversary of Shimizu’s founding to foremen who have achieved remark- able results in quality, safety, and environmental activities. In fiscal 2017, 26 foremen received the award, bringing the total number of Shimizu Craftsmen to 253. Excellent foremen who have
types of construction that will experience a busy period. Our purpose in doing so was to build a system of support that can be used should the supply of skilled workers tighten. As of June 2018, 90 employees have taken the skills acquisition course. This will support the acquisition of multi- functional skills in the future to address concerns over the future shortage in skilled workers. It will also improve productivity at job sites and enable workers who wish to continue working to work effectively even as they age.
been named as Shimizu Craftsmen are presented with a Shimizu Craftsman helmet and Craftsman card. We provide an excellent craftsmanship allowance to Craftsman card holders at all job sites in Japan, regardless of whether they have foreman responsibilities or not.

 Shimizu Craftsman
Receives Excellent Foreman Award in Fiscal 2017
 I worked at a job site that had time limitations from working inside an educational facility in addition to the fact that the work was being performed during the busy year-end period. Moreover, the eaves of the steel frame building on each floor were finished with architectural concrete, so it was work that required a high level of accuracy and quality. The Shimizu employees, foremen responsible for other work, and the work- ers worked together during the daily meetings to closely coor- dinate the work. I think that the heartfelt communication and teamwork among everyone is what made such good work amid this environment. We will be happy if the young people with promising futures on the campus are able to see and touch this building and take an interest in construction in the future.
There is a building on a main street that I had a part in con- structing and the craftsmanship evident throughout the building gives me great pride. A formwork carpenter has many things to learn. I would like to continue to improve my own skills in put- ting safety first and pass on those skills to young workers.

    Four Key Measures
1. To eliminate falls from all heights, first mitigate the risk by making sure the job site is safe, then make sure to always use a safety belt. Also conduct regular training on the risk of falls, including hands-on training in use of safety belt equipment and hazardous situations.
2. To eliminate accidents involving heavy equipment and cranes, take comprehensive precautions to prevent contact with vehicle-type construction machinery, prevent crane collapse, prevent three-point heavy equipment from falling over, and prevent runaway of drivable construction machinery.
3. To eliminate the collapse and fall of heavy objects, first confirm stability when handling steel frame, PC, or other heavy materials, then strictly follow the work procedures, and ensure safety in the construc- tion of tunnels.
4. To eliminate fires and accidents that cause damage to infrastructure, make a dedicated effort to use construction methods that do not use flames and take steps to visualize infrastructure in ongoing renovation work, etc.

Business BaseInitiatives in Disaster Recovery
  Striving to Recover from Tsunami Damage Caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake
This describes the progress made on the main recovery projects Shimizu has been working on in the seven years since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 to repair the damage caused by the tsu- nami along the coasts of Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures.
We continue to respond to the needs of these communities through construction work so that those affected by the disaster will have new places to live.
 Raising the Land Elevation in Areas that Were Flooded
We are raising the land elevation in areas that were damaged by flood- ing from the tsunami in the cities of Ishinomaki and Kesennuma in Miyagi Prefecture and Rikuzentakata in Iwate Prefecture. Housing and facili- ties that make life convenient have been built in residential develop- ments that have already been deliv- ered, and we are moving forward with city planning.
A large belt conveyor, which has now been removed, was used to transport soil and sand in the con- struction to raise the land elevation in Rikuzentakata City. This enabled the project to be completed quickly.
Progress on home construction on the deliv- ered development in the Takata district of Rikuzentakata City
Developing a Relocated Area on High Ground
We cleared a hilly area and relo- cated groups of homes on high ground at the same time we raised the land elevation in Ishinomaki and Rikuzentakata cities. We created 49 disaster-resilient shelters on high ground in Ishinomaki City, and deliv- ered the entire housing develop- ment by March 2018.
We also performed construction work on the Sanriku Expressway that runs through the Imaizumi district of Rikuzentakata. This sec- tion of the expressway opened in July 2018.

Building Homes and Public Facilities
In the Shishiori district of Kesen- numa City, in Miyagi Prefecture, we built eight public housing complexes with a total floor area of 23,206 m2 in the delivered development after we completed work on raising the land elevation. The welfare center built at the same time will also be used as an evacuation shelter in the event of a disaster.
In the town of Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefecture, we rebuilt the Togura Elementary School, which was completely destroyed by the tsunami, in a disaster-resilient relo- cation zone on high ground.

Compliance
 Compliance (Corporate Ethics and Compliance with Laws and Regulations)
Code of Conduct and Internal Company Structure
Initiatives to Ensure Compliance with the Antimonopoly Act
Outline of Measures to Prevent Recurrence
  1 Top management will take the lead on cultivating ethical values and working to ensure comprehensive compliance
All officers and employees will faithfully keep the Analects and the Abacus, which contains the basic principles of management, in mind. They will maintain high ethical values, maintain discipline in their own conduct, and lead by example. Executive management will continually endeavor to cultivate ethical values and ensure compliance.
Management will also enlist the cooperation of external experts in their efforts to instill high ethical values in officers and employees.
2 Strengthen compliance through organizational changes
The president will serve as the chairman of the Committee on Corporate Ethics, and the organization shall be under the direct control of the president, with assistance from external experts.
A new Corporate Ethics Office has been established. This office will ensure that everyone is aware of corporate ethics and will strengthen initiatives aimed at ensuring strict compliance by:
• Reorganizing the business structure
• Establishing a new general business headquarters to supervise the Building Construction Headquarters
and the Civil Engineering Headquarters
An officer in charge of compliance will be assigned to the general business headquarters.
The audit function will be strengthened by expanding the size of the Audit Department. Special audits on fair bidding will be performed on the main business projects company-wide.
3 Revise and strictly enforce the Code of Conduct
The existing Code of Conduct for Officers and Employees on Bidding Contracts (hereafter, the “Code of Conduct”), which is based on the compliance program for the Antimonopoly Act, has been revised to clarify the obligation to blow the whistle on violations and the rules on contact with other companies in the same industry. We will continue work to strictly enforce the Code of Conduct.
4 Strengthen compliance checks on specified projects
Checks have been strengthened on projects that pose a high risk of inviting actions that restrict competition because the number of competitors is effectively limited by the degree of technical difficulty, the size of the business, or other such factors.
5 Other measures
We will continue to implement existing measures based on the Code of Conduct. Such measures include a system of checks by department heads, rounds made by the Legal Department to different divisions to provide training and perform audits, and external whistleblowing system, and stricter internal disciplinary measures.
 Code of Corporate Ethics and Conduct
Shimizu has formulated the Code of Ethics and Corporate Conduct and ensures that it is known to all employees, amid the current environment which calls upon companies to recognize their role in society and fulfill their social responsibilities. The purpose of the code is to help all officers and employees better understand how The Analects and the Abacus, which contains the basic management principles of Shimizu, applies to their work on a routine basis to enable them to act in line with the spirit of that code.
Establishing the Internal Company Structure
Shimizu has established a Committee on Corporate Ethics and the internal company structure
100% Attendance of Compliance Training
Compliance training for all employees
Shimizu also achieved a 100% participation rate in the e-learning that we offer to all Shimizu employees in fiscal 2017. Compliance training tailored to the circumstances of each department is also provided in each business department as needed, including the International Division.
Ensuring Strict Compliance at Group Companies as Well
Compliance conferences and other events are held at affiliated companies to align them with the Shimizu Group. A code and structure that aligns with Shimizu’s code and structure are also
necessary for strict, practical compliance with the Code of Corporate Ethics and Conduct by officers and employees.
Shimizu also established an internal whistle- blowing system, and established both internal and external contacts that employees can consult on compliance issues.
The Compliance
established in group companies and compliance training is provided for all employees.
Approximately 3,700 employees of group companies participated in training in fiscal 2017.
Compliance training held for national staff in Singapore
One specific action taken to cultivate awareness of ethical values and strict compliance was the “Learn about the Analects” training held for executive management. Participants deepened their understanding of The Analects and the Abacus and the Analects of Confucius. Shimizu will hold similar training sessions in the future on an ongoing basis.
To strengthen compliance through organizational changes, the Audit Department, which has
strengthened its audit function by expanding the
size of the department, made the rounds to each branch in Japan.
The Corporate Ethics Office and the Legal Department also made the rounds to each branch in Japan to hold training sessions on the revisions to the Code of Conduct and educate employees on how to prevent recurrence and ensure strict compliance.
 Hotline internal whistleblowing system
   Proper Management of Personal Information
 In the construction industry, companies retain personal information on customers, subcontractors, etc., and the personal information of employees obtained in the course of business activities.
Shimizu has established a Privacy Policy. We take the necessary and proper steps to safely manage such information based on the policy,
and properly manage personal information, including the national identification number. We have also revised our rules on the protection of personal information to conform with the revised Act on the Protection of Personal Information enacted in May 2017, and are implementing it appropriately.

Initiatives in CSR Procurement
On March 23, 2018, Shimizu Corporation was indicted for alleged violations of the Antimonopoly Act relating to a bid on a Chuo Shinkansen construction project. Shimizu formulated a Basic Procurement Policy and Things We Request of Our Suppliers to ensure fair and transparent procurement processes. We ask the vendors who make up our supply chain to comply with all laws and regulations on human rights and labor.
In fiscal 2017, we obtained confirmation of understanding from 100% of the vendors for 762 companies nationwide and began transactions with them. We also revised parts of the Things We Request of Our Suppliers in fiscal 2018. This was aimed at eradicating fraud in transactions.
These steps will enable us to implement even stricter compliance with laws and regulations.


Shimizu provides fair and equitable opportunities for competition to suppliers and strives to respond in good faith.
Shimizu complies with laws and regulations, social norms, and internal company rules, and observes sound and fair procurement practices.
Shimizu takes the environment into consideration in its procurement activities, in accordance with the corporate Basic Environmental Policy.
Shimizu works together with suppliers to maintain and improve quality.
Shimizu strives to build good partnerships and to achieve mutual improvement in technical skills, based on a mutual relationship of trust.

In the past, Shimizu has conducted compliance training nationwide for the subcontractors we do business with. From fiscal 2017 onward, we have clearly specified and standardized the topics for compliance training. The purpose of this is to work together with subcontractors to ensure that all measures are implemented rapidly and to improve the effectiveness of compliance measures.
The first compliance training conducted was focused on the eradication of fraudulent transactions and 3,077 people from 2,927 companies nationwide attended the training.
In fiscal 2018, we are conducting compliance training on the topics of compliance, eradicating
fraudulent transactions, labor and employment, and information security.
We will continue to pursue a fair and trans- parent CSR procurement, in cooperation with subcontractors.

Ecological Mission 2030-2050
As the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) formulated by the United Nations in 2015 are drawing interest, Shimizu is working on the activities outlined in our Ecological Mission 2030-2050, which is aimed at achieving Goal 13 (Climate Action). We think that reducing the CO2 emissions from our own business through construction and office activities (Scope 1/2) and reducing the CO2 emissions from customers through the operation of buildings we have designed and built (Scope 3) are especially important, and we have established KPI for reduction activities and are working toward them.

Medium & Long-term Goals
We convened a construction working group and began activities aimed at achieving our goals for reducing CO2 emissions from construction sites.
About 70% of CO2 emissions from construction sites is said to come from the combustion of diesel fuel in heavy equipment used in construction. The working group interviewed construction equip- ment manufacturers and others to compare the fuel costs for the old equipment to the new types equipment that meet the latest standards and confirm the pace at which Shimizu should switch to the latest equipment. We will reference this information in future CO2 reduction activities.

Initiatives at Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings
The use of lumber from certified forests has mainly been limited to use for printing paper up to this point. Recently, however, major distribu- tors and manufacturing companies have also begun to use products from certified forests. At Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings, we use FSC certified materials for our original wooden kino style products that are used in com- memorative furniture presented to customers upon completion of a project and gifts of appre- ciation given to shareholders, which contributes

Pollution Prevention
Preventing deterioration of the neighboring living environment and protecting the health and preventing exposure of employees and workers to asbestos is a major social issue. Shimizu therefore con- ducts special training on asbestos on an ongoing basis.
The entire company also works to render the PCB waste Shimizu owns harmless (through a subcontractor), to properly manage industrial waste from products containing mercury, and to prevent pollution from construction wastewater.

In the future, we will expand the certified products we handle and will establish a supply chain of certified forest products for all products made by Tokyo Mokkoujou Arts & Crafts Furnishings, and promote more activities that protect the forests by using the trees.

  Kyobashi Wildlife Day
Shimizu is a member of the Japan Business Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB). Corporate members of JBIB all hold wildlife observation events in the green areas of each company at the same time. We hold the Wildlife Days event to make biodiversity a mainstream concept by joining together to spread the news. Sixteen companies and over 2,400 people participated in this event.
On May 22, which is International Day for Bio- logical Diversity, Shimizu teamed up with the Daiichi Life Group, one of our customers, and held the Kyobashi Wildlife Day event in Tokyo Square Garden, an outdoor garden in Kyobashi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, as part of that effort. A total of 25 employees from the two companies assisted with
the activities, which included observing wildlife, playing field bingo, and trying out beekeeping.
We have set our sights on expanding this beyond employees and customers to city residents in the future, and will provide activities to educate people about biodiversity.

Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 61

This project was ordered as a design & build project, meaning that the customer placed one order for both design and construction of the halls. This project required Shimizu take the fact that these are facilities related to the Olympics and Paralympics that will be removed after they have been used for about 10 years into consideration in proposing the technology. We therefore proposed an ecological, environmentally friendly buildings that can be recycled and the proposal was accepted. This involved considerations such as minimizing the impact on the environment during construction to build the new halls and when eventually dismantling them.
In fiscal 2017, Shimizu received the Prime Minister’s Award for distinguished service in promoting the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle), which is sponsored by the 3R SUISHINKYOGIKAI in this project, This was the first such award of distinction for Shimizu.
Award ceremony
    The theme which received the award was “Building 100% recyclable exhibit halls that are easily removable.”
During construction we used pile head ring sockets (developed at the Institute of Technology), which made the use of footing beams unnecessary in the entire foundation. We used steel pipe piling because they would be removed in the future and reused. A pure steel frame was used for the upper structure. Double folded plate was used for the roof, and ALC for the exterior walls. We received the award because all of these materials could be recycled.
Shimizu also received 3R SUISHINKYOGIKAI Chairman’s Awards for the following projects in fiscal 2017: Plans for the Nomura Building in Yokohama, construction site redevelopment on the west side of Kyobashi 2-chome, new construction site for a redevelopment project to the west of the north exit from Tachikawa Station, construction to improve the ground for the smokestack foundation at the Soma thermal power plant.
ECO First Certification
Shimizu obtained ECO First certification from the Minister of the Environment on August 7, 2018 for our pledge to work on our own initiatives in environmental protection.
Shimizu’s ECO First pledge covers the main goals for fiscal 2030, which include measures to combat global warming, effective use of resources, and initiatives in biodiversity.
In the future, we will enlist the entire company in promoting these initiatives and fulfilling our pledge.
 
Shimizu has been holding forums on the promoting the advancement of women since fiscal 2013. The goal of these forums is to encourage a sense of participation in initiatives to promote the advancement of women among women employees.
Changing the Mindset of Managers
It is essential to change the mindset of managers in order to promote diversity. Shimizu joined the Iku-Boss Corporate Alliance in December 2015 and has been developing Iku-Bosses since then.
We have held Iku-Boss seminars since fiscal 2016. Lively discussions take place during these seminars on the theme of workstyle reform aimed
Around 300 women from locations throughout Japan and overseas participate each year and top management and other officers also participate. The forum was held outside of corporate head- quarters for the first time in fiscal 2017.
at creating a workplace that makes it easy for anyone to work there.
We have also been presenting Iku-Boss Awards since fiscal 2015 and share good examples of Iku-Bosses internally. Twelve people have received the Gold Iku-Boss Award, which is the top award, thus far.
 Workplaces Supportive of All Employees
Comprehensive Disaster Drills that Include Employees with Disabilities
  In fiscal 2017, we began conducting comprehensive disaster drills to ensure the same level of safety for all employees, during a fire, earthquake, or other disaster, regardless of whether a person has a disability or not.
Roughly 50 employees at headquarters participated. Participants included employees with dis- abilities and supporters to assist them. They confirmed evacuation routes and performed a roll call. After the drill, they also experienced the smoke that occurs during a fire and experienced an earthquake in an earthquake simulation truck.
Initiatives in Human Rights
Shimizu actively promotes educational activities on human rights based on the principle of being a company that values people as set forth in the Code of Corporate Ethics and Conduct and the Basic Human Rights Policy. During fiscal 2017, we conducted grade-level seminars and e-learning on the themes of LGBT individuals, people with disabilities, and preventing harassment through the abuse of power, based on the basic policies
Participants commented that it made them aware of the need to think about evacuation for people with disabilities and the means for assist- ing them, and gave them a fresh awareness of the importance
of support.
Comprehensive disaster drill
formulated by the company-wide Human Rights Education Promotion Committee. We also hold ongoing seminars for leaders who promote human rights in each division and affiliate to increase the level of awareness.
In December every year, we present awards for human rights educational slogans solicited from employees, their families, and affiliated companies to increase awareness.

We have enlisted the entire company at Shimizu in working as a team to achieve workstyle reform. The purpose of this is to create a workplace in which all employees who work there can fully demonstrate the abilities they possess in a shorter amount of time, and to improve the attractiveness of the construction industry.

Message from the President
We are communicating the corporate vision that Shimizu aspires to and the determination and need for working as a unified team on workstyle reform to employees through messages from the president, informal receptions with the president, and other means on an ongoing basis.

Portal Site Dedicated to Workstyle Reform at Shimizu Established
Shimizu launched a portal site on the Internet dedicated to work- style reform in December 2017.
The site visualizes the initiatives that each division and depart- ment is working on. By sharing information, we are working to build awareness of working as a single company-wide team to reform workstyles. We also conduct regular surveys to solicit employee opinions and solicit suggestions on how to improve operations. These are incorporated in new Workstyle Reform steps taken.

Introduction of a Pilot Work-from-Home Program
Shimizu introduced a pilot work-from-home pro- gram in May 2018.
Due to advances in information and communica- tions technology (ICT), we are now able to estab- lish an environment that makes new workstyles possible without limitations on time or location. Feeling the need to think dynamically, we took the bold step of introducing a pilot program that is not limited to a specific division or type of work.
Achieving Flexibility in Work Hours
Shimizu has introduced a flextime system. We reduced the core time period and employees are now also able to use this system for doctors visits for illness or injury, in addition to caring for chil- dren and families members, since May of this year. We are also promoting highly productive, efficient workstyles by making it possible for employees to take their annual vacation time in hourly increments and choose the workstyle that best suits them individually.

Benefits Anticipated from Working at Home
1. It will establish an approach to work that takes the productivity per unit of time into consideration.
2. There will be a concerted effort to take inventory of work and visualize progress on work by managers and subordinates.
3. It will improve work-life balance by enabling employees to work while also caring for children or family members.
4. It will enhance BCP response.

Shimizu fulfills its social responsibilities through its business activities, based on the Analects and the Abacus, which contains the basic principles by which the company is managed. By doing so, we aim to manage the company
in a highly expeditious, efficient, and transparent manner to earn greater trust in the company from stakeholders while also achieving sustainable growth and increasing corporate value over the medium and long-term.

Company with an Audit & Supervisory Board
     The company increases the trust that sharehold- ers and investors as well as customers, employ- ees, local communities, and other stakeholders have in Shimizu by fulfilling its social responsibili- ties through business activities, based on the basic principles contained in The Analects and the Abacus. Shimizu also aims to manage the company in an expeditious, efficient, highly trans- parent, and lawful manner to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value over the medium and long-term.
To be specific, we have introduced an execu- tive officer system and limited the board of directors to a small number of directors (cur- rently 11 directors, with the maximum number allowable being 12 directors). We have sepa- rated the functions of decision-making on man- agement strategy and management oversight from the function of business execution by
appointing two external directors (one of whom is female), and other means. Three members of the five-member Audit & Supervisory Board are external members who are independent officers under the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. They supervise management of the company from an objective, neutral perspective.
Shimizu has also established an Audit Depart- ment to perform internal audits of all operating division activities. The Audit Department reports the results of audits performed according to audit plans approved by the Board of Directors to the representative directors, audit & supervisory board members, and accounting auditor as appropriate.
Shimizu has established the Basic Policy on Establishment of Internal Controls to clearly specify the system for ensuring proper conduct of business, and this policy is revised by the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

I am now in my sixth year as an external director of Shimizu Corporation. In regard to operation of the Board of Directors, I feel that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has improved during this time due to more energetic debate on many topics, including the medium to long-term management of the company, under the direction of Chairman Miyamoto. I also receive clear explanation of individual agenda items before each Board of Directors meeting, conduct my own research and examination, and contribute to the discussion of items at Board of Directors meeting. One of Shimizu’s characteristics is that it also actively implements IR activities to communicate with both institutional and individual investors in Japan and overseas. It impresses me as a company that places importance on its stakeholders.
The role required of me as an external director is to utilize my experience in the formulation of national and corporate plans and on domestic and foreign finance and lending to manage the risks of individual proposals, including new businesses. I also believe that it is my role to provide advice on medium to long-term management issues and the future vision for Shimizu and the construction industry. When I provide such advice, I think it is important to provide advice and supervision from three perspectives: By looking at issues from a bird’s eye view of the macro perspective, by looking at them from the ground- level perspective of the frontlines and stakeholders, and by looking at them from a below-the-surface perspective of trends in society and the market.
Shimizu is one of the leading, long-established companies in Japan with consistent management prin- ciples. Shimizu’s strengths lie in its technological capabilities and its innovativeness. The company will need to make full use of these strengths in responding to changing social and economic conditions in the future. I look forward to Shimizu’s continued contributions as it provides new value to communities and customers through physical initiatives in monozukuri (craftsmanship), community development, and development of Japan that embody the corporate slogan of “Today’s Work, Tomorrow’s Heritage.”

Three years have passed since I became an external director for Shimizu. I feel that discussions at the Board of Directors meetings each year have been energetic and frank. Regular reports are also pre- sented on the core construction business as well as all other businesses, such as investment develop- ment, LCV, and engineering. These reports are valuable in understanding the details of these businesses and I am satisfied with the advance explanations I receive on agenda items and other elements of the support structure.
Thus far, I personally have been mainly involved in work on topics such as labor, insurance and ben- efits, and the long-term care insurance field, as well as work-life balance, promoting the advancement of women, and measures to prevent harassment. I look forward to using the knowledge, personal connections, and experience I have gained through those careers to advise Shimizu on management in the future as well.
Recently, the company has been particularly focused on workstyle reform and promoting the advancement of women as management strategies. To achieve that, it is important for Shimizu to keep the productivity per hour of each employee in mind in proceeding with workstyle reform, to continually revise operations, including organization-wide processes, and to improve the quality of organizational management.
President Inoue has repeatedly stated these perspectives in his messages to Shimizu employees, and I would like to see the company make further progress on establishing an environment and structure that enable a diverse range of human resources to demonstrate their capabilities and work enthusiastically.

Today, globalization has progressed to the extent that it can be said there are no national boundaries and the actions that companies must take to survive are proliferating. It is increasingly important to have an unwavering North Pole for both management and employees in such an environment. This is why they must always take the teachings of Eiichi Shibusawa in The Analects and the Abacus, which contains the basic principles by which Shimizu manages its business, to heart. That spirit exhorts us to walk with the weak, think about future generations, and put work in communities and the world that we can truly be proud of first, rather than focusing on immediate profit. Shimizu does this through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by world leaders at a United Nations summit. To achieve that, it is important for everyone to be able to speak freely and in a friendly manner. That deeply impressed me as being something that I should take the lead on as an external audit & supervisory board member.

As a person who is involved in corporate management to some extent, I focus the system of internal controls that will ensure proper management of the business through risk management, compliance, and other means, from the perspective of preventing a loss of corporate value from unforeseen events. I rec- ognize that the management of Shimizu are building a proper system of internal controls. As a full-time external audit and supervisory board member, I want to confirm that discrepancies do not arise between the views of management and the understanding of the locations and frontlines spread throughout Japan and overseas so that the internal controls function effectively. Shimizu has a good corporate culture in which all employees follow the teachings of Eiichi Shibusawa contained in The Analects and the Abacus, which talks about the compatibility of economic activity and ethics. I would like to see Shimizu take risks that are appropriate in light of this culture and will lead to further enhancement of corporate value.

At Shimizu, management makes an effort to ensure that everyone in the company shares a common understanding. Information is also actively shared with external audit & supervisory board members by providing them with information on internal and external operations and answering questions. As an external audit & supervisory board member, I have the mandate of shareholders. I think that I was able to audit the performance of duties by directors and other officers to ensure that these duties were carried out appropriately, and that I was able to properly audit the performance of duties in regard to the mate- rial impact of events on the company for the various stakeholders. I also think that Shimizu’s standards for audits by auditors, rules on the audit & supervisory board, and record of prior audits show that audits have been appropriate for the company’s long tradition in light of the social demands of each age.
Today, as major changes are occurring in society, I would like to contribute to ensuring strict compli- ance in the future and to even better management of the company based on flexible, sustainable governance.

Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 has
employed creativity in boosting its message by maintaining a two-phased structure of using the concept of a Smart Solutions Company to talk about corporate principles and strategy in the first half, and reporting on the business base that will support this in the second half.
The beginning hit forcefully on the concept of pursuing growth through the sustainability of com- munities and structures, as it did last year. By first looking back over the company’s long history and reaffirming faithful craftsmanship, the spirit of inno- vation, and The Analects and the Abacus as the DNA that forms the strengths of the company, you revealed the immutable founding principles that have run through everything you have done up to today. The president’s message then added the perspective of the long-term vision of where you plan to go, based on the Midterm Management Plan, to this. Weaving the past and the future together resulted in the specification of three key areas (safe, secure communities; comfortable, smart communities; and sustainable, environmen- tally friendly communities) as fields that Shimizu will manifest its strengths in. The new perspective of SDGs was incorporated and top management voiced the importance of understanding these as business opportunities, rather than simply respond- ing to the demands of society. The structure of concretely illustrating the development with exam- ples of projects in these three key areas makes it an excellent message. I think the contents of that mes- sage did a superb job of communicating the sce- narios for creating value in the series of initiatives.
In light of this, after reviewing Initiatives in Each Area at the outset from the perspective of concrete results, commercialization, and achieving stable revenues in each business, you also incorporated
the opinions of those who were in charge of the various projects in introducing them. Clearly, the main focus in this part appears to be on demon- strating the competitiveness of Shimizu through an extensive track record and full pipeline (including projects currently underway and frontier develop- ment with an eye toward the future). However, I think that it simultaneously serves the function of providing raw material to the reader for thinking about what elements support competitiveness. That is because touching on information such as the story of growth in the real estate business, the wide variety of engineering solutions, and the concept of expandability in the life cycle business enables readers to sense that the focal point lies in having the technological capabilities and human resources to support this. When read from this perspective, the contents of this part are highly interesting because they suggest the elements that support sustainability of the business model.
As I mentioned in regard to the previous issue, what I would to see in the next issue is this type of connection of the first half with a second half that explains the business base from multiple perspec- tives. Because the topics range far and wide, it unfortunately can become increasingly difficult to see the connection to the clear storyline in the first half as one reads through the second half.
In regard to this point, I think there is value in giving some thought to trying to position the strengths in human resources and technology, which are mentioned as the sources of competitiveness in Initiatives in Each Area, in the business base at the same level as compliance, for example.
Positioning the technology strategy and human resources strategy, which integrates diversity & inclusion and work-life balance, into the business base would create a flow of explaining the strengths and long-term business strategy of Shimizu in the first half and the elements that support these in the second half. I think that this would make the story more cohesive and suggest considering it.
I expect this report to evolve further as Shimizu plans to revise its long-term vision and midterm management plan next fiscal year.

The following is an English translation of an independent assurance report prepared in Japanese and is for information and reference purposes only. In the event of a discrepancy between the Japanese and English versions, the Japanese
version will prevail.
Independent Assurance Report
July 25, 2018
We, Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, have been commissioned by SHIMIZU CORPORATION (hereafter the “Company”) and has carried out a limited assurance engagement on the Key Sustainability Performance Indicators (hereafter the “Indicators”) of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2018 as included in the Company’s Ecological Mission 2030-2050 section of the Shimizu Corporate Report 2018 (hereafter the “Report”). The scope of our assurance procedures was limited to the Indicators marked with the symbol “   ” in the Report.
1. The Company’s Responsibilities
The Company is responsible for preparing the Indicators in accordance with the Company’s own criteria, that it determined with consider- ation of Japanese environmental regulations as presented in 2018, 2.Ecological Missions 2030-2050, 2.1. Estimation Standards (https:// www.shimz.co.jp/company/csr/environment/pdf/data_2018.pdf) of the Report. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are estimated using emissions factors, which are subject to scientific and estimation uncertainties given different instruments for measuring GHG emissions may vary in characteristics, in terms of functions and assumed parameters.
2. Our Independence and Quality Control
We have met the independence requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Stan- dards Board for Accountants in January 2017, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectiveness, professional com- petence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior.
In addition, we maintain a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures for compliance with ethi- cal rules, professional standards, and applicable laws and regulations in accordance with the International Standard on Quality Control 1 issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in April 2009.
3. Our responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators included in the Report based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements: Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information - (“ISAE 3000”) (Revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in December 2013, Practical Guidelines for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, revised in December 2014 by the Japanese Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information and, with respect of GHG emis- sions, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“ISAE 3410”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Stan- dards Board in June 2012. The procedures, which we have performed according to our professional judgment, include inquiries, document inspection, analytical procedures, reconciliation between source documents and Indicators in the Report, as well as the following:
• Making inquiries regarding the Company’s own criteria that it determined with consideration of Japanese environmental regulations, and evaluating the appropriateness thereof;
• Inspecting relevant documents with regard to the design of the Company’s internal controls related to the Indicators, and inquiring of personnel responsible thereof at the Company and 1site visited ;
• Performing analytical procedures concerning the Indicators at the Company and 1site visited; and
• Testing, on a sample basis, underlying source information and conducting relevant re-calculations at the Company and 1site visited. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are more limited in nature, timing and extent than a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than would have been obtained if we had performed a reasonable assurance engagement.
4. Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators included in the Report have not been measured and reported in accordance with the Company’s own criteria that it determined with con- sideration of Japanese environmental regulations.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Shimizu Corporation and its subsidiaries
1. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the accounts maintained by Shimizu Corporation (the “Corporation”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “Group”) prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are differ- ent in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Corporation as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan.
2. U.S. Dollar Amounts
The accounts of consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying con- solidated financial statements and notes thereto have been translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥106.31 to U.S.$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2018, and have been then rounded down to the nearest thousand. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate.
3. Principles of Consolidation
1) Scope of Consolidation
The Corporation had 65 subsidiaries as at March 31, 2018. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018 include the accounts of the Corporation and all subsidiaries.
The Corporation had 14 affiliates as at March 31, 2018. As at March 31, 2018, the equity method was applied to all affiliates.
2) Financial Statements of Subsidiaries
The financial year-end for 16 overseas subsidiaries and 2 domestic subsidiaries is December 31, and the financial year-end for one domestic subsidiary is March 26.
Consolidation of these subsidiaries is therefore performed by using their financial statements as at December 31 and March 26, respectively, and certain adjustments are made to reflect any sig- nificant transactions during the period from year-end balance sheet dates for these subsidiaries to March 31.
3) Amortization of Goodwill
Goodwill is principally amortized over a five-year period on a straight-line basis from the year of ac- quisition.
4) Elimination of Unrealized Intercompany Profits
All significant unrealized intercompany profits included in assets such as “Costs on uncompleted construction contracts” among the Group has been eliminated on consolidation and the portion thereof attributable to non-controlling interests is reported as “Non-controlling Interests.”
In connection with the elimination of unrealized intercompany profits, the depreciation expense is also adjusted to eliminate any profit from the cost of assets purchased through intercompany transactions.
4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
1) Valuation of Securities
The Group classifies securities into two different categories, held-to-maturity debt securities and other securities. The Group holds no trading securities. Held-to-maturity debt securities are valued at amortized cost. Other securities with market quotations are valued at the prevailing market price as at the balance sheet date. Other securities without market quotations are stated at cost, cost being determined by the moving average method. Net unrealized gains on other securities with market quotations are reported net of taxes as a separated component of “Net Assets” and the cost of sales is determined by the moving average method.
2) Valuation of Inventories
Real estate for sale: At cost on an individual basis (The carrying value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for decline in earnings.)
Costs on uncompleted construction contracts: At cost on an individual basis
Costs on uncompleted real estate development projects: At cost on an individual basis (The carry- ing value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for de- cline in earnings.)
PFI projects and other inventories: At cost on an individual basis or at cost, cost being determined by the moving average method (The carrying value of inventories on the balance sheet is presented at book value after write-down for decline in earnings.)
3) Depreciation Method for Tangible Fixed Assets
Depreciation for tangible fixed assets (excluding leased assets) is computed by the declining bal- ance method, at rates based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Some subsidiaries use the straight-line method.
4) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
For receivables classified as “normal,” the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on a historical default ratio. For receivables classified as “doubtful” or “bankrupt,” the allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on individual assessment on the probability of collection.
5) Warranty Reserve
An allowance to cover the costs of repairs for damages related to completed construction work for which the Group is responsible is provided based on previous warranty experience.
6) Reserve for Expected Losses on Construction Contracts in Process
An allowance is provided for estimated future losses related to the construction contracts in process.
7) Reserve for Expected Losses Related to the Anti-Monopoly Act
An allowance is provided for an estimated amount of payment of penalties, etc., under the Anti- monopoly Act.
8) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits
Net defined benefit liability has been recorded mainly at the amount calculated based on the pro- jected benefit obligation and the fair value of the plan assets as at the balance sheet date.
Method of attributing the projected benefit obligations to periods of service: Benefit formula basis Method used for amortization of actuarial gain or loss: Straight-line method (10 years - amortized from the following financial year)
Method used for amortization of prior service cost: Straight-line method (10 years)
Adoption of simplified methods in the Group: Some consolidated subsidiaries apply a simplified
method to compute their net defined benefit liability and retirement benefit expenses.
9) Accounting for Hedging
Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted by using the deferral method of ac- counting. With regard to some interest rate swaps which meet certain requirements, the Group uses the special treatment, based on the short-cut method, assuming that there is no ineffective- ness in the hedging relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments.
Hedging instruments: Derivative transactions (interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts) Hedged items: Assets and liabilities which are exposed to interest and foreign exchange market
fluctuation risks
Hedging policy: Derivative transactions are used solely for hedging the risks associated with existing
or future assets and liabilities.
Derivative transactions are never entered into for the purpose of trading or speculation.
10) Recognizing Revenues and Costs of Construction Contracts
Revenues and costs of construction contracts, of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated, are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated based on the cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method is applied to all other construction contracts.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
11) Consumption Taxes
Consumption taxes payable or receivable are excluded from each account in the consolidated statements of income.
12) Foreign Currency Translation
The balance sheet of overseas subsidiaries is translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date except for shareholders’ equity which is translated at historical rates. The revenues and expenses of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising from such translations are shown as “Foreign currency translation adjustments” and are included in “Net Assets.”
13) Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, bank deposits payable on demand, and time deposits, which are readily convertible into cash and subject to minor risks of fluctuations in value.
14) Income Taxes
Income taxes of the Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries consist of corporate income taxes, local inhabitants’ taxes and enterprise taxes.
The Corporation and its domestic subsidiaries account for deferred taxes in accordance with the regulations for preparation of consolidated financial statements in Japan. Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and those as reported in the financial statements.
In addition, the consolidated overseas subsidiaries provide for deferred income taxes relating to temporary differences between reporting for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with ac- counting principles generally accepted in the relevant countries.
15) Accounting Standards issued but not yet effective
(1) Summary
On March 30, 2018, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) issued “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29) and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30). The accounting standard provides a comprehensive framework for recognising revenue from contracts with customers.
(2) Scheduled effective date
The Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries expect to apply the accounting standard from the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2021.
(3) The effects of applying accounting standard
At present, the Corporation and consolidated subsidiaries are in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard.
5. Notes to Consolidated Balance Sheet
1) Revaluation Reserve for Land
According to the Land Revaluation Law enacted on March 31, 1998, land used for business and owned by the Corporation was revalued on March 31, 2002 and an unrealized gain from the revalu- ation of land was reported as “Revaluation reserve for land, net of taxes” as a separate component of “Net Assets” and the relevant deferred tax liabilities were reported as “Deferred tax liabilities for revaluation reserve for land” as a separate component of “Non-Current Liabilities.”
Such revaluation was allowed only at one specific time under the Law and cannot be undertaken at each financial year-end.
According to the enforcement ordinance of the Law, there are several methods allowed to deter- mine the revalued amount of land. The Corporation adopted a method of using the assessed value for property taxes with appropriate adjustments.
2) Assets Pledged as Collateral
The following assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings at affiliated companies and others.

1) Overview
(1) Policy for financial instruments
The Group raises operating funds primarily through bank borrowings and bond issues. Temporary fund surpluses are managed principally through short-term deposits with little risk. Under the Group’s policy, the Group uses derivatives only for the purpose of reducing risks by hedge, and not for speculative purposes.
(2) Types of financial instruments, risk and risk management
Regarding credit risk associated with customer’s operating receivables such as notes receivable and accounts receivable from construction contracts, the Group appropriately reduces such risk in response to the payment conditions and customer’s credit situation.
Regarding investment securities held primarily for the purpose of maintaining business relation- ships, the Group comprehensively takes into account the benefits to the Corporation, acquisition value and stock price fluctuation risk, etc., judges whether or not to acquire these, and reconsiders the purpose of holding acquisitions from the same viewpoint each year.
Regarding volatility risk of foreign exchange rates and interest rates, the Group conducts market risk management in line with its risk management rules for volatility in financial markets.
The Group manages liquidity risk associated with raising funds by appropriately planning fund raising based on a three-month cash flow projection prepared monthly and the fiscal year’s cash flow projection. (3) Supplementary explanation on fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is based on market value or reasonable estimate if there is no market value. Since certain assumptions are used for estimating values, values could be different if different assumptions are applied. In addition, the derivative contract amounts described in “De- rivatives” (Note 12) are not indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions.

(1) Cash, (3) Marketable securities, (5) Notes and accounts payable—trade, (6) Short-term borrowings
The Corporation uses carrying value for these amounts because they will be settled in the short term, meaning that carrying value approximate fair value.
(2) Notes and accounts receivable—trade
By receivables with separate fixed terms, the fair value is calculated by applying a discount rate determined taking into account the term of collection and the credit risk.
(4) Investment securities
The fair value of stocks is determined based on the stock market price and the fair value of bonds is determined based on the stock market price or prices quoted by financial institutions. Among “Investment securities,” non-listed shares, etc. (¥46,602 million ($438,368 thousand) in the consolidated balance sheets as at March 31, 2018 (¥40,942 million as at March 31, 2017) ) are not included in the above because determining the fair value for them is extremely difficult.
(7) Bonds payable and current portion of bonds payable, (8) Convertible bond-type bonds with subscription rights to shares The fair value of the bonds issued by the Corporation is based on the prevailing market price.
(9) Non-recourse bonds payable and current portion of non-recourse bonds payable
Carrying value is used as fair value as there is a variable interest rate and the value is reviewed on a short term basis to reflect the market interest rate, meaning that carrying value approximate fair value.
(10) Long-term borrowings, (11) Non-recourse borrowings and current portion of non-recourse borrowings
The fair value of long-term borrowings and non-recourse borrowings are estimated by applying a discount rate to be applied to the total of principal and interest if a similar new borrowings agreement would be entered into. Some long-term borrow- ings and non-recourse borrowings are subject to special treatment of interest rate swap, and these are calculated by apply- ing a discount rate to be applied to the total principal and interest with the consideration of the underlying interest rate swap if a similar new borrowings agreement would be entered into.
(12) Derivative transactions
The fair value of derivative transactions is valued from prices quoted by financial institutions.

16. Segment Information
1) Segment Information
(1) Overview of Reportable Segment
The Group is engaged in construction, real estate development and other related businesses. Construction business and real estate business both operated by the Corporation are the main businesses of the Group. Construction business of the Corporation is operated by branches, etc. located in various regions. Real estate business of the Corporation, which involves development, rental and sales, is operated by the Investment and Development Division. The Board of Directors regularly reviews the management and operating results. Therefore, based on the aggregate criteria and the quantitative criteria, “Construction business of the Corporation,” which consists of branch- es of the Corporation, and “Real estate business of the Corporation,” conducted by the Investment and Development Division, are deemed to be the two reportable segments of the Group.
(2) Detail of the method used to calculate net sales, profit or loss, assets and liabilities by report-
able segment
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are mostly the same as those in “4. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” However, segment profit does not include provision and reversal amounts of reserves and allowances which are included in the consolidated financial statements.  Intersegment transactions are based on arm’s length price.

 21. Asset Retirement Obligations
In accordance with Article 92, Paragraph 2 of “Regulation for Consolidated Financial Statements” the amount of asset retirement obligations as at April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 has not been presented because it represented less than 1% of total liabilities and net assets on the consolidat- ed balance sheets.
The Board of Directors Shimizu Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Shimizu Corporation and its consolidated subsidiar- ies, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at March 31, 2018, and the consolidated statements of income, com- prehensive income, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, all expressed in Japanese yen.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accor- dance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for designing and operating such internal control as man- agement determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Those standards require that we plan and per- form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. The purpose of an audit of the consolidated financial statements is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control, but in making these risk assessments the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presenta- tion of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting es- timates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidat- ed financial position of Shimizu Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries as at March 31, 2018, and their consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.
Convenience Translation
We have reviewed the translation of these consolidated financial statements into U.S. dollars, presented for the convenience of readers, and, in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been properly translated on the basis described in Note 2.

Contributing to the Realization of Sustainable Global Communities
Shimizu creates sustainable energy through its EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) business and management of renewable energy facilities.
Solar, wind power, biomass, geothermal, small to medium-sized hydro- electric power, and other types of renewable energy are promising and diverse types of energy that do not use fossil fuel resources which are being depleted, and can prevent global warming while also ensuring energy security. The introduction of renewable energy also contributes to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Accord, which was effected in 2016.
Shimizu is aiming to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastruc- ture), and 13 (Climate Action) and is contributing to the realization of environmentally friendly, sustainable communities by developing tech- nology, accumulating expertise through demonstration projects, and working to develop mega solar and other businesses.

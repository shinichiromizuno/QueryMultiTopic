45 Shimizu Corporate Report 2019TOPICS—DecarbonizationInitiatives as an Eco-first Company
In August 2018, Shimizu obtained certification under the Eco-First system. We pledged to Japan’s Ministery of the Environment that we will implement environmental conservation activities. Shimizu’s Eco-first pledge took the form of fiscal 2030 goals to combat global warming, use re- sources effectively, and protect biodiversity.
In FY2018, we planned specific initiatives to our goals for FY2030, in particular our goal for CO2 reduction. We examined proliferation rates, cost, and other factors, and communi- cated these through internal PR, and dialogues with external stakeholders, including discus- sions on setting SBT*1 goals.
*1 SBT: Science Based Targets. Sponsored by the NGO Science Based Targets, this initiative requires setting scientifically-grounded goals aimed at keeping global warming to 2°C or below through 2100.

Revision of Basic Environmental Policy
Shimizu revised its Basic Environmental Policy in May 2019.
The policy will apply to the entire Shimizu Group. It establishes goals for contributing to the achievement of SDGs, preventing global warming, resource conservation and reuse, and preserving biodiversity. The policy contains measures to achieve those goals. The specific initiatives are explained on the following pages.

While we achieved a reduction in emissions density (t-CO2/construction work completed) at job sites, the construction work completed for the entire company increased, so the CO2 emissions volume also increased. We will strengthen the following initiatives from next fiscal year, and work to further reduce the volume of CO2 emissions during construction.

Measures Aimed at Preventing Global Warming
We are implementing the following measures aimed at preventing global warming: (1) Using electric power generated from renewable energy (RE)
(2) Shifting from fuel oil to electric power
(3) Using heavy machinery equipped with hybrid engines and an auto idling stop function We support GREEN OIL JAPAN*3 and will conduct a joint trial with Euglena Co., Ltd. on using next-generation biodiesel fuel (BDF) in cranes at select job sites
in the Greater Tokyo Area and in shuttle buses at the Institute of Technology in FY2019.

TOPICS—BiodiversityTOPICS—Natural Resource / PollutionSupporting Our Customer`s Biodiversity Preservation Activities
Morioka Seiko Instruments Inc., a subsidiary of Seiko Instruments Inc., has its Grand Seiko and other manufacturing locations in Shizukuishi, Iwate Prefecture. Woodlands, covering approximately 2 hectares, have existed on the company premises since it was founded in 1970. Since 2012, Seiko Instruments Inc. has used these woodlands for nature observation by employees as part of its biodiversity preservation activities.
Shimizu has utilized our biodiversity preservation technology to provide technical support for preserving biodiversity in these woodlands. Examples of the support provided include monitoring biodiversity and forest management, creating grassy habitats for various kinds of wildlife, and installing birdhouses for small birds.
These activities resulted in the acquisition of the first factory-version “business innovation in harmony with nature and community” ABINC certification* in Japan by Morioka Seiko Instruments Inc. in 2015. In 2016, the company received the ABINC special prize for ABINC-certified companies that implement business initiatives that are particularly outstanding. The Ebine (Calanthe discolor) plant, which was includ- ed in the Iwate Prefecture Red List of rare wildlife and plant life, was discovered there in 2017, and steady improvement in biodiversity has been confirmed.
Shimizu will continue this technical support, and will also extend support to many biodiversity preservation activities by customers in the future.
* The Association for Business Innovation in harmony with Nature and Community (ABINC) awards certifications to companies deemed to have excellent initiatives in the creation and preservation of biodiversity.

Environmental Pollution Prevention
As demolition and renovation work increases, environmental pollution from asbestos is becoming a major problem. Shimizu provides ongoing special training on asbestos. In FY2018, we conducted training sessions at branches nationwide on the removal of fin- ishing compounds that contain asbestos for Shimizu employees and subcontractors.
We also provided training in response to the revised Soil Contamination Counter- measures Act. The entire company is working as one team to prevent environmental pollution.
Study sessions on finishing compounds containing asbestos held for the entire company

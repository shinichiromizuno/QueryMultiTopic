This report covers the SANYO DENKI Group including its 18 consolidated subsidiaries (as of March 31, 2020).

        Message from Chairman Message from President
                              Since April 2016, the SANYO DENKI Group has been engaged in the five-year 8th Mid-term Management Plan, and fiscal 2020 marks its final year.
This plan is focused on the following four themes:
1. Continue to develop world-leading products in terms of quality, performance, and reliability;
2. Establish a "borderless" sales system in which all group companies operate under the same management policy to deliver high and uniform quality products and services to customers around the world;
3. Manage all information in real time to make all the latest business information available from anywhere in the world; and
4. Build factory automation to improve production efficiency and quality as well as reduce inventory and improve production management.
All of these themes are reaching their final stages. For the "factory automation" theme, many
automation lines have been completed during this
fiscal year, including the assembly process lines for cooling fans and servo amplifiers at Fujiyama Works. In addition, we have started new attempts to run product design and production lines simultaneously.
At the factory in the Philippines, Technology Center started full-scale operations, significantly contributing to the development of new products and the improvement of production technology in the Philippines. In addition, the Technology Center in Japan is constructing a new building to further strengthen product development capabilities. We are aiming to open it in May 2021.
Regarding our sales activities, a new group company in Tianjin, China, SANYO DENKI (Tianjin) CO., LTD. opened as the 24th international group site in April 2019. Together with the Beijing branch office, we are expanding our sales and services to customers in the north and north-east regions of China.
We look forward to your continued support.

    Operating Results by Business Segment
We aim for manufacturing carried out side by side with customers
The SANYO DENKI Group develops five businesses: Cooling Systems, Power Systems, Servo Systems, Electrical Equipment Sales, and Electrical Works Contracting.
                      Cooling Systems Business
San Ace is a SANYO DENKI brand name for Cooling Systems products, such as cooling fans and cooling fan units.
In fiscal 2019, demand for
servers and ICT equipment was strong. In addition, demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and control equipment increased. On the other hand, demand for factory automation such as robots remained sluggish until the third quarter, however, this demand began to increase from the fourth quarter.
Power Systems Business
SANUPS is a SANYO DENKI brand name for Power Systems products such as uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), inverters, engine generators, and renewable energy inverters.
In fiscal 2019, demand for public facilities was strong, primarily
for disaster management. On
the other hand, demand for industrial equipment and FA equipment stagnated. In the field of renewable energy applications, investment was sluggish due to the postponement of investment in self-consumption applications.
Servo Systems Business
SANMOTION is a SANYO DENKI brand name for Servo Systems products, such as servo motors, servo amplifiers, stepping motors and drivers, controllers, and encoders.
In fiscal 2019, demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, robots, and electronic component mounting equipment rebounded from the third
quarter as 5G communications and capital expenditures in the semiconductor industry became active. However, this tendency did not help the recovery from the decline in demand until the second quarter. On the other hand, demand for machine tools and injection molding machines was sluggish throughout the year.
Electrical Equipment Sales Business
The Electrical Equipment Sales Division conducts sales of industrial electrical equipment, control equipment, and electrical materials.
In fiscal 2019, sales of industrial electrical equipment, control equipment, and electrical materials were strong as the demand for medical equipment remained steady.
Demand for uninterruptible power supplies equipped with lithium-ion batteries for disaster prevention and the solar power generation business also increased.
In the steel-related business, demand fell significantly due to a reduction in the number of capital investment projects.
Electrical Works Contracting Business
Electrical Works Contracting Division offers planning, design, construction, and maintenance work for industrial control systems.
In fiscal 2019, electrical work at steel plants remained steady due to increased demand for spare parts and repair work. Off-site projects and system projects remained steady due to the completion of large-scale construction centered on water treatment and renewable energy.

Environmental Policy
Basic Philosophy
The SANYO DENKI Group helps preserve the global environment and enhance humanity's prosperity through its corporate activities for society and the environment.
Basic Policy
SANYO DENKI CO., LTD., comprising Kangawa Works, Shioda Works, Fujiyama Works, Technology Center, and Head Office, develops, designs, manufactures, and sells cooling fans, UPSs, power conditioners for photovoltaic generation systems (PV inverters), engine generators, servo systems, stepping systems, controllers, encoders, and driving devices. Under the principles listed below, each member of SANYO DENKI will take part in eco-friendly activities to help preserve our abundant global environment.
1. To enhance our environmental performance, we will continuously improve the environmental management system and work hard to prevent pollution and reduce the environmental impact of our activities.
2. We will assess the environmental impact of our corporate activities, set reduction targets, and achieve the targets.
We identify the following items as high-priority for environmental management.
(1) Develop, design, manufacture, and sell environment-friendly products
(2) Reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances
(3) Reduce the environmental impact (energy consumption, amount of paper copies, waste, etc.) of business

    Eliminating Conflict Minerals
Procurement Policy
The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), whose members include major electronics companies and their suppliers around the world, encourages companies to monitor their supply chains to eliminate the use of mineral resources produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are considered to be conflict minerals (conflict minerals or resources in conflict metal disputed areas). To address this issue, the SANYO DENKI Group has formulated the procurement policy stated below.
1.
2. 3.
4.
5.
The SANYO DENKI Group recognizes its responsibilities as a member of the global community and acts in accordance with social norms and relevant laws and regulations of the countries where it operates.
Under this policy, conflict minerals include tin, gold, tantalum, tungsten, and cobalt.
We will occasionally check whether or not suppliers of parts and materials, which are likely to include any of these minerals, use minerals produced in the Congo as well as the country of origin of the minerals they use.
We will immediately stop purchasing parts or materials should they be found to contain any minerals produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or neighboring conflict zones. Suppliers are asked to promptly contact our purchasing department should they discover that any of their products contain or may contain a conflict mineral, and follow the instructions provided. Regardless of the policy stated above, it may be difficult to identify the country of origin, refinery, and upstream suppliers of a material since conflict minerals constitute rare metals or precious metals and are traded in various forms and through different channels. We will conduct follow-up investigations at appropriate intervals to ensure that the investigation is thorough.

    Environmental Action Committee
System
The Environmental Action Committee, which was established in April 2000, has been in operation for 20 years as of this year. Since fiscal 2004, energy conservation and waste reduction efforts at each site have been conducted as part of maintenance activities. In addition to reducing environmental impact, the Environmental Action Committee is working on reducing quantities of hazardous chemical substances, and developing eco-design products as a key theme focused on environmental management.
Main Responsibilities of the Environmental Action Committee
1. Planning, communication, and guidance on policies concerning environmental preservation activities.
2. Preparation and maintenance of company regulations concerning environmental preservation activities (including the environmental manuals of the company).
3. Promotion of environmental preservation activities at the head office, factories, branch offices, and other locations through environmental management managers.
4. External contact for the companyÙè∞Äs environmental preservation activities.
5. Surveys on social conditions concerning environmental
preservation activities.
Introduction of Activities
What are the Eco Products?
Efforts for Eco-Design
Regarding product design, we are carrying out product development with the aim of incorporating the latest energy-saving technologies into our new products. Newly developed products are compared with commercially available and existing products and are certified as Eco Products (eco-design products) if they satisfy the specified evaluation standards. In fiscal 2019, we developed 27 eco-products. Going forward, we will continue to promote the reduction of CO2 emission when in use and product development considering LCA.
In addition, we conduct an internal eco-products training on an annual basis.
Implementation of Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA)
This LCA is one of the techniques used to provide a general quantitative measure of levels of environmental impact, including global warming, that products have through their life cycles. We evaluate the environmental compatibility of a product using LCA. The LCA implementation rate for our Eco Products is over 90%.
Eco products are indicated by the "LEAF symbol" in our catalogs
Initiatives and Environmental Management Managers at Each Site Hiroyuki Nishimura, General Environmental Management Manager
SANYO DENKI established an environmental management system and acquired ISO 14001 certification in 1999.
A general environmental management manager has been appointed under the supervision of top environmental management to promote environmental initiatives at each site. In addition to saving energy and implementing waste reduction activities at each site, we also aim to reduce the environmental load of customers when they use our products by developing energy-saving and high-efficiency products, as well as by supplying units that reduce the power receiving capacity via a maximum power peak cut function, and power supply equipment that regenerates braking power into regenerative power, among other activities that help reduce environmental impact. We also widely disclose our environmental information inside and outside the company, and commit to communicating with local communities and other parties involved. The Environmental Action Committee organizes environmental management managers at each site as well as specialized subcommittees to deliberate and set goals aimed at helping continuously improve the environment, and actively promote environmental preservation activities.
Akira Hashiguchi, Head Office
At the Head Office, Sales, Administrative, and Business Divisions perform their business operations.To reduce our environmental impact, our priority goals are to improve the sales ratio of eco-products, save energy, thoroughly separate and reduce waste, reduce the amount of copy paper used, and run volunteer activities to clean up local neighborhoods. We will continue to promote environmental activities in all divisions.
Ùè∞É Understanding and improving the sales ratio of eco-products by each business division
Ùè∞É Reduction of power consumption
Ùè∞É Thorough separation and reduction of waste
Ùè∞É Improvement of waste recycling rate
Ùè∞É Reduction of copy paper usage by digitizing format sheets and making meeting materials paperless
Ùè∞É Volunteer cleaning activities around the Head Office
Hiroyuki Nishimura, Technology Center
AtTechnology Center, which designs and develops products, we are specifically promoting eco-design and designing products that do not contain harmful chemical substances. In the creation of eco-design products "Eco-Products", 27 product models were newly certified as eco-design products in fiscal 2019. As part of the product design that does not contain harmful chemical substances, we are implementing measures such as four additional substances under the RoHS Directive and SVHC (substances of very high concern) in REACH. We also reduced use of electricity, LPG, and copy paper, as well as waste, and cleaned up the area around Ueda Research Park. We will continue to strive to reduce the environmental load of customers when they use our products by helping them conserve energy as a result of eco-design, reduce environmental impact via increased efficiency, and reuse electricity via the power regeneration function.
Kazuhiko Takizawa, Kangawa Works/Shioda Works

Our power conditioner was verified in the "Demonstration test on frequency control technology using storage battery".
From December 2, 2019 to January 31, 2020, we jointly conducted a demonstration test with 10 companies including electricity companies. We are participating in the demonstration test at our Fujiyama Works using our SANUPS P73L grid-connected isolated charging type power conditioner as a verification system that can use the electricity generated by the storage batteries and solar cells at the same time.
Solar Panels
Solar panels are installed at Kangawa Works, Fujiyama Works, Technology Center, and Logistic Center. The generated electricity is utilized at each factory. The power generation uses our PV inverters.

    Safety and Health Promotion Activities
   Foundation for Employees' Safety and HealthActivities Safety and Health Activities
The safety manager meetings and health manager meetings attended by general managers, safety managers, health managers, general affairs managers, and relevant directors play an important role in deciding annual goals. In accordance with these goals, each production site decides the annual safety and health plans.
Safety and HealthTargets in FY 2020
Stress Check Follow-up
In fiscal 2019, 3,874 employees including those of our group companies underwent a stress check. This is an opportunity for employees to gain an understanding of their stress levels and work on maintaining their bodies and minds. In addition, the results are analyzed to select workplaces that need improvements. Improvement activities such as interviews with all employees and meetings with managers were performed by external counselors.
    Support for employees with high stress

In fiscal 2019, we focused on training managers and conducted staff praise training and mental toughness training. One hundred and six managers at
all domestic sites except Technology Center have completed the course and are applying it to their daily work.
As a result of these improvement activities, the overall health risk and the proportion of people with high stress decreased when compared to fiscal 2018.
If self-care is difficult, a health nurse will counsel the individual.
The nurse will assess the cause and symptoms of stress and work together for solutions.

We conduct trainings for learning how to control stress and how to praise subordinates.
     Utilization of Telework
Telework has been introduced as a measure against the novel coronavirus, and in
principle, employees in group companies in areas where there is a high risk of infection continue to telework. Furthermore, to change from "unavoidable teleworking" to "business innovation by active teleworking", a teleworking review committee has been organized. Even after the novel coronavirus is suppressed,
we will strategically utilize the advantages of teleworking and aim to realize diverse and efficient work styles.
Follow-up training
       Launch of Walking Event
This event is organized by the health nurse with the aim of countering the lack of exercise among employees. Participants in this event are lent a pedometer so that they can get into the habit of enjoying walking while keeping track of the number of steps they take each day. A total of 165 people participated in this year's event and competed against each other to keep themselves healthy. As a result, the number of participants significantly exceeded last year's record number, and the number of those who achieved the "average of 10,000 steps per day" recommended by the health nurse increased. Awards were given to the top performers, and the event was also used as an opportunity for staff to communicate in addition to improving their health.
Healthy Company Declaration
SANYO DENKI announced initiatives to boost employees' health throughout the company to be recognized as a Healthy Company.
In August 2018, we were certified as a "Silver" Healthy Company.

Kurumin Mark
SANYO DENKI is moving ahead with an eye on realizing the objectives of the Japanese Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children, i.e., helping build a society in which the children of the next generation are born and raised in good health. That includes enhancing the work environment and conditions for its employees so they can do their jobs with peace of mind as they maintain a healthy balance between work and family life. Pursuant to this act, in July 2016 the company was awarded a certificate (known as Kurumin) in recognition of the excellent childcare support it provides to employees.
Support for Employees Balancing Work and Eldercare
Semiannual briefing sessions are held for pregnant employees, those who will be providing nursing care for family members, as well as those juggling work and child or family care responsibilities. The session is designed to provide these employees with information about laws related to childbirth, child rearing, and family nursing care, relevant employee rules and regulations, health insurance benefits, and so on.
Factory Tours
We hold parent-child factory tours for local elementary school students and their parents in Ueda City in Nagano Prefecture, where our factory is located.
This factory tour is a program where participants experience assembling the cooling fans manufactured at the factory in addition to touring the production lines. The purpose is to make participants interested in manufacturing by actually creating products.
Internships
We offer internship programs at our factories in Japan and overseas. This year, in our first attempt, we held a six-month internship
for university students to experience a series of manufacturing processes, from design to production and quality control.

                            Thoughts of theTrainer Manager of Sect. 1, General Affairs Dept.Toru Senoo
      We have more practical training programs that incorporate many discussions and role-playing activities. We also reviewed the curriculum. As a new initiative, we introduced "training for newly promoted employees" to further strengthen the skills of young and mid-level employees.
Recently, we have also been actively working on online training. All new employee training sessions held in April 2020 were conducted online. With the introduction of online training sessions, the participation rate of group company employees, who previously had difficulty in participating due to mobility issues, has increased. We will continue to incorporate the most appropriate training programs that meet requirements.
Human resource development is essential for the company to grow in the future. We hope that the training will not only help our employees to acquire new knowledge, but also serve as a bridge to improve their skills.

(1) Since fiscal 2015, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
(2) EBITDA (Earnings before interest and taxes) = Operating profit/income + depreciation and amortization
(3) Previously, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, the necessary adjustments for consolidated accounting were made using the financial statements of 14
overseas consolidated subsidiaries as of three months earlier. Effective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, however, for acquiring more accurate consolidated financial statements, we have employed on our accounting method to use the financial statements of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries for the same period as that of the Company. Accordingly, the above results for the year ended March 31, 2015, include the three-month results from January 1 to March 31, 2014, of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries.
(4) The Company implemented a share consolidation in which five shares were consolidated into one share on October 1, 2017. Basic earnings per share and equity attributable to owners of the parent per share are calculated based on the assumption that the share consolidation was executed on the date of transition to IFRS.
(5) The dividend for fiscal 2017 is the sum of the interim dividend amount of ¬•10 and the year-end dividend amount of ¬•55 (after the share consolidation). When converted on a post-share consolidation basis, the interim dividend will be ¬•50 and the full-year dividend will be ¬•105.

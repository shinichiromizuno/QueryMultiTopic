48 Company Overview
Since April 2016, the SANYO DENKI Group has been engaged in the five-year Mid-term Management Plan, and completed all initiatives this March.
This plan had the following aims:
1. Continue to develop world-leading products in terms of quality, performance, and reliability;
2. Establish a "borderless" sales system in which all group companies operate under the same management policy to deliver high and uniform quality products and services to customers around the world;
3. Manage all information in real time to make
all the latest business information available from anywhere in the world; and
4. Build factory automation to improve production efficiency and quality as well as reduce inventory and improve production management.
All of these have been achieved, and a new medium-term management plan was launched this April.
The achievements in "factory automation" include the production lines of Servo Systems and Cooling Systems divisions have been significantly refurbished, centering around the Kangawa Works and Fujiyama Works in Ueda, Nagano, to create automated production lines that enable high-mix, low-volume production. These automated production lines significantly reduced production labor hours, lead time, and in-process inventory. It is also planned to build a new plan to reinforce our product design and construct production lines simultaneously.
Our design and development capabilities have also been significantly enhanced. In March 2019, a new Technology Center was launched
in the Philippines. This Technology Center significantly contributes to the development of new products and the improvement of production technology in the Philippines. Furthermore, a new wing was built at the Technology Center in Japan, which started operating in May 2021 to further advance our technology.
Regarding our sales activities, SANYO DENKI (Tianjin) CO., LTD. was established in Tianjin, China and its Beijing branch office opened in April 2019 to focus on expanding our global business.
SANYO DENKI IT Solution CO., LTD. was established for centralizing the IT operations of all of the 19 group companies. This company􏰀s high- quality digital services increase the efficiency of the group􏰀s business operations, and achieve real- time information sharing within the entire SANYO DENKI Group
We appreciate your continued support of the SANYO DENKI Group.

  Message from President
you are only concerned with speed and quantity, you will be focused only on the immediate details and lose the perspective required to create what is truly necessary and innovative.
To systematically organize such things,
when developing new products, make sure to classify developments in the following four types: development of revised products, development
of successor products, development of follower products, and development of pioneering products. Then clarify the aim of the development and the benefit it can offer to users. This will help minimize the discrepancies between what you aim for and the results.
As you can see, the set goals are higher than our previous ones since we aim to develop world- leading products. For this reason, naturally, the design engineers will need a better development environment to achieve such goals. The SANYO DENKI Group has Technology Centers and major production factories concentrated in Ueda, Nagano, Japan and Subic, Philippines, allowing us to advance product development and production processes simultaneously. Furthermore, a new wing was added to the Technology Center in Ueda in May this year. This new wing is a research and development facility with state-of-the-art testing equipment, and has about twice the size of the existing building. We will make the best use of this latest equipment and establish a design and development process that will enable us to proactively take on challenging tasks.

MakingTechnology a Source of Growth
The SANYO DENKI Group has maintained a strong commitment to improving our technology since its foundation. As a result of these efforts, the design and development capabilities of the entire group have grown dramatically. On the other hand, technological innovation and the market environment are changing at a speed that exceeds our growth.
In order to keep up with this rapid change, we
must improve the quality and speed of our product development. I believe that, in the period of 9th Mid-term Management Plan, those who engaging in the product development will be required to develop new products that are competitive in the global market.
Thoughts on Technology
I have been involved in the design of the Cooling Systems products for a long period of time ever since I joined the company. When I joined the company, there were only three designers in the Cooling Systems Division, including myself, and it was a much smaller organization compared to the Servo Systems Division and Power Systems Division at that time.
The technology of cooling fans is very simple. However, for this very reason, it is not possible
to produce good products unless the technology is sophisticated. In other words, the performance of products will not improve without enhancing
the technology. As a familiar example, consider
a toothbrush. Toothbrushes have a simple design and they look quite alike. However, to serve the purpose of brushing teeth, numerous technological innovations have been made and the performance required by users is continuously satisfied by combining various ideas involving hair tips, handles, materials, etc.
In other words, simple technology is universal, however, by refining related techniques and creative ideas, it can become unique to users. Although the technology required for our product development is relatively simple, yet it is universal and durable.
Expand into "Wide Markets in Depth"
TechnicalThemes of 9th Mid-term Management Plan
Until recently, SANYO DENKI Group􏰀s products have targeted "narrow markets in depth" markets. For example, Cooling Systems products are used in applications for communications equipment and data centers, Power Systems products are used
in applications that require stable power. Servo Systems products are used in applications for factory automation and factory robots. All of these fields are essential for developing the industry, however, they are also susceptible to market trends and the boom and bust cycles of the global economy.
From this point on, SANYO DENKI Group􏰀s goal is to expand the business focus from the current "narrow markets in depth" to "wider markets in depth." In addition to cultivating new fields, we also need to let more people know that our products can contribute to society better.
We need to let the world know show consumers that our products can be used in many more situations and in many more ways. We also need to expand into wider fields in depth. In the past, we have introduced Airflow Tester that allows customers to measure
the operating airflow in their equipment, and PWM Controller and San Ace Controller that remotely control the rotational speed of fans. However, these products were born from the idea of how to help customers make better use of our cooling fans. By utilizing these ideas, we would like to expand the scope of our products to "wider markets in depth" instead of the current "narrow markets in depth," thereby further improving our technology and elevating ourselves to a higher level as a company.
In the 9th Medium-term Management Plan, which started this fiscal year, technology improvement is one of the major themes. The Design Department has set a goal of "a 20% increase in product development output."
This goal of "a 20% increase in product development output" does not only mean faster development and increased quantities, but also expect a proactive attitude towards challenging projects. This means that in product development, if

   Strength of our business
   Initiatives of the 9th Mid-term Management Plan
   The strength of our Cooling Systems business lies
in the design and development capabilities of high-end products that boast industry-first and industry-leading performance. Cooling fans are used everywhere in our daily lives, however, their performance requirements vary by application. Our lineup of cooling fans includes specialized products such as Splash Proof Oil Proof Fans that can be used in harsh environments, Long Life Fans with long lifespans that do not require maintenance often, and Low Power Consumption Fans that minimize power usage. These cooling fans contribute to improving the performance and reliability of equipment in complex structures and harsh operating environments, such as ICT equipment, customers􏰀production facilities, and medical equipment, and support an affluent society.
This design and development is based upon systems that enable us to listen to customer feedback and reflect it in product development, and a spirit to take on new challenges. The Airflow Tester is a typical example of this. The Airflow Tester is a device that can measure
the cooling performance of a fan built in customers􏰀 equipment. It was developed based on a customer􏰀s feedback stating that they wanted to be able to perform an evaluation on their own without having to visit us and use our measurement equipment. This Airflow Tester is the first product in the industry designed to be portable while maintaining measurement prevision.
The Cooling Systems Division plans to implement the initiatives set in the 9th Mid-term Management Plan with the following goals: advance the three technologies stated in the corporate philosophy, take on new technological challenges, and make San Ace a top brand in all fields. If these goals are achieved, the size of the
Cooling Systems business is expected to double from the current level in five years.
To make the San Ace brand a top brand in all fields, it is necessary to further expand the current product lineup to broader applications. In the next five years, our new product development will be categorized as follows: (1) develop successor products of existing products that have improved performance, (2) develop products that competitors have but we do not have in our lineup, and (3) develop pioneering products that create new value that does not currently exist in the market.
To achieve these, we will strengthen our design and development capabilities. Specifically, we will carry out development by incorporating innovative technologies such as simulation technology and IoT. Furthermore, we will develop new core technology by creating an environment where we can collect, select, and study new core technology that are several years ahead
of time. In addition, we will establish a system and structure to develop new markets, which will lead to the development of new products that have not been available by our company or the market.
In the Production Department, we have advanced
the automation of production lines, and have so far introduced an automated assembly line for the final assembly process of cooling fans. This automated assembly line uses QR codes and IC tags to manage products, supplies parts and jigs automatically, and performs necessary changeovers automatically. In the future, we will build a system that centrally manages and visualizes the flow of build-to-order production planning, parts procurement, production, and shipping, and flexibly supports high-mix, low-volume production.
Also, the Quality Control Department will improve the skills of the technicians in the department to further improve the product quality, and introduce an IoT-enabled process management and monitoring system to achieve zero product defect.

     Strength of our business
  Initiatives of the 9th Mid-term Management Plan
     Since the foundation, SANYO DENKI has been developing various power supply products, such as radio power generators and Japan􏰀s first UPS products. The Power Systems business was the first business that SANYO DENKI launched. Presently, the Power Systems Division offers three product groups: UPS (uninterruptible power supply) products, renewable energy inverters (power conditioners), and engine generators. Our products have been widely used in applications where stable power supply is required, such as protecting electronic devices and equipment from instantaneous power grid failure and providing power supply in the event of an emergency. Recently, our UPSs with lithium-ion batteries􏰄which feature high environmental durability, long life, small
size, and long-term backup􏰄are playing an active role
in emergency, BCP (business continuity planning), and medical fields by helping keep people safe.
All SANYO DENKI products have their own strengths, however, on the other hand, the entire industry is leaning towards commoditization, which makes it difficult to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. However, we believe that this is the environment in which we can leverage our strengths of having a wide-ranging product lineup and customization capabilities to provide custom products tailored to customer specifications.
For example, the SANUPS A11K-Li UPS with lithium-
ion batteries has the capability to supply power for a long period of time even when a power failure occurs. Currently, demand for vaccine storage is increasing. We have further customized these products to develop a model dedicated to medical storage refrigerators and freezers.
Also, with the recent advancement in factory automation and IoT, more and more precision equipment has been used in factories is increasing. In particular, UPSs used in dusty factories require a structure that prevents foreign objects from entering inside and a measure for dissipating heat.
We have developed UPSs suitable for such locations where environmental durability is required by creatively designing the product structure and using heat exchange technology.
In addition to this, we offer an abundant lineup of products that use renewable energy, and products that come in handy in the event of an emergency. SANUPS M53A is a power generation vehicle that can supply power anytime, anywhere it is needed in the event of a power outage or facility inspection. It is available in a variety of types, including the van type that can be driven with a regular driver􏰀s license, and various options are also offered to meet a wide range of customer needs.
In terms of production, we plan to improve profitability
by increasing the ratio of in-house unit assembly (assembly process). This in-house assembly allows us to make good use of our safety and control technology, so we intend to push it forward.
The Power Systems business is where SANYO DENKI started, and its older systems or culture had often made it more difficult to make decisions freely or flexibly than other younger business divisions. That is why we chose the slogan of "breaking out of the shell," for the next 9th Mid-term Management Plan, and we will review our conventional ways of thinking and take on new challenges.
As one of the actual initiatives, we are developing products that utilize the strengths of SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC. In the past, Power Systems products have been manufactured mainly in Japan, and delivered to the customers in Japan. Although compact UPSs have already been produced at SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC., these were for use in Japan. This is because manufacturing and selling a large number of power supply products for use in foreign countries is difficult due to
the difference in grid power and standard compliance requirements in each country. However, with the various safety standard certifications we have acquired, we are finally getting ready to deliver our power supply products to international customers. Most importantly, producing products in the Philippines will make it possible to directly provide products tailored to each country with added value. By leveraging this advantage of producing products at SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC., we will develop products targeting not only the domestic market but also the international markets.
Thanks to its accumulated technology and wide product lineup, our Power Systems business􏰀potential applications are limitless. We will continue to manufacture products that can meet any possible need.

  Strengths of our business
   Initiatives of the 9th Mid-term Management Plan
   Servo systems are used to move, stop, and control the movement of equipment such as machine tools, robots, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and medical equipment. Ours Servo Systems Business not only provides servo systems products but also involves our engineers working closely with customers from the design phase of customers􏰀equipment, and we excel in helping customers maximize the performance of their manufacturing equipment.
The Servo Systems Business has evolved mainly through making contributions to manufactures. The technology we have accumulated over many years
are also playing an increasingly important role in fields where new technological innovations are emerging. Expectations for servo system products are increasing in medical and welfare equipment fields, which contribute to human health, and in energy fields, which contribute to the preservation of the global environment.
In addition to meeting the application and functional requirements of users, we can add new value to machinery and equipment by perusing product features such as high efficiency, compact and lightweight design, and low noise. The Servo Systems products involve converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. Through the mechanical devices, we can even create "happy energy" that can contribute to human health and the global environment.
In the 8th Medium-term Management Plan, the previous 5-year plan, we redesigned the production lines in our factory and built automated "production innovation lines." This has greatly improved the production efficiency and manufacturing quality.
The 9th Medium-term Management Plan, which started this year, aims to achieve a 1.5 times higher production capacity in Japan and 3 times higher overseas. The number of orders we receive from our customers has increased every year, and subsequently we now produce a wide range of products. To deliver high-quality products to customers faster under such
circumstances, we need a new system that can produce products faster and more efficiently.
First, our production factories will achieve this by further expanding the production facilities. We are also working to extend the functions of our newly introduced production innovation lines. In particular, we have been making efforts to make our production innovation lines IoT-ready. This will visualize manufacturing information using digital data, enabling the monitoring of production status in real time. This will enable even minor variances in quality to be detected immediately. This prevents failures from occurring, and enables changes and modifications of plans to be implemented quickly. Furthermore, we have been building a system that enables us to speed up the processes􏰄from design
to production startup􏰄by using digital technology to
link design information with the parts processing and assembly processes.
In addition to manufacturing at the factory, we are also promoting initiatives that involve technical centers. SANYO DENKI Group sales offices are equipped with technical centers that allow us to customize products and conduct equipment tests in coordination with local customers. Working together with customers on their equipment enables you to make customization in more detail, leading to the development of products that benefit customers the most.
We are also focusing on the development of new products. The SANYO DENKI Group has set a goal of
a 20% increase in product development output in the five years of the 9th Medium-term Management Plan. The goal is to develop more products in a shorter period of time and increase the productivity of design and development. In product development, we are promoting co-creation initiative to create new value by empathizing with our customers.
We continue to enhance our strengths and take on new challenges at the same time. We have excellent customization capabilities that we have accumulated through making contributions to the manufacturing of customers with Servo Systems products. In addition to reinforcing these strengths, we will take on the challenge of creating new products and services that contribute
to the health of people and the betterment of global environment.

 Corporate Governance
Selection Criteria for Directors and Auditors
The Articles of Incorporation states that there shall be no more than ten directors. Regarding selection of directors, an individual who is well versed in each business field or who possesses relevant legal, accounting, or management knowledge is selected to maintain balance between knowledge, experience, and capabilities as well as diversity within the board.
Additionally, it is considered that many important matters directors are expected to address are not uniform and that policy related to selection should not be fixed.
Executive Compensation
Determination of executive compensation
(1) Policy for determining executive compensation
SANYO DENKI clarifies the policy for determining executive compensation at the board of directors meeting after consulting with and reporting to the Compensation Committee as follows.
􏰂Executive compensation is decided at the board of directors meeting after the board of directors consults the Compensation
Committee, which is established on a voluntary basis, and receives its report.
􏰂Executive compensation includes monthly compensation as a fixed compensation, and performance-based compensation.
The total amount of fixed-amount compensation and performance-based compensation is determined within the range of
compensation approved at the general shareholders meeting. The calculation is generally as follows:
Fixed compensation (basic salary)
In the case of directors who also serve as executive operating officers, their compensation is determined based on the degree of responsibility they have for their assigned duties, and in the case of directors who do not serve as executive operating officers, their compensation is determined based on the degree of their involvement in overall management.
Performance-based compensation
Depending on the overall performance of the consolidated company in the previous fiscal year and the degree of performance of each director, the performance-based compensation is determined within the range of 0 to approximately five times (annual) the monthly compensation of each director.
Retirement benefits
Retirement benefits are calculated in accordance with the retirement benefits rules, and after consulting with and reporting to the Compensation Committee, the board of directors decides to submit the proposal to the general shareholders meeting.
If a director causes any damage to the company during his/her term of office, some or all of the retirement benefits may not be paid.
(2) Auditor compensation policy
Auditors􏰀salaries are decided within the range that is approved at the general shareholder meeting, and finally approved by the board of auditors. Retirement benefits for auditors are discussed and finalized at the general shareholder meeting based on the submitted proposals.
The proposals are made at the board of auditors beforehand.

Both business growth and environmental conservation are achieved to realize a sustainable and recycling-based society.
the greater their contribution to environmental preservation.
We are also strengthening our efforts to save energy in the factories themselves. In 1997, we introduced a Photovoltaic generation facility at
the Technology Center in Ueda City in Nagano Prefecture. Presently, the entire Ueda Works has a maximum power generation capacity of 2,520 kW.
In addition, by changing the factory lighting to LED lighting, we were able to significantly reduce power consumption. In 2014, we introduced LED lighting for the first time when the third factory of SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC. was opened. After that, in the last five years, we have changed the lighting of almost all factories in Japan to LED lighting.
Furthermore, we are comprehensively reducing the amount of general and industrial waste generated by production activities and recycling
them as part of zero-emission activities. As a result, we achieved a company-wide waste recycling rate of 99.7% in 2020. In addition, the Ueda Works
and Head Office also engage in environmental conservation activities, such as regularly volunteering for community cleanups.
SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC., established in 2000, also acquired the ISO 14001 certification in 2003. The company has set up a specialized department called Environment Health and Safety to promote the development of products certified as Eco-products and the introduction of LED lighting in factories, similar to Japanese factories. The company has three factories and a technology center for research and development, all of which use LED lighting. In addition, as a unique initiative rooted in the community, they actively engaged in environmental conservation activities such as tree planting and beach cleaning.
Environmental Initiatives
The SANYO DENKI Group􏰀s environmental policy is to manage its business in a manner that contributes to global environmental conservation and the prosperity of mankind through its corporate activities with respect to society and environment.
Our environmental initiatives started with
the acquisition of ISO 14001 certification. After acquiring this certification in 1999, we established an Environmental Action Committee in 2000. After that, for about 20 years, the Environmental Action Committee took the lead in promoting the following priority themes for environmental management: (1) development and manufacture of environmentally- friendly products, (2) reduction of the use of harmful chemical substances, (3) reduction of
the environmental load in business activities,
(4) contribution to the local community, and (5) protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.
There are three main types of environmental initiatives as follows. The first is reduction of environmental load and power consumption through the development of products certified as Eco- products. The second is energy-saving initiatives at factories, and the third is waste reduction.
First, in product development, we are working
to develop products that incorporate the latest energy-saving technologies. Newly developed products are compared with commercially available and existing products, and are certified as Eco- products if they satisfy the specified evaluation standards. In 2020, 18 products were certified as Eco-products. For example, the high static pressure fan introduced last year has a structure that can reduce power consumption by about 20% compared to our conventional products. In other words, the more products that are certified as Eco-products,
In the future, we will work on three major issues to help achieve a carbon-free society.
The first is to positively develop products certified as Eco-products. We will strive to
reduce environmental load and CO2 emissions by incorporating the latest energy-saving technologies. The goals of the SANYO DENKI Group are to develop new technologies and new products that will bring happiness to everyone who uses them. Based on the belief that developing superb products continuously leads to social contribution, SANYO DENKI will further focus on development of Eco- products.
The second is to improve the energy efficiency in production activities. By strengthening the production facilities that we have been working
on so far, we have been able to greatly improve production efficiency. In the future, we will utilize this production environment to further reduce wasted power in the factory by optimizing the layout and utilizing the IoT, and evolve the factory into a
more energy-efficient facility while increasing the production capacity.
The third is to strengthen efforts aimed at fulfilling carbon-neutral market requirements. In our Power Systems Business we have developed a number of products that can also utilize
natural energy, such as power conditioners for photovoltaic generation systems (PV inverters) and grid management system. We believe that the widespread use of our products in the carbon- neutral market will significantly contribute to a carbon-free society. Entering this carbon-neutral market is also a great business opportunity for us. We will also focus on research and development activities to develop this market.
The SANYO DENKI Group fully utilizes the technology cultivated to date and carries out corporate activities aimed at achieving both business growth and conserving the environment in order to realize a sustainable and recycling-based society.

  Environmental
        The SANYO DENKI Group promotes corporate activities aimed at preserving the global environment and human prosperity.
Environmental Policy
Basic Philosophy
The SANYO DENKI Group helps preserve the global environment and enhance humanity􏰀s prosperity through its corporate activities for society and the environment.
Basic Policy
SANYO DENKI CO., LTD., comprising Kangawa Works, Shioda Works, Fujiyama Works, Technology Center, and Head Office, develops, designs, manufactures, and sells cooling fans, UPSs, power conditioners for photovoltaic generation systems (PV inverters), engine generators, servo systems, stepping systems, controllers, encoders, and driving devices. Under the principles listed below, each member of SANYO DENKI will take part in eco-friendly activities to help preserve our abundant global environment.
1. To enhance our environmental performance, we will continuously improve the environmental
management system and work hard to prevent pollution and reduce the environmental impact of our
activities.
2. We will assess the environmental impact of our corporate activities, set reduction targets, and achieve
the targets.
We identify the following items as high-priority for environmental management.
(1) Develop, design, manufacture, and sell environment-friendly products
(2) Reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances
(3) Reduce the environmental impact (energy consumption, amount of paper copies, waste, etc.) of business
activities
(4) Contribute to the local community
(5) Protect biodiversity and ecosystem
3. We observe environmental laws, restrictions, and other rules relevant to our company and work hard to preserve the environment.
4. We document, carry out, and maintain our environmental principles, make them known to all our employees, and ask that our employees cooperate in the pursuit of these principles and reflect them in our environmental management processes.
5. We will review the environmental management system periodically.
6. We will openly publicize our environmental principles to parties inside and outside the company.
Biodiversity Initiatives
The protection of biodiversity is an important issue on a par with the prevention of global warming. The SANYO DENKI Group engages in energy saving activities and initiatives utilizing our own resources including our own technologies and products.
Environmental Committee
The Environmental Committee, which was established
in April 2000, has been in operation for 20 years as of this year. Since fiscal 2004, energy conservation and waste reduction efforts at each site have been conducted as part of maintenance activities. In addition to reducing environmental impact, the Environmental Committee is working on reducing quantities of hazardous chemical substances, and developing eco-design products as a key theme focused on environmental management.
Main Responsibilities of the Environmental Committee
1. Planning, communication, and guidance on policies concerning environmental preservation activities.
2. Preparation and maintenance of company regulations concerning environmental preservation activities (including the environmental manuals of the company).
3. Promotion of environmental preservation activities at the head office, factories, branch offices, and other locations through environmental management managers.
4. External contact for the company􏰀s environmental preservation activities.
5. Surveys on social conditions concerning environmental preservation activities.
What are the Eco-products?
Efforts for Eco-Design
Regarding product design, we are carrying out product development with the aim of incorporating the latest energy-saving technologies into our
new products. Environmental impact of a product is assessed in each of the following stages: the procurement of parts and materials, manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.
Newly developed products are compared with commercially available and existing products and are certified as Eco-products (eco-design products) if they satisfy the specified evaluation standards. In fiscal year 2020, 18 models were certified as Eco-products, raising the cumulative total to 315 models.
Going forward, we will continue to promote the reduction of CO2 emission when in use and product development considering LCA.
Implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
This LCA is one of the techniques used
to provide a general quantitative measure
of levels of environmental impact, including global warming, that products have
through their life cycles. We evaluate the environmental compatibility of a product using LCA. The LCA implementation rate for our Eco-products is over 90%.

The SANYO DENKI Group recognizes its responsibilities as a member of the global community and acts in accordance with social norms and relevant laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. Under this policy, conflict minerals include tin, gold, tantalum, tungsten, and cobalt.
We will occasionally check whether or not suppliers of parts and materials, which are likely to include any of these minerals, use minerals produced in the Congo as well as the country of origin of the minerals they use.
We will immediately stop purchasing parts or materials should they be found to contain any minerals produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or neighboring conflict zones.
Suppliers are asked to promptly contact our purchasing department should they discover that any of their products contain or may contain a conflict mineral, and follow the instructions provided.
Regardless of the policy stated above, it may be difficult to identify the country of origin, refinery, and upstream suppliers of a material since conflict minerals constitute rare metals or precious metals and are traded in various forms and through different channels. We will conduct follow-up investigations at appropriate intervals to ensure that the investigation is thorough.

Health and Productivity Management
Health Management Activities
We conduct regular and special health examinations, stress checks, new employee training, mental health seminars, branch office patrols, walking events, and influenza vaccinations every year. In FY 2021, we provided COVID-19 vaccines in workplaces for workers who wanted them.
Workplace Improvement
Activities
Based on the results of the stress check, for workplaces that have been identified as needing improvement, we conduct workplace improvement activities such as interviews with the support of occupational health nurses, and meetings with managers.
Providing stress checks are a legal obligation, however, workplace improvement activities are not essential. However, the SANYO DENKI Group actively performed workplace improvement activities, and as a result of these initiatives, we were able to reduce the number of departments subject to improvements by 38% over five years.
  SANYO DENKI Group Health Management Declaration
SANYO DENKI group companies work together to engage in creating a workplace where our employees can maintain and promote physical and mental health and in health promotion. Further, we contribute to society to make use of our accumulated technologies and products since its founding in the promotion of health of all employees involved in SANYO DENKI Group.

Specific goal based on health challenges
SANYO DENKI Group works on following goals based on the SANYO DENKI Group Health Management Declaration.
1 Provide a comfortable workplace and eliminate a workplace with increased risks for health
We perform stress check tests on a regular basis and provide feedback on the results of these tests. For a workplace with increased risks for health, we work to reduce health risks through workplace improvement activities supported by health nurses.
2 Improvement rate in abnormal findings - 100% year over year
For employees who have abnormal findings during health checkups, we provide them with health guidance or encourage them to seek medical attention to improve their health. We also support diet modifications by providing health-promoting menus at the staff cafeterias.
3 Rate of improvement in exercise habits - 100% year over year
We increase employees􏰀opportunities to do physical exercise and encourage them to make it a habit by conducting a questionnaire on awareness of exercises and walking events.
Establishment of Health and
Productivity Management Committee
The Health and Productivity Management Committee was established in April 2021 with the aim of maintaining and improving the health of employees. By engaging in a range of health-related activities, this committee will promote the creation of workplaces and health promoting activities that enable employees to maintain and improve their physical and mental health.
Industrial Health System
Occupational health nurses are stationed at the Head Office and Ueda Works to support both physical and mental health of employees in cooperation with industrial physicians.
We have established a consultation desk system for early detection of people with poor health condition, including activities related to improving the health of employees.
Venue for occupational vaccinations against COVID-19 (Fujiyama Works)
   Improvement of Employee’s Awareness of Health
In order for each employee to maintain and improve their health, it is important to improve their awareness of health
issues. Occupational health nurses prepare Health Report, which provides health-related information to employees on a regular basis, and publish it on the company􏰀s intranet site and the bulletin board at the factory to help improve employees􏰀health consciousness.

We renewed the menus at the staff cafeteria in the Ueda Works and incorporated health-friendly dishes. We continue to provide healthier and tastier menu items while incorporating employees􏰀opinions.
■ Initiatives to Improve Exercise Habits – Implementation of Walking Event –
We have been holding walking events every year
since 2018 with the aim of eliminating the lack of
exercise among employees and improving health
checkup results. Pedometers and smart watches are rented to participants, and the average number of steps walked during the event is announced in ranked order,
and prizes are awarded according to the results. The walking event is an initiative aimed at improving workers􏰀 exercise habits while encouraging them to have fun by tracking the number of steps taken each day and building walking habits.
Last year, in spite of the Coronavirus pandemic, 240 people participated in the event - the largest number ever – and enjoyed competing with each other to build healthy bodies.

 Our Goals and Strategy Our Businesses Foundations of Value Creation Financial Data

     Society and Community
    Promotion of
Diversity and Inclusion
        Promotion of Diversity
Since the 1990s, the SANYO DENKI Group has treated all employees equally and evaluated their abilities and performance fairly and equitably without any discrimination based on nationality, race, origin, gender, age, religion, educational background, beliefs, or personal preferences. We also strictly observe this policy when hiring employees. We will continue to stick to this policy with 100% pride.
Global Human Resources Strategy
In order to promote global management, the SANYO DENKI Group actively appoints local staff to management and manager classes at group companies in each country. Currently, local people make up about half of the staff at respective group companies in each country. Furthermore, about half of them are women.
Support for Balancing Childcare and Nursing Care
We hold semi-annual briefing sessions for employees who are about to give birth or get involved in nursing care, as well as employees who are balancing work with childcare or nursing care, in order to provide information on laws related to childbirth, childcare, and nursing care, employment regulations, and health insurance union systems. In addition, the rate of male employees taking childcare leave has been increasing year by year, making it possible
for new parents to balance childcare and nursing care regardless of gender. In July 2016, the company was awarded a certificate (known as Kurumin) recognizing it as a company that actively supports childcare based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children.
New employee training
Self-Development and Volunteer Leave System
(Studied in the UK and acquired the MA in Media and Public Relations)
Support for Employees with Disabilities
We are maintaining and supporting the work environment so that employees with disabilities can work in as lively a manner as other employees.
■ Creation of Support Book and Consideration Check Sheet, and Implementation of Individual Interviews We have prepared a Support Book for each employee. This booklet shows at a glance what kind of support
employees need from their surroundings to carry out their job responsibilities.
In addition, we have prepared a Consideration Check Sheet that includes facilities and support equipment,
frequency of hospital visits, necessity of support in case of disaster, and emergency contact information according to each work environment, which is useful for creating a safe and secure environment for employees.
■ Maintenance of Workplace Environment
We are maintaining the work environment by installing
handrails in the toilets and supporting ostomates by providing multi-functional toilets.
In addition, for employees with physical disabilities, we have introduced dedicated special transport carts with anti-static functions, and for employees with hearing disabilities, we check each other􏰀s work details using tablet terminals that can convert speech into text and enable communication via writing. As a result, we are improving work efficiency by making use of the workplace- and worker-specific requirements of each workplace.
Personnel Training
The SANYO DENKI Group management aims to manage the company so that employees can achieve self-realization through their work and corporate activities.
■Training System
Our training includes three main pillars: (1) grade-based training
programs that help employees recognize the expected roles and activities of each professional qualification and to support them
to demonstrate their abilities above the required levels, (2) career- based training programs that are dedicated to specific occupations such as sales and design, and (3) department-based training programs that help employees acquire special knowledge specific to their divisions. These training programs support employees who are striving to develop their own abilities and grow.
In addition, we introduced training for newly promoted employees to further improve skills of young and mid-level employees, and are also focusing on developing employees who will lead the next generation. For managers, we perform manager training to help them acquire practical knowledge and skills as managers, with the aim of developing them into senior managers and produce top management candidates.
■ Self-Development and Volunteer Leave System
We have established a self-development and volunteer leave
system that allows employees who wish to develop their own abilities and participate more in society to take leave for up to three years, and then return to work. This system is aimed at supporting employees to achieve self-fulfillment. In FY 2020, one of our employees who took advantage of this system obtained a master􏰀s degree in the UK and are applying the specialized skills she acquired in her work.

(1) Since fiscal 2015, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
(2) EBITDA (Earnings before interest and taxes) = Operating profit/income + depreciation and amortization
(3) Previously, in preparing the consolidated financial statements, the necessary adjustments for consolidated accounting were made using the financial statements of 14 overseas
consolidated subsidiaries as of three months earlier. Effective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, however, for acquiring more accurate consolidated financial statements, we have employed on our accounting method to use the financial statements of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries for the same period as that of the Company. Accordingly, the above results for the year ended March 31, 2015, include the three-month results from January 1 to March 31, 2014, of the overseas consolidated subsidiaries.
(4) Our company implemented a share consolidation in which five shares were consolidated into one share on October 1, 2017. Basic earnings per share and equity attributable to owners of the parent per share are calculated based on the assumption that the share consolidation was executed at the beginning of fiscal year 2015 (April 1, 2015).
(5) The dividend for fiscal 2017 is the sum of the interim dividend amount of ¥10 and the year-end dividend amount of ¥55 (after the share consolidation). When converted on a post- share consolidation basis, the interim dividend will be ¥50 and the full-year dividend will be ¥105.

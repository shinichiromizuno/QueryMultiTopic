Both business growth and environmental conservation are achieved to realize a sustainable and recycling-based society.
the greater their contribution to environmental preservation.
We are also strengthening our efforts to save energy in the factories themselves. In 1997, we introduced a Photovoltaic generation facility at
the Technology Center in Ueda City in Nagano Prefecture. Presently, the entire Ueda Works has a maximum power generation capacity of 2,520 kW.
In addition, by changing the factory lighting to LED lighting, we were able to significantly reduce power consumption. In 2014, we introduced LED lighting for the first time when the third factory of SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC. was opened. After that, in the last five years, we have changed the lighting of almost all factories in Japan to LED lighting.
Furthermore, we are comprehensively reducing the amount of general and industrial waste generated by production activities and recycling
them as part of zero-emission activities. As a result, we achieved a company-wide waste recycling rate of 99.7% in 2020. In addition, the Ueda Works
and Head Office also engage in environmental conservation activities, such as regularly volunteering for community cleanups.
SANYO DENKI PHILIPPINES, INC., established in 2000, also acquired the ISO 14001 certification in 2003. The company has set up a specialized department called Environment Health and Safety to promote the development of products certified as Eco-products and the introduction of LED lighting in factories, similar to Japanese factories. The company has three factories and a technology center for research and development, all of which use LED lighting. In addition, as a unique initiative rooted in the community, they actively engaged in environmental conservation activities such as tree planting and beach cleaning.
Environmental Initiatives
The SANYO DENKI Group􏰀s environmental policy is to manage its business in a manner that contributes to global environmental conservation and the prosperity of mankind through its corporate activities with respect to society and environment.
Our environmental initiatives started with
the acquisition of ISO 14001 certification. After acquiring this certification in 1999, we established an Environmental Action Committee in 2000. After that, for about 20 years, the Environmental Action Committee took the lead in promoting the following priority themes for environmental management: (1) development and manufacture of environmentally- friendly products, (2) reduction of the use of harmful chemical substances, (3) reduction of
the environmental load in business activities,
(4) contribution to the local community, and (5) protection of biodiversity and ecosystems.
There are three main types of environmental initiatives as follows. The first is reduction of environmental load and power consumption through the development of products certified as Eco- products. The second is energy-saving initiatives at factories, and the third is waste reduction.
First, in product development, we are working
to develop products that incorporate the latest energy-saving technologies. Newly developed products are compared with commercially available and existing products, and are certified as Eco- products if they satisfy the specified evaluation standards. In 2020, 18 products were certified as Eco-products. For example, the high static pressure fan introduced last year has a structure that can reduce power consumption by about 20% compared to our conventional products. In other words, the more products that are certified as Eco-products,
In the future, we will work on three major issues to help achieve a carbon-free society.
The first is to positively develop products certified as Eco-products. We will strive to
reduce environmental load and CO2 emissions by incorporating the latest energy-saving technologies. The goals of the SANYO DENKI Group are to develop new technologies and new products that will bring happiness to everyone who uses them. Based on the belief that developing superb products continuously leads to social contribution, SANYO DENKI will further focus on development of Eco- products.
The second is to improve the energy efficiency in production activities. By strengthening the production facilities that we have been working
on so far, we have been able to greatly improve production efficiency. In the future, we will utilize this production environment to further reduce wasted power in the factory by optimizing the layout and utilizing the IoT, and evolve the factory into a
more energy-efficient facility while increasing the production capacity.
The third is to strengthen efforts aimed at fulfilling carbon-neutral market requirements. In our Power Systems Business we have developed a number of products that can also utilize
natural energy, such as power conditioners for photovoltaic generation systems (PV inverters) and grid management system. We believe that the widespread use of our products in the carbon- neutral market will significantly contribute to a carbon-free society. Entering this carbon-neutral market is also a great business opportunity for us. We will also focus on research and development activities to develop this market.
The SANYO DENKI Group fully utilizes the technology cultivated to date and carries out corporate activities aimed at achieving both business growth and conserving the environment in order to realize a sustainable and recycling-based society.

management system and work hard to prevent pollution and reduce the environmental impact of our
activities.
2. We will assess the environmental impact of our corporate activities, set reduction targets, and achieve
the targets.
We identify the following items as high-priority for environmental management.
(1) Develop, design, manufacture, and sell environment-friendly products
(2) Reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous chemical substances
(3) Reduce the environmental impact (energy consumption, amount of paper copies, waste, etc.) of business
activities
(4) Contribute to the local community
(5) Protect biodiversity and ecosystem
3. We observe environmental laws, restrictions, and other rules relevant to our company and work hard to preserve the environment.

5. We will review the environmental management system periodically.
6. We will openly publicize our environmental principles to parties inside and outside the company.
Biodiversity Initiatives
The protection of biodiversity is an important issue on a par with the prevention of global warming. The SANYO DENKI Group engages in energy saving activities and initiatives utilizing our own resources including our own technologies and products.
Environmental Committee
The Environmental Committee, which was established
in April 2000, has been in operation for 20 years as of this year. Since fiscal 2004, energy conservation and waste reduction efforts at each site have been conducted as part of maintenance activities. In addition to reducing environmental impact, the Environmental Committee is working on reducing quantities of hazardous chemical substances, and developing eco-design products as a key theme focused on environmental management.
Main Responsibilities of the Environmental Committee
1. Planning, communication, and guidance on policies concerning environmental preservation activities.
2. Preparation and maintenance of company regulations concerning environmental preservation activities (including the environmental manuals of the company).
3. Promotion of environmental preservation activities at the head office, factories, branch offices, and other locations through environmental management managers.
4. External contact for the company􏰀s environmental preservation activities.
5. Surveys on social conditions concerning environmental preservation activities.
What are the Eco-products?
Efforts for Eco-Design
Regarding product design, we are carrying out product development with the aim of incorporating the latest energy-saving technologies into our
new products. Environmental impact of a product is assessed in each of the following stages: the procurement of parts and materials, manufacturing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.
Newly developed products are compared with commercially available and existing products and are certified as Eco-products (eco-design products) if they satisfy the specified evaluation standards. In fiscal year 2020, 18 models were certified as Eco-products, raising the cumulative total to 315 models.
Going forward, we will continue to promote the reduction of CO2 emission when in use and product development considering LCA.
Implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
This LCA is one of the techniques used
to provide a general quantitative measure
of levels of environmental impact, including global warming, that products have
through their life cycles. We evaluate the environmental compatibility of a product using LCA. The LCA implementation rate for our Eco-products is over 90%.
  Eco-products are indicated by the "LEAF symbol" in the our catalogs

The SANYO DENKI Group recognizes its responsibilities as a member of the global community and acts in accordance with social norms and relevant laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. Under this policy, conflict minerals include tin, gold, tantalum, tungsten, and cobalt.
We will occasionally check whether or not suppliers of parts and materials, which are likely to include any of these minerals, use minerals produced in the Congo as well as the country of origin of the minerals they use.
We will immediately stop purchasing parts or materials should they be found to contain any minerals produced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or neighboring conflict zones.
Suppliers are asked to promptly contact our purchasing department should they discover that any of their products contain or may contain a conflict mineral, and follow the instructions provided.
Regardless of the policy stated above, it may be difficult to identify the country of origin, refinery, and upstream suppliers of a material since conflict minerals constitute rare metals or precious metals and are traded in various forms and through different channels. We will conduct follow-up investigations at appropriate intervals to ensure that the investigation is thorough.

Coexistence with the global environment
 ● Reduction of CO2 emissions through SBT certification Reduction targets of CO2 emissionsWe believe that conducting our business activities in harmony with the global environment is an essential prerequisite, and we strive to protect the global environ- ment through energy conservation, renewable energy, recycling, and other efforts. We are working to achieve a sustainable society through measures such as reducing CO2emissions based on SBT certification, improving energy efficiency through FEMS, promoting the intro- duction of solar power generation systems, and reduc- ing industrial waste emissions.
 In April 2020, we received certification from the SBT Initiative in recognition that our medium- to long-term CO2 emissions reduc- tion targets are science-based and in line with “1.5°C target” set by the Paris Agreement. We are committed to reducing our emissions in Scope 1+2 by 50% by 2030 compared to 2018 levels. In the meanwhile, as supplier engagement, we also are committed to completing a goal setting of supplier equivalent to 80% of our emissions for purchased goods and services by 2024.
Changes of CO2 emissions
With an emphasis on business transformation and corporate value improvement, we increase productivity by eliminating waste from customer proposals to receiving orders, production and installation. Thereby, we reduce the Scope 1+2 CO2 emissions from our internal energy use by 196t (3.9%) compared to 2018 levels. Going forward, we will continue to work to reduce CO2 emissions through energy conservation and renewable energy and collaborate with our suppliers in this regard.

  Environmental Management System
To promote energy conservation measures and the use of renewable energy, we have established an environmental management system led by the “Environmental Conserva- tion Committee”, which is comprised of seven / subcommit- tees from manufacturing, logistics, construction, purchas- ing, administration, products, and group subsidiaries, to promote environmental conservation activities.

Reducing industrial waste
● Reduction of industrial waste
In the production process, we have reduced the amount of industrial waste by purchasing actual size materials and improving the yield
rate. Besides, the recycling rate of the total amount of waste has been improving every year by thorough separation of waste at the industrial waste storage site. We will continue to review our material purchasing, production, and packaging methods to improve our recycling rate and reduce amount of industrial waste with the aim of realizing a circular economy.

● Participation in RE Action ‒ Declaring 100% Renewable We joined “RE Action ‒ Declaring 100% Renewable,” a framework to declare conver-
sion to 100% renewable electricity, as an initial participant organization in October 2019, and committed to 100% renewable energy for our electricity use by 2040. Going forward, we will work to reduce CO2emissions by introducing self-consump- tion solar power generation systems and increasing the ratio of renewable energy by switching the existing solar power generation systems from selling electricity to self-consumption and purchasing green energy.

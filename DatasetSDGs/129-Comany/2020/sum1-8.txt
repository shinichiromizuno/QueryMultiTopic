 Office market
     Create a space where people can work in a variety of ways to support their individual work
Challenges and Changes in the Office Market
The office market will continue to diversify in terms of ways of working and the people who work there. This means each office will be given its person- ality rather than remaining as a conventional space.
Besides, the office market is not limited to the spaces provided by compa- nies, and a variety of spaces are being used as offices in a recent trend. Since cafes, private homes, and even tourist facilities such as inns have been used as worksites, we will aim to provide spaces suited to a variety of work styles.

Office Market Strategies
●Medium-Term Strategy
In view of the redevelopment of the Tokyo metropolitan area, which is likely to continue even in the age of after-corona, the needs of the city center are expected to remain flat to slightly increase. On the other hand, we predict that more people will seek new ways of working in rural areas. These two movements are not in conflict, and more and more people will gain value from both. We will provide spaces that create new value by capturing the spatial needs in relation to the changing ways of working.
▶ It is expected to see a change in the requirements of working and the culture in the first place. (The impact of COVID-19)
Office Market Initiatives
●Long-term strategy
As telework moves forward with full-scale implementation, most workers will be able to choose where to work in corresponding to their purpose. Recognizing that what is necessary for personal spaces is different from what is necessary for public spaces; we will create and provide spatial values that meet the objectives of all forms of working.Sales

As demand for redevelopment in the Tokyo metropolitan area is growing, overall demand in the office market increased. The whole concept of office has changed due to the change in marketability and the work style reform. The demands for partition capable of changing the value of office space emerged, the creation of new added value in our product contributing to our moderate growth in sales.

We continue to conduct environmental surveys in our offices using sensing technology and vital data. We are also conducting environmental research in individual booths as part of business-academia collaboration with the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST). In addition to researching how the environment, such as CO2 concentration, changes, and how these changes affect people, we are also experiment- ing with an environment capable of operating lightings with smartphones by utilizing sensing technology.
“Wherever Booth--KAKOU”
It is expected that people would have more choices when deciding where to work in future while the social infrastructure is improved. In addition to the impact of COVID-19, people are starting to work from home at a rapid pace.
In other words, we should think of our homes as a different form of offices now. To address the issue of homes being used as offices, we have focused on the traditional Japanese way of partition, the folding screen and released our new product "Wherever booth--KAKOU" in July 2020.Changes in the whole concept of the office due to progress in telework

      Create a safe and productive work environment for all workers in factories
Challenges and Changes in the Factory Market
The factory market is undergoing a major transformation. With the challenges in handing down of technical expertise and a shrinking workforce, there is an urgent need for a shift to digitalization, and efforts are being made to automate and reduce the manpower through the introduc- tion of robots and to streamline production processes by utilizing IT, IoT, big data, AI, and other technologies. Besides, there has been an increase in the recruitment of diverse human resources to secure the workforce.

Factory Market Strategies
●Medium-Term Strategy
Capital investment in the manufacturing industry is expected to shrink over the next three years or so. However, we believe that even in this context, the demand for more comfortable and easier working spaces for factory workers will continue to grow in the future. We will continue to meet the needs for new ways of working in factories in the age of after-corona and provide products that are ideal for creating spaces in which factory workers can work at high productiv- ity.

●Long-term strategy
We will develop new services by applying the know-how we have
cultivated in the clean room business and further expand our sales channels.
Besides, we will develop products and provide interior space that is useful for establishing production systems that meet the high-mix, low-volume production requirements of future manufacturing industry.Sales

Capital expenditures by companies have begun to decline from fiscal 2018, which have had a negative impact on sales.
The factory market is heavily dependent on specific end users and sales to those companies. This is an issue for the future, and we are working to resolve it.

he era of mass production has changed to an era of high-mix, low-volume production. The customer needs are diversifying and the factories which can cope with such change are necessary. For this reason, we believe that the product line and the layout of partition within the factories are required to change flexibly. We are conducting market research to respond to these changes in factory operations.
“Mobile Robot" for factories is now in operation
We have started operating a "mobile robot" at our main factory. The mobile robot is a transport robot that transports finished products and members in the factory. In anticipation of future needs, we started a trial operation of the robot in our factories. We will commercialize the robot as a proposal for creating new value in industrial solutions, mainly for existing users, and expand the range of services we offer.Lack of human resources

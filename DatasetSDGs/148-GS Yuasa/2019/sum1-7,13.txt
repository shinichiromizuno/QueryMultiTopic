Contributing to the diffusion of renewable energy and the solution of climate change issues
In recent years, power generation using renewable energy sources has become the focus of attention all over the world, because it can act as
a countermeasure to issues such as climate change caused by global warming and the depletion of fossil resources. Wind power generation offers a relatively high demand rate and the capability to produce power around the clock, day and night. In Japan, the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions provide good wind conditions throughout the year and are considered suitable locations for wind power facilities. Increasing adoption of such installations is expected in the future. The GS Yuasa Group is working to advance technical progress in the areas of storage batteries and dedicated maintenance systems in order to promote the spread of renewable energy and the realization of a sustainable society.
7.2 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.
13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.
    Wind power generation has high potential as a deterrent to global warming
In recent years, the effects of measures to combat global warming by switching to renewable energy have received great attention, and wind power generation is increasingly being adopted in Japan.
The northern region of Hokkaido (the Dohoku region) is suitable for wind power generation, but weaknesses in the transmission grid so far have prevented effective use of wind resources. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry therefore is pursuing a subsidized project entitled a Project for the Development of a Transmission Network for Wind Power Generation. The newly established Kita Toyotomi Substation is part of this project, where GS Yuasa will be installing the storage battery equipment. Work is to begin in 2020 on what will become one of the world’s largest storage battery facilities.
Outline of Kita Toyotomi Substation
●Feature: One of the world’s largest storage battery facilities Capacity: 720MWh
●Location: Toyotomi-cho, Teshio-gun, Hokkaido ●Start of operations: Fiscal 2023 (planned)
In wind power generation, the output fluctuates significantly according to changes in wind strength and direction. This makes it difficult to ensure stable power supply, so that the balance between supply and demand is disrupted which can affect the entire power grid.
Increasing battery storage capacity is a way to overcome
this dilemma. The presence of a storage battery system makes it possible to absorb fluctuations in the generation of the source and provide stable power.
Lithium-ion batteries from GS Yuasa have an extensive track record in automotive and industrial use. Our mass production system is well established and we supply products to a wide range of fields. We were selected on the strength of our proven technology, outstanding reliability, superior safety, and solid long-term support framework.
For the current project, a new type of high-energy lithium-ion battery with low internal resistance will be used. This will contribute to space savings and longer life of the storage battery facility. The enormous capacity of 720MWh is the equivalent of the battery banks of 45,000 electric vehicles. Regular maintenance and inspection are important aspects of battery storage facilities. GS Yuasa will be providing 24-hour voltage management and fault monitoring to further enhance the reliability of the system.
In order to effectively utilize the electric power generated by renewable energy sources, battery storage systems that stabilize operation are essential. This in turn is driving a rise in demand for batteries suitable for this purpose.
Battery storage systems also increasingly have other important roles to play, for example as backup power sources in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.
The GS Yuasa Group will continue its intensive R&D efforts into various types of batteries, with the aim of helping to realize safe and reliable energy systems and thereby contributing to the solution of social issues and the protection of the global environment.

 Supporting
  the future of railways as
a key component of social
infrastructure
Expectations are increasing in the potential of railways as an environment-friendly means of transport. Products of the GS Yuasa Group are playing an important role in supporting advanced railway functions.

Industrial lithium-ion batteries
High current capacity/Good discharge performance
Used in new “ACCUM” unit of EV-E301 series
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
Long life/ Space saving design
Industrial lithium-ion batteries were first adopted as power supply devices to back up railway communication equipment.
Expanded use of industrial lithium-ion batteries by railway companies
A storage battery system of the GS Yuasa Group was adopted for the new ACCUM model in the EV-E301 series developed by East Japan Railway Company. This storage battery system utilizes the industrial lithium-ion battery module LIM 30H-8A, which has an excellent track record with many satisfied customers.
ACCUM allows traveling in non-electrified sections where there is no overhead wire by using accumulated energy from the battery, which then is charged again while traveling in an electrified section. Furthermore, in both sections, it is possible to accumulate electricity generated by regenerative braking in the storage battery and make effective use of it.

   Background
Initiatives
time adopted our industrial lithium-ion batteries in backup power-supply devices for railway communication equipment. Compared to conventional lead-acid batteries, this brought various advantages, such as superior cycle life and space savings. Having a long-term power backup for railway communication equipment in emergency situations is vital for enhancing the stable train operation.
Our Group will continue to promote the expanded use of industrial lithium-ion batteries for railways and other important social infrastructure.
Whether for commuting, travel, or freight transport, railways are an integral part of Japanese life
In fiscal 2017, over 24.5 billion people used domestic railways in Japan, and the yearly numbers of people passing through the major stations in urban areas are at the top of worldwide statistics. Without a doubt, railways are an indispensable part of social infrastructure. Moreover, CO2 emissions per transported unit are approximately nine times lower than with automobiles, making railways the means of transport with the lowest environmental impact. Daily life without railways can hardly be imagined. As with other forms of mobility, however, further improvements in terms of energy efficiency and reduction of the environmental burden are required, as well as business sustainability as an important social infrastructure of the nation.
Supplying regenerative power storage devices using
industrial lithium-ion batteries to JR West Japan
In March 2018, we delivered regenerative power storage devices to West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan). Previously the energy generated by a decelerating train was not effectively utilized if there was no accelerating train nearby. The power storage devices delivered by us can temporarily retain energy by charging a storage battery and discharging it when electric power is necessary, resulting in more efficient use of energy. The device also contributes to stabilizing the catenary voltage, helping to ensure stable train operation with electric trains.

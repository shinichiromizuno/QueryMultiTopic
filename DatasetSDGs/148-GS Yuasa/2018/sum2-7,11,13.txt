                            Contributing to power stabilization in social infrastructure with power backup equipment
In an age when electricity is needed for all kinds of things, the activities of society would come to a halt if the supply of electricity were cut off. Therefore, backup power sources assuming the stoppage of power supplies at times of natural disaster, such as flooding or earthquakes, are becoming increasingly important.
With their outstanding quality and reliability, our Group’s products are safeguarding society’s basic infrastructure. In addition, we are contributing to the continuity of business in office buildings and plants in the event of a large natural disaster.

a setup providing total support from product development to installation and maintenance.

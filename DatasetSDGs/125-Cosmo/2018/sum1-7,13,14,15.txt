      As a part of the new medium-term CSR management plan, we developed the “Long-Term Environmental Vision 2030,” consistent with the orientation of the global community and the Japanese Government toward realizing a sustainable society. In an effort to contribute to reducing CO emissions,

 by FY2030, compared to the level in FY2013. Along this line, we are targeting a 16% reduction in FY2022, the final year of the plan, again compared to the level in FY2013.
Energy Conservation at Refineries
In FY2017, in order to attain optimal supply and demand balance in domestic petroleum products, the Chiba Refinery reduced the processing capacity of the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). The resultant decrease in crude oil refining volume led to a slight increase in CO2 emissions per unit of crude oil equivalent throughput.
Refineries represent the largest portion in CO2 emission of the Cosmo Energy Group. We will therefore strive for energy conservation from both a hard aspect (introduction of high-efficiency equipment) and a soft aspect (energy- efficient operation of facilities).
Reduction of Environmental Pollutants
Use of Water and Water Discharge Measures
(Water Pollution Prevention)
The Cosmo Energy Group’s refineries and plants use a vast
amount of water (over 90% is seawater) mainly for cooling but
also for cleaning and boiler feed water. In FY2017, 489,237kt of
water was used, of which 60,762kt was industrial water. We
are striving to use water efficiently, including the reuse and
recycle of water.
Concerning water discharge, we discharge the seawater used for
cooling into the sea, and properly treat the water used for
cleaning and other operating processes at stricter levels than
required by the legal standard levels for minimizing environmental
impact when discharged. In FY2017, the total amount of Chemical FY2017

Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE)-mixed gasoline: The amounts of reduction in CO
by gasoline combustion at a target share of 11% multiplied by the adoption target of bioethanol of the Act on Sophisticated Methods of Energy Supply Structures. The estimates for FY2022 are calculated based on the FY2017 targets – 500,000 KL (crude oil equivalent) multiplied by 11% share.
Wind power generation: Calculated by using the total power generation volume multiplied by the actual CO2 emission coefficient, adjusted CO2 emission coefficient, and other alternative measures. The targets
for FY2022 use the alternative measure (0.587kg-CO /kWh) of FY2016. 2

3: Total Pollutant Load Control amount (annual value for reference): The prescribed daily load is multiplied by 365 to get an annual amount. In the case that the amount temporarily exceeds the legal limit, we report to the relevant authority and promptly take measures to make the amount fall below the legal limit.

1. “Crude oil production” and “Crude oil transport” are estimated based on LCI for Petroleum Products by Fuel and Environmental Impact Assessment for Petroleum Products, published in March 2000 by the Japan Petroleum Energy Center.
2. For “Manufacturing” and subsequent stages, energy consumption is calculated in accordance with the Act on the Rational Use of Energy.
3. CO2 emissions for “Manufacturing,” “Product transport and storage (oil depots),” and “Sales (service stations)” (based on data from Cosmo Oil Sales Corp.), “R&D centers, offices, and other facilities” are calculated in accordance with a manual for GHG emissions accounting, reporting, and disclosure systems published by Japan’s Ministry of the Environment and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
4. Figures given for “Manufacturing” include data from Cosmo Oil’s three refineries, Yokkaichi Kasumi Power Station, and Cosmo Oil Lubricants in the Petroleum Business and Cosmo Matsuyama Oil and Maruzen Petrochemical in the Petrochemical Business. However, figures for SOx and NOx exclude data from Cosmo Oil Lubricants.

“Electricity sold” refers to electricity supplied externally by Cosmo Oil’s Chiba Refinery, Yokkaichi Kasumi Power Station, and Maruzen Petrochemical’s Chiba Plant. CO2 emissions from “Manufacturing” were calculated by deducting the portion of CO2 emissions attributed to electricity sold. CO2 emissions from utility (power) were included in the CO2 emissions from “Manufacturing.” “Steamsold”referstosteamsoldbytheChibaRefinery,CosmoMatsuyama Oil, and Maruzen Petrochemical’s Chiba Plant. CO2 emissions for “Manufacturing” were calculated after deducting the portion of CO2 emissions that results from the generated steam sold.
CO2 emissions from “Product transport” include data from the specified consigners in accordance with the Act on the Rational Use of Energy.
8. CO2 emissions for “Consumption (product use)” are calculated by multiplying shipped volume of fuel products (such as gasoline and heavy fuel oil) by CO2 emission coefficient. CO2 emissions attributable to generated “Electricity sold” and “Steam sold” are calculated separately.
9. SOx emissions for “Consumption (product use)” are for reference, and were estimatedfromthesulfurcontentofproductswithoutaccountingforsulfur reduction during use. Accordingly, actual SOx emissions are lower than the estimate.
10. Data for “R&D Centers” includes the R&D Center of Cosmo Oil, the R&D Laboratory of Cosmo Oil Lubricants, and Research Center of Maruzen Petrochemical.
11. Figures given for “Offices and other facilities” are the amount of electricity use of Cosmo Energy Holdings, Cosmo Energy Exploration & Production, Cosmo Oil, Cosmo Oil Marketing, Group companies that share the eco-office activities, and Maruzen Petrochemical.

What Makes Cosmo Special
      What Makes Cosmo Special
Oil development and stable production based on strong relationships of trust with Middle East oil producing countries
Hail Oil Field at full production
• Low-risk, low-cost development has been realized, based on relationships of trust with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) based on the stable production for about 50 years.
• In December 2012, Abu Dhabi Oil Company (ADOC) extended concessions (30 years) and obtained new concession area, the Hail Oil Field, which is as large as total of the three existing oilfields. The Hail Oil Field began production in November 2017 and has been operating at full capacity since January 2018.
• The Hail Oil Field investment has been curbed with the shared use of existing crude oil processing, storage, and shipping facilities (Estimated saving of roughly $300-400 million), the unit operating cost is expected to decline along with increase in production volume.
Risk Tolerance
• Earnings power under lower oil prices
We made a profit even in the January-March quarter of 2016 when the Dubai crude was $30/bbl.
• Achieving low-cost development of discovered but undeveloped oil fields (including the Hail Oil Field).
Growth strategy
• Continued full production of each oil field and selective investment to enhance competitiveness.
• Strategic and comprehensive alliance with CEPSA (a major Spain- based oil company owned by MIC or former IPIC), deliberating development of a new oil field jointly with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and CEPSA.
Long-term stable production structure
• Obtained concessions before the foundation of the UAE and continued safe operation and stable production for about 50 years.
• Long-term stable production of crude oil from the UAE (Abu Dhabi) and Qatar.
• Cultural (i.e., Japanese-language education) and environmental (i.e., zero flaring) contributions to both countries.
Maximizing profit in the oil business
Initiatives to increase profit
• Increase profitable products with an increased Delayed Coker unit capacity at Sakai Refinery, prompted by the IMO regulations*.
• Maintain high capacity utilization to establish refinery competitiveness exceeding the global standard.
• Use alliances with other companies to increase competitiveness (i.e., alliances in Chiba and Yokkaichi; growing the recipients of products).
• Create synergy with the petrochemical business. * The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a global limit to
reduce the content of sulfur in marine fuel oil.
Measures in the new Consolidated Medium-Term Management Plan
Growing renewable energy business into a new main business segment
Expansion of the wind power generation business
• Aim to reach 500,000kW output of onshore wind farms at an early stage.
• As the land available for power plant development is decreasing, use the Group’s operation and maintenance strengths to make an early entry into the offshore wind power business.
• Invest in this business to make it the foundation for the next growth stage.
Cosmo Energy Group’s strengths
Group incorporation in 2010 of Eco Power,
a pioneer in the wind power generation business in Japan (established in 1997)
Realization of a high level on-wind availability (at least 90%), as development, construction, operation and maintenance are carried out within the Group
Reducing risks of wind fluctuation in each region and securing stable profit by placing wind power plants across the nation
Aiming to expand the business in the long term by expanding sites on land and participating
in offshore site projects

increased by ¥53.9 billion, to ¥95.9 billion. The Petroleum Business achieved an increase in ordinary income from the previous year, thanks to safe operation and high operating ratios at our refineries, and maintained appropriate margins with an improvement in the domestic supply-demand balance. The Oil Exploration and Production (E&P) Business also posted a rise in profit, attributable to a rise in crude oil prices in FY2017. The Petrochemical Business also saw increased profit, thanks to the absence of regular maintenance at Maruzen Petrochemical, in addition to the firm market conditions. At the end of FY2017, the net worth ratio improved 3.3 points from the end of the previous year to 14.1%, while the net debt to equity ratio* was 2.3 times, down 1.3 points from the end of the previous year.
Realignment of the business portfolio in keeping with ongoing efforts to reduce CO2 emissions as the long-term direction of our business. Taking an expected decline in oil demand as opportunity
Awareness for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is increasing worldwide and many countries and companies
are working proactively to achieve the goals. Global warming and climate change are important keywords for the Cosmo Energy Group’s long-term business environment. Based on the Paris Agreement, the Japanese government is targeting reduction in CO2 emissions of 26% by FY2030 (compared to FY2013). Our Group has also set its own targets, at similar reduction levels. To achieve those or comparable reduction targets, the transition to a fossil-fuel-free society is expected to accelerate worldwide, accompanied by the widespread use of electric vehicles and the expansion of the sharing economy. Given these changes as well as an expected decline in population in Japan, while we are likely to continue to see domestic demand for gasoline in the future, the demand is likely to decline.
In this environment, we will seek to increase our competitiveness in the petroleum-related businesses and at the same time to grow our renewable energy business into a profit generator by making active investments. We are thereby anticipating significant changes in our profit structure over the next 20-30 years. Specifically, we envision the following changes:
First, the Petroleum Business is expected to contribute
All of us in the Cosmo Energy Group did our best, enabling us to recover to a profitable position
FY2017 (ended March 31, 2018) was the final year of the previous consolidated medium-term management plan (FY2013 to FY2017) and my first year as President and CEO. I am pleased that we were able to generate a far greater profit than planned at the beginning of the year. This was a result of all of our employees’ steady execution of a wide range of initiatives in the midst of a tough period characterized by a decline in crude oil prices, the continuing impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake of
2011 and the accident at the Chiba Refinery, and an ongoing oil industry consolidation in Japan. I would like to extend my thanks to shareholders, customers, business partners, and all other stakeholders for supporting us during such a harsh period.
FY2017 results
In FY2017, the final year of the previous consolidated medium-term management plan, ordinary income increased by ¥35.5 billion from the previous year, to ¥116.9 billion, and profit attributable to owners of parent increased by ¥19.6 billion, to ¥72.8 billion.

Message from the President and CEO
  Enhancing the earnings strength of the Petroleum-related businesses and growing the Renewable Energy Business into a new main business segment
In the meantime, by taking account of the structural improvement and the assumptions for the crude oil price and product market conditions, the management goals are ordinary income (excluding the impact of inventory valuation) of over ¥120 billion (compared to ¥95.9 billion in FY2017); net worth of over ¥400 billion (compared to ¥238.7 billion at the end of FY2017); and a net debt to equity ratio of 1.0-1.5 times (compared to 2.3 times at the end of FY2017).
Initiatives for profit improvement
I would now like to explain where we expect to generate profit improvement of approximately ¥80 billion (compared to FY2017). First is an improvement of about ¥42 billion (ordinary income base, excluding the impact of inventory valuation) in the Petroleum Business. Specific plans include an increase in the Delayed Coker capacity at Sakai Refinery, the use of a pipeline between our Chiba Refinery and the JXTG Energy’s Chiba Refinery, an increase in the added value of our products that satisfy new IMO regulations, the start of fuel products supply to Kygnus Sekiyu, and the contribution of our “vehicle life” business. Second is an improvement of about ¥35 billion in the Oil E&P Business, mainly from the contribution of the Hail Oil Field, which has been operating at peak production volume since January 2018. Third is the Petrochemical Business, which should see an improvement in profit of about ¥1 billion (¥8 billion in terms of cash flow, including depreciation) by making investments to increase the competitiveness of basic chemical products and pursuing synergies with refining operations.
Fourth is an improvement of ¥2 billion from our renewable energy business (ordinary income base) by developing onshore wind farms. Finally, while we have not quantified it, we plan to develop new businesses at an early stage so that additional profit improvement can be realized.
Active investment in boosting competitiveness and in growth areas
We plan to make net investments worth ¥360 billion during the new consolidated medium-term management plan, which would be a 22% reduction compared to the previous consolidated medium-term management plan, when large investments, such as development of the Hail Oil Field, were made.
While being selective, we will make active investments and allocate approximately 40% of our total investment to enhancing our business portfolio. Specific plans include enhancing the Delayed Coker capacity of Sakai Refinery, increasing the added value of petrochemical products, and developing offshore wind farms as a next-generation business.
less profit in line with the decline in domestic demand, despite our efforts to increase competitiveness. On the other hand, the Oil E&P Business is likely to maintain its general profit level as production at the Hail Oil Field will offset a decline in production volume elsewhere. While competition against overseas companies is likely to intensify, we also believe we can enhance earnings strength in the Petrochemical Business as global demand is expected to grow on the back of global population growth. We will achieve this by increasing competitiveness with greater synergies with the Petroleum Business, and by continuing to expand our specialty products.
We envision significant growth and profit in our wind power generation and other renewable energy business, which should become a business mainstay within several decades. Anticipating this future, I would like our Group to make a vigorous step forward in FY2018, my second year as President and CEO. We created a slogan “Oil & New” in the new medium-term management plan (FY2018 to FY2022). We are determined to strengthen our business portfolio and establish a solid financial position, enabling us to achieve sustainable growth.
New consolidated medium-term management plan (FY2018 - FY2022),
“Oil & New, Everything About Oil – And Beyond”
The slogan of the new consolidated medium-term management plan is “Oil & New”, “Oil” means petroleum itself. We believe that our petroleum-related businesses will continue to have growth potential up to around 2030 and that we can profit from aggressive business management on that basis.
Specifically, although demand for gasoline in Japan is projected to decline, we expect to expand sales share through a capital and business alliance with Kygnus Sekiyu and improve our earnings strength, driven by the high operating ratios of the refineries. We will also increase the capacity of our Delayed Coker unit at Sakai Refinery and build a refining system which doesn’t produce high sulfur fuel oil, ahead of the year 2020 when the marine fuel regulations of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)1 will come into force. This will allow us to convert the heavy oil fraction, which is subject to the regulations, into diesel fuel oil and other products, leading to an expansion in our lineup of profitable products.
“New” means all non-oil businesses. We will particularly invest in renewable energy and new businesses. No matter how things change in the world, energy remains indispensable. In particular, we anticipate that renewable energy will become much more significant than at present. We are therefore convinced that even if our business portfolio changes in the future, the Cosmo Energy Group will remain an energy company needed in society.
FY2022 management goals
We conservatively forecast the market condition under the assumptions for the crude oil price (70$/B) and product market conditions, which have ¥51 billion negative impact. On the other hand, we expect to generate profit improvement of approximately ¥80 billion (compared to FY2017), with contributions from structural factors such as an increase in cracking capacity in the Petroleum Business and a production increase of the Hail Oil Field in the Oil E&P Business.

Message from the President and CEO
 FY2018 forecasts
For FY2018 (ending March 31, 2019), which is the first year of the new consolidated medium-term management plan, we are forecasting ordinary income of ¥121.0 billion (expecting no impact of inventory valuation) and profit attributable to owners of parent of ¥57.0 billion. The Petroleum Business is projecting a decrease of ¥5.8 billion year on year in ordinary income, excluding the impact of inventory valuation, due to a negative impact from sales activities that are consistent with crude oil processing volume, which will offset the expected profit improvement from the utilization of the pipeline of Chiba Refinery and from high operating ratios at the refineries. The Oil E&P Business, on the other hand, is expecting an increase of ¥38.7 billion year on year in ordinary income, thanks to an increase in production, driven by the Hail Oil Field, which has maintained peak production volume from January 2018. The Petrochemical Business is expecting a decrease of ¥8.4 billion year on year in ordinary income, given a decrease in the margin for ethylene and the financial effect of regular maintenance.
Financial improvement and stable shareholder return
Our capital policy in the new consolidated medium-term management plan is to carry out growth investment and shareholder returns while considering the balance with our financial position. With the aim of improving our financial condition, which was impaired during the previous consolidated medium-term management plan mainly due to the impacts of the crude oil price decline and the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011, we intend to focus on increasing shareholders’ equity first.
At the same time, we are committed to returning profit to shareholders, who have been supporting us in times both good and challenging. Achieving stable dividend payments is the basic policy but we aim at enhancing returns to shareholders, with due consideration to balancing our progress toward achieving our management goals and growth investment. I sincerely appreciate the understanding of our shareholders.
Promoting the consolidated medium-term CSR management plan, which contributes to achieving the SDGs
Our name starts with Cosmo, “relating to the world or universe,” incorporating our wish to help enrich lives and hearts of humans inhabiting this planet. However, we are also aware that we inevitably place some degree of burden on the global environment as we mainly handle fossil fuels in our role of providing a stable supply of
primary energy and petroleum-derived chemicals that are essential to everyone’s daily lives. While necessarily functioning within this reality, we have integrated corporate management with CSR initiatives in planning and their implementation. Since 2006 our Group has been a signatory of the Global Compact, a United Nations initiative that encourages businesses to respect ten principles for solving global issues and realizing a sustainable society. We respect basic principles on human rights, labor, the environment, and the prevention of corruption, and endeavor to incorporate in our activities an international viewpoint with the aim of enhancing our CSR activities.
I want our Group to be “a good company” and “a sustainable company.” By that I mean a company that generates sufficient returns, which is important from the viewpoint of sustainability, and a company that can contribute to achieving SDGs from the viewpoint of Creating Shared Value (CSV). To contribute to accomplishing SDGs through CSV can be taken to mean I intend to be a company that excels from the perspective of the Environment, Society, and Governance (ESG). Moreover, I want our Group to be “a good company” for our employees. In this regard, we will continue to promote workstyle innovation and diversity. Specifically, we believe that we need to reform our way of working in order to bring about better outcomes from fewer hours of work. We are therefore encouraging the greater use of IT, the use of AI in business operations, the adoption of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to achieve more efficient, automated business processes using cognitive technologies, operational reform, and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO).
We developed the new consolidated medium-term CSR management plan, in line with the new consolidated medium-term management plan, just as we did during the previous plan. In an effort to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions, we are targeting a 26% reduction in emissions
by FY2030, compared to the level in FY2013, in line with the target of the Japanese government. In addition, we set targets based on the perspective of ESG, which include ensuring safety measures at the refineries and strengthening our corporate governance structure. The consolidated medium-term CSR management plan will be promoted not only by our Group but by our entire supply chain network, including our business partners.
Enhancing corporate governance
We have established our corporate governance structure with the aim of promoting sustainable growth and raising medium- to long-term corporate value, and have enhanced the auditing and supervising functions of the Board of Directors by appointing Japanese and non-Japanese Outside Directors. Looking ahead, we will further enhance the structure in order to respond to the changing business environment and enable swift decision making, for example by further promoting diversity in outside directors. Maruzen Petrochemical, a consolidated subsidiary of our Group, announced that it was involved in inappropriate conduct regarding quality inspections. We took this event seriously. The entire Cosmo Energy Group is determined to thoroughly comply with laws and regulations and to improve our Group governance, obtaining advice from outside experts.
Message to stakeholders
The Cosmo Energy Group’s mission is to fulfill the needs of our customers by safely and reliably providing high- quality products and services, as expressed in our declaration to our shareholders, customers, business partners, and all other stakeholders with a slogan, “Filling Up Your Hearts, Too.” We will continue to fulfill our mission and create sustainable corporate value. We sincerely hope that our stakeholders will continue to extend their support to us for many years to come.
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs*)
                   * The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs*) were adopted by 193 member countries at the United Nations Summit in September 2015. There are 169 targets for 17 goals, to be achieved in 15 years, from 2016 to 2030.

 Toward improving financial condition
During the previous consolidated medium-term management plan, our industry’s environment was significantly changed due to consolidation, fluctuation in crude oil prices, and other factors. In such an environment, we continued the growth and steadily made the investment needed for enhancing our competitiveness, including the development of the Hail Oil Field, while making those investments with due consideration to maintaining well-balancing financial conditions, on the basis of the previous consolidated medium-term management plan. While our financial condition deteriorated temporarily in FY2014 and FY2015 due to the
1
impact of inventory valuation that stemmed from a decline
in crude oil prices, we have achieved significant improvement by FY2017, the final year of the the previous consolidated medium-term management plan, compared to the end of FY2012. We recorded net interest-bearing debt2 of ¥635.8 billion and a net debt to equity ratio3 (after partially accounting for hybrid loans4) of 2.3 times.
The new consolidated medium-term management plan that started in FY2018 has the goal of increasing our earning power and improving our financial condition so as to achieve a level of net worth (over ¥400 billion) that can tide us over changes in the market environment, including changes in crude oil prices. We also intend to strengthen cash management and make highly selective investments, with an eye on the long-term business environment, for early achievement of management goals in the new consolidated medium-term management plan. We are currently improving our financial position faster than
Key points in improving financial strength
1 Increase shareholders’ equity based on profits
Cash balance and use of funds
During the years from FY2018 to FY2022, we will carry out growth investment and ensure payment of shareholder returns while giving high priority to its balance with the financial position of the company.
We plan to generate incoming cash of ¥535.0 billion by combining profit attributable to owners of parent and depreciation, etc. and expect free cash flow (cumulative of five years) of ¥175.0 billion during the new consolidated medium-term management plan.
Regarding our investment plan, we plan to proactively allocate approximately 40% of the total investment to increase competitiveness and for growth. Specifically, we will invest to increase the capacity of our Delayed Coker unit at Sakai Refinery, increase added value of petrochemical products, and discover business opportunities and guide efforts pointed toward the next growth stage, including development of offshore wind power sites.
The new consolidated medium-term management plan incorporates investment of around ¥450.0 billion in total but use of sale and leaseback* and other means is expected to reduce the net investment amount to ¥360.0 billion (cumulative of five years), down 22% from the previous consolidated medium-term management plan.
* Method of financial transaction in which one sells a facility, such as a wind farm, and leases it back.
Shareholder return policy
We recognize shareholder returns as one of the important management priorities. Given our history of no dividend payment in some years, we have adopted the principle of making stable dividend payments and aim for further returns to shareholders while considering the balance between our progress toward management goals and growth investment.

     Impact of inventory valuation
The “impact of inventory valuation” indicates the impact on the cost of sales in the financial statements, according to the inventory valuation method, when there is a change in the price of crude oil. It can be separated into the following two categories:
1 Inventory valuation impact based on the periodic average method This indicates the impact in terms of income based on the “periodic average method,”
which is an inventory valuation method. In a phase when crude oil prices rise, the cost of sales is pushed down because the unit prices of purchased inventory that have risen during the term are averaged with the lower inventory unit prices at the start of the term. Conversely, in a phase when crude oil prices fall, the cost of sales is pushed up because the unit prices of purchased inventory that have fallen during the term are averaged with the higher inventory unit prices at the start of the term.
2 Inventory valuation impact based on reduction in book value If the market value of inventory at the end of the term falls below the book value, it is
necessary to reduce the book value to the market value, and this indicates that a resulting loss is incurred.
When crude oil prices rise
Average of the unit prices of purchased inventory during the term with the “lower” inventory unit prices at the start of the term.
Cost of sales is pushed down (positive inventory valuation)
When crude oil prices fall
Average of the unit prices of purchased inventory during the term with the “higher” inventory unit prices at the start of the term.
Cost of sales is pushed up (negative inventory valuation)

In addition to building a close collaborative relationship with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, the Cosmo Energy Group has strived to establish amicable relationships with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and other oil producing countries. Such efforts have resulted in acquisition of a concession in new oil field, the Hail Oil Field, as well as in extension of concessions in the three existing oil fields for 30 years in
Development History of Hail Oil Field
December 2012. This field began development in 2013, drilling in 2016, and started production in November 2017. United Petroleum Development has been engaged in stable production at existing oil field and, after deliberate discussions with both the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the State of Qatar, executed a new concession agreement in March 2018.

 Cosmo Energy Exploration & Production
  The Hail Oil Field began production in November 2017 and has been operating at full capacity since January 2018. This is the first time since 2011 that an oil field in which a Japanese company has operatorship started production in the Middle East.
As the Hail Oil Field investment has been curbed with the shared use of the existing crude oil processing, storage, and shipping facilities and reduced investment (Estimated
savings $300-400 million), the unit operating cost is expected to decline along with increase in production volume. In addition, we will consider development of new oil fields, making use of our technologies accumulated from about 50 years of experience in oil development as well as safe, stable operations and our relationships of trust built through a wide range of cooperation to Middle East oil producing countries.

 Environmental preservation activities
As the Hail Oil Field is located in an area registered by UNESCO as a sunctuary, it was developed by carefully conducting survey and examinations, and recovered materials and wastewater generated during oil well drilling were embedded in a dedicated underground well. In addition, the Hail Oil Field realized a complete “zero waste operation” by conducting zero flaring operation, which eliminates oil flaring during production.
Japanese-language training
In conjunction with the Ritsumeikan Trust in Japan, we provide Japanese-language programs to Applied Technology High School (ATHS), a local high school in Abu Dhabi. Twelve students who completed the program are currently studying in Japan with the support of a scholarship from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Increase Delayed Coker unit capacity at Sakai Refinery
From 2020, supply of cleaner marine fuel oil, oil with low sulfur content, will be required due to the IMO* regulations. Cosmo Energy Group will increase the capacity of the Delayed Coker unit at Sakai Refinery so as to not produce
high-sulfur fuel oil, which is subject to the IMO regulation, as early as possible. By doing so, we aim at increasing production of profitable products, such as diesel fuel oil converted from the heavy oil fraction.
Support social infrastructure Provision of life line in disasters
Stable energy supply
Stable supply of materials for daily necessities
* As an air pollution preventive measure, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a global limit to reduce the content of sulfur in marine fuel oil from 3.5% at present to 0.5% by 2020, in order to reduce ships’ emissions of sulfur oxide (SOx).
The Cosmo Energy Group is making appropriate capital expenditures so as to reduce unplanned stoppage at refineries. The number of defective issues at refineries has been less than halved in FY2017 relative to FY2011, while the operating ratio at refineries have been rising.
Increase the competitiveness of Chiba Refinery
Continue the operation of two Crude Distillation Units (CDUs) at Chiba Refinery after the completion of the pipeline to maximize the use of the pipeline.

The Cosmo Energy Group has been making consistent efforts for energy conservation at refineries, which resulted in reduction in crude oil consumption by 50,000 kl in three years, from FY2014 to FY2016. For example, the manufacturing process of xylene, a basic chemical product, was revised at the Yokkaichi Refinery. By adopting IT in managing the manufacturing process, a system to automatically control flow, temperature, and pressure of crude oil was developed, leading to reduction in consumption of fuel, to the extent of a crude oil equivalent of 500 kl per year.

Service Stations’ CSR Analysis
 Determine new business models that take the long-term business environment into consideration while seeking growth of the “Vehicle Life” Business
Cosmo Oil’s service stations (SS) conduct CSR analysis as a part of CSR activities that emphasize thorough compliance and environmental consideration. The CSR analysis is comprised of the Environmental Management (EM) survey and the Personal Information Protection (PP) survey and aims at understanding and improving related issues. The former is to ascertain how environment-related SS facilities
are managed, including preemptive measures to prevent oil leaks, as well as pollution control, while the latter is to ensure proper management of personal information. The EM/PP survey results for FY2017 showed that the ratio of SSs which achieved the target of 100 points increased by about 1% in the EM survey and about 2% in the PP survey compared to the previous year.
  Contributing to a better society — CSV (Creating Shared Value) — Offering car leasing for individuals

Basic Governance Structure and Business Execution System
The Cosmo Energy Group transitioned to a holding company structure in October 2015 and became a company with a supervisory committee structure in order to increase the ratio of outside directors and strengthen the audit and supervisory functions of the Board of Directors. Moreover, with the aim of clearly separating management oversight and business execution, the Company has adopted an executive officer system. As a result, some authority has been transferred to executive officers in order to enable the Company to respond promptly to changes in the business environment and carry out swift decision-making.
Executives’ Remuneration Plan
In FY2018 the Company introduced a new remuneration plan linked to business performance, with the purpose of enhancing medium-term business performance, increasing corporate value, and sharing profits with shareholders. It applies to directors (excluding outside directors and directors who are Supervisory Committee members) and executive officers. This plan consists of annual incentive remuneration (bonuses) linked to consolidated performance indices for each fiscal year, and medium- to long-term incentive remuneration (stock remuneration) linked to the ratio of the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to the TOPIX (Tokyo Stock Price Index) growth rate as well as to
the consolidated net debt-to-equity ratio for FY2018- FY2020. A ratio of 4:3:3 has been established for basic remuneration: annual incentive remuneration (when consolidated ordinary income excluding the impact of inventory valuation reaches ¥100 billion): and medium- to long-term incentive remuneration (when stock price conditions are fully achieved).
The stock remuneration plan is an incentive plan that uses a trust system. It is a mechanism that creates management motivation based on awareness of increasing corporate value in the long term, as directors and executive officers share changes in shareholder value with shareholders.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors is composed of ten members in total, and comprises 6 internal directors (1 of whom is a member of the Supervisory Committee) and 4 outside directors (2 of whom are members of the Supervisory Committee). It decides important matters such as the basic management policy and also supervises the execution of business duties. To reinforce the supervisory function of the Board of Directors and realize fair and highly transparent management, the Company increased the number of outside directors by 2 members (2 of the 4 outside directors are independent outside directors) in tandem with the transition to a holding company structure. Outside directors have immediate access to necessary information.
Supervisory Committee
The Supervisory Committee is composed of three members in total, namely, one internal director and two independent outside directors, and uses the internal control system to audit and supervise the business execution of directors as well as the state of execution of other business duties in general that are related to the management of the Group. The Chairperson is an independent outside director.
Executive Officers’ Committee
The Company has adopted the executive officers’ system to clarify the roles and responsibilities of “Directors” in charge of decision-making and management oversight, and “Executive Officers” in charge of business execution. The Executive Officers’ Committee comprises major executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and directors that are members of the Supervisory Committee, and functions as an advisory body to the President. The committee makes decisions concerning
the execution of business in accordance with management policies determined by the Board of Directors.
Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee
The Company has established the Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee, which is an advisory body to the Board of Directors, to ensure transparency and objectivity in the selection of director candidates and the compensation determination process. This committee is composed of three members in total, namely, one internal director and two independent outside directors, and deliberates on the nomination and remuneration of executive officers. The Chairperson is an independent outside director.

Method of evaluation
Summary of evaluation results
Initiatives to enhance the effectiveness
Upon explanation of the purpose of evaluation, questionnaires were distributed to all directors. Then the results were analyzed and evaluated based on the answers from all of them in consideration of discussions at the Board of Directors.
Main points of inquiry:
Composition, roles, and operation of the Board of Directors Coping with the Corporate Governance Code
Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors analyzed and evaluated that the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole is ensured due to the following:
The Board of Directors, over the period of one year, held constructive discussions on the Company Group’s long-term direction and its consolidated medium-term management plan. The Board did not overly focus on discussion of business execution; it had unfettered exchange of opinions on the shaping of business strategies.
Based on the above evaluation results, the Board of Directors will do the following.
The Board of Directors will continually monitor how the medium-term management plan is implemented, so as to raise its effectiveness.
Annual incentive remuneration (bonuses)1,3
Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Board of Directors
As a part of continued initiatives from FY2016 to enhance effectiveness of corporate governance, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in order to improve its management and functions.
1. Remuneration linked to business performance is not applicable to directors who are outside directors or Supervisory Committee members.

  Q.How do you see the Cosmo Energy Group?Please also tell us what you think are the advantages or strengths and the issues of the Cosmo Energy Group.
A.The Cosmo Energy Group has an integrated business that involves not only sale of oil products, such as gasoline, to customers but also a comprehensive flow from oil exploration and development to transportation, refining, and sales. Making use of this strong advantage, measures in the new consolidated medium-term management plan should be promoted and the corporate value, that includes brand value, reputation, and other social value, should be maximized. This should be a challenge the Group is facing today.
Q.Will you share your thoughts on the role of an independent outside director in corporate management?
A. Independent outside directors are expected to play three roles; 1) to give advice needed for an increase in corporate value through the Board of Directors meetings and other occasions, from a viewpoint of protecting interests of general shareholders; 2) to supervise execution of duties of directors, by making use of its independent position from the management and controlling shareholders; and 3) to reflect opinions of stakeholders on management. Among these, I focus on encouraging the company to achieve sustainable growth and a long-term increase in corporate value.
Q. How do you evaluate the management as an outside director?
A. I highly value the fact that the Cosmo Energy Group made corporate-wide, solid efforts in implementing the previous consolidated medium-term management plan despite being in a difficult business environment, caused by significant damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. The Cosmo Energy Group achieved profit improvement, that exceeded the targets, and firmly positioned itself as the third strongest force in the industry.
Q. How do you look at Cosmo’s “long-term direction of business”?
A. The Cosmo Energy Group plans to enhance competitiveness in Petroleum-related Businesses so as to lead to improve earnings power. At the same time, we will respond to transition to a fossil-fuel-free society by focusing on the Petrochemical Business, which is related to materials, and by growing the Renewable Energy Business into a new main business segment. I highly regard such business direction as down-to-earth and easy-to-understand.
Q. What is your view on the slogan of the new consolidated medium-term management plan “Oil & New”? How about the consolidated medium-term CSR management plan?
A. According to the new consolidated medium-term management plan, the Cosmo Energy Group intends to strengthen its financial condition by increasing the profitability of the Oil E&P and Petroleum Businesses and then improve the business portfolio for subsequent growth from a long-term point of view. I highly appreciate the slogan “Oil & New” as appropriately indicating the process and intention along the Group’s direction.
On the other hand, the consolidated medium-term CSR management plan, states that initiatives based on the perspective of Environment, Society, and Governance (ESG) will be promoted not only by the Group but by its entire supply chain network, including business partners, so that the Group will contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through its sustainable growth. I am confident that the Cosmo Energy Group can contribute for a better future.
Q. What do you think are the advantage or strengths and the issues of the Cosmo Energy Group’s corporate governance? A. In my view, the Group is proactive in coping with Japan’s Corporate Governance Code and the top management is highly aware of enhancing corporate governance in order to raise corporate value, while there is a corporate culture that allows active discussions among employees. Looking ahead, in addition to financial information concerning corporate management, the Group is expected to make timely disclosure of non-financial information, such as ESG-related initiatives, to shareholders and other stakeholders in order to ensure transparency in corporate governance.
Q. How do you regard the “effectiveness of the Board of Directors”?
A. The Board of Directors meetings’ important agenda items include the update of the consolidated management plan (including core operational companies) for the current fiscal year, the plan for the next fiscal year, and the consolidated medium-term management plan. For example, during the discussion on the consolidated medium-term management plan, all directors actively participated in raising questions or opinions. I therefore believe that effectiveness of the Board of Directors is fully ensured.
Q. Will you give a message to shareholders and other stakeholders?
A. Each and every employee of the Cosmo Energy Group, young and old, is sharing the new consolidated medium-term management plan for a long-term increase in corporate value and playing his or her role for its achievement. I sincerely hope for your support to us.
Q.From your position as Outside Director, what is your impression of the Cosmo Energy Group and what do you see as its strengths and weaknesses?
A.Cosmo Energy Group has significant operating and management experience in the refining, petrochemicals, and renewables sectors through many cycles, which has helped it to survive and prosper in a challenging business environment. Cosmo’s position has clearly improved from FY2014 when we had the negative impact of inventory valuation, not least in the strengthening of its balance sheet. As a result, Cosmo now has momentum to leverage on its core skills to further its business value.
Q.Please tell us your thoughts on the role that an outside director plays in corporate management.
A.Outside directors add value by bringing an independent, fresh and diverse perspective to decision-making process. They provide feedback and challenge to management on business strategies and plans, so that those are robust and acceptable from the standpoint of shareholders.
Q.How do you evaluate the new consolidated medium-term management plan?
A.The investment associated with the new consolidated medium-term management plan is well balanced to capitalize on current business strengths in refining, petrochemicals and upstream, and set a foundation for future direction in renewables, focused on growing the wind power business. The target is to increase ordinary income(excluding the impact of inventory valuation) by ¥80 billion through various initiatives. I am very hopeful that initiatives taken in accordance with the new consolidated medium-term management plan will lead to improved financial condition and income generation, thus, will support value creation for shareholders.
Q.What do you see as the areas of strength and the issues in regard to the Cosmo Energy Group’s corporate governance?
A.Since the transformation to a holding company in October 2015, Cosmo has separated its supervisory function from operational execution. Consequently its Board of Directors is now focused intently on its supervisory function. I believe that introduction of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, driving the appointment of multiple outside directors, has boosted transparency and strengthened monitoring, and is definitely a move in right direction.
Q.How do you evaluate the “effectiveness of the Board of Directors”?
A.Much of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors depends on fulfilling its regulatory obligations along with a strong contribution to the development of company’s strategic direction, lifecycle and culture. Cosmo implements its strategy through a medium-term management plan, this process and its review has been managed effectively at Board level.
Q.What does Mubadala Investment Company, as the top shareholder of Cosmo Energy Holdings, want Cosmo Management to do?
A.Cosmo’s new consolidated medium-term management plan focuses on the improvement of profitability and developing a more diversified and stable business model to face future energy scenarios. Management should continue to make all efforts to improve structural profitability and meet targets as outlined in the business plan. New investments should be executed within budget and in a timely manner to deliver best value for all stakeholders.
Q.What do you think the Cosmo Energy Group needs to do to further raise its corporate value?
A.Cosmo has undertaken several initiatives such as a shift to holding company structure, the development of the Hail Oil field, and building of new alliances. Such initiatives have resulted in an increase in value during the last 2-3 years. The next phase of generating additional corporate value relies heavily upon the successful execution of the new consolidated medium-term management plan.
Q.Do you have any additional messages for shareholders and other stakeholders?
A.The demand for oil products in Japan has been in structural decline due to a number of factors, not least the aging population and improved fuel efficiency. Cosmo Energy Group has responded to these challenges by undertaking a range of strategic initiatives and we are very optimistic that management will deliver against its corporate targets.

Energy Conservation at Refineries
In FY2017, in order to attain optimal supply and demand balance in domestic petroleum products, the Chiba Refinery reduced the processing capacity of the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU). The resultant decrease in crude oil refining volume led to a slight increase in CO2 emissions per unit of crude oil equivalent throughput.
Refineries represent the largest portion in CO2 emission of the Cosmo Energy Group. We will therefore strive for energy conservation from both a hard aspect (introduction of high-efficiency equipment) and a soft aspect (energy- efficient operation of facilities).
Reduction of Environmental Pollutants
Use of Water and Water Discharge Measures
(Water Pollution Prevention)
The Cosmo Energy Group’s refineries and plants use a vast
amount of water (over 90% is seawater) mainly for cooling but
also for cleaning and boiler feed water. In FY2017, 489,237kt of
water was used, of which 60,762kt was industrial water. We
are striving to use water efficiently, including the reuse and
recycle of water.
Concerning water discharge, we discharge the seawater used for
cooling into the sea, and properly treat the water used for
cleaning and other operating processes at stricter levels than
required by the legal standard levels for minimizing environmental
impact when discharged. In FY2017, the total amount of Chemical FY2017

CSR Activities
Diversity
Empowering Diverse Human Resources
The Cosmo Energy Group is committed to achieve diversity in its workplaces. We aim to achieve high productivity and create new value by having a workplace that allows motivated employees with diverse backgrounds go about their work proactively and combine their contributions derived from their diverse value, abilities, and experiences. In order to achieve diversity, we are focusing on empowering female employees as the foremost priority. We are targeting women representing 6% of managers and 30% of newly-hired employees (professional staff) by FY2022.

   Reducing Long Working Hours
In order to improve productivity and to facilitate work-life balance, we have aimed to optimize working hours. Targeting 1,900 total annual work hours, initiatives in FY2015 include the encouragement of employees to work mornings rather than nights (revision of the overtime pay rate), to take a so-called “refresh day” (no-after-hours work day), to turn off the lights in the workplace at 8pm (to discourage non-essential after-hours work), and to factor in the actual number of hours worked by
subordinates and its improvement in personnel assessment of managers. These efforts have resulted in achieving the target in FY2017 with the actual work hours at 1,883 hours.
We are now working for achieving higher productivity and workstyle innovation, targeting achievement of less than the agreed total annual working hours (1,811 for day work and 1,826 for rotating shift work) and 100% utilization of paid days off.

The support for balancing elderly care with work is another area of emphasis. In November 2017, we held a seminar for support balancing elderly care and work as an opportunity to think about the issue. Moreover, an “Elderly Care Guidebook,” featuring a diversity of programs, has been prepared and disseminated internally.
From the perspective of respecting
diversity, we also strive to maintain
or increase employment of persons
with disabilities. The rate of persons with disabilities as of June 1, 2017 was 2.36%, exceeding the mandate rate. We are implementing measures to empower employees with disabilities, such as arranging seminars at the departments which will receive the employees and providing regular consultation to ensure the employee is settled well in the workplace.

The ratio of Service Stations (SS) with the “AA” rating, the highest in evaluation on Three Promises, increased by 4.1 percentage points in FY2017 compared to the previous year. We believe this is due to heightened awareness of the Three Promises by SS employees through their attendance in a group training, which is held at 15 sites across Japan once a year. We will aim at further raising the ratio of AA-rated SS in order to satisfy more customers.

Customers will be greeted with a welcome and a smile at clean Cosmo Oil service stations.
Cosmo Oil Eco Card Fund
The Cosmo Energy Group has been issuing the Eco Card as a membership card to our loyal customers who frequently use our service stations and have a high level of environmental consciousness since 2002. There are 63,000 card holders. This Eco Card has an add-on feature to contribute to environmental activities: both card members and the Cosmo Energy Group make donations to fund the Cosmo Oil Eco Card Fund, which supports projects to counter climate change issues across the world. In FY2017, the Fund supported 14 projects, and was involved in a project to plant 55,000 trees as well as another to preserve a forest. The roots of climate change problems are often poverty, education, economic growth, and other social issues in emerging countries. The projects the Fund supports tend to help resolve these issues as well. We will continue to help resolve social issues in the world jointly with our Eco Card members.

“Cosmo Earth Conscious Act” cleanup campaign
Since 2001, the Cosmo Energy Group, in a partnership with the Japan FM Network Association, has been promoting Cosmo Earth Conscious Act initiatives for the preservation and conservation of the global environment. These efforts include cleanup campaigns, where participants enjoy nearby nature while cleaning up throughout Japan.
At 670 locations over the past 17 years, 252,394 participants of these campaigns have collected a total of 7,321,332 liters of garbage.
Each summer, a cleanup campaign is also held at Mt. Fuji. Ken Noguchi, a Japanese alpinist, and 160 volunteers from all over Japan clean up Mt. Fuji while enjoying eco trekking.

Cosmo Waku Waku Camp
Based on “Harmony and Symbiosis between Companies and Society,” one of the principles of the corporate management philosophy, the Cosmo Energy Group is undertaking various social contribution activities.
The Cosmo Waku Waku Camp, a nature camp for elementary school-age children who have lost one parent or both parents in traffic accidents, is a representative project that was launched in 1993. At the 25th camp in FY2017, 46 children and 20 volunteering employees participated. The children experienced fishing using self-made fishing rods from tree branches they cut and observed the living beings in a rocky shore area as a nature-appreciation experience, for three days.

GEnsuring Safety Measures
The Cosmo Energy Group advocates “ensuring safety measures” as materiality of the new consolidated medium-term CSR management plan. From a different perspective from original corporate governance, we have intentionally incorporated “safe operations and stable supply” and “quality assurance” as priority issues as they are a part of an essential foundation for raising corporate value. We have set targets and KPIs for these issues in promoting the enhancement of a
Governance safety management structure.

Safety Measures
As we declared in the first chapter of the Cosmo Energy Group Code of Conduct, we are determined to be a safe and accident free corporate group, and, consistent with that, we continued to undertake safety measures in FY2017.
Our refineries adopted “Zero serious accidents” meaning prevention of such as fires, explosions, outside or massive leakages, or serious labor-related accidents, as a safety target and, moreover, achieved it in FY2017. We have adopted as management indicators the frequency rate* of lost-worktime accidents and injuries, the rate of unplanned stoppage, and the number of days of stoppage of incoming and outgoing shipment; in addition, we implemented safety management procedures, while we strived to establish good workplaces and work environments and to manage the Operational Management System (OMS) so as to foster a safety-oriented culture.
* Frequency rate represents the number of casualties by work-related accidents and injuries in one million work hours and indicates the frequency of occurrence of accidents and injuries.
Initiatives to Prevent Forgetting Incidents and to Reduce Unsafe or Inadequate Conditions.
Cosmo Oil has designated March 11, a date when the fire and explosion at the LPG tanks occurred at its Chiba Refinery due to the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, as the Cosmo Oil Safety Day. On the day, all group employees watch a DVD compiling the story of the accident, its cause and preventive measures. We continue to try not to forget the incident by implementing diverse initiatives, including holding safety seminars and installing a memorial monument.
Experience and insight gained through discovery or occurrence of fault at a refinery is shared with other refineries at regularly-held conferences in order to reduce similar faults. Adoption of the OMS infrastructure has also resulted in a steady reduction in incidents of unsafe conditions or faults. Consequently, this led to the improvement in operating rate in FY2017.

Quality Assurance: Enhancing the Quality Assurance Structure
“Safety Day” seminar
  With the objective of economical, stable supply of safe products that fulfill customers’ requirements for quality, Cosmo Oil and Cosmo Oil Marketing have a “CS and Quality Assurance Committee” to decide a quality assurance policy and promote related activities. The committees of both companies cooperate with the Safety and Risk Management Committee of Cosmo Energy Holdings, forming the Group’s quality assurance structure.
Cosmo Oil’s themes for quality management initiatives in FY2017 were “thorough implementation of measures for safe, stable supply (prevention of quality defaults)”; “compliance with quality standards in Japan and overseas”; and “prompt, appropriate
response to troubles, and thorough investigation into their cause and prevention of recurrence.” In FY2017 our refineries and oil depots continued to record no significant quality- related trouble and no shipment of non-conforming products. Cosmo Oil Marketing had three incidents of erroneous mixing of oils due to operational errors at the time of unloading. Thanks to customers’ cooperation and prompt action, none of these cases became a serious problem. Nevertheless, in order to eliminate such a possibility, we have implemented preventive measures such as to checking actual freight shipments with its documentation and to always have someone from the company present during unloading.

TOPICSOperations Management System
Cosmo Oil has adopted an Operations Management System (OMS) with the aim of achieving safety operation and stable supply that are superior to the world standard. The adoption of the OMS has enabled us to establish an operating- related management system base. On this basis, we intend to achieve safety operation and stable supply, improve operations, and avoid opportunity losses.

OMS Auditing to Improve Operations
The implementation status of OMS activities is internally audited on a regular basis to identify and improve issues which may have been unnoticed by those involved. In FY2017, the OMS auditing was conducted at the head office, Chiba Refinery, Yokkaichi Refinery, and Sakai Refinery and more than 200 items for improvement were identified.
The OMS activities comprise (1) preparation manuals for rules and procedures; (2) instruction and training; (3) achievement of complete adoption; and (4) continuous improvement. In order to understand the implementation status of the activities and to timely take measures as needed, we have adopted OMS indicators, in FY2017. The indicators include relevant leading indicators and lagging indicators for each requirement item in measuring the implementation status of each action item. The results are shared, and the achievements are appreciated by all relevant people, who also respond to arising issues as needed. Further, validity of the OMS indicators is regularly reviewed, so that they may be improved and be more appropriate for achieving the targets.

CSR Activities
Compliance: Corporate Ethics Promotion Structure
Cosmo Energy Holdings has established the Corporate Ethics and Human Rights Committee to promote and implement the CEG’s Code of Conduct, and to check its status. The Committee’s operation is supported by the CEG Corporate Ethics Office. Aiming for enhancing employees’ sense of ethics, the Corporate Ethics and Human Rights Committee plans, implements, and evaluates various programs, including training programs on corporate ethics for all group employees, and e-learning.
The CEG Corporate Ethics Consultation Helpline, by which employees’ misconduct such as violation of laws and corporate rules, as well as ethical issues, can be reported or
anonymously discussed as a consultation, has been established within the Corporate Ethics Office and at an outside law firm.
In addition, in FY2018 the Harassment Consultation Helpline was established outside the group to consult on interpersonal issues in workplace, including sexual or power harassment. A consultation helpline card was distributed to all group employees (about 9,000).
Details of the reported and consulted issues and the response by the respective office are forwarded to the Supervisory Committee and are reflected in future CSR activities. There were zero incidents involving serious compliance violations* in FY2017.
* The most serious violations stipulated in the internal rules or accidents.

CSR-based Procurement
     Risk Management
Being strongly committed to the stable supply of energy, the Cosmo Energy Group holds Safety and Risk Management Committee meetings twice a year to promote risk and safety management at the group-wide level. The Committee discusses risks and safety policy for the entire group and checks progress of the related actions. The core three operating companies and semi-core companies also have their own risk management committee and safety committee, in accordance with their respective business and function. These committees check the status of initiatives taken for their respective, inherent risks, develop safety measures, and manage progress of safety activities. The committees strive to check and improve risk management and safety control actions.
Cosmo Energy Holdings and its three core operating companies are promoting initiatives to eliminate business transactions with organizations known or suspected of criminal behavior, in addition to green procurement in which the “green degree” evaluation, as well as conventional quality, price, and delivery factors are comprehensively evaluated.
Information Disclosure: Inclusion in ESG Indices
Cosmo Energy Holdings has been included in the “FTSE4Good Developed Index” for 16 consecutive years since 2003 when the Company was adopted. It was the first Japanese oil company to have that distinction. In FY2017 the Company was selected as a constituent of the “FTSE Blossom Japan Index,” which the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) has adopted as an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment index for Japanese equities. The Company has also been selected as a constituent of the “SNAM Sustainability
During the new consolidated medium-term CSR management plan, we will develop a CSR procurement policy that incorporates ESG initiatives in consideration and broadly disclose it to stakeholders. We aim at sustainable development by working with suppliers who agree with our policy.

Margins & Domestic sales volume
Lower profit expected, reflecting sales activities for generating profits that are consistent with the decrease of the crude oil processing amount, although we expect to utilize the pipeline of Chiba Refinery and secure a high operating ratio at refineries and an appropriate margin.
Lower profit expected due to a reduction in sales volume resulting from regular maintenance at Maruzen Petrochemical.
Higher profit expected, thanks to an increase in production resulting from the Hail Oil Field.

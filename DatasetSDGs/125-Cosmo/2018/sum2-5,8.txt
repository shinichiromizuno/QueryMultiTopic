Diversity
Empowering Diverse Human Resources
The Cosmo Energy Group is committed to achieve diversity in its workplaces. We aim to achieve high productivity and create new value by having a workplace that allows motivated employees with diverse backgrounds go about their work proactively and combine their contributions derived from their diverse value, abilities, and experiences. In order to achieve diversity, we are focusing on empowering female employees as the foremost priority. We are targeting women representing 6% of managers and 30% of newly-hired employees (professional staff) by FY2022.

   Reducing Long Working Hours
In order to improve productivity and to facilitate work-life balance, we have aimed to optimize working hours. Targeting 1,900 total annual work hours, initiatives in FY2015 include the encouragement of employees to work mornings rather than nights (revision of the overtime pay rate), to take a so-called “refresh day” (no-after-hours work day), to turn off the lights in the workplace at 8pm (to discourage non-essential after-hours work), and to factor in the actual number of hours worked by
subordinates and its improvement in personnel assessment of managers. These efforts have resulted in achieving the target in FY2017 with the actual work hours at 1,883 hours.
We are now working for achieving higher productivity and workstyle innovation, targeting achievement of less than the agreed total annual working hours (1,811 for day work and 1,826 for rotating shift work) and 100% utilization of paid days off.

Human Resources Development
Maximizing Employees’ Ability
In order to maximize individual employees’ ability and realize a lean organization, we actively invest in human resources. Our employee training programs aim to encourage employees to be motivated for improvement, with challenging spirit in a lean organization and to keep growing every day.
As one indicator of investment in human resources and employee awareness for improvement, our targets are ¥ 50,000 expenses for training per employee and a 20% rate in the number of employees who sign up for a correspondence course of personal development.

work-at-home program, working reduced hours, and limited- workplace options. Further, a Childcare Handbook, featuring a diversity of programs, has been published. We aim at continuing to achieve the women’s current 100% return rate* to work.
The support for balancing elderly care with work is another area of emphasis. In November 2017, we held a seminar for support balancing elderly care and work as an opportunity to think about the issue. Moreover, an “Elderly Care Guidebook,” featuring a diversity of programs, has been prepared and disseminated internally.
From the perspective of respecting
diversity, we also strive to maintain
or increase employment of persons
with disabilities. The rate of persons with disabilities as of June 1, 2017 was 2.36%, exceeding the mandate rate. We are implementing measures to empower employees with disabilities, such as arranging seminars at the departments which will receive the employees and providing regular consultation to ensure the employee is settled well in the workplace.

Elderly Care Guidebook
In FY2017 we started a Networking Lunch program to help female employees raise career awareness. By providing opportunities to talk with executives (potential role models), the networking lunches are intended to help them overcome unease or problems concerning their career or work-life balance, obtain some hints for career formation, and expand their network within the company. Since FY2015, we have been hosting seminars for balancing childcare and work so that employees who are taking childcare leave would return to work without losing their career mindset. We

The ratio of Service Stations (SS) with the “AA” rating, the highest in evaluation on Three Promises, increased by 4.1 percentage points in FY2017 compared to the previous year. We believe this is due to heightened awareness of the Three Promises by SS employees through their attendance in a group training, which is held at 15 sites across Japan once a year. We will aim at further raising the ratio of AA-rated SS in order to satisfy more customers.

In FY2017 the support hotline received 10,997 calls, up 1,619 from the previous year.

Evaluation on Fulfillment of Three Promises
True to the “Filling Up Your Hearts, Too,” declaration, Cosmo Oil service stations are working to fulfill the following three brand promises to customers. We are confident that keeping these promises at all service stations will result in favorable attitudes toward the Cosmo Brand and its being preferred by more customers. To check the status of our initiatives and enhancing services, outside mystery examiners investigate services at stations three times a year.
Comfort
Customers will be greeted with a welcome and a smile at clean Cosmo Oil service stations.
Cosmo Oil Eco Card Fund
The Cosmo Energy Group has been issuing the Eco Card as a membership card to our loyal customers who frequently use our service stations and have a high level of environmental consciousness since 2002. There are 63,000 card holders. This Eco Card has an add-on feature to contribute to environmental activities: both card members and the Cosmo Energy Group make donations to fund the Cosmo Oil Eco Card Fund, which supports projects to counter climate change issues across the world. In FY2017, the Fund supported 14 projects, and was involved in a project to plant 55,000 trees as well as another to preserve a forest. The roots of climate change problems are often poverty, education, economic growth, and other social issues in emerging countries. The projects the Fund supports tend to help resolve these issues as well. We will continue to help resolve social issues in the world jointly with our Eco Card members.

“Cosmo Earth Conscious Act” cleanup campaign
Since 2001, the Cosmo Energy Group, in a partnership with the Japan FM Network Association, has been promoting Cosmo Earth Conscious Act initiatives for the preservation and conservation of the global environment. These efforts include cleanup campaigns, where participants enjoy nearby nature while cleaning up throughout Japan.
At 670 locations over the past 17 years, 252,394 participants of these campaigns have collected a total of 7,321,332 liters of garbage.
Each summer, a cleanup campaign is also held at Mt. Fuji. Ken Noguchi, a Japanese alpinist, and 160 volunteers from all over Japan clean up Mt. Fuji while enjoying eco trekking.

Cosmo Waku Waku Camp
Based on “Harmony and Symbiosis between Companies and Society,” one of the principles of the corporate management philosophy, the Cosmo Energy Group is undertaking various social contribution activities.
The Cosmo Waku Waku Camp, a nature camp for elementary school-age children who have lost one parent or both parents in traffic accidents, is a representative project that was launched in 1993. At the 25th camp in FY2017, 46 children and 20 volunteering employees participated. The children experienced fishing using self-made fishing rods from tree branches they cut and observed the living beings in a rocky shore area as a nature-appreciation experience, for three days.
